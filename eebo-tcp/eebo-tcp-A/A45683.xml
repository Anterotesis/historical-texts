            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Take thou away from me
the noise of thy Songs: for I will not hear the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody
of thy Viols.</p>
                  <p>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the unspeakable Folly of vain
man, when he lyes under the
pressures, or is within the sight of
approaching Evils, when he's made
sensible of the frowns of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and comes to feel the effects of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon him, for sin, to conceit that any thing
which looks like Duty (though never so sleight
and formal) will serve the turn, to smooth Gods
brow, to turn away his wrath, and to take the
sinner into favour again.</p>
            <p>As if the holy God (who is present every
where, and knoweth all things) was either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
or unmindfull of inward dispositions and
affections, and had respect only to outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and deportments in Religious undertakings;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42074:4"/>
               <hi>Men indeed look on the outward appearance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 7.</note> 
               <hi>but the
Lord looketh on the heart:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 35. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Surely</hi> (saith <hi>Elihu) God
will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To take the estimate of Divine mysteries, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the shallow scantling of common sence and
opinion, argues gross ignorance and blindness of
mind, and is a sad indication of a carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
estate.</p>
            <p>Thus many in a day of fears (as did the sinning
<hi>Israelites</hi>) go on blindfold in Duty, resting in
their outside performances, which are no better
than <hi>the Sacrifices of fools, the blind and the lame,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 1.</note>
               <hi>and that which cost them nought.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 8.</note> Yet in these vain
Oblations, they will securely confide, and now
conclude themselves sufficiently guarded, against
the loudest thunders of most terrible Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>But how highly the great God is displeased,
with such empty, insignificant Services, we may
clearly perceive from the Scripture now before us;
where he abominates and rejects them, and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prohibites the Formalists farther procedure and
continuance in them: <hi>Take thou away from me the
noise of thy Songs; for I will not hear the melody of
thy Viols,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which words contain a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept:</hi>
The <hi>Prohibition</hi> in the <hi>23d. v.</hi> is tempered
with <hi>Indignation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Divis.</note> the <hi>Precept</hi> in the <hi>24th.</hi> calls for
<hi>Reformation:</hi> Or, in the Text (considered with its
coherence) we have reported and reproved the
great Corruptions and Disorders in <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42074:4"/>
The <hi>Church</hi> was guilty of <hi>Will-worship</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi>
the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppression;</hi> both
these must be <hi>removed,</hi> before God will be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reformation is first to begin at the <hi>Church,</hi>
but it is not to end there; the stream thereof
must run thorow the <hi>State</hi> in like manner, that
so it may refresh,<note place="margin">Psal. 46. 4.</note> and <hi>make glad the whole City
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The waters of the Sanctuary,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.</note> which were <hi>first
to the ankles, afterward increased to be up to the
knees, and then to the loins, and at the last they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a great River, waters to swim in, a River that
could not be passed over, which issued toward the East
Country, and ran down into the Desart.</hi> Such
should be the stream of <hi>Justice,</hi> it should run
thorow the whole Country, that none may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the want of it; but that every one may
have a free and easie access unto it; <hi>that so righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and judgment may be executed for all that are
oppressed,</hi> Ps. 103. v. 6.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Division, I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Exposition of the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, briefly of the <hi>Prohibition, Take thou
away from me the noise of thy Songs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These words admit of divers <hi>readings,</hi> which do
nothing vary from the sence of our <hi>English Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
wherefore I need not run out time, to repeat
them to you.</p>
            <p>There's a <hi>Meiosis</hi> in this verse, <hi>Minus dicitur,
plus intelligitur;</hi> for we are not only to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Lords dislike of their Ceremonies, and

Superstitious Services, (though that be sad
enough, seeing it is his approbation and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that makes our performances of any worth
or significancy) but also his exceeding hatred and
abhorrence of them, as things which he could no
longer endure, nor would he any more be burdened
with them, and therefore he bids them take away
these <hi>provocations</hi> from him, viz. <hi>the noise of their
Songs, and the melody of their Viols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which expressions do figuratively include all
the <hi>Israelites</hi> Festivals, Incense, Sacrifices, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

            <p>To offer many Sacrifices with the Papists, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>
               <hi>I'll conclude this former part of my Text, in
the words of a Reverend and Learned Bishop:</hi>
Christians must not suffer,<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Reynolds</hi> Serm. Beauty and Bands.</note> either the meer form of
Godliness to swallow up the power, or the pretence of
power to shut out the form; but we must give the
Lord, both that inward and outward honour, which
is due unto his Holy name, in all our solemn atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances
upon him.</p>
            <p>Now to pass from the <hi>Inhibition</hi> of sin committed,
to the <hi>Injunction</hi> of duty omitted: And the good
Lord help us all, to leave off the <hi>pursuit</hi> of sin,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42074:8"/>
and to fall upon the practice of duty, of the <hi>great
duty</hi> in my <hi>Text,</hi> that <hi>Magistrates</hi> especially (who
are chiefly concerned in it) may endeavour ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
<hi>to let judgment roul down as waters, and
righteousness as a mighty stream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Precept, there are two things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
as</p>
            <p>First, An <hi>Antithesis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Antithesis.</note> the adversative particle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>but,</hi> intimates an opposition to their Musical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments

because they were defiled with hypocrisie and
impiety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ten Tribes</hi> put much <hi>stress,</hi> upon Intervals,
Circumstantials, and Ceremonials: Now in this
<hi>verse,</hi> they are minded of the great and weighty
matters of the Law, viz, <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which they are also commanded to execute
and perform.</p>
            <p>2dly. Here's <hi>Locus a comparatis;</hi>

and running waters, <hi>righteousness,</hi> and

and righteousness imply <hi>righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or an administration of <hi>judgment righteously,</hi>
in a plentifull, firm, and invariable manner,
for it is <hi>to roul down as waters, and as a mighty

            </p>
            <p>Which Scripture, some Interpreters of good
note (as <hi>Lyra, A Lapide,</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi>) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of a torrent of Judgments, threatned in
righteousness, against <hi>Israel,</hi> for their crying sins,
whereby they should be carried away into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42074:9"/>
as things are violently carried down, by a
strong and rapid stream.</p>
            <p>I shall leave these learned Authors to abound in
their own sence, and take <hi>the words</hi> as they are
commonly received, by Expositors of great esteem
also, and more in number, then the former; these
are <hi>Vatablus, Castalio, Livelius, Gualter, Drusius,
Grotius, Piscator,</hi> and <hi>Calvin:</hi> All which Authors,
besides several others, as the <hi>Dutch Annotations,
Diodat, Mayer,</hi> and <hi>Hutcheson,</hi> (it would be too
tedious to cite them, in their own words) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Command, according to the sence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hinted at, <hi>viz.</hi> of a diligent, impartial exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of judgment, and an abounding in the fruits
thereof; that there be no unjust dealings among
men, but that all unrighteousness be born down,
and quite taken away, as <hi>hay,</hi> or <hi>stubble,</hi> by <hi>swift
running waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>words</hi> thus opened, resolve themselves into
this <hi>practical Observation:</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>A vigorous and constant administration of true
and righteous judgment,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> is a duty of grand concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to a people professing Religion.</p>
            <p>Judgment (as a learned Author hath well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
in a Book lately set forth) is <hi>private</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Cure of Church-Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note>
or <hi>publique;</hi> the <hi>Judicium privatum discretionis,</hi>
which is the guide of rational acts, belongeth to
every private man; the <hi>Judicium publicum</hi> is either
<hi>in foro Civili,</hi> determining in order to corporal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
and this belongeth only to the Magistrate;
or it is <hi>in foro Ecclesiae,</hi> in order to Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or Excommunication: Thus far he.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42074:9"/>
Now, it is the <hi>Judicium publicum in foro Civili,</hi>
that I am to discourse of, at this time; and this
(as you have heard) is principally incumbent on
Magistrates, who are not to <hi>bear the sword in vain,</hi>
out of formality, or for fashion sake, but <hi>for the
terrour of evil doers, and for the praise of them that
do well;</hi> for the keeping of the Laws of God and
the Land, and for the protection of the innocent;
<hi>that they may sit every man under his own Vine, and
Figg-tree, and none may make them afraid, according
to that promise,</hi> Micah 4. 4.</p>
            <p>The stream of Justice (I say) must flow from
the <hi>lawfull Magistrates,</hi> and be derived from them
to the people, as the <hi>precious oyntment, that was
poured on Aarons head, trickled down to the skirts
of his garments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Holy Writ abounds in proof of the <hi>Observation,</hi>
so that 'tis not only the Doctrine of my Text, but
of many other Scriptures also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall be your Remembrancer of some few of
them, as os that parallel place,</hi> Isa. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18.
Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your
doings, from before mine eyes, cease to do evil: Learn
to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same injunction you have in</hi> Psal. 82. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherless,
do justice to the afflicted and needy: rid them out of
the hand of the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be pleased also to consider that Scripture,</hi>
Zech. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. These are the things that ye
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42074:10"/>
shall do, speak ye every man the truth to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
execute the judgment of truth and peace in your
gates: And let none of you imagine evil in your
heart against his neighbour, and love no false Oath,
for all these are the things that I hate, saith the
Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the</hi> 6th. <hi>of</hi> Micah <hi>v.</hi> 8. He hath shewed
thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>
            <p>All these places are so many clear <hi>proofs</hi> of this
great <hi>truth,</hi> viz. that the Lord requireth, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of men professing piety, that they should
make conscience of <hi>justice and equity,</hi> in their
mutual dealings one with another; that so they
may prove the sincerity of their Profession, and
may adorn it by an answerable conversation, that
their whole life may be (as one phraseth it)
<hi>Index &amp; Commentarius Evangelii, an Index and
Commentary of the Bible.</hi>

but) <hi>willingly and with a ready mind.</hi>

be a <hi>straight and regular</hi> proceeding, a proceeding
<hi>by rule,</hi> according to <hi>the Law of God, and the estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
Laws of the Land.</hi>

for this would be like the Authority of the

            <p>Of this brave Heroick Spirit, was <hi>John</hi> Duke of

The great God commands the execution of Judgment;
he commends it also: It is a remedy to remove curses,
a means to procure blessings for us and our Children
after us; the neglect of it is a mighty provocation to
the Lord; and without it, there can be no peaceable
living in the world. <hi>And now consider, whether</hi>
a vigorous and constant execution of righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be not a duty of grand concernment, to a people
professing Religion.</p>
            <p>I am now to <hi>Apply,</hi> and the Uses of our Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
are only two,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> which I shall briefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
            <p>First, This should stir up the people of <hi>England</hi>
unto <hi>unfeigned thankfulness</hi> to Almighty God,<note place="margin">Vse 1. Of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</note> for
the good and wholesome <hi>Laws</hi> we enjoy, and for
those Magistrates, that are diligent and faithfull in
the execution of them.</p>
            <p>It is a mercy to have Judges, <hi>modo audeant, quae
sentiunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. pro Milone</note> (as the Orator hath it:) So that they
have courage and integrity to do, what they think
fit and equal to be done, who will not be swayed
by the <hi>gifts,</hi> nor scared by the <hi>greatness</hi> of men, to
pass an unrighteous sentence: Let us praise God
for such.</p>
            <p>The next Use is of Exhortation,<note place="margin">Vse 2. Of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and here I shall
endeavour in a few words, to divide to every one
his portion, and to press home the <hi>Duty</hi> of my <hi>Text,</hi>
to persons especially concerned in it.</p>
            <p>And in the first place,<note place="margin">To the Judge.</note> I beseech you, <hi>My Lord,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the venerable Judge of this <hi>Circuit,</hi> to suffer the

word of Exhortation; I would not forget to
whom I speak, yet I must remember from whom
I speak.</p>
            <p>I have a message from the Great God, the Judge
of all the World, unto <hi>You</hi> this day, and it is to
mind you of your <hi>Duty,</hi> that you <hi>do Justice,</hi> and
<hi>execute right,</hi> without respect of persons, that you
quit not the Guilty, nor condemn the Innocent;
<hi>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as a mighty stream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this River, there must be no ebbing nor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the banks at all times are to be full, and the
current mighty, neither must the stream be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
or turned another way; for then iniquity will
take place, and whosoever drinks of this puddle,
it will be like the <hi>water of jealousie</hi> to him,<note place="margin">Numb. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>bitter
water, that causeth the curse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beseech you, <hi>My Lord,</hi> follow your pattern,
<hi>Job</hi> 29. 14. <hi>I put on righteousness, and it cloathed
me, my judgment was as a robe and a diadem:</hi> They
who wear <hi>justice</hi> for a <hi>cloak,</hi> need no <hi>cloak</hi> for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:</hi>
Justice is both a Cloak, and an Helmet, it
will adorn you, it will secure you.</p>
            <p>God forbid, that any should find you like the
brooks of <hi>Teman,</hi> that when they come for
the waters of judgment, they should find the
brooks dry.</p>
            <p>There is abundance of filth in this Nation,
for iniquity abounds every where; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there can be no better expedient used, for
the cleansing out these increased <hi>dunghils</hi> of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
then by letting forth the <hi>river of justice</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42074:16"/>
to run down upon them, as <hi>Hercules</hi> cleansed

punish in others; if the Justice be a person of a

should use any just severity, against those who are
<hi>fly-blown</hi> with the like transgressions. Allow not
of sin in your selves, nor in your Servants, nor in
any others; but frown upon it, wherever you
meet with it: a frown of yours may do more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are

Righteousness is not to be taken <hi>here,</hi> only in
the <hi>abstract,</hi> but with relation to the <hi>subject</hi> in
which it is inherent; the <hi>concrete</hi> is included in
the <hi>abstract,</hi> as it is often to be found in holy Writ,
where the names of Virtues and Vices, are put for
the persons to which they are adjoyned,<note place="margin">

So here, <hi>Righteousness</hi> being inclusive of <hi>Righteous

in all the <hi>Commandments and Ordinances of God

               </note> that a Nation comes to be exalted and

saying of an ancient Author, <hi>whatever good thing
is bestowed upon the sons of men, it is given on the
account of the righteous, for the sake of those that
faithfully preach and diligently hear the Gospel, and
call upon God; the unrighteous do not believe this,
neither do they acknowledge it, therefore they evilly
requite the people of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any shall be offended with this doctrine, we
need not much wonder at it, for they who have no
love for Gods people, will not acknowledge that
they are beholden to them. <hi>The poor wise man</hi> that

This is <hi>merces mundi,</hi> the worlds wages, (as

(I mean sincere Christians) <hi>upon whose account

many great and endearing mercies upon an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
yea, upon an ill-deserving people.</p>
            <p>The truth of this <hi>Proposition</hi> will be sufficiently

            <p>1. By the Examination of those allusive meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical

this singular great mercy, but look upon it as an
enjoyment that may well enough be spared;
Preaching is counted but foolishness, and all the
means of grace are thought to be unnecessary and
undesirable, yet if it were but well considered,
that it is not onely a great mercy in it fels (which
impenitent sinners will not be perswaded to believe)
but also, that this is a blessing which seldome
comes alone, for where God sets up the light of his
Gospel, he usnally sends <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the means of grace have been most pure and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
other outward blessings have been there most
plentiful, and abounding; If this consideration
(I say) was but once well digested in the hearts of
the sons of men, many that heretofore have had

St. <hi>John</hi> hath put upon him, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>He that

not in a legal sence, (there is no such

in an Evangelical sence, and thus he that sincerely

person to whom righteousness may be rightly
ascribed. But as for those, that are intoxicated
with errors, will be drunk with wine and strong
drink, who prophane the Sabbath, swear, curse,
and blaspheme the holy and tremendous name of

take away the right from the poor, that go beyond,

or defraud their brethren in any matter, or that

they have no lot nor portion in the <hi>former part

(q. d.) <hi>the Religion and Piety of Nations</hi>
(that know not God) <hi>is sin;</hi> which is chiefly to
be understood of their Idol-worship, and indeed,
all their most moral performances are but <hi>splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida
peccata, shining abominations,</hi> in the sight of
the living and true God.</p>
            <p>This is the first and genuine signification of the
Hebrew word [<hi>Chesed</hi>] it signifies properly, <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
misericordia, benignitas,</hi> but then, <hi>per Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrafin</hi>
it is also translated, <hi>impietas, crudelitas,

to be understood of any ordinary, common, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42074:29"/>
low degree of holiness, but of extraordinary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
raised grace; so when it is taken for the
contrary, (as here it is in the judgment of the
most and best Expositors I have met with) it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
not a little crime, or some small offence, but
that which is most notorious and highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking,
as <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> hath observed, from
<hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 17.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Mercer</hi> reads the <hi>word</hi> in that place, <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio,</hi>
or <hi>res nefanda,</hi> an horrid wickedness, a
thing not to be mentioned, much less to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
Thus we are to understand it in the <hi>Text,
viz.</hi> that sin (especially that capital crying sin
of Injustice, which is here chiefly pointed at) is a
very great and heinous reproach, and an high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
to the pure eyes of the holy God; <hi>The
Lord trieth the righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 11. 5.</note> 
               <hi>but the wicked and him
that loveth violence, his soul hateth:</hi> And better it
is to have all the world to hate us, then God to

            <p>So now then, the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>

and makes it to tumble upon the heads of those
that are within it; <hi>The house of the wicked shall be
overthrown, but the tabernacle of the righteous shall
flourish,</hi> Prov. 14. 11.</p>
            <p>Again, for the sake of righteous ones, the Lord
bestows (as you have already heard) those great
blessings of <hi>Truth, Peace, Plenty, Victory over ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>

that hath made them become a curse,<note place="margin">Jer. 25. 9.</note> and an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

Judges of the Earth: <hi>to serve the Lord with fear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>in
the concernments of his Church,</hi> and your King and
Country with saithfulness in <hi>State affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I would commend Righteousness to
you,<note place="margin">2. To the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Peace.</note> our honourable and worshipful Justices, as a
very choice Friend and Companion, which will
be hughly advantagious unto you, and in you, to
us, and will get you more honor in the Country,
then moroseness, passion, or partiality can do; Be
pleased therefore to think Righteousness worthy of
your acquaintance, as that wich will exalt you,
and the Nation also, but <hi>Sin</hi> will be a <hi>reproach</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
both.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. To Lawyers.</note> If Lawyers would be perswaded, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Rule of Righteousness, and to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as they themselves would be done by, they
should find more comfort in being <hi>just and honest,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42074:33"/>
then in being <hi>politick and subtile;</hi> and the <hi>Fees</hi> they
receive in the defence of <hi>Truth,</hi> will do them more
good, then then times as much, in making a bad
Cause seem good, and a good Cause seem bad: It
was a wicked saying of a prosane spirited man, <hi>He
that will not venture his body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nevissan a <hi>Lawyer.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>shall never be a stout
man, and be that will not venture his soul, shall never
be rich.</hi> Surely the wretched sinner would find this
a <hi>desparate venture,</hi> when he came to thrust his
head into the other world:<note place="margin">Peov. 11. 4.</note> 
               <hi>For Riches profit not in
the day of wrath, but Righteousness delivereth from
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. To the Grand Inquest.</note> As for you that are to be of the Grand
Inquest, or of any other Jury, or shall be brought in
as Witness in any Cause; Remember (I pray you)
that you are to Swear <hi>in Truth, in Judgment and
in Righteousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer 4. 2.</note> and so to proceed according to
your Oath. (1.) You Swear in <hi>Truth,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatsoever is affirmed or denyed by you, must
truly, and for a certainty be affirmed or denied:
You are to Swear (such is the form of the Oath)
<hi>the Truth, the whole Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Veritas haud dubiè hic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur prointe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritate cordis. <hi>Cal. in loc.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and nothing but the
Truth.</hi> (2.) You Swear <hi>in Judgment</hi> (i. e.) well
weighing, and advisedly considering, what it is
you are to Swear, and who it is by whom you
are to Swear, not taking an Oath hand over head,
vainly and rashly, but so as you may have comfort
in performing that great Duty aright, in making
known the Truth, and putting an end to some
great doubt and controversie. (3.) You are to
Swear <hi>in Righteousness,</hi> (q. d.) there must be a
just cause of your Swearing, and that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42074:34"/>
to the will of God: And be sure you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
nothing, which your Oath obligeth you to
make known, lest you bring upon you the flying
roll of curses threatned <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
            <p>I have read a notable passage of a meer moral
man, which is very well worth your imitation;
<hi>This person being desired by a Friend to testifie a
Lye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> which he was to avouch by an Oath, he
returned this serious answer; <hi>I am your Friend</hi>
(saith he) <hi>to the Altar,</hi> i. e. as far as Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Religion, and honesty will permit, but no
farther.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. To Ministers</note> In the last place, let us be exhorted
(Fathers and Brethren) who are Ministers of
the Gospel, and Preachers of Righteousness, to
<hi>practice</hi> righteousness, as well as <hi>preach</hi> it, to be
Ensamples to our Flocks, and not only to shew
them the way, but also to walk before them in it;
<hi>that when the chief Shepherd shall appear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>we may
receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have all of us our duty <hi>laid down</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us,<note place="margin">1. Mot. Righteousness is most congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Christianus in peccato vivens, &amp; concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis suis inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viens, horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum spectrum, imo monstrum censetur coram Dio. <hi>vid. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. in Col. p.</hi> 206.</note> let us now be perswaded to <hi>take it up,</hi> and
to put it into speedy practice: And for this end,
we may consider these following <hi>Motives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Righteousness is most congruous and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our Profession: What a Christian? and an
unrighteous man? A Christian? and a proud
man? A Christian? and a Drunkard? A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
and a common Swearer? A Christian?
and an Atheist? What a reproachfull thing is
this? If sin be a reproach to any people, much
more to a Christian people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42074:34"/>
It is better to be a just Heathen, then an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Christian; a sober Heathen, then a
drunken Christian; a chast Heathen, then an
unclean Christian. 'Twould be better posterity
should never know such persons lived in the world,
then to know us by such reproachful names. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis
stragulam pudefacis, Thou puttest honesty to
open shame,</hi> said <hi>Diogenes</hi> to <hi>Antipater, who being
exceeding vicious, wore a white cloak, the emblem of
innocency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a great reproach to the Jew,<note place="margin">Non credam jures Verpe per Anchialum. <hi>Martial.</hi>
               </note> when an
Heathen told him, that he would not believe him,
though he swore, <hi>As God shall help me:</hi> And
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells those of the Circumcision,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 24.</note> that <hi>the
name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles,</hi>
by that unagreeableness that was betwixt their
practice, and their Law. So now it may be said
of us, that the name of Christ is blasphemed
among the Turks and Heathens,<note place="margin">Quomodo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus est magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster cujus tam males videmus esse discipulos? <hi>Salv. l. 4. p.</hi> 149</note> by the vile and
scandalous lives of us, who call our selves Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and particularly in this sin of injustice; for
shame, let us at last endeavour, to wipe off this
reproach from our Profession,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Whole Duty of Man, p. 237.</note> by leaving these
practises, that do so much offend God, and all
good men.</p>
            <p>2. The welfare and happiness of the Nation,<note place="margin">2. Mot. The welfare of a Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</note>
very much depends upon our being righteous: So
long as the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had just Judges, and
righteous Kings to rule over them, <hi>all things went
well with them,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
11. 12. But when they forsook their God, and
cast his Laws behind their backs, they became a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42074:35"/>
scorn, and a derision, to all that were round about
them,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and suffered Justice to fall in the Streets, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting

            <p>So I might instance in <hi>Rome,</hi> and other famous
Empires and Kingdoms in the world, whilst they
followed but the shadow of justice (for theirs was

prospered, and became formidable; but as the
