            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>The <hi>Omen</hi>'s well, that, with a mind unite</l>
                     <l>To carry on this great deliv'ering work,</l>
                     <l>We here are met, as at a Signal given:</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Tribunius, Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Ligurius,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Norbanus,</hi> and good <hi>Decius,</hi> use no speech;</l>
                     <l>But seat your selves. Now, <hi>Roman</hi> Lords, and Friends,</l>
                     <l>Once great in Fortune, not in emty sound;</l>
                     <l>The all that we enjoy; tho we may feign,</l>
                     <l>Like melancholy men who Reign in thought,</l>
                     <l>Revel in joyes, the meer <hi>Idea</hi>'s form'd</l>
                     <l>From Fancy, wrought into a height by words,</l>
                     <l>But the effect is Air: Can you, my Friends,</l>
                     <l>Tho we may credit, in our fulness, things</l>
                     <l>Which stupid ease creates, be or secure or great?</l>
                     <l>We call our selves a Senate, and beget</l>
                     <l>Thoughts we are truly so. <hi>Sertorius</hi> says,</l>
                     <l>When barbarous <hi>Gaul</hi>'s sack'd <hi>Rome</hi> and lay'd it wast,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Camillus</hi> unto <hi>Vei</hi> made retreat,</l>
                     <l>Gave out, that <hi>Rome</hi> it self was thither mov'd;</l>

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50829:25"/>
And, for the confirmation, added this:</l>
                     <l>"Where e're the Senate was, there <hi>Rome</hi> was still;</l>
                     <l>Alluding to our abject States, to please</l>
                     <l>A few, once Senators, now Exil'd men.</l>
                     <l>Say then, if <hi>Cneius</hi> may be bold to speak</l>
                     <l>The plainest of his thoughts.</l>

                     <l>Add all the Ornaments that Soldiers boast:</l>
                     <l>Break all your Shields; there all your Ensigns lay;</l>
                     <l>And mourn that loss which sheaths your Swords again.</l>
                     <l>Let him have common Burial. May the Gods</l>
                     <l>Forget his Crimes; while <hi>Rome</hi> no Equal knows,</l>
                     <l>Nor none contend against her Soveraign pow'r:</l>
                     <l>But to her Vengeance, as the Ire of Heav'n,</l>
                     <l>Wast into former Chaos, and forget</l>
                     <l>That being which they had. Spread wide thy Gates,</l>
                     <l>Oh Guardian Angel of the Gods abode;</l>
                     <l>Let Fame, from Pole to Pole, her Eccho sound:</l>
                     <l>While the whole World, obedient to her Pow'r,</l>
                     <l>Submit to <hi>Rome,</hi> as to her Emperor.</l>

            <byline>By <hi>Mr.</hi> Ravenscroft.</byline>
            <l>OVR Poet to the learned Criticks does submit,</l>
            <l>But scorns those little Vermine in the Pit,</l>
            <l>Who noise and nonsense vent instead of Wit:</l>
            <l>Those Aierie empty Sparks that know no more</l>
            <l>Than how to dress and railly with a Whore;</l>
            <l>Nay all they say to 'em is perfect cant,</l>
            <l>And Vizord still runs down the weak Gallant:</l>
            <l>Vext at her Repartee, he stroaks his Wig,</l>
            <l>And cries, Dam me, you Whore you, I'll unrig:</l>
            <l>Then cursing her, he leaves her to the rest</l>
            <l>O'th' Fops—</l>
            <l>Or tears a Hood and Scarf to make a jeast.</l>
            <l>Whence have these silly Monsters their pretence,</l>
            <l>That they should Iudges be of Wit and Sence?</l>
            <l>These Gnats about a Poets Ears may swarm,</l>
            <l>But want a Sting to do him any harm.</l>
