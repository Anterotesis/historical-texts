            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

many Inches make a Foot? I look for 8 on the Board-measure, and just against my finger (being set to 8) on the Inch side, I find 18, and so many Inches long, at that bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, goes to make a Foot Superficial.</p>
                  <p>Again, suppose it had been 18 Inches broad, then I find 8 Inches in length, to make a Foot superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; but if 36 Inches broad, then 4 Inches in length makes a Foot.</p>
                  <p>Or you may do it more easie thus: Take your Rule and hold it in your left hand, and apply it to the breadth of your Board or Glass, making the end that is next 36 even with one edge of the board or <hi>glass,</hi> &amp; the other edge of the <hi>board</hi> shews how many Inches or Quarters of an Inch go to make a foot of the board or Glass. This is but the converse of the former, and needs no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for laying the Rule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o it, and looking on the Board-measure, you have your desire.</p>
                  <p>Or else, you may do thus in all narrow peices under 6 inches broad.
<pb facs="tcp:105159:7"/>
As suppose 3¼, double 3¼ it makes 6½, then I say, that twice the length from 6½ to the end of the Rule, shall make a Foot Superficial, or so much in length makes a foot.</p>

                  <p>Having found the breadth, and how much makes one Foot, turn that over as many times as you can, for so many Foot is there in that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies: But if it be a great breadth, then you may turn it over two or three times, and then take that together, and so say 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and till you come to the end of the Superficies. Note that the three short strokes between figure and figure, are the Quarters; as thus, 8 and a quarter, 8 and a half, 8 and three quarters, then 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till you come to 30, and then 30 and a half, 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 36. And if it be divided

                     <hi>The use of the Table at the beginning end of the Board-measure,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, you have five ranks of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; the first, or uppermost is the number of Inches that any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies is broad, and the other 4 are Feet, and Inches, and parts of an Inch that goes to make up a Foot of Superficial measure: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, at 5 Inches broad you must have 2 Foot, 4 Inches, and 4 Fifths of an Inch more, that is, 4 parts of 5, the Inch being divided into 5 parts; but where you have but two figures beside the uppermost, and Ciphers in the rest, you must read it thus, At two Inches broad you must have six Foot in length, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, no parts.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the use of the line of Superficial or Board measure.</p>

like the former: For first, you must learn how much your piece i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, suppose it were 24 Inches square, then I find 3 Inches i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> length makes a Foot, for so I find 3 Inches on the other side, just against 24: But if it were small Timber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as under 9 Inches square, then you must seek the square in the upper rank in the Table, and right under you have the Feet Inches, and parts that go to make a Foot square, as was in the Table of Board-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<pb facs="tcp:105159:8"/>
As suppose 7 Inches square, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen you must seek the square In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the upper rank in the Table, and right under you have the Feet Inches, and parts that go to make a Foot square, as was in the Table of Board-measure. As suppose 7 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches square, right under 7, I find in the Table 2 Foot 11 Inches, and 2 sevenths of an Inch, divided into 7 parts, and at 8 Inches square you find only 2 Foot, 3 Inches, 0 parts, and so for the rest.</p>
                  <p>But if a <hi>piece</hi> be not just square, but broader at one side than the other, then the usual way is to add them both together, and to take half for the square, but if they differ much, then this way will be very errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore I refer you to the following Rules: But if it be round Timber, then take a string and girt it about, and the fourth part of this is usually allow'd for the side of the square, and then you deal with it as if it were just square.</p>

                  <p>THE Line of Numbers is only the Logarithmes contrived on a Ruler, and the several ranks of figures in the Logarithms are here express'd by short, and longer, and longest division; and they are so contrived in proportion one to another, that as the Logarithmes by adding together, and substract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one from another produce the <hi>quesita,</hi> so here by turning a pair of Compasses forward or backward, according to due order, from one point to another, doth also bring out the <hi>quesita</hi> in like manner.</p>
                  <p>For the length of this Line of Numbers, know, that the longer it

is the better it is, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it hath been contrived several ways, as first into a Rule of two Foot long, and three Foot long by Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> and I suppose it was therefore called <hi>Gunter</hi>'s <hi>Line.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, I would find the point upon the line of numbers representing 12, now the first figure of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is one, therefore I take the middle one for the first figure; then the next figure being 2, I count two tenths from that 1, and that shall be the point representing 12, where usually there is a brass pin with a point in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I count 4, tenths onwards for that: Lastly, for the other 4, I count 4, centesmes further, and that is the point for 144.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:105159:15"/>First, As before, for 1000. take the middle 1, on the line</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For 7, I reckon seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenths onward, and that is 700.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For 2, reckon two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesmes from that <hi>7th.</hi> tenth for 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>And lastly, For 8, you must rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably estimate that following centesme, to be divided into 10 parts (if it be not express'd, which in lines of ordinary length cannot be done) and 8, of that supposed 10. is the precise point for 1728 the number propounded to be found, and the like of any number whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>But if you were to find a frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or broken number, then you must consider, that properly, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, the line doth express none but decimal fractions: thus, 1/10 or 1/100 or 1/1000 and more nearer the rule in common acception cannot express; as one inch, and one tenth or one hundredth or one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of an inch, foot, yard,

                     <p>2. That whatsoever value or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations you put on 1 the same value or denomination all the other figures must have successively, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>If I call 1 at the beginning of the line, one tenth of any integer, then 2 following must be two tenths, 3 three tenths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 1 in the middle 1 integer, 2 two integers, &amp; 10 at the end must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Also in this Impression is added the use of the <hi>Line of Pence,</hi> which is added to the <hi>Line of Numbers</hi> next to it, when it shall be desired by any one, being very convenient for casting up small summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in any concern whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Line of Numbers</hi> and <hi>Pence</hi> together, do give the Decimal Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any summ under 20 <hi>s.</hi> very near, as by the Print to 11 Radixes is most plainly seen.</p>
                     <p>Where 20 <hi>s.</hi> or 1 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, is at 1 in the fourth line, and 2 <hi>s.</hi> one tenth of a pound, at 1 right over it in the third Line; 9 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and 6 tenths of a farthing, being one tenth of two shillings, at 001 in the second line right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 01.</p>

towards the right hand, or the 96/1000 parts, at the 00001 at the left end of the same Line.</p>
                     <p>Therefore note, if 20 <hi>s.</hi> is 1, 15 <hi>s.</hi> is 075, 12 <hi>s.</hi> is 06, 10 <hi>s.</hi> is 05, 5 <hi>s.</hi> is at 025, and 2 <hi>s.</hi> or 24 <hi>d.</hi> at 01, which on Two-foot Rules is set at <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>10 at the end of the Rule, though in this case called but one tenth, when 1 is one pound.</p>
                     <p>Then if 1 or 10 at the end, be 24 pence, 18 pence is at 75, 12 <hi>d.</hi> at 5, 6 <hi>d.</hi> at 25, 2 <hi>d.</hi> at 8.33 in the first part, and 1 <hi>d.</hi> at 4166, and 1 farthing at 1042, a little beyond the first 1 on Two-foot Rules.</p>
                     <p>From hence you may see that the Print of the eleven <hi>Lines of Numbers</hi> sheweth the right Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Fraction of any summ under 1 pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> &amp; by consequence, for any summ above, and was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely made to explain this on Two-foot Rules.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now observe, if 1 in the middle is called 1 <hi>l.</hi> then in the first part, 9 is 18 <hi>s.</hi> 9.5 is 19 <hi>s.</hi> 5 towards the beginning-end is 10 <hi>s.</hi> and 1 at the very beginning end is 2 <hi>s.</hi>

                     <p>3. <hi>Examp.</hi> At 1 <hi>l. per</hi> 100, counted at the middle 1, is 2 <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>far.</hi> 6 tenths of a <hi>far.</hi> for 1.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Examp.</hi> But for any price under 2 <hi>s. per</hi> 100, count thus, as 12 <hi>d. per</hi> 100, just against 12 <hi>d.</hi> on the Line of pence is 5 on numbers, for 5 tenths of a farthing the near answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for 5 tenths of a farthing

is half a farthing, and 100 half far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things is 50 farthings, being two farthings above 48, the farthings in one shilling.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Examp.</hi> At 6 <hi>d. per</hi> 100, right against 6 in the Line of pence is 025, or one quarter of a tenth of a farthing, on the Line of Numbers, the answer near the truth. For a hundred quarters of a farthing is 50 half farthings, or 25 farthings, one more than 6 <hi>d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you count 1 farthing less for every 6 <hi>d.</hi> you shall have it right. <hi>Example</hi> at 18 <hi>d. per</hi> 100, count 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Again, at 12 <hi>d.</hi> counted at 11 <hi>d.</hi> 2 <hi>far.</hi> just against it on numbers is 48/100 pts. of a farthing, the price of 1.</p>
                     <p>Again, for 6 <hi>d.</hi> counted at 5 <hi>d.</hi> 3 <hi>far.</hi> just against it is 24/100 pts. of a farthing, the true answer or price of 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:105159:70"/>I have been large in this, that you might see the reason of it the plainer.</p>
                     <p>Again, on the contrary upwards, at any price for 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what cost 100, or 5 score.</p>
                     <p>At 48/100 pts. of a farthing for 1, the price of 100, is just 12 <hi>d.</hi> the contrary to the last example but one.</p>

                     <p>I say thus, 3 times 2 is 6, set 6
<pb facs="tcp:105159:83"/>
right under 2 and 3, as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the left page: for 6 foot, as is clear, if you consider the Scheme over the example, <hi>viz.</hi> the squares noted with <hi>f.</hi> then for the next, I say cross-wise, 2 times 3 is 6, <hi>viz.</hi> long inches, as you may percieve by the 2 long squares marked with 9 L. and 6 L. which 6 I put in the next place to the right hand, as in the example; then for the next, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 times 3 is 9 (cross wise, as the stroke from 3 to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> shews) which 9 is also 9 long inches, as the Scheme shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and must be put under 6 in the second place towards the right hand, in the Scheme it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the 3 long squares marked with L9. Then lastly for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, 3 times 3 is 9, going right up, as the stroke from 2 threes lead you: but note, this 9 must be set in the next place to the right hand, because they are but 9 square inches, but had the product been
<pb facs="tcp:105159:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
above 12, you must have substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the 12 out, and set them in the long inches place, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, where this 9 now stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and this 9 is expressed in the Scheme, by the little square in the corner mark't with (□ 9.)</p>
                     <p>Then now for the Fractions, or 8 parts of an inch, first say, cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as the longest prick line doth lead you to, 3 times 4 is 12, for which 12 you must set down 1.6, that is 1 long inch, and 6 square inches; the reason is, a piece 8 half quarters of an inch broad, and 12 inches long, is a long inch, or the twelfth part of a foot superficial; and if be 12 square inches, then 4 must needs be 6 square inches: therefore instead of 12 I set down 1.6, as you may see in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the least long square of the Diagram or Scheme. Then do likewise for the other long square, which is also multiplied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross, as 2 times 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is 10, that is, as
<pb facs="tcp:105159:84"/>
I said before, 1.3 as the example and Scheme make manifest, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what I last said, and it is marked by the 2.00. But if this or the other had come to a greater number, you must have substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted 8 as oft as you could, and set down the remainder in the place of square inches, and the number of 8 in the place of long inches, as here you see.</p>
                     <p>Then for the two shorter long squares next the corner, say cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise again, 3 times 5 is 15, that is 1.7, because 8 half quarters an inch long, do make 1 square-inch as well as eight half-quarters a foot long made 1 long inch: therefore I set 1 in the place of square inches and 7 in the next place to the right hand, and it is expressed in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agram by the small long square, and marked with * 1.7.</p>
                     <p>Then again for the other little long square, say cross-wise, as the shorter prick line leads you, three
<pb facs="tcp:105159:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times 4 is 12, that is 1.4; and do by this as the last: it is noted in the Scheme by 1.4.</p>
                     <p>Then lastly, for 5 times 4, as the short prick line sheweth you, is 20: out of which 20 take the 8 <hi>s.</hi> and set them down in the last place, and the 4 remaining you may either neglect (or set it down a place further) for you cannot see it on the Rule; therefore I thus advise, if it be under 4, neglect it quite, but if above, increase the next a figure more, if 4, then it is a half, and so may be added; for note, 64 of these parts make but 1 square inch; of which parts the little square in the right hand low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er corner of the Scheme is 20, for which I fet down 2.4, that is two half quarters and 4 of 64, which is the last work, as you may see by the Scheme and example.</p>
                     <p>Now to add them together, say thus, 4 is 4, which I put furthest to the right hand, as it were use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,

the line of inches, on ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Two-foot Rules, is into 8 parts, according to which counting the former R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Then the parts between 3, 6, and 91 may be easily estimated by help of the halfquarter cut.</p>
                     <p>Then I say, the Arithmetical multiplication will be much easier, being brought to one denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the way by decimals, and somewhat more exact, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by this following example.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, set down the numbers as
<pb facs="tcp:105159:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is usually done in their three deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of feet, inches, and 12 parts, as in the example is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the black lines and the pricked lines down right and slop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from figure to figure, done so only for ease and plainness, in wording of it to a Learner.</p>
                     <p>Then proceed in the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thus;</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> 2 times 9 is 18, as the down right black line from 2 to 9 sheweth, for which set down 18 foot under the 2 and 9, as in the Example.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> say 9 times 3 is 27 long inches, as the sloping black line from 9 to 3 sheweth, for which 27 you must set down 2 foot in the place of feet, and 3 in the place of long inches, because 27 long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is 2 foot 3 inches.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Say 2 times 5 is 10 long inches, as the sloping black line from 2 to 5 sheweth, for which you set down only 10 long inches
<pb facs="tcp:105159:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under 5 and 3 as in the the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because it is under 12 long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which make 1 foot, as in the second just before.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Say 3 times 5 is 15 square inches, as the short black line from 3 to 5 sheweth; every 12 whereof makes 1 long inch. Therefore I set down 1 long inch in the place of long inches, and the 3 square inches over in the place of square inches right under 7 and 8.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Say 9 times 7 is 63 square inches, as the long pricked line from 9 to 7 sheweth, every 12 whereof makes 1 long inch, and every 144 one foot; therefore I set down 5 long inches in that place and 3 in the place of square inches.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Say 2 times 8 is 16 square inches, as the other long sloping pricked line from 2 to 8 sheweth, for which set down one long inch and 4 square inches, each in their proper places, as in the fifth last mentioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:105159:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>7. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Say 5 times 7 is 35, 144 or 12 parts of 1 square inch, as the shorter sloping prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line from 5 to 7 sheweth, every 12 whereof is 1 square inch; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set down 2 in the place of square inches under 7 and 8 and 11, the parts over in a space beyond, under 144.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Say 3 times 8 is 24, 144 or 12 parts of one square inch, as before, as the other short sloping pricked line sheweth, every 12 whereof is one square inch; therefore I set down 2 in the place of square inches under 8 and 7, and no more, because nothing is over 2 halves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> Say 7 times 8 is 56, <hi>1728s.</hi> as the short down right pricked line from 7 to 8 sheweth, every 12 whereof makes one 144, or the 12 part of 1 square inch; therefore I set down 4 in the place of 144 &amp; the 8 parts over in the place of 1728 <hi>s.</hi> being a place further, as in the example you see done.</p>

                  <p>A Sliding-Rule is only two Rules, or Rule-pieces fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, with a brass socked at each end, that they slip not out of the grove; and the Line of Numbers thereon, is cut across the moving Joynt on each piece, the same divisions on both sides, only the placing of the Lines differ; for on one side of the Rule you have 1 set at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and 10 at the end on each piece; but on the other side, 1 is set in the middle, and the rest of the figures answerably both ways,
<pb facs="tcp:105159:90"/>
on purpose to make it large, and to take in all numbers; and the reading of this is the very same with the other; for if you pull out the Rule, and set 10 at the end, right against 1 at the beginning, then on both pieces you have the former Line of Numbers complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; therefore I shall say nothing as to description, or reading of it, but come streight to the use.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:105159:91"/>
out as far as the brasses will suffer, it wants about one inch of 2 foot just when pulled out, as it is made for Carpenters use, then the inches on one side, and Foot-measure on the same reciprocal edge, must be figured otherwise, as 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 25 inches, and the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measure with 110, near the end 120, 130, 140, 150, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with 210 at the very end, shewing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from end to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> end, being drawn out to any distance; as is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to conceive of, and need no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to illustrate it withal.</p>
                  <p>Note also in using the Line of Numbers, that that side or part of it, on which you find the first part or term in the question, shall always call the first side, and then the other must needs be the second, that the Rules and Examples may be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made easie.</p>

Also at 13 foot 7 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is TD, and at 3 inches and ½ is TR.</p>
                  <p>Note also, if you put on the Gage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points for Ale or Wine, with the mean diameter, and length, you may gage any Wine or Beer-vessel, the Wine at 17 inches 15. the Ale or Beer at 18. 95.
