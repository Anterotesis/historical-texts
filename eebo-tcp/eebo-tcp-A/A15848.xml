            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing in this world can bee framed so perfect, but it shall have some delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quensies; to prove that more were in the Compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor: and it is almost as easie to find faults, as to make them. To spy the inconveniences of a house built, is nothing: but to lay the plot well, at first, requires the pate
<pb facs="tcp:2380:3"/>
of a good Contriver. All Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists can doe well till they come to doing: But there is a further distance from nothing to the least thing in the world; then between it and the greatest.</p>
            <p>All publique actions are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to diverse, and uncertaine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations; for a great many heads judge of them, and mens censures are as various as their palats, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. Our writings are as so many dishes; our Readers, guests. Bookes are like faces; that which one admires, another slights. Why? Some will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne what they do as little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand as they doe themselves: Others, the better a thing is, the
<pb facs="tcp:2380:3"/>
worse they will like it. <hi>They hate him</hi> (saith Amos) <hi>that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly, Amos</hi> 5.10. You know, <hi>Herods</hi> festered conscience could not endure <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> plaister of truth; a galled backe, loves not the curry Combe; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed face, loathes the true glas, nothing is so hatefull to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speratly wicked, as good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: with <hi>Balaam</hi> they grutch to be stayed in the way to death, and fly upon those that oppose their perdition. And how should they other then miscarry; who have a Pirate (the flesh) for their guide? So that if a man should observe the wind of Applause, he should
<pb facs="tcp:2380:4"/>
never sowe; or regard the clouds of Aspersion, hee should never reape. But I had rather hazard the censure of some, then hinder the good of others: yea, I had rather misse of what I expect, then faile to do my utmost. Wherefore, I present to thee, curteous Reader, a posey of such flowers as I have gathered abroad. If they be liked (as <hi>Phidias</hi> said, concerning his first portrayture) expect more; if not, onely this.</p>
            <p>To fore-relate their variety, and severall worths, were to imitate an Italian Host, meeting you on the waies, and promising before hand, your fare and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Wherefore let it please you
<pb facs="tcp:2380:4"/>
to see and allow your cheare. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in generall; my Booke is a feast; wherin holsomnesse strives with pleasantnesse, and variety with both. Each Chapter seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is a severall dish, stuft full of notable sayings and examples (for that's the meate) by which a man may, not only become more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but more wise; not alone, able to say well, but to doe well; for quaint and elegant phrases, on a good subject, are baites, to make an ill man vertuous. Pithy sentences, curious metaphors, witty apophthegmes, sweet simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and rhetoricall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have, as it were, sprinkled in the
<pb facs="tcp:2380:5"/>
most serious discourses) are to the minde, as musicke to the body; which (next to sleepe) is the best recreation. Or as pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Sause, which gives a more savory tast to holsome, and profitable Divinity. And thou shalt finde but few here, which are not both sinewy, and sharpe: <hi>mucrones verborum,</hi> pointed spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; either fit to teach, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to perswade, or sage to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, and forewarne; or sharpe to reprove, or strong to confirme, or piercing to imprint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! most men regard not what is written, but who writes: valew not the mettall, but the Stampe which is upon it.
<pb facs="tcp:2380:5"/>
To these, I say little, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve little: and turne my speech to all that reserve themselves open, and prepared, to receive each profitabe instruction, and continuall amendment; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Reader, that sucks hony from the selfe same flower which the Spider doth poyson; wishing him to come, that out of this Treatise which he did not know before; and well note what speakes to his owne sinne: And perhaps he may, in this short jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney make more true gaine, then <hi>Salomons</hi> Navy did from Ophir, or the Spanish fleete from the West Indies; for in so doing, he shall greatly increase his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:2380:6"/>
and lessen his vices. In one day he may reade it, and ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be the better for it.</p>
            <p>But methinkes I am too like a carelesse Porter; which keepes the guests without dores, til they have lost their stomackes; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I wil detaine you no longer in the porch, but unlock the dore, and let you in.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Treatises I have proved, that there is a naturall enmity and a spiritual Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy betweene the Men of the World, and the children of GOD; betweene the seed of the Serpent, and the seed of the Woman. And that these two
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2380:9"/>
Regiments being the Subjects of two severall Kings, Satan and CHRIST, are governed by Lawes opposite and cleane contrary each to the other: whereby it comes to passe, that grievous temptations and persecutions doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompany the remission of sins: That all men (as <hi>Austine</hi> speakes) are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to miseries, which bend their course towards the Kingdome of Heaven. For god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and temptation are such inseparable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants on the same person, that a mans sins be no sooner forgiven, and hee rescued from Satan, but that Lion fomes, and roares, and bestirs himselfe to recover his losse. Neither can Gods love be injoyed, without Satans di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance. Yea, the World and the Devill therefore hate us, because <hi>God</hi> hath chosen us. If a Convert comes home, the Angels wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him with Songs, the devils follow him with uproare and fury, his old acquaintance with scornes and obloquie; for they thinke it quarrell enough that we will no longer <hi>runne with them to the same excesse of riot,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4.4.

               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2380:9"/>It is not enough for them to be bad them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, except they raile at, and persecute the good. He that hath no grace himselfe, is vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see it in another: godly men are thornes in wicked mens eyes, as <hi>Iob</hi> was in the devils; because they are good, or because they are deerely beloved of <hi>God</hi>: If a mans person and wayes please <hi>God,</hi> the world will be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with both. If <hi>God</hi> be a mans friend, that will be his enemy; if they exercise their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, it is where he shewes mercy: and indeed he refuseth to be an <hi>Abel,</hi> whom the malice of <hi>Cain</hi> doth not exercise (as <hi>Gregory</hi> speaks:) for it is an everlasting rule of the Apostles, <hi>He that is borne after the flesh, will persecute him that is borne after the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 4.29. not because he is evill, but because he is so much better than himselfe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.12. <hi>Because his life is not like other mens, his wayes are of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fashion, Wisd.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>I have also shewed the Originall, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, properties, causes, ends, and what will be the issue of this enmity; and therein made it plaine, that as for the present, they suit like the Harpe and the Harrow, agree like two poisons in one stomack, the one being ever sick of the other: so, to reconcile them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were to reconcile Fire and Water, the

Wolfe and the Lambe, the Windes and the Sea together; yea, that once to expect it were an effect of frenzie, not of hope.</p>

               <p n="2">2 SEcondly, the malice of our enemies serves to worke in us amendment of life, the outward cold of affliction doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increase the inward heate and fervor of the Graces of God in us. Indeed no Chastizement (saith the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>) for the present seemes to be joyous, but grievous; But afterwards it bringeth the quiet fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to them that are thereby exercised, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.11. God strips the body of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to cloath the soule with righteousnesse, and oftentimes strengthens our state of grace by impoverishing our temporall estate: Oftentimes the more Prosperity, the lesse Piety.</p>
               <p>It was an observation of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siing of the fortune, did rarely mend the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, onely <hi>Vespasian</hi> was changed into the better; few men can disgest great felicity; Many a man hath been a looser by his gaines,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2380:18"/>
and found, that that which multiplied his outward estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath abated his inward. Now who will esteeme those things good which make us worse, or, that evill, which brings such gaine and sweetnesse? <hi>Before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I went astray, but now doe I keepe thy Commandements, Psal.</hi> 119.67. Happy was he, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. in being borne blind, whose game of bodily sight made way for the spirituall, who of a Patient became an Advocate for his <hi>Saviour,</hi> who lost a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and found Heaven, who by being abandoned of sinners was received of the Lord of glory: God rarely deprives a man of one faculty, but he more then supplyes it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. <hi>Hannibal</hi> had but one eye, <hi>Appius, Claudius, Timelon,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> were quite blinde, So was <hi>Muliasses King</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Ioh. King of Bohemia</hi>; But for the losse of that one Sence they were recompenc'd in the rest, they had most excellent memories, rare inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and admirable other parts: Or suppose he send sicknesse, the worst Feaver can come, does not more burne our bloud than our lust; And together with sweating out the Surfets of nature at the poores of the body, we weepe out the sinfull corruption of our nature at the poares of the Conscience; Yea the Author to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2380:19"/>
the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> saith of <hi>Christ</hi> Himselfe, that <hi>though he were the Sonne, yet</hi> (as he was man) <hi>He learned obedience by the things which Hee suffered, Heb.</hi> 5.8. As in humane proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Ill manners beget good Lawes; So in Divine, the wicked by their evill tongues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get good and holy lives in the Godly; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sooner brings us to the knowledge and amendment of our faults, then the scoffes of an enemy, which made <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> acknowledge himselfe much beholding to his enemies (the <hi>Athenians</hi>) for speaking evill of him, for (saith he) they have made me an honest man, to proove them lyers: Even barren <hi>Leah</hi> when she was despised became fruitfull.</p>
               <p>So that we may thanke our enemies, or must thanke God for our enemies; Our soules shall shine the brighter one day for such rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing; Yea put case we be gold, they will but trye us; If Iron, they will scower away our rust. The malice of wicked men serves to the godly, as the Thorne to the brest of the Nightingale, the which (if she chance to sleep) causeth her to warble with a renewed cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. These very tempestuous showers bring forth spirituall flowers and hearbs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance: Devotion (like fire in fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

burnes hottest in affliction. Vertue provoked, addes much to it selfe: With the <hi>Arke</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> the higher we are tossed with the floud of their malice, the neerer we mount towards Heaven. When the waters of the floud came upon the face of the earth, downe went stately Turrets and Towers; but as the waters rose, the Arke rose still high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and higher. In like sort when the waters of afflictions arise, downe goes the pride of life, the lust of the eyes; In a word, all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world. But the <hi>Arke</hi> of the soule ariseth as these waters rise, and that higher and higher, even neerer and neerer towards Heaven.</p>
               <p>I might illustrate this point by many obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable things in nature: We see Well-waters arising from deep Springs, are hotter in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in Summer, because the outward cold doth keep in and double their inward heate: And so of mans body, the more extreme the cold is without, the more doth the naturall heate fortify it selfe within, and guard the heart.

Or as experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souldiers in time of peace, prepaire against the day of battell; and so much the rather, when they look every day for the approach of the enemy.

               <p>Againe, God suffers us to suffer much, more especially to try our perseverance, which is a grace so good and acceptable, that without it there is nothing good, nor acceptable; And indeed how shall a man shew his strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse some burthen be laid upon his back, or his constancy?

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2380:31"/>
suffers us to be afflicted, because he will not suffer us to be damned; such is the goodnesse of our heavenly Father to us, that even his anger proceeds from mercy; he scourgeth the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of Iesus Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. Yea, <hi>Ioseph</hi> was therefore abased in the dungeon, that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement might be the greater. Its true, in our thoughts we often speake for the flesh, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did for <hi>Ismael, O that Ismael might live in thy sight</hi>! no, God takes away <hi>Ismael</hi> and gives <hi>Isaac</hi>; he withdrawes the pleasure of the flesh, gives delight to the soule. The man sick of a burning feaver cries to his Physitian for drinke; he pities him, but does not satisfie him; he gives him proper physick, but not drink. A man is sick of a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie, the Physitian lets him bloud, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it; the arme shall smart to ease the heart.

So if God scourge us any way, so we bleed not; or till we bleed, so we faint not; or till we even faint, so we perish not; let us be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: for if the Lord prune his Vine, he meanes not to root it up: if he minister phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to our soules, it is because he would not

have us dye in our sins; all is for salvation. What if <hi>Noah</hi> were pent up in the Arke, so long as he was safe in it: what if it were his prison, so long as it was his Fort also against the waters?</p>
               <p>I might illustrate the point, and make it plaine by sundry and divers comparisons. We know, one naile drives out another; one heat another; one cold another: yea, out of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable experience I can witnesse it, that for most constitutions there is not such a remedy under Heaven for a cold in the head, or an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed tendernesse, as a frequent bathing of it in cold water; I can justly say, I am twenty yeeres the younger for it. Yea, one sorrow drives out another; one passion another; one rumour is expelled by another: and though for the most part, contraries are cured by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; yet not seldome will Physitians stop a Lask with a Purge; they will bleed a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the Arme, to stop a worse bleeding at Nose. Againe, in some Patients they will procure a gentle Ague, that they may cure him of a more dangerous disease. Even so deales God with us; he often punisheth the worser part of man (saith S. <hi>Ierome,</hi>) That is, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, state, or name, that the better part (to wit) the soule, may be saved in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2380:32"/>
Neither are chastisements any whit lesse necessary for the soule, than medicines are for the body: many a man had beene undone by prosperity, if they had not beene undone by adversity; they had perished in their soules, if they had not perished in their bodies, estates, or good-names. Its probable <hi>Naamans</hi> soule had never beene cleansed, if his body had not beene leaprous: and though affliction be hard of digestion to the naturall man, yet the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Christian knowes, that it is good for the soule, that the body is sometime sick; and therefore to have his inward man cured, he is content his outward man should be diseased; and cares not so the sins of his soule may be les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I hope thou desirest thy soules safety above all; and thou knowest, the stomack that is purged must be content to part with some good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, that it may deliver it selfe of more evill humours.

saves the life, which makes S. <hi>Austine</hi> say unto <hi>God</hi>; Let my body be crucified, or burnt, or doe with it what thou wilt, so thou save my soule.

Our adversaries as well as our sins are Messengers sent from Satan to buffet us; and the best minds troubled, yeeld inconsiderate motions. As water violently stirred sends up bubbles, so the vanities of our hearts, and our most secret and hidden corruptions (as dregs in a glasse) shew themselves when shaken by an injury, though they lay hid before. And so the pride of man is beaten downe as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.17. The sharpe water of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction quickens our spirituall sight.

We esteeme our Inches, Ellues, till by triall of evils we finde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but then alas, how full of feeblenesse is our body, and our minde of impatience? If but a Beesting our flesh, it swels, and if but a tooth ake, the Head and Heart complaine. How smal trifles make us weary of our selves? What can we doe without thee? Without thee, what can we suffer? If thou be not (O Lord) strong in our weaknesse, we cannot be so much as weake; we cannot so much as be. Selfe-conceit and desire of glory, is the last garment that even good men lay aside: Pride is the inmost coat which we put on first, and which we put off last; but sore affliction will make us give all to Him, of whom whatsoever we have, we hold. And we cannot ascribe too little to our selves, nor too much to Him, to whom we owe more than we can ascribe.

For we must suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. When the <hi>Iewes</hi> offered <hi>Iesus</hi> Gall and Vinegar, he tasted it, but would not drink; he left the rest for his Church, and they must pledge him. <hi>Whosoever</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>beareth not his crosse and commeth after me, cannot be my Disciple, Luk.</hi> 14.27. For hereunto are ye called, saith S. <hi>Peter, For Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we should follow his steps,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Againe, <hi>The Disciple,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, is not above his Master,</hi> but whosoever will be a perfect Disciple shall be as his Master, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.40. Yea, S. <hi>Paul</hi> made this the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine testimony and seale of his Adoption
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2380:34"/>
here, and glory afterward; his words are these, having delivered, <hi>that the Spirit of God beareth witnesse with our spirit, that we are the children of God</hi>: &amp; having added, <hi>If we be children, we are also heires, even the heires of God, and heires annexed with Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him</hi>; making suffering as a principall condition annexed, which is, as if he had said, it is impossible we should be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with him, except we first suffer with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. Whereupon having in another place reckoned up all priviledges which might minister unto him occasion of boasting, he concludeth, <hi>that what things were gaine unto him, those he accounted losse for Christ, that he might know the fellowship of his sufferings, and be made conformable to his death, Phil.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Againe, by suffering we become followers of our brethren who went before us. <hi>Brethren</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ye are become followers of the Churches of God, which in Iudea are in Christ Iesus, because ye have also suffered the same things of your owne Countrey men, even as they have of the Iewes,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.14. It was the lot of Christ, and must be of all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to doe good and to suffer evill. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

let us be exhorted in the words of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to rejoyce in suffering, forasmuch as we with all the Saints, <hi>are partakers of Christs sufferings,</hi> that when his glory shall appeare, we may be glad and rejoyce, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 13. That it increaseth their faith.</head>
               <p n="10">10 TEnthly, because the malice of our enemies serves to increase our faith for the time to come, when we consider how the Lord hath delivered us formerly. God hath delivered me (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) out of the mouth of the Lion, (meaning <hi>Nero</hi>) and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from every evill worke, and will preserve me unto his heavenly Kingdome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17, 18. When <hi>Saul</hi> tels <hi>David, Thou art not able to goe against this great Philistime to fight with him, for thou art a Boy, and he is a man of war from his youth:</hi> what saith <hi>David? Thy servant kept his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sheepe, and there came a Lion, and likewise a Beare, and tooke a Sheepe out of the flocke, and I went out after him and smote
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2380:35"/>
him, and tooke it out of his mouth, and when he rose against me, I caught him by the beard and smote him and slew him; so thy servant slew both the Lion and the Beare. Therefore</hi> (marke the inference) <hi>this uncircumcised Philistime shall be as one of them; Yea,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Beare, he will deliver me out of the hands of this Philistine,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.33. to 37. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how confidently he speakes. The Tree of faith the more it is shaken with the violent stormes of trouble, the faster it becomes rooted by patience. He can never be a good souldier, that hath not felt the toile of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; yea, the more deliverances he had, the greater was his faith: for after the Lord had delivered him often out of extreme exigents; namely, from this great <hi>Goliah,</hi> the cruelty of <hi>Saul,</hi> the unnaturall insurrection of <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> and the unjust curses of <hi>Shemei,</hi> he was able to say, <hi>I trust in God, neither will I feare what flesh can do unto me, Psal.</hi> 56.4. And in <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. <hi>I will not be afraid for ten thousand of the people that should beset me round about, Vers.</hi> 6. And in Psal. 18. <hi>By thee I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through an host, and in thy Name I will leape over a wall.</hi> His experience had made it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2380:36"/>
so easie to him, that it was no more than a skip or jumpe: we men indeed therefore shut our hands, because we have opened them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our former kindnesses arguments of spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring afterwards. But contrarily, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives, because he hath given; making his former favours arguments for more. It is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> only argument, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. <hi>Have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me</hi> (saith he) <hi>and hearken unto my prayer</hi>: Why? <hi>Thou hast set me at liberty when I was in distresse, Vers.</hi> 1. I might likewise here shew from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.29. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12, 13.14. how the delivering of some increaseth the faith of others; but I passe that.</p>
               <p>That we may live by faith, and not by sence, he first strips us of all our earthly confidence, and then gives us victory, and not before; lest he should bee a loser in our gaine, his helpe uses to shew it selfe in extremity: he that can prevent evils, conceales his aide till dangers be ripe, and then he is as carefull as before he seemed connivent. <hi>Daniel</hi> is not delivered at the beginning of his trouble, he must first be in the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and then he findes it. Those three Servants are not rescued at the Ovens mouth, in the Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nace they are. That is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and well-tried faith, that can hold out with confidence to the last. The Lion seemes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2380:36"/>
to leave her young-ones, till they have almost kill'd themselves with roaring and howling, but at last gaspe she relieves them, whereby they become the more couragious. When the <hi>Prophet</hi> could say, <hi>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee</hi> (instantly followes) and not till then <hi>the Lord heard me</hi>: the Lord saw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him sinking all the while, yet lets him alone till he was at the bottome. Every maine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is our Red-sea, which whiles it threats to swallow, preserves us: now when it comes to a dead lift (as we say) then to have a strong confidence in God is thankworthy. Hope in a state hopelesse, and love to God under signes of his displeasure, &amp; heavenly mindednesse in the midst of worldly affaires &amp; allurements, drawing a contrary way, is the chiefe praise of faith: to love that God who crosseth us, to kisse that hand which strikes us, to trust in that power which kils us; this is the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proofe of a Christian, this argues faith indeed. What made our <hi>Saviour</hi> say to that <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Canaan, O Woman, great is thy faith</hi>: but this, when neither his silence nor his flat deniall could silence her. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. It is not enough to say, God is good to Israel, when Israel is in peace and prosperity, and neither feeles nor wants any thing: but God
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2380:37"/>
will have us beleeve that he is good, even when we feele the smart of the rod, and at the same time see our enemies (the wicked) prosper. It best pleaseth him when we can say boldly with <hi>Iob, Though hee kill me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> When our enemies are behind us, and the Red-Sea before us, then confidently to trust upon God is much worth. When we are in the barren wildernesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most famished, then to beleeve that God will provide <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, and water out of the Rock, is glorious: when with the <hi>three Children</hi> we see nothing before us but a fiery Fornace; to beleeve that God will send his Angell to be our deliverer, this is heroicall, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.28. And those which are acquainted with the proceedings of God well know, that cherishing ever follow stripes, as Cordials do vehement evacuations, and the cleere light of the morning a darke night: yea, if we can looke beyond the cloud of our afflictions, and see the sunshine of comfort on the other side of it. We cannot be so discouraged with the presence of evill, as hartned with the islue. Cheere up then, thou drooping soule, and trust in God, what ever thy sufferings be, God is no tyrant, to give thee more than thy loade; and admit he stay long, yet be thou fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2380:37"/>
he will come at length. <hi>In thee doe I trust</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi>) <hi>all the day</hi>; He knew that if hee came not in the Morning, hee would come at Noone; if hee came not at Noone, hee would come at Night; At one houre of the day or other hee will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me: and then as the Calme is greater after the Tempest then it was before; so my <hi>joy</hi> shall be sweeter afterwards then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; The remembrance of <hi>Babylon</hi> wil make us sing more <hi>joyfull</hi> in <hi>Sion.</hi> If then I find the Lords dealing with mee to transcend my thoughts, my faith shall be above my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and thinke, he will worke good out of it, though I yet conceive not how.</p>

occasions offered to praise the Author of our deliverance. <hi>When the Lord brought againe the Captivity of Sion</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi> in the person of <hi>Israel</hi>) <hi>wee were like them that dreame,</hi> meaning, the happinesse seemed too good to be true) <hi>Then was our mouthes filled with laughter,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and our tongues with joy, The Lord hath done great things for us wherof we rejoyce, Psal.</hi> 126.1, 2, 3, 4. And how could their case bee otherwise, when in that miserable exigent, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. they saw the <hi>Pillar</hi> remove behind them, and the Sea remove before them they looking for nothing but death? <hi>Is any one afflicted?</hi> I may say unto him as that harbinger answered a Noble man complaining that he was lodged in so homely a roome; you will take pleasure in it when you are out of it; For the more grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous our exigent, the more glorious our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, <hi>A desire accomplished delighteth the soule, Prov.</hi> 13.19. We reade how that lamentable and sad decree of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> through the goodnesse of God was an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion exceedingly to increase the <hi>Iewes joy</hi> and thankfulnesse, insomuch that (as the Text sayth) <hi>the dayes that were appointed for their death and ruine were turned into dayes of feasting and joy, and wherein they sent presents
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2380:38"/>
every man to his neighbour, and guifts to the poore, Ester.</hi> 9.17.22, <hi>to</hi> 28. And this <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>thankefulnesse</hi> was so lasting, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> cease not to celebrate the same to this day. Gods dealing with us is often harsh in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, hard in the proceeding, but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is alwayes comfortable. The <hi>joy</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Church was greater after he was delivered out of Prison by the <hi>Angell, Act.</hi> 12. And the <hi>joy</hi> of <hi>Iudith</hi> and the rest of <hi>Bethulia</hi> when she returned with <hi>Holofernes</hi> head, then if they never had been in distresse, <hi>Iudith</hi> 13. The Lord depreives us of good things for a time, because they never appeare in their full beauty, till they turne their backs and be going away. Againe he defers his ayde on purpose to increase our desires before it comes, and our <hi>joy</hi> when it is come, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our desires, for things easily come by, are little set by; to increase our <hi>joy</hi> for that which hath been long detayned, is at last more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained; but suddenly gotten, suddenly forgotten. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Child at seventy yeares was more welcome then if he had beene given at thirty. And the same <hi>Isaac</hi> had not been so precious to him if he had not been as miraculously restored as given, his recovery from death made him more acceptable: The

Yea the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of some, increaseth the <hi>joy</hi> of others, and causeth them to praise God for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in their behalfe that are delivered, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.14. We never know the worth of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit so well as by the want of it, want teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the worth of things most truly. O how sweet a thing is peace to them that have been long troubled with wars and tedious conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? How sweet is liberty to one that hath beene long immured within a case of walls? How deere a Iewell is health to him that tumbles in distempered bloud? Let a man but fast a meale or two, oh how sweet is browne bread, though it would not down before? Yea when <hi>Darius</hi> in a flight had drunk puddle water, polluted with dead Carkasses, he confest never to have drunke any thing more pleasant; the reason was, he

alwaies before used to drinke ere hee was athirst. We are never so glad of our freinds company, as when he returnes after long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or a tedious voyage. The nights darkenesse maketh the light of the Sunne more desirable; a Calme is best welcome after a Tempest: Good things then appeare of most worth, when they are knowne in their wants; When we have lost those invaluable comforts which we cannot well be without, the minde hath time to recount their severall worths; and the worthes of blessings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not untill they are vanisht; When we would have some Fiers flame the more, we sprinkle water upon them; Even so when the LORD would increase our <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>thankefulnesse,</hi> Hee allayeth it with the teares of affliction, misery sweetneth <hi>joy,</hi> yea the sorrowes of this life shall (like a darke vaile) give a lustre to the glory of the next, when the LORD shall turne this water of our earthly afflictions into that wine of gladnesse, wherewith our soules shall bee satiate for ever. We deceive our selves to thinke on earth continued <hi>joyes</hi> would please; Plenty of the choycest dainties is no daynty.

Even as the Clay with water, and the Iron with fire, are made pliable and apt to receive impression from the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Even so when wee are soaked in the flouds of sorrow, and softned in the fire of affliction, we are aptest to receive the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Gods Law into our hearts, when hee speakes unto us by his Ministers; If the Lord breakes us in peeces with the Plow of his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then let the Seedsmen (his Ministers)

Yea the whole Church, and every particular member thereof have their wisdome and knowledge impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved even by their greatest enemies. If <hi>Arius &amp; Sabellius</hi> had not vexed the Church, the deepe mysteries of the <hi>Trinity</hi> had not beene so accurately cleered by the Catholike Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2380:43"/>
them that were the cause of his banishment, though he were now advanced above them. Yea <hi>Diogenes,</hi> rather than want exercise for his patience, would crave almes of dead mens statues; for being demanded why he did so, he answered, That I may learne to take denials from others the more patiently. Now if we can therefore suffer because we have suffered, we have well profited by our afflictions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not; to shew that there is nothing so hard and difficult but may be attained to by use and custome: give me leave to cleere it by some familiar instances. We know the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of any hardship (whether it be labour, cold, or the like) makes it easie and familiar: you shall have a common Labourer worke all day, like a Horse, without once sweating or being weary. Let a Scholler or Gentleman but dig one quarter of an houre, you must give him leave to take breath all the day after. The face that is ever open, yea, the eye that is twice as much open as shut, is able perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to endure the coldest wind can blow, when as the rest of the parts would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the least blast that is cold. Let him that is next neighbour to the Belfrey tell me, whether ringing doth so molest his silent sleepe now, as formerly. Yea, the fall of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2380:43"/>
River <hi>Nilus</hi> which makes a new commer stop his eares, to the naturall inhabitants is not so much as heard. At <hi>Milton</hi> neere <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingborne</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> is (or lately was) one <hi>William Allen</hi> a Taylor, that eats betweene 30. and forty graines of <hi>Opium</hi> every day, the tythe whereof would kill him that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed thereunto, neither can he sleepe (no not live) without it; he began but with one graine, and so increased the quantity as the operation and quality of it decreased. If any question the truth of this, they need but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the signe of the Rose in <hi>Bucklers Bury</hi> and be satisfied: but this is nothing, for you have slaves in the <hi>Turkish Gallies,</hi> that will eat neere an Ounce at a time as if it were bread. Neither, in my judgement, is it lesse rare for men to drink a Pottle or a Gallon of the richest old Canary every day, as is usuall with some of our Sack-drinkers and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes, without the least inflammation; it hath no other operation in them then a cup of Six hath with me, or hath had with them <hi>in diebus illis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, as that Maide which <hi>Plinie</hi> speakes of, by an accustomary picking Spiders off the Wall and eating them, digested them into nourishment: And as <hi>Mithridates</hi> by his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2380:44"/>
accustomed eating of poyson, made his body unpoisonable. So the godly, notwithstanding they are by nature as a wilde As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Colt, as <hi>Zophar</hi> speakes, <hi>Iob</hi> 11.22. Yet by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and accustomary suffering of injuries these wilde Asses are made tame, &amp; the ablest to carry burthens of any creature: yea, though they were once as fierce and cruell as Wolves, Leopards, Lions, &amp; Beares, and as mischievous as Aspes, and Cockatrices; yet Christ will so change their natures, partly by his word, and partly by his rod of affliction, that they shall now be as apt to suffer evill as they have been to offer it: What else meanes the Prophet, when he tels us that the Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard with the Kid, and the Lion with the Calfe, so that a little childe shall leade them; that the Cow and the Beare, and the Lion and the Bullock, shall eat straw together; that the sucking childe shall play upon the hole of the Aspe, and the wained child shall put his hand upon the Cockatrice hole, <hi>Isay</hi> 11.6. and so forward. And so you see that according to the ancient proverbiall speech, Vse makes perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and that custome is not unfitly called a second nature. Wouldest thou then attaine to an unconquerable patience, and be able to

               <p>First, they beare the slanders and reproches of wicked men patiently, for that they are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2380:45"/>
false and so appertaine not unto them. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> being railed upon, and called by one all to naught, took no notice of it, and being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a reason of his patience, said, it concernes me not, for I am no such man. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was wont to say when the people mockt him, They deride me, yet I am not derided, I am not the man they take me for. This reason is of more force from the mouth of an innocent Christian. If a rich man be called poore, or a sound Christian, hypocrite, hee slights it, he laughs at it, because he knoweth the same to be false, and that his Accuser is mistaken; whereas if a Beggar be called, bankrupt, or a dissembler, hypocrite, hee will winch, and kick, and bee most grievously offended at it. <hi>Marius</hi> was never offended with any report that went of him, because if it were true it would sound to his praise; if false, his life and manners should prove it contrary. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the best confutation of their slanders, is not by our great words, but by our good workes. <hi>Sophocles</hi> being accused by his owne children, That hee grew Dotard, and spent their patrimonies idely, when he was summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned did not personally appeare before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, but sent one of his new Tragedies to their perusall, which being read, made
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2380:46"/>
them confesse, This is not the worke of a man that dotes. So against all clamours and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling opprobies, set but thine innocency and good life; thou needest doe no more. That body which is in good health, is strong, and able to beare the great stormes and bitter cold of Winter, and likewise the excessive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate heat of the Summer: but with a cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie and distempered body it is far otherwise. Even so, a sound heart and cleare conscience will abide all trialls; in prosperity it will not be lifted up, in adversity it will not be utterly cast downe: whereas the corrupt heart and festred conscience, can indure nothing; even a word if it be pleasing puffes him up with pride; if not, it swels him with passion: no greater signe of innocency when we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused then mildnesse: as we see in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who being both accused and committed for forcing of his Mistresse, answered just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we reade of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39, 17, 18. And <hi>Susanna,</hi> who being accused by the two El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an hainous crime (which they alone were guilty of) never contended by laying the fault upon them, but appeales unto God whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she were innocent or no. The History of <hi>Susanna, Vers.</hi> 42, 43. And <hi>Hanna,</hi> whose reply to <hi>Ely,</hi> when he falsely accused her of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2380:46"/>
drunkennesse was no other, but <hi>Nay my Lord count not thy Handmaid for a wicked woman,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15, 16. Neither is there a greater Symptome of guiltinesse, than our breaking into choller, and being exasperated when we have any thing laid to our charge, witnesse <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 49. That <hi>Hebrew</hi> which struck his fellow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.13.14. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.32, 33. <hi>Abner,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.27. <hi>Amazia,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16. <hi>Vzziah.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26 19. <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch, Luke</hi> 3.19.20. The men of <hi>Nazareth, Luke</hi> 4.28, 29. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, Iohn</hi> 8.47.48. And the <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Scribes, Luke</hi> 20, 19, 20. And this is one reason why the former are compared to Sheep and Lambes (Emblemes of innocency) which being harmed will not once bleate, and the latter unto Swine, which will roare and cry if they be but toucht. But to leave these Swine and returne to the men we were speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
               <p>A good conscience is not put out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with the false accusations of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous tongues: it throweth them off, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Viper,</hi> unhurt. Innocence and patience are two Bucklers sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse and abate the violence of any such
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2380:47"/>
charge; the breast-plate of righteousnesse, the brazen wall of a good conscience feareth no such Canons. The Conscionable being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, and reviled by a foule mouth, may reply as once a Steward to his passionate Lord, when he called him Knave, &amp;c. Your Honour may speake as you please, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not a word that you say, for I know my my selfe an honest man. Yea, suppose we are circled round with reproaches, our consciences knowing us innocent, like a constant friend, takes us by the hand and cheeres us against all our miseries. A just man, saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> is impregnable, and cannot be overcome, take away his wealth, his good parts cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and his treasure is above; cast him into prison and bonds, he doth the more freely enjoy the presence of his <hi>God</hi>; banish him his Countrey, he hath his conversation in Heaven, kill his body, it shall rise againe: so he fights with a shadow that contends with an upright man.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let all who suffer in their good names, if conscious and guilty of an enemies imputations, repent and amend; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, contemne them, owne them not so much as once to take notice thereof: yea, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God esteemes men as they are, and not as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2380:47"/>
they have beene; although formerly thou hast beene culpable, yet now thou mayest answer for thy selfe as <hi>Paul</hi> did for <hi>Onesimus, Though in time past I was unprofitable, yet now am I profitable</hi>: and oppose to them that sweet and divine sentence of sweet and holy <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> Tell me not Sathan what I have beene, but what I am and will be. Or that of <hi>Beza</hi> in the like case, Whatsoever I was, I am now in <hi>Christ</hi> a New Creature, &amp; that is it which troubles thee, I might have so continued long enough ere thou wouldest have vexed at it, but now I see thou dost envie me the grace of my Saviour. Or that Apothegme of <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to a base fellow, that told him he had once beene a forger of money, whose answer was, 'Tis true, such as thou art now; I was once, but such as I am now thou wilt never be. Yea, thou maist say, by how much more I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly sinned, by so much more is Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and goodnesse now magnified. As S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> hearing the <hi>Donatists</hi> revile him for the former wickednesse of his youth, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, The more desperate my disease was, so much the more I admire the Physitian: Yea, thou maist yet straine it a peg higher, and say, the greater my sins were, the greater is my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Devils which <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>

               <head>CHAP. 18. That it is more laudable to forgive, than revenge.</head>
               <p n="2">2 BEcause it is more generous and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to forgive, than revenge: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in taking revenge a man is but even with his enemy, but in passing it over he is superiour to him, for it is a Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part to pardon; yea quoth <hi>Alexander,</hi> There can be nothing more noble, than to do well to those that deserve evill. Princes use not to chide when Embassadours have offered them unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, but deny them audience; as if silence were the way royall to correct a wrong. And certainly he injoyes a brave composednes, that seats himselfe above the flight of the injurious claw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agathocles, Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great <hi>Potentates,</hi> were as little moved at
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2380:48"/>
vulgar wrongs, as a Lion at the barking of Curres: and who so truly noble as he that can doe ill and will not? You'l confesse then 'tis Princely to disdaine a wrong; and is that all? No, forgivenesse saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> is a valiant kind of revenge: and none are so frequent in pardoning as the couragious. He that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly valiant, stirs not till he must needs, and then to purpose: who more valiant than <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua?</hi> and he held it the noblest victory to overcome evill with good: for the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> tooke not so much paines in comming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, as he in going to deliver them. And <hi>Cicero</hi> more commends <hi>Caesar</hi> for overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his owne courage in pardoning <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> than for the great victories hee had against his other enemies. Yea, a dominion over ones selfe, is greater than the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory of <hi>Turkie.</hi> And indeed, for a man to overcome an enemy, and be overcome by his owne passions, is to conquer a petty Village with the losse of a large City. Yea, if the price or honour of the conquest is rated by the difficulty; then to suppresse anger in thy selfe, is to conquer with <hi>Hercules</hi> one of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; To tame all passions is to leade <hi>Cerberus</hi> in chaines: and to indure afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions strongly and patiently, is with

                  <hi>Atlas,</hi> to beare the whole world on thy shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as saith the Poet. Every Beast and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine can kill: it is true prowes and honour to give life, and preserve it. Yea, a Beast being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>narl'd at by a Cur, will passe by as scorning to take notice thereof. I, but is it wisdome so to doe? Yes, none more wise than <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> and he is of opinion; <hi>That it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a man to passe by an offence, Pro.</hi> 19.11. We fooles thinke it ignominy and cowardise to put up the lye without a stab; a wrong without a challenge: but <hi>Salomon,</hi> to whose wisdome all wise men will subscribe, was of another judgement. And <hi>Pittacus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher holds, That pardon is better than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, inasmuch as the one is proper to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the other to a cruell Beast. How <hi>Socrates</hi> whom the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> pronounced the wisest man alive, and all the rest of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers approved of it, both by judgement and practice; We shall have occasion to relate in the reasons ensuing. No truer note of a wise man than this; he so loves as if he were to bee an enemy, and so hates as if he were to love againe; as with fire, the light stuffe and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish kindles sooner than the solid and more compact; se anger doth sooner inflame a foole than a man composed in his resolutions. This
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2380:49"/>
the Holy Ghost witnesseth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Bee not thou of a hasty spirit to be angry: for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger resteth in the bosome of fooles.</hi> Some have no patience to beare bitter scoffes: their noses are too tender to indure this strong and bitter Wormewood of the braine. Others againe like tyled houses, can admit a falling sparke unwarmed; it may be coales of Juniper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of burning. Now what makes the difference? the one hath a good head-peece and is more solid, the other are covered with such light drie straw that with the least touch they will kindle and flame about your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled eares: and when the house is on fire, it's no disputing with how small a matter it came. I confesse I finde some wise men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely passionate by nature, as there is no generall rule but admits of some exception<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: and these as they are more taken with a joy, so they taste a discontent more heavily. And others againe none of the wisest, who are free from being affected: and as they never joy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, so they never sorrow inordinately but have together lesse mirth and lesse mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, like patient Gamesters winning and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing are all one. But for the most part it is otherwise. Yea, impatience is the Cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to frenzie. How oft have we heard men
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2380:50"/>
that have beene displeased with others teare the name of their Maker in peeces?</p>
               <p>And lastly, this of all others is the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Christian like revenge, witnesse our Saviour Christ, who even then triumphed over his enemies, when most they seemed to triumph over him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. And the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs who are said by the Holy Ghost to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the great Dragon, that old Serpent cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Devill and Sathan, in that they loved not their lives unto the death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.11. And holy <hi>David,</hi> who when he had <hi>Saul</hi> at his mercy, instead of cutting off his head, as his servants perswaded him, only cut off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>p of his Garment, and after, thought that too much also. And at another time when the Lord had closed him into his hands, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him asleep in the Fort, instead of taking away his life, as <hi>Abishai</hi> councelled him, he tooke away his Speare, and instead of taking away his blood from his heart, he takes a pot of water from his head. That this kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for a man to finde his enemy at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and let him depart free, is generous and noble, beyond the capacity of an ordinary man; you may heare <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe confesse, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. to 23. Againe, when the King of <hi>Syria</hi> sent a mighty. Host to take <hi>Elisha,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:2380:50"/>
and the Lord had smote them all with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and shut them into <hi>Samaria,</hi> what doth the Prophet? Slay them? no. Indeed the King of Israel would faine have had it so, his fingers itcht to be doing: but <hi>Elisha</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bread and water to be set before them, that they might eat and drink, and go to their Master, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.22.</p>
               <p>So we see the cudgell is not of use, when the Beast but only barkes: nay, tell me, how wouldst thou endure wounds for thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that canst not indure words for him? if when a man reviles thee thou art impatient, how wouldst thou afford thy ashes to <hi>Christ,</hi> and write patience with thine owne blood.</p>

And at another time being counselled either to banish or put to death one who had slandered him; hee would doe neither of both, saying, It was not a sufficient cause to condemne him, and for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, it was better not to let him stir out of <hi>Macedonia</hi> where all men knew that hee lyed, thon to send him among strangers, who

not knowing him, might admit his slanders for truth. And this made <hi>Chrysippus</hi> when one complained to him that his friend had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him privately, Answer: Ah, but chide him not, for then he will doe as much in publike. Neglect will sooner kill an injurie than revenge. These tongue-Squibs or crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the braine will dye alone if we revive them not: the best way to have them forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by others, is first to forget them our selves. Yea, to contemne an enemie, is better than either to feare him or answer him. When the Passenger gallops by, as if his feare made him speedy, the Cur followes him with open mouth and swiftnesse; let him turne to the brawling Cur and he will be more fierce; but let him ride by in a confident neglect, and the Dog will never stir at him, or at least wil soon give over and be quiet.

It is said of <hi>Aristides</hi> when he perceived the open scandall which was like to arise by reason of the contention sprung up betweene him and <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him mildely after this manner; Sir, we both are no meane men in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; our dissention will prove no small offence unto others, nor disparagement to our selves; wherefore good <hi>Themistocles</hi> let us be at one againe; and if we will needs strive, let us strive who shall excell other in vertue and love. And wee reade of <hi>Euclides,</hi> that when his Brother (in a variance betweene them) said, I would I might dye if I be not revenged of thee; he answered againe, nay let me dye for it, if I perswade thee not otherwise before I have done: by which one word he presently so wonne his brothers heart, that he changed his minde, and they parted friends. And this was <hi>Davids</hi> way of overcomming, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. He whose Harp had wont to quiet <hi>Sauls</hi> frenzie, now by his kindnesse doth calme his fury, so that now he sheds teares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of blood: here was a victory gotten and no blow stricken.

What did he loose by it, or had he cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent himselfe? No: he did thereby so prevent succeeding quarrels, that as the Text saith, The bands of <hi>Aram</hi> came no more into the Land of <hi>Israel</hi>; so every wise Christian will doe good to them that doe hurt to him; yea, blesse and pray for them that curse him, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our adviseth: neither is he a foole in it, for if grace comes (and nothing will procure it soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than prayers and good examples) though before they were evill enemies; now they shall neither be evill nor enemies. It was a witty answer of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who replied when one askt him, why he tooke such a mans bitter railing so patiently; It is enough for one to be angry at a time. For if a wise man contend with a foolish man, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> whether he be angry or laugh, there is no rest, <hi>Pro,</hi> 29.9. Whereas gentle speech appeaseth wrath, and patience bridleth the secret pratlings of mockers, and blunteth the points of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.

When the stone and the steele meets, the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue ingendred from thence is fire: whereas the Sword of anger being strucke upon the soft pillow of a mild spirit, is broken.

A man that studies revenge keepes his owne wounds greene and open, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would heale and do well. Anger to the soule is like a coale on the flesh or garment; cast it off suddenly it doth little harme, but let it lye, it frets deepe. Wherefore saith one, their malice shall sooner cease than my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed patience. A small injury shall go as it comes, a great injury may dine or sup with me, but none at all shall lodge with me; for why should I vex my selfe because another hath vexed me? That were to imitate the foole that would not come out of the pound, saying, they had put him in by Law, and he would come out againe by Law: or <hi>Ahab,</hi> who because he could not have his will on <hi>Naboth,</hi> would be revenged on himselfe.

We cannot communicate in the Sacrament, but wee make our selves guilty of Christs bloud, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.24. We cannot be good hearers of the word, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.21. and that it maketh a man captive to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2380:61"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.26, 27. and many the like: <hi>If ye forgive men their trespasses</hi> (saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>your heavenly Father will also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you; but if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses, Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. So he that will not be in charity shall never be in Heaven. And why should I doe my selfe a shrewd turne, because another would? Yea, when we pray to <hi>God</hi> to forgive us our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, as we also forgive them that trespasse against us, and doe not resolve to forgive our brethren; wee doe in effect say: Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us, for we will be condemned: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that doth good to his enemie, even in that act doth better to himselfe. It is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sacrifice to God, and well pleasing to him to do good against evill, and to succour our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enemy in his necessity. But we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance heape coles of fire upon the others head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. though we must not doe it with an intent to make his reckoning more, but our reckoning lesse?</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Blessed is the man,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iames, that indureth temptation</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> with patience) <hi>for when hee is tryed, hee shall receive the Crowne of life, Iames</hi> 1.12. And this made <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2380:61"/>
joyfull, esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For saith the Text, he had respect unto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. And well it might; for whereas the highest degree of suffering is not worthy of the least and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree of this glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. S. <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth, <hi>that our light affliction which is but for a moment</hi> (if it be borne with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) <hi>causeth unto us a far most excellent and eternall weight of glory; while we looke not</hi> on the <hi>things that are seene, but on the things which are not seene,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. Where note the incomparablenesse and infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the work and the wages, light affliction receiving a weight of glory, and momentany afflictions eternall glory; answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the reward of the wicked, whose empty delights live and dye in a moment; but their insufferable punishment is interminable and endlesse: their pleasure is short, their paine everlasting; our paine is short, our joy eternall. What will not men undergoe, so their pay may be answerable? The old expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Souldier feares not the raine and stormes above him, nor the numbers falling before him, nor the troupes of enemies against him, nor the shot of thundring Ordnance
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2380:62"/>
about him, but lookes to the honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promised him. When <hi>Philip</hi> asked <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> if he did not feare to lose his head, he answered, No: for (quoth he) if I dye, the <hi>Athenians</hi> will give me a life immortall; meaning, he should be statued in the treasury of eternall fame: if the immortality (as they thought) of their names, was such a strong reason to perswade them to patience, and all kinde of worthinesse; what should the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the soule be to us? Alas, vertue were a poore thing, if fame only should be all the Garland that did crowne her: but the Christian knowes, that if every paine he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were a death, and every crosse an hell, he shall have amends enough. Why, said <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> on his death bed, we are happy in this, we serve a good Master, that will not suffer us to be losers. Which made the Martyrs such Lambes in suffering, that their persecutors were more weary with striking, than they with suffering. And many of them as willing to dye as dine. No matter (quoth one of them) what I suffer on earth, so I may be crowned in heaven. I care not, quoth another, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth of this fraile Barke my flesh, so I have the passenger, my soule, safely conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:2380:62"/>
                     <l>If at night thou grant me <hi>Lazarus</hi> boone,</l>
                     <l>Let <hi>Dives</hi> dogs lick all my sores at noone.</l>
                  </q>
And a valiant Souldier going about a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an atchievement; my comfort is, though I lose my life for Christs sake, yet I shall not lose my labour, yea, I cannot indure enough to come to Heaven. Neither doe they think that God is bound to reward them any way for their sufferings; no, if he accepts me when I have given my body to be burned (saith the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) I may account it a mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus hope refresheth a Christian, as much as misery depresseth him; it makes him defie all that men or devils can do, saying, take away my goods, my good name, my friends, my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, my life, and what else thou canst ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; yet I am well enough, so long as thou canst not take away the reward of all, which is an hundred fold more even in this world, and in the world to come life everlasting, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.29, 30.</p>
               <p>Now if this be so, how should we not with a great deale of comfort and security, passe through a sea of troubles, that we may come to that haven of eternall rest? How should we not cheare up one another, as <hi>Iewell</hi> did his friends in banishment, saying, This wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2380:63"/>
stay the tyde, as a fish left upon the fands. <hi>Ob.</hi> I but in the meane time my sufferings are intolerable, saith the fainting soule. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: <hi>Sol.</hi> It is no victory to conquer an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and weake crosse; these maine evils have crownes answerable to their difficulty, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. No low attempt a star-like glory brings; but so long as the hardnesse of the victory shal increase the glory of the triumph, indure it patiently, cheerefully.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, as patience in suffering brings an eternall reward with it in Heaven, so it procureth a reward here also: suffer him to curse, saith <hi>David</hi> touching <hi>Shemei,</hi> (here was patience for a King to suffer his impotent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, even in the heat of bloud and midst of war to speak swords, and cast stones at his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and that with a purpose to increase the rebellion, and strengthen the adverse part) but marke his reason: <hi>It may be the Lord will looke upon mine affliction, and do me good</hi>: Why? <hi>even for his cursing this day,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12. And well might he expect it, for he knew this was Gods manner of dealing: as when he turned <hi>Balaams</hi> curse into a blessing upon the children of <hi>Israel, Num.</hi> 23. And their malice who sold <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Indeed these <hi>Shem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is</hi> and <hi>Balaams</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:2380:63"/>
whose hearts and tongues are so ready to curse and raile upon the people of God, are not seldome the very meanes to procure a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary blessing unto them; so that if there were no offence to God in it, nor hurt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we might wish and call for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, cruelty, and curses, for so many curses, so many blessings.</p>
               <p>I could adde many examples to the former, as how the malice of <hi>Haman</hi> turned to the good of the <hi>Iewes</hi>: the malice of <hi>Achitophel</hi> to the good of <hi>David,</hi> when his counsell was turned by God into foolishnesse: the malice of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to him that was borne blind, when <hi>Christ</hi> upon their casting him out of the Synagogue, admitted him into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.34. The malice of <hi>Herod</hi> to the Babes, whom he could never have pleasured so much with his kindnesse, as he did with his cruelty; for where his imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ety did abound, there Christs pittie did super-abound, translating them from their earthly mothers armes in this valley of teares, unto their heavenly Fathers bosome in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. But more pertinent to the matter in hand is that of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> when they murmured against him, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. where it is evident that God had
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2380:64"/>
never so much magnified him to them, but for their envie. And that of the <hi>Arians</hi> to <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> when they put out one of his eyes for withstanding their Heresie: whom <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Emperour, even for that very cause, had in such reverence and estimation, that hee would often send for him to his Court, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly imbracing him, and greedily kissing the eye which had lost his owne sight, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that of the Catholike Doctrine: so that we cannot devise to pleasure Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants so much, as by despighting them.</p>
               <p>And thus you see how patient suffering is rewarded both here and hereafter, according to that asseveration of our Saviour, <hi>Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or suffered any thing for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive an hundred fold, now at this present, and in the world to come eternall life, Marke</hi> 10.29, 30. But admit patience should neither be rewarded here nor hereafter; yet it is a sufficient reward to it selfe: for hope and patience are two soveraigne and universall remedies for all diseases. Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a counterpoison or antipoison for all griefe. It is like the Tree which <hi>Moses</hi> cast into the waters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. for as that Tree made the waters sweet, so patience sweete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2380:64"/>
affliction; it is as Larde to the leane meat of adversity. The taste of goods or evils doth greatly depend on the opinion wee have of them, and contentation, like an old mans spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, makes those characters easie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar that otherwise would puzzle him shrewdly. Afflictions are as we use them; there is nothing grievous if the thought make it not so: even paine it selfe (saith the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>) is in our power if not to be disanulled, yet at least to be diminish'd through patience: Patience is like a golden shield in the hand, to breake the stroke of every crosse, and save the heart though the body suffer. <hi>A sound spirit,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, will beare his infirmity, Prov.</hi> 18.14. Patience to the soule is as the lid to the eye; for as the lid being shut, when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires, saves it exceedingly; so patience intervening betweene the soule and that which it suffers, saves the heart whole, and cheeres the body againe. And therefore, if you marke it, when you can passe by an offence, and take it patiently and quietly, you have a kinde of peace and joy in your heart, as if you had gotten a victory, and the more your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, still the lesse your paine is; for as a light burthen at the armes end weigheth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier by much than a burden of troble weight,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2380:65"/>
if it be borne on the shoulders which are made to beare; so if a man set patience to beare his crosse, the weight is nothing to what it would be if that were wanting; wherefore, saith one, being unable to direct events, I governe my selfe, and if they apply not themselves to me, I apply my selfe to them; if I cannot fling what I would, yet I will somewhat mend it, by playing the cast as well as I can.</p>
               <p>O that all implacable persons who double their sufferings through long study of revenge would learne this lesson! then would they find that patience can no lesse mitigate evils, than impatience exasperates them. A profitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription indeed (may some say) but of an hard execution! hard indeed to the capacity of a carnall conceipt, yea, altogether impossible to flesh and bloud. If thou art only beholding to nature, and hast nought but what thou broughtest into the world with thee, well mayest thou envie at it, but thou canst never imitate it; for to speake the truth, faith and patience are two miracles in a Christian. <hi>Cassianus</hi> reporteth, that when a Martyr was tormented by the Infidels, and asked by way of reproach what miracle his CHRIST had done; he answered, he hath done what you now behold, inabled me so to beare your
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2380:65"/>
contumelies, and undergoe all these tortures so patiently, that I am not once moved, and is not this a miracle worthy your taking notice of? Indeed what have we by our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth, which is not miraculous in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of our natural condition? It was no lesse than a miracle for <hi>Zacheus,</hi> a man both rich and covetous, to give halfe his goods to the poore, and make restitution with the residue, and all this in his health. It was a great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that <hi>Ioseph,</hi> in the armes of his Mistrisse should not burne with lust. It is a great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for a man to forsake Houses and Lands, and all that a man hath, yea, to hate Father and Mother, and Wife and children, and his owne life to be Christs Disciple. It is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to rejoyce in tribulation and smile death in the face. It is a great miracle that of fierce and cruell Wolves, Beares, Lions, we should bee transformed into meeke Lambes, and harmelesse Doves: and all this by the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of preaching Christ crucified. Indeed they were no miracles, if Nature could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the like effects: but shee must not looke to stand in competition with grace. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion, could doe as much as the proudest naturall man of you all; his words are, <hi>If any other man
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2380:66"/>

Yet when he speaketh of patience and rejoycing in tribulation, he sheweth, That it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the love of God was shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost which was given unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. of himselfe he could doe nothing, though he were <hi>able to do all things through Christ which strengthened him, Phil.</hi> 4.13. Hast thou then a desire after this invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible patience? seeke first to have the love of God shed abroad in thy heart by the Holy Ghost. Wouldst thou have the love of God? Ask it of him by prayer; who saith, if any of you lacke in this kinde, let him <hi>Aske of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, and it shall be given him, Iames</hi> 1.5.

And when it was told him another time, that such an one spake evill of him, hee replyed; alas the man hath not as yet learned to speake well; but I have learned to contemne what he speakes.

                  <hi>Diogenes</hi> being told that many despised him, answered; It is the wise mans portion to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of fooles. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> being told that a simple fellow railed on him, was not once moved, but said, let him beate me also being absent, I care not; we may well suffer their words, while God doth deliver us out of their hands: for if we go on in a silent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, say our eares be beaten, yet our hearts shall be free.

For if the whole world doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne a generous Christian, he will even contemne that contempt, and not thinke it worthy a roome in his very thoughts, that common receptacle or place of entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And indeed, he that lets loose his anger upon every occasion, is like him that lets go his Hawke upon every bayte. Besides, we may apprehend it a wrong, when it is none, if we take not heed: for those things passe many times for wrongs in our thoughts, which were never meant so by the heart of him that speaketh.

Nay,

suppose they should turne their words into blowes, and (instead of using their tongues) take up their swords and kill us, they shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasure than hurt us.

For as there is no such griefe to a Iester or Iugler, as when he doth see that with all his jests, tricks, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, he cannot move mirth, nor change the countenances of them that see and heare him; so there can be no greater vexation to a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and malitious enemy, then to see thee no whit grieved nor moved at his malice against thee; but that thou dost so beare his injuries, as if they were none at all. Yea, he which makes the triall, shall finde that his enemy is more vexed with his silence, than if he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne like for like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was wont to take this revenge of his enemies; amongst whom there was one, who perceiving that by injuring and reviling of him he could not move him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, whereby he might have more scope
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2380:71"/>
to raile; went and made away with himselfe, as <hi>Brusonius</hi> reports. And <hi>Mountaine</hi> tels us of a Citizen that having a Scould to his Wife, would play on his Drum when shee brawled, and rather seeme to be pleased with it, than angry; and this for the present did so mad her, that she was more vexed with her selfe, than with him: but when she saw how it succeeded, and that this would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, in the end it made her quite leave off the same, and prove a loving wife, that so she might overcome him with kindnesse, and win him to her bow, by bending as much the other way; that so, like a prudent Wife, she might command her Husband by obeying. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever makes the triall, shall finde, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian patience, and magnanimous contempt, will in time either draine the gall out of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spirits, or make it more overflow to their owne disgrace: so that the best answer is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther silence, or laughter; or if neither of these will do, a Cudgell. The best answer to words of scorne and petulancy, saith learned <hi>Hooker,</hi> is <hi>Isaac's</hi> Apologie to his brother <hi>Ismael,</hi> the Apologie which patience and silence make, (no Apologie) and we have our Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident for it: for when false witnesses rose up and accused him falsely before the Priests,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2380:71"/>
Scribes, and Elders, it is said, that <hi>Iesus held his peace</hi>: that infinite wisdome knew well, how little satisfaction there would be in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, where the Sentence was determined, where the Asker is unworthy, the Question captious, words bootlesse, the best answer is silence. Let our Answer then to their Reasons be, No; to their scoffes nothing. And yet when the slanders which light on our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons rebound to the discredit of our profession, it behoveth us not to be silent in answering truly, when as our adversaries are eloquent in objecting falsely; an indignity which only toucheth our private persons, may be dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; as <hi>Austine</hi> replied to <hi>Petillian; Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumus esse in his copiosi pariter, sed nolumus esse pariter vani.</hi> But in the other case, the retorting of a poisoned weapon into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries owne breast, is laudable.</p>
               <p>It is the weaknesse of some good natures (the more is the pitty) to grieve and to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at wrongs received, and thereby to give advantage to an enemy. But what would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice rather have, then the vexation of them whom it persecutes? We cannot better please an adversary, than by hurting our selves: and this is no other than to humour envie, to serve the turne of those that maligne us, and to

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Because it were a great disparagement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the godly, if they should have the good word and approbation of wicked men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, because it is the greatest praise unto the godly, to be dispraised of the wicked.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2380:72"/>
These two reasons being neere of kinne, in speaking of them I will cast both into the similitude of a Y, which is joyned together at one end, brancht in the middle. And first to joyne them both together.</p>
               <p>The condemnation and approbation of wicked men, is equally profitable and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to good men: for every word they speake of the conscionable, is a slander, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evill: whether in praise or dispraise, his very name is defiled by comming into their mouthes: or if this do not hold in all cases, yet (as a Reverend Divine saith) it is a praise to the godly, to be dispraised of the wicked; and a dispraise to be praised of them; their dispraise is a mans honour, their praise his dishonour: so that when deboysed persons speake ill of a man, especially their Minister, the worse the better; for to be well spoken of by the vicious, and evill by the vertuous; to have the praise of the good, and the dispraise of the bad, is all one in effect, as <hi>Salomon</hi> sheweth; <hi>They that forsake the Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>praise the wicked; but they that keepe the Law, set themselves against them, Proverbs</hi> 28.4.</p>
               <p>Thus much of both Reasons joyntly, now of each severally; and First, That it is a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2380:73"/>
to a godly man to be well spoken of by the wicked.</p>
               <p>When it was told <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> that such an one who was a vitious person, spake good words of him, he answered, <hi>What evill have I done, that this man speakes well of me?</hi> To be praised of evill men (saith <hi>Bion</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher) is as evill, as to be praised for evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Out of which consideration our Saviour Christ rejected the evill spirits testimony, which though it were truth, yet he would not suffer the Devill to say, <hi>Thou art the Christ the Sonne of God,</hi> or <hi>that Holy One,</hi> but rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him sharpely, and injoyned him to hold his peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.35. No, he would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Devils at another time to say, That they knew him, Vers. 41. And good reason, for he knew that the Devils commendations would prove the greatest slander of all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would S. <hi>Paul</hi> suffer that maide which had a spirit of Divination, to say, he was <hi>the Servant of the most high God,</hi> which shewed them the way of salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.17, 18. well knowing that Sathan did it to this end, that by his testimony and approbation, hee might cause them (which formerly beleeved his doctrine) to suspect him for an Impostor and Deceiver, and that he did his miracles by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2380:73"/>
the helpe of some Familiar spirit. And indeed, if the good report of wicked men, who are set on worke by Sathan, did not derogate from the godly, or from the glory of God, Sathan should bee divided against himselfe; and, <hi>if Sathan be divided against himselfe,</hi> saith ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if we enjoy any wicked mans love, and have his good word, we may justly suspect our selves are faulty in one kinde or other; for 'tis sure he could not doe so, except he saw something in us like himselfe. If eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing were unlike him, how is it possible he should love us? Difference breeds disunion, and sweet congruity is the Mother of love. This made <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when a Rakeshame told him, he would rather be hanged by the neck, than be so hated of all men as he was, reply, And I would bee hanged by the neck, ere I would be beloved of all, as thou art; And <hi>Phocion,</hi> to ask, when the people praised him, what evill have I done? It was a just doubt in him, and not an unjust in any that are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous like him, which occasioned one to say; their hatred I feare not, neither doe I regard their good will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:2380:74"/>Secondly, a wicked mans tongue is so far from being a slander, that it makes for our credit, to be evill spoken of by them. <hi>To be evill spok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n of by wicked men,</hi> saith <hi>Terence, is a glorious and laubable thing</hi>; and another, <hi>It is no small credit with the vile, to have a vile estimation.</hi> As a wicked mans glory is his shame; so the godly mans shame (for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good) is his glory: and to be evill spoken of for well-doing, is peculiar to good men, as <hi>Alexander</hi> used to speake of Kings. Yea, saith <hi>Epictetus, It is the highest degree of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a man to heare evill when he doth well.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> is of his judgment, which makes him say, <hi>If mine adversary should write a booke against me, would I not take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a Crowne unto me? Yes, I would, &amp;c. Iob</hi> 31, 35, 36, 37. And who having the use of Reason (especially sanctified) will not conclude), that Religion and holinesse must needs be an excellent thing, because it hath such enemies as wicked men and wicked spirits?

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2380:74"/>
me</hi>: for to be disliked of evill men, is to be praised for goodnesse. <hi>O happy art thou,</hi> saith <hi>Picus Mirandula, who livest well amongst the bad; for thou shalt either win them, or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them, or exasperate them. If thou win them, thou shalt save their soules, and adde to thy owne glory; If thou silence them, thou shalt diminish of their torment, and prevent the contagion of their sin; If thou exasperate them thereby to hate and traduce thee for thy goodnesse, then most happy, for thou shalt not onely bee rewarded according to the good which thou do'st, but much more according to the evill which thou sufferest.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter; If any man suffer as a Christian</hi> (that is, for righteousnesse sake) <hi>let him not be ashamed; but let him glorifie God in this behalfe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16. The reason is given by Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> with whom this speech was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; <hi>They that backbite me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do against their wills increase my honour, both with God and good men.</hi> Alas, the durty feet of such Adversaries, the more they tread and rub, the more lustre they give the figure graven in gold; their causeles aspersions do but rub our glory the brighter. And what else did <hi>Iudas,</hi> touching <hi>Mary,</hi> when he depraved her in our <hi>Saviours</hi> presence, for pouring that pretious

oyntment on his feet? <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. which was the only cause that in remembrance of her it shold be spoken to her praise, <hi>whersoever the Gospell shold be preached throughout the whole world, Mar.</hi> 14.9. O what a glorious renowne did the Traytors reproach occasion her? Now to make some use of this point: If the language of wicked men must be read like <hi>Hebrew,</hi> backward, and that all good men doe so for the most part, it being a sure rule, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever presently gives credit to accusations, is either wicked himselfe, or very childish in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; then let us count their slanders, scoffes and reproaches the most noble and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable badges and ensignes of honor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency that can be: And in case we are told that any such person doth raile on us, let our answer be, he is not esteemed, nor his words credited of the meanest believer which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands any thing of Satans wiles; And thus we see, that a man of a good life needeth not feare any who hath an evill tongue, but rather rejoyce therein; for he shall be praised of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, who hath, by renouncing the world, eschewed the prayses of wicked men on earth.</p>

               <p n="4">4 IN the fourth place, one reason why we beare injuries so patiently, is, That our enemies and others may learne and bee wonne by our example, which oft prevailes more than precept: As how many Infidels were wonne to the Christian Faith, by seeing Christians indure the flames so patiently? Wherefore <hi>in all things</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi>) <hi>shew thy selfe an example of good workes, Tit.</hi> 2.7. Vnder the generall of good workes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Patience, as one maine speciall. <hi>The servant of the Lord must not strive</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>but must be gentle towards all men, suffering the evill men patiently, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them with meeknesse that are contrary minded, proving if God at any time will give the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repentance, that they may know the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>Aristippus</hi> being demanded, why he tooke so patiently <hi>Dionysius</hi> spitting
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2380:76"/>
in his face, answered, <hi>the Fishermen to take a little Gudgion, doe abide to be imbrued with slime and salt water; And should not I, a Philosopher, suffer my selfe to be sprinkled with a little spittle, for the taking of a great Whale?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A word seasonably given, after we have received an injury, like a Rudder sometimes steares a man quite into another course. The nature of many men is forward to accept of peace, if it be offered them, and negligent to sue for it otherwise; They can spend secret wishes upon that which shall cost them no endeavour; unlesse their enemy yeelds first, they are resolved to stand out. But if once their desire and expectation be answered, the least reflection of this warmth makes them yeelding and plyable; We need not a more pregnant example then the Levites father in Law; I do not see him make any meanes for reconciliation; but when remission came home to his doore, no man could entertaine it more thankfully, seeing such a singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of patience, and good condition in his Son. When Iron meets with Iron, there is a harsh and stubborne jar; but let wooll meet that ruffer mettle, this yeelding turnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance into imbracing; Yea a man shall be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2380:76"/>
in more estimation with his enemy (if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious) having vanquisht him this way, then if he had never been his enemy at all. Thy greatest enemy shall, if he have any sparke of grace, confesse ingeniously to thee, (as <hi>Saul</hi> once to <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Thou art more righteous than I, for thou hast rendred me good, and I have rendred thee evill.</hi> And such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is like that which <hi>Euagrius</hi> recordeth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> namely; That they got such a victory over <hi>Chosroes,</hi> one of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, that this <hi>Chosroes</hi> made a Law; That never after any Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> should move war against the <hi>Romans.</hi> Actions salved up with a freee forgivenesse, are as not done: Yea, as a bone once broken, is stronger after well setting; so is love after such a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; for happily it may (and not a little) further Gods glory, and make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan a looser: as thus, let us shake off their slanders, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Viper; and these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which now conceive so basely of Gods people, will change their mindes, and say we are petty gods; Yea, will they say, surely theirs is a good, and holy, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Religion, that thus changes and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes them into new Creatures. The hope
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2380:77"/>
whereof should make us thinke no indeavour too much. For if <hi>Zopyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> was content (and that voluntarily) to sustaine the cutting off his nose, eares, and lips, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the enterprize of his Lord <hi>Darius</hi> against proud <hi>Babylon</hi>; what should a Christian be willing to suffer, that the Lord of Heaven and Earths cause may be furthered against proud <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and all the powers of darknesse? But suppose thy patient yeelding produceth no such effect, as may answer these or the like hopes, yet have patience still, and that for two reasons.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Because he will not take Gods Office out of his hand, who saith, avenge not your selves, but give place unto wrath, <hi>for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is mine, and I will repay it, Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of our Saviour Christ, saith, <hi>When hee was reviled, hee reviled not againe; when hee suffered, hee threatned not, but committed it to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.23. And the holy Prophet
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2380:78"/>
of himselfe, <hi>I returne not reviling for revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for on thee, O Lord, do I wait, thou wilt heare me, my Lord, my God</hi>; meaning, if I call to thee for a just revenge, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.13, 14, 15. If the Lord see it meet that our wrongs should be revenged instantly, he will do it himselfe; as he revenged the <hi>Israelites</hi> upon the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>: and so that all standers by shall see their fault, in their punishment, with admiration. <hi>Now I know,</hi> saith <hi>Iethro, that the Lord is greater than all the gods; for as they have dealt proudly with them, so are they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, Exod.</hi> 18.11. And as once he reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Davids</hi> cause upon <hi>Nabal,</hi> For <hi>about ten dayes after the Lord smote Nabal that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> saith the Text: and it followes, when <hi>David</hi> heard that <hi>Nabal</hi> was dead, <hi>he said, Blessed bee the Lord, that hath judged the cause of my rebuke at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evill; for the Lord hath recompenced the wickednesse of Nabal upon his owne head,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.38, 39. And that infinite wrong of railing <hi>Shimei,</hi> being left to the Lord, he did revenge it; in giving <hi>Shimei</hi> up to such a stupidity, that he ran him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wilfully upon his owne deserved and shamefull death. And if the Lord thus revenge the cause of <hi>Davids</hi> personall wrong, much
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2380:78"/>
more will he revenge his owne cause: for in this case I may say to every childe of God which suffereth for Religion sake, as <hi>Iahaziel</hi> by the Spirit of God said unto all <hi>Iudah,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and King <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat; The battell is not yours, but Gods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall not need to fight in this battell, stand still, move not, and behold the salvation of the Lord towards you,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.15, 17. Yea, it stands upon Christs honour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine those that are in his worke. I but, saith the weake Christian, I am so wronged, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and slandered, that it would make a man speake, like <hi>Aeagles</hi> that famous wrestler, that never spake before in his life. Answer, There is no such necessity. For first: Who ever was, that was not slandered? Secondly: let him speake evill of thee, yet others shall not beleeve him; or if the evill and ignorant do; yet report from wise and good men shall speake thee vertuous. Yea, Thirdly: though of some the slanderer be beleeved for a while, yet at last thy actions will out-weigh his words; and the disgrace shall rest with the intender of the ill. The constancy of a mans good behaviour vindicates him from ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: how ever, revenge not thy selfe in any case: for by revenging thine owne quarrell,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2380:79"/>
thou makest thy selfe, both the Iudge, the Witnesse, the Accuser, and the Executioner. If thou wilt see what God hath done, and what he can and will do, if there be like need: heare what <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> write of <hi>Theodosius</hi> in his warres against <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this good Christian Emperour saw the huge multitude that was comming against him, and that in the sight of man there was apparent overthrow at hand, he gets him up into a place eminent, and in the sight of all the Army fals downe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate upon the Earth, beseeching GOD, if ever hee would looke upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>infull creature, to helpe him at this time of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test need: whereupon there arose sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a mighty winde, that it blew the Darts of the enemies back upon themselves, in such a wonderderfull manner, that <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> with all his Host was cleane discomfited, and seeing the power of Christ so fight for his people, was forced in effect to cry out, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did, <hi>God is in the cloud, and he fighteth for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God either preventeth our enemies, as here he did; or delivereth his servants out of persecution, as he did <hi>Peter</hi>; or else if hee
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2380:79"/>
crowneth them with Martyrdome, as he did <hi>Stephen</hi>; hee will in his Kingdome of Glory give them instead of this bitter a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inheritance; <hi>pro veritate morientes, cum veritate viventes.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2380:80"/>
guilty of the breach of every Commandement <hi>Iames</hi> 2.10, 11. We know the frantick man, though he be sober eleaven moneths of the yeare, yet if he rage one, he cannot avoide the imputation of madnesse: If so, let our revenge be like that of <hi>Elisha's</hi> to the <hi>Amorites,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of smiting them, set bread and water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Or like that of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, when one had spent the day in railing upon him at his owne dore, lest he should go home in the dark, caused his man to light him with a Torch. And to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is <hi>Ammonite</hi>-like, to intreat those Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours ill, which are sent in kindnesse and love: for these afflictions are Gods Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and to handle them ruffely, yea, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine or grudge against them, is to intreat them evill. And certainly, as <hi>David</hi> tooke it not well when the <hi>Ammonites</hi> ill intreated his Embassadours; so God will not take the like well from thee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. But secondly, as the Law of God binds us to this, so doth the Law of Nature: <hi>Whatsoever you would that men should doe unto you, even so doe you unto them, Mat.</hi> 7.12. Our Saviour doth not say, doe unto others, as others do unto you; but as you would have others doe unto you. Now if we have wronged any man, we desire

that hee should forgive us, and therefore we must forgive him, <hi>Lex Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even as they did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, so have I done unto them, is but an ill plea. For the Law of God, and the Law of Nature forbids it; and doth not the Law of Nations also? Yes, throughout the whole world, either they have no Law, or else a Law to prohibit men from revenging themselves.</p>
               <p>Oppression or injury may not be righted by violence, but by Law: the redresse of evill by a person unwarranted, is evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But thou wilt say, the Law doth not provide a just remedy in all cases of injury, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in case of reproach and slander, which is now the Christians chiefe suffering; or if in part it doth, yet he that is just cannot be quit in one Terme or two. Nay, if he have right in a yeare, it is counted quick dispatch; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When wee have suffered some evill, the flesh, our owne wisdome, like the King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.21. will bid us returne evill to the doer; but the Spirit or wisdome of God, like <hi>Elisha,</hi> opposeth, and bids us returne him good, notwithstanding him evill: But the flesh will reply; he is not worthy to be forgiven; I but saith the Spirit, Christ is worthy to be obeyed, who hath commanded thee to forgive him. Now whethers counsell wilt thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? It is not alwayes good to take our own counsell; our owne wit often hunts us into the snares, that above all we would sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n. We oft use meanes of preservation, and they prove destroying ones. Againe, we take cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to ruine us, and they prove meanes of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How many flying from danger have met with death? And on the otherside, found protection even in the very jawes of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, that God alone may have the glory. It fell out to bee part of <hi>Mithridates</hi> misery, that he had made himselfe unpoysonable. All humane wisdome is defective; nor doth the Fooles Bolt ever misse: whatsoever man thinketh to doe, in contrariety is by God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bee an helpe of hastning the end hee hath appointed him. We are governed by a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2380:82"/>
power that we cannot but obey, our mindes are wrought against our mindes to alter us. In briefe; man is oft his owne Traitor, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to undoe himselfe. Wherefore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> take the Spirits and the words direction, Render good for evill, and not like for like, though it be with an unwilling willingnesse: as the Merchant casteth his goods over-board; and the Patient suffers his arme or leg to be cut off; and say with thy Saviour, <hi>Neverthelesse, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet more to induce thee hereunto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in the last place, That to avenge thy selfe is both to lose Gods protection, and to incur his condemnation. We may be said to be out of his protection, when we are out of our way which he hath set us; he hath promised to <hi>give his Angels charge over us, to keepe us in all our wayes, Psal.</hi> 91.11. that is, in the wayes of obedience, or the wayes of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. But this is one of the devils wayes, a way of sin and disobedience, and therefore hath no promise or assurance of protection: yea, if we want his word, in vaine we looke for his aide; weftes and strayes, we know, are properly due to the Lord of the Soyle. And then if in case there shall happen any thing amis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, through thy taking revenge, what
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2380:82"/>
mayest thou not expect to suffer, and in thy suffering what comfort canst thou have? Whereas if God bring us into crosses, he will be with us in those crosses, &amp; at length bring us out of them more refined. You may observe, there is no such Coward, none so valiant as the beleever: without Gods warrant he dares do nothing; with it, any thing. Why, first a calling is a good warrant, and it cannot want danger to goe unsent: sinne is the sting of all troubles; pull out the sting, and deride the malice of the Serpent. Yea, let death happen, it shall not happen amisse; for the assurance of Gods call and protection, when a mans actions are warranted by the Word, will even take away the very feare of death: for death (as a Father well notes) hath nothing terrible, but what our life hath made so. He that hath lived well, is seldome unwilling to dye, life or death is alike welcome unto him; for he knowes, whiles he is here, God will protect him; and when he goes hence, God will receive him. Whereas he that hath lived wickedly, had rather lose any thing, even his soule, than his life: whereby he tels us, though his tongue expresse it not, that he expects a worse estate hereafter. How oft doth guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse make one avoide, what another would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2380:83"/>
wish in this case? Yea, death was much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the vertues of a well-led life, even in the Heathen. <hi>Aristippus,</hi> as I take it, (though I may be mistaken) told the Sailers (that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred why he was not, as well as they, afraid in a storme) that the ods was much; for they feared the torments due to a wicked life, and he expected the reward of a good one. Its a sollid and sweet reason, being rightly applyed. <hi>Vice</hi> drawes death with a horrid looke, with a whip, and flames, and terrors, but so doth not vertue. And thus much to prove that the godly indure reproaches and persecutions pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, because God hath commanded them so to doe.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:2380:83"/>It is a saying of <hi>Seneca, He that is not able to set light by a sottish injury, is no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Philosophy.</hi> And the examples before rehearsed shew, that <hi>Socrates, Plato, Aristip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Aristotle, Diogenes, Epictetus, Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon, Dion of Alexandria, Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Antigonus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caesar,</hi> were indued with rare and admirable patience; whereunto I will adde foure other examples: <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> asking the Embassadours of <hi>Athens</hi> how he might most pleasure them, received this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>It were the greatest pleasure to Athens, that could be, if you would hang your selfe</hi>; yet was not moved a jot, for all his might was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his patience: why? he cared not so much to revenge the evill, as to requite the good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polaemon</hi> was not so much as appalled at the by ting of a Dog that tooke away the brawne or calfe of his leg; nor <hi>Harpalus,</hi> to see two of his sons laid ready drest in a silver Charger, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <item>1 One notable difference betwene the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of a Philosopher and a Christian is, They lacked a pure heart, which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all well doing.</item>
                  <item>2 Whatsoever they did, was either out of pride to purchase fame to themselves, thinking their patient suffering a kinde of merit, or for some other by respect: whereas the childe of God doth it in obedience to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thinkes when he hath done that, he fals far short of performing his duty.</item>

                  <item>4 The one doth it in faith, which only crownes good actions; the other without. The want of which, made all their vertues but <hi>Splendid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>5 The Philosopher, and so all civill and morall men, can forbeare; the Christian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; they pardon their enemies, wee love ours, pray for them, and returne good for evill. And if not, we no whit savour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>For if you love them which love you</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>what thankes shall you have, for even the sinners doe the same?</hi> (such as see not beyond the clouds of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) <hi>But I say unto you which heare, Love your enemies, doe well to them that hate you, Luke</hi> 6.27, 32, 33. shewing, that if wee will ever hope for good our selves, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne good for evill unto others. And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to teach us this lesson, he practised it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, adding example to precept; for when the <hi>Iewes</hi> were crucifying of him, be at the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2380:85"/>
same time (though the torments of his passion were intolerable, incomparable, unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) solliciteth God for their pardon, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. And this likewise is the practise of the Saints, who strive to imitate their Master in all things which he did as man: <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> at the instant while his enemies were stoning of him, kneeled downe and prayed, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge, Acts</hi> 7.60. Where is one thing very remarkable; he stood when he prayed for himselfe, but kneeled when he prayed for his enemies; hereby shewing the greatnesse of their impiety, which easily could not be forgiven, as also the greatnesse of his piety. It were easie to abound in examples of this kinde; how often did <hi>Moses</hi> returne good unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his evill, in praying and prevailing with God for him, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of nine severall plagues, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his cruell oppression? And <hi>David,</hi> what could he have done for <hi>Saul,</hi> that he left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, notwithstanding he so cruelly persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and hunted after his life. But what doe I tell them of these transcendent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? when I never yet heard or read of that Philosopher, which could parallell <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Cooper,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in an act of patient suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know there are some men (or rather two legged Beasts) that esteeme no more of Bookes and Notes, than <hi>Esops</hi> Cocke did of the Pearle hee found; and these accordingly will say, this was nothing in comparison of what they suffer; as when once a Hot spur was perswaded to be patient as <hi>Iob</hi> was, he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What doe you tell me of <hi>Iob? Iob</hi> never had any suits in <hi>Chauncery.</hi> And thus you see in the first place, that Nature hath but a slow foot to follow Religion close at the heeles; that grace and faith transcends reason, as much as reason doth sense; that patience (rightly

so called) is a Prerogative royall, peculiar to the Saints. It is well if Philosophy have so much wisdome, as to stand amazed at it.</item>

Fifthly, That we forgive, as well as forbeare; yea, love, pray for, and returne good to our enemies for their evill: which being so, what hath the hot-spur to say for himselfe? And what will become of him, if he repent not, who can afford no time to argue, but to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute? Yea, what hath the more temperate worldling to say for himselfe, who hath some small peece of reason for his guide? arguing thus, I would rather make shew of my passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than smother them to my cost, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vented and exprest, become more langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and weake; better it is to let its point worke outwardly, than bend it against our selves; and in reason, Tallying of injuries is but justice. To which I answer, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, especially carnall reason, but Religion, which all this while hath beene disputed of, which is Divine and supernaturall; and that teacheth how good must be returned for evill,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2380:86"/>
and that we should rather invite our enemy to do us more wrong, than not to suffer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with patience; as our Saviours words doe imply: <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>they strike thee on the one cheeke, turne to him the other also; If they sue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coate, let him have thy Cloake also, Matth.</hi> 5.39, 40.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the difficulty of the duty, the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming danger and want of faith in carnal men, weakneth the force of the strongest reasons; for no more among Ruffins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here also, if it were as orderly as pertinent, I might take occasion to shew another peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar &amp; proper adjunct belonging to the patience of a Christan, which a Philosopher may soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner envie than imitate; yea, it must put him besides his reason, before hee can conceive it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2380:87"/>
possible, namely, That a Christian rejoyceth in his sufferings: <hi>We rejoyce in tribulation</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>) <hi>knowing that tribulation bringeth forth patience, and patience experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and experience hope, &amp;c.

Yea, S. <hi>Iames</hi> goeth yet further, and saith, <hi>My brethren, count it exceeding joy, when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing that the trying of your faith bringeth forth patience, and let patience have her perfect worke, that ye may be perfect and intire, lacking nothing, Iames</hi> 1.3, 4.

                  <hi>Wilt thou,</hi> saith one, <hi>looke to raigne, and not expect to suffer? Why Christ himselfe went not up to his glory, untill first hee suffered paine: Or wilt thou,</hi> saith S. <hi>Cyprian, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, by seeking present revenge upon thine enemies, when Christ himselfe is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of his enemies?</hi> Do thou beare with others, God beares with thee; is there a too much which thou canst suffer for so patient a Lord? But to go on; wilt thou follow Gods example? Then note, whereas Christ hath in many particulars commanded us to follow his example, yet <hi>in no place,</hi> saith S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, he inferreth we should be like our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, but in doing good to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> And therein resemble wee the whole three Persons in Trinity. God was only in the stil winde, Christ is compared to a Lambe, the Holy Ghost to a Dove. Now if we will resemble these three persons, we must be soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Lambes, Doves; but if on the contrary we be fierce, cruell, and take revenge, so using vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, we resemble rather the Devill, who is called a roaring Lion; and the wicked, who are termed Dogs, Wolves, Tygers, &amp;c. But secondly, they are patient in suffering of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2380:88"/>
that they might imitate the Saints in all ages. They were so, and we are likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to follow their steps, as in all things which are good, so especially in this. <hi>Take my brethren the Prophets,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iames, for an example of suffering adversities, and of long patience, Iames</hi> 5.10. <hi>Brethren,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians, Ye are become followers of the Churches of God which in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea are in Christ Iesus, because ye have also suffered the same things of your owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, even as they have of the Iewes,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.14. And to the <hi>Philippians, Be yee followers of me, Brethren, and look on them which walke so, as ye have us for an example, Phil.</hi> 3.17. And see how he followed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters example; for which amongst us so loves his Benefactors, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> loved his Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors? he would do any thing (even be rased out of the booke of life) to save them that would doe any thing to kill him. Amongst many examples recorded for thy imitation and mine, behold the Patience of <hi>Iob, Iames</hi> 5.11. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 20.17, 18. <hi>Isaac, Chap.</hi> 26.15. <hi>Ioseph, Chap.</hi> 39. <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 38.12. <hi>to</hi> 15. And lastly of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who when the <hi>Iewes</hi> were stoning him to death, kneeled downe, and cried with a loud voice, <hi>Lord, lay
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2380:89"/>
not this sin to their charge, Acts</hi> 7.60. A true Scholler of CHRIST: for first, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for enemies; secondly, for mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that stoned him; thirdly, in hot bloud, at the time when they wronged him most, as being more sorry for their riot, then for his owne ruine. Now what is it that we suffer, being compared with their sufferings? even nothing in a manner: <hi>Ye have not</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrewes) <hi>yet resisted unto bloud: Wee have passed</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>through fire and water</hi>; not fire onely, as the three Children; nor water onely, as the Israelites, but fire and water, all kind of afflictons and adversities. For shame then let us passe through a little tongue-triall without the least answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or repining.</p>
               <p>Now all ye scoffers, behold the patience of the Saints, and stand amazed. That which you (not for want of ignorance) esteemed base, sottish and unworthy, ye see hath 16. sollid Reasons, as so many pillars to support it, and these hewen out of the Rock of Gods word. Ye see the childe of God is above nature, while he seemes below himselfe; the vilest creature knowes how to turne againe; but to command himselfe, not to resist being urged, is more then Heroicall. Here then is matter

worth your emulation, worthy our imitation.</p>
               <p>Againe, behold the reasons why God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers you to deride, hate, and persecute his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are likewise declared to be sixteene in number, and those no lesse weighty; of which three concerne his owne glory; Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene our spirituall and everlasting good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and advantage. Yea, reflect yet further, you seed of the Serpent, and see the Originall, continuance, properties, causes, ends, and what will be the issue of your divellish enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the seed of the Woman?

               <head>CHAP. 32. Rules to bee observed touching thoughts, words, and deeds, when we are wronged.</head>
               <p>I must needs confesse (may some say) you have shewed sixteene solid and substantiall reasons of patience, sufficient to perswade any reasonable creature to imbrace it, at least in affection; but is it therefore in all cases ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary we suffer injuries, without righting of our selves, or being angry.</p>
               <p>No: he that makes himselfe a Sheepe, shall be eaten of the Wolfe. In some cases tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more than unexpedient, they inspire the party with boldnesse, and are as it were pullies to draw on more injuries; beare one wrong, and invite more; put up this abuse, and you shall have your belly full of them. Yea, he that suffers a lesser wrong, many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites a greater, which he shall not be long without. As how doth <hi>Davids</hi> patience draw on the insolence of <hi>Shemei?</hi> Evill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures grow presumptuous upon forbearance. In good natures and dispositions, injury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2380:90"/>
growes weary of it selfe, and dyes in a voluntary remorse; but in those dogged sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, which are onely capable of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints of feare; the silent digestion of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wrong, provokes a second; neither will a Beefe brain fellow be subdued with words. Wherefore mercy hath need to be guided with wisdome, lest it prove cruell to it selfe.</p>
               <p>Neither doth Religion call us to a weake simplicity, but allowes us as much of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent as of the Dove. It is our duty indeed to be simple as Doves, in offending them; but we are no lesse charged to be wise as Serpents, in defending our selves: lawfull remedies have from God both liberty in the use, and blessing in the successe; no man is bound to tender his throat to an unjust stroake. Indeed, when the persecuted Christians complained against their adversaries to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring justice, he answered them as some of our scoffers may doe in the like case, <hi>It is your Masters commandement that you should beare all kinde of injuries with patience.</hi> But what did they answer? It is true, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to beare all kindes of injuries pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, but not in all cases; besides, said they, we may beare them patiently, yet crave the Magistrates ayde for the repairing of our
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2380:91"/>
wrongs past, our present rescue, or for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of what is like to ensue. But to make a full answer to the Question propounded;</p>
               <p>There are Rules to be observed,
<list>
                     <item>1 touching our <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 touching our <hi>Words.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 touching our <hi>Actions.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 First, touching our Thoughts: He that deceiveth me oft, though I must forgive him, yet Charity bindes me not, not to censure him for untrusty; and though Love doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low suspition, yet it doth not thrust out dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; it judgeth not rashly, but it judgeth justly; it is not so sharpe sighted, as to see a moate where none is, nor so purblinde, but it can discerne a beame where it is; the same spirit that saith, <hi>Charity beleeveth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. saith also, that <hi>a foole beleeveth all things,</hi> and charity is no foole, as it is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspitious, so neither lightly credulous.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For our tallying of words, as it argues lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle discretion in him that doth it, so it is of as little use, except the standers by want infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of thy innocency, and his guiltinesse which gives the occasion. Wherefore in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy owne private and personall reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the best answer is silence, but the wrongs and indignities offered to God, or contumelies that are cast upon us in the causes of Religion,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2380:91"/>
may safely be repaired. If we be meale mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in Christ and the Gospels cause, we are not patient, but zealelesse. Yea, to hold a mans peace when Gods honour is in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to mistake the end of our Redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. Neither is there a better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an upright heart, than to be more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the indignities offered to God, then of our owne dangers. And certainly no inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious disposition can be so tender of his owne disgrace, as the true Christian is at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his God; as we see in <hi>Moses,</hi> who, when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> offered him a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate injurie, it is said, his meeknesse was such, that <hi>he gave them not a word, Num.</hi> 12. But when the people had fallen to idolatry, and he heard them murmure against their Maker, he spares neither <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor the people, but in a godly fit of zeale takes on at them, yea breakes the Tables in peeces, <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. A meek Lambe in his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ause, a fierce Lion in Gods. And in <hi>David,</hi> who was a man deafe &amp; dumbe and wholly senselesse at <hi>Shemeis</hi> private reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when he cursed him, cast stones at him, called him murtherer, &amp; wicked man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. But not so at <hi>Goliahs</hi> publike revilings of God, and his Church, no, not at <hi>Michols</hi> despising his holy zeale in the publike
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2380:92"/>
service of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. In these cases how full of life and spirit, and holy impatiency did he shew himselfe to be?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Touching our actions; whether it be in thine owne cause, or in the cause of God and Religion, thou mayest not be a revenger. All that private persons can do, is either to lift up their hands to Heaven for redresse of sin, or to lift up their tongues against the sinne, not their hands against the person. Who made thee a Iudge; is a lawfull question, if it meet with a person unwarranted. <hi>Object.</hi> Every base nature will bee ready to offer injuries, where they think they will not be repaid: he will many-times beate a coward, that would not dare to strike him, if he thought him vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: as a Cur that goes through a Village, if he clap his taile betweene the legs, and runne away, every Cur will insult over him; but if he bristell up himselfe, and stand to it, give but a countersnarle, there's not a Dog dares med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Neverthelesse, avenge not thy selfe, but give place unto wrath, and that for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, <hi>Romans</hi> 12.19. If thou receivest wrong in thy person, goods, or good name, it is the Magistrates office to see thee righted, and <hi>For this cause ye pay also tribute. He is the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2380:92"/>
Minister of God for thy wealth, to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on him that doth evill, and for the praise of them that doe well</hi>: neither doth he <hi>beare the sword for nought, Rom.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.14. Now in this case, he that hath endammaged me much, cannot plead breach of charity in my seeking his Restitution: I will so remit wrongs, as I may not encourage others to offer them; and so retaine them, that I may not induce God to retaine mine to him. Have you not seene a Crow stand upon a Sheepes backe, pulling off wooll from her side: even creatures reasonlesse know well whom they may bee bold with; that Crow durst not do this to a Wolfe or a Mastiffe; the knowne simplicity of this innocent beast gives advantage to this presumption; meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit commonly drawes on injuries, and the cruelty of ill natures usually seekes out those, not who deserve worst, but who will beare most. Wherefore patience and mildnesse of spirit is ill bestowed, where it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses a man to wrong and insultation: Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish dispositions are best to others, worst to themselves. I could be willing to take inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but I will not be guilty of provoking them by lenity; for harmlessenesse let mee goe for a Sheepe; but whosoever will be tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2380:93"/>
my fleece, let him looke to himselfe.</p>

                  <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> teaching his auditors how they should refraine anger, and being earnest in pressing them to patience, a waggish boy spit in his face, to see whether he would practise that which he taught others: but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> was not a whit moved at it, yet said withall, I feare I shall commit a greater fault in letting this boy go unpunished, then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry. In some cases, for reason to take the rod out of the hands of wrath, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise, may be both lawfull and expedient.

               <p>For Cautions and Rules to be observed, when we appeale to the Magistrate. 1. First, let it be in a matter of weight, and not for trifles. 2. Secondly, in case of necessity, after we have assaied all good meanes of peace and agreement. 3. Thirdly, let not our aime and end be the hurt of our enemy; but, first, the glory of God, secondly, the reformation of the party himselfe, that so he which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, may also overcome, and (if it may be) others by his example, whereby more than
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2380:93"/>
one Devill shall be subdued. And thirdly, to procure a further peace and quiet afterwards, as Princes make war to avoid war; yea, in case we see a storme inevitably falling, 'tis good to meet it, and break the force. 4. Let us not be transported either with heat or hate, but begin and follow our suits without anger, or using the least bitternesse or extremity against the person of our adversary: as Tilters break their Speares on each others breasts, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrath or intention of hurt; or as <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King made war against <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> rather with an Olive branch, than a Lawrell branch in his hand, more desiring peace than victory; not using bribery, or any other meanes to corrupt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der justice, but to seeke our own right. 5. And lastly, having used this ordinary meanes that the Lord hath given us for the righting of our selves, in case we finde no redresse, let us rest with quietnesse and meekenesse therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fretting or desire to right our selves by private revenge, knowing assuredly, that the Lord hath thus ordered the whole matter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our correction, or for the exercise of our patience and charity; or that he will take the matter into his owne hand, and revenge our cause of such an enemy, far more severely;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2380:94"/>
or for that he meanes to deale far better with us, if we commit our cause to him, than either our selves, or any Magistrate could have done.</p>
               <p>To conclude this argument in a word. If thou goe to Law.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 33. Vse and Application of the former Reasons.</head>
               <p>THese latter Reasons being dispatcht, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne wee to make Vse of the former; for I may seeme to have left them, and be gone quite out of sight, though indeed it cannot properly be called a digression: seeing the last point proved, was; That <hi>God suffers his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be persecuted and afflicted for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, if God sends these afflictions, either for our Instruction or Reformation, to scowre away the rust of corruption, or to try the truth of our sanctification, either for the increase of our patience, or the exercise of our faith, or the improvement of our zeale, or to provoke our importunity, or for the doubling of our Obligation; let us examine whether we have thus husbanded our afflictions, to his glory and our owne spirituall and everlasting good. I know <hi>Gods</hi> chastisements for the time, seeme grievous to the best of his Children; Yea, at
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2380:95"/>
first they come upon us, like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Lion, looke terribly in shew, as if they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure us; and as Children are afraid of their friends when they see them maked, so are we. But tell me, hath not this roaring Lion prevailed against thy best part? hast thou kept thy head whole? I meane thy soule free? For as Fencers will seeme to fetch a blow at the leg, when they intended it at the head; so doth the Devill, though he strike at thy name, his aime is to slay thy soule. Now instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome, dost thou overcome? Hath this Lion yeelded thee any honey of Instruction or Reformation? Hath thy sin died with thy fame, or with thy health, or with thy peace, or with thy outward estate? Dost thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the graces of Gods Spirit to come up, and flourish so much the more in the spring of thy recovery, by how much the more hard and bitter thy winter of adversity hath been? Then thou hast approved thy selfe Christs faithfull Souldier, and a citizen of that Ierusalem which is above: yea, I dare boldly say of thee, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> of himselfe, That <hi>nothing shall be able to separate</hi> thee <hi>from the love of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lord, Rom.</hi> 8.39. To find this honey in the Lion, more than makes amends for all former feare and griefe: and in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2380:95"/>
ease any man, by his humiliation under the hand of God, is growne more faithfull and conscionable, there is honey out of the Lion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or is any man by his temptation of fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more circumspect after it? there also is honey out of the Lion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For there is no <hi>Sampson,</hi> to whom every Lion doth not yeild some honey; and thou mayest foulely suspect thy selfe, (if thou beest not the better) for thy being the worse. He is no true borne Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who is not the better for his evils, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they be; no price can buy of the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever the gaine of his sins: Yea, <hi>Sathan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in his exercise of Gods Children advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth them. And looke to it, if the malice and enmity of wicked men hath beaten thee off from thy profession, thou wert at the best but a counterfeit, and none of Christs owne bandd. A little faith, even so much as a <hi>graine of Mustard-seed,</hi> would bee able to remove greater mountaines of feare and distrust out of thy soule, than these: the damaske Rose is sweeter in the Still, than on the Stalke; and a Diamond will shine even in the durt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If the malice of our enemies, as it is hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded to our thrift (by a divine and supreame providence) doth make so much for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and benefit here and hereafter, as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2380:96"/>
namely, that it opens our eyes no lesse, than peace and prosperity had formerly shut them; that nothing doth so powerfully call home the conscience, as affliction; and that we need no other art of memory for sin, besides mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if commonly we are at variance with <hi>God,</hi> when we are at peace with our enemies; and that it is both hard and happy, not to be the worse with liberty, as the sedentary life is most subject to diseases; if vigor of body, and infirmity of minde, do for the most part lodge under one roofe, and that a wearish outside is a strong motive to mortification; if God, the al-wise Physitian, knowes this the fittest me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for our soules sicknesse, and that wee cannot otherwise bee cured; if our pride for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth God to doe by us, as <hi>Sertorius</hi> did by his Army, who perceiving his Souldiers pufft up through many victories, and hearing them boast of their many conquests, led them of purpose into the lap of their enemies, to the end that stripes might learne them modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If this above all will make us pray unto him with heat and fervency; as whither should wee flye but to our <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when the powers of darkenesse, like mighty <hi>Aramites,</hi> have besieged us? If ever we will send up our
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2380:96"/>
prayers to him, it will be when we are be lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd with evils.</p>
               <p>If true and saving joy is only the daughter of sorrow; if the security of any people is the cause of their corruption; as no sooner doth the Holy Ghost in sundry places say, <hi>Israel had rest,</hi> but it is added, <hi>They committed wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse</hi>; Even as standing waters soone grow noisome, and Vines that grow out at large, become wilde and fruitlesse in a small time; if it weanes us from the love of worldly things, and makes us no lesse inamored with heavenly; as <hi>Zeno,</hi> having but one Fly-boat left him, hearing newes that both it and all therein was cast away, said, <hi>O Fortune, thou hast done well to send me again to our Schoole of Philosophy:</hi> Whereas if we find but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleasure in our life, we are ready to doate upon it. Every small contentment glewes our affections to that we like, neither can we so heartily thinke of our home above, whilest we are furnished with these worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But when God strips us of them, straightwayes our mind is homeward; if this world may be compared to <hi>Athens,</hi> of which a Philosopher said, that it was <hi>a pleasant City to travell through, but not safe to dwel in</hi>; if by smarting in our bodies, states, or names, we
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2380:97"/>
are saved from smarting in our soules; if it was good for <hi>Naaman,</hi> that he was a Leper; good for <hi>David,</hi> that he was in trouble; good for <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> that he was blinde; if with that <hi>Athenian</hi> Captaine we should have perished for ever, in case we had not thus perished for a while; if our peace would have lost us, in case wee had not a little lost our peace; then <hi>refuse not the chastening of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee grieved with his correction,</hi> as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> adviseth, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 3.11. And so much the rather, because our strugling may aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, cannot redresse our miseries. Yea though the wicked, like some beasts, grow mad with baiting, yet let us with good old <hi>Eli</hi> (who was a good sonne to GOD, though he had beene an ill Father to his sonnes) even kisse the very rod we smart withall, and say, <hi>It is the LORD, let him doe what seemeth him good:</hi> for whatsoever seemeth good to him, cannot but be good, howsoever it seemes to us. Yea let us receive his stripes with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, patience, piety, and thankfulnesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, as that holy Martyr <hi>Iohn Bradford,</hi> who said to the Queen, (how much more did he meane it to the great King of Heaven and Earth?) <hi>If the Queen will give me life, I will thanke her; if she will banish me, I will thank

her. if she will burne me, I will thank her; if she will condemne me to perpetuall imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will thanke her.</hi> The stomacke that is purged, must be content to part with some good nourishment, that it may deliver it selfe of more evill humours: and the Physitian knowes what is best for the Patient; the Nurse better than the infant, what is good and fit for it; yea, let us take them as tokens and pledges of Gods love and favour, who loves his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren so, as not to make wantons of them. They that would tame pampered Horses, doe adde to their travell, and abate of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> served the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Which of us shall see peeces of Timber cut and squared, and plained by the Carpenter; or Stones hewne and polished by the Mason, but will collect and gather, that these are Stones and Timber which the Master would imploy in some building? if I suffer, it is that I may raigne. And how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable is that affliction, which carrieth me to Heaven? Oh, it is a good change, to have the fire of affliction for the fire of Hell: Who would not rather smart for a while, than for ever?

               <p>Thirdly, If in conclusion the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and damnable practises of our worst and greatest enemies, prove no other in effect to us, than did the malice of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, Mistrisse, and Lord to him: the first in selling of him, the second in falesely accusing him, the third in imprisoning him; (all which made for his inestimable good and benefit,) than the malice of <hi>Haman</hi> to <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose bloudy decree obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, procured them exceeding much joy and peace; then <hi>Balaks</hi> malice to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose desire of cursing them, caused the Lord so much the more to blesse them, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. Then the Devils spight to <hi>Iob,</hi> who pleasured him more by his soare afflicting him, than any thing else could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have done, whether we regard his name, Children, substance, or soule; than <hi>Iudas</hi> his treason against the Lord of life, whose dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable fact served not only to accomplish his

How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable are his judgments, and his wayes past finding out! Rom.</hi> 11.33. O the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and soveraigne goodnesse of our <hi>God!</hi> that turnes all our poysons into Cordials, that can change our terrours into pleasures, and make the greatest evils beneficiall unto us; for they are evill in their owne nature, and work those former good effects, not properly by themselves, but by accident, as they are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the infinite wisdome, goodnesse, and power of God, who is able to bring light out of darknesse, and good out of evill: yea, this should tutor us to loue our enemies; we love the medicine, not for its owne sake, but for the health it brings us; and to suffer chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatsoever is laid upon us: for how can Gods Church in generall, or any member in particular but fare well, since the very malice of their enemies benefits them?

What voluminous waves be here, for number, and power, and terrour; yet they shall not separate the Arke from Christ, nor a soule from the Arke, nor a body from the soule, nor an haire from the body, to do us hurt. What saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? Marke the upright man, and behold the just; for the end of that man is peace, Psa.</hi> 37.37. Marke him in his setting out, he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppositions, marke him in the journey, he is full of tribulations: but marke him in the conclusion, and <hi>the end of that man is peace. In Christ al things are ours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. How is that? Why, we have all things, because we have the haver of all things. And <hi>if we love Christ, all things work together</hi> for our good, yea, <hi>for the best, Rom.</hi> 8.28. And if all things (quoth <hi>Luther</hi>) then even sinne it selfe. And indeed, how many have wee knowne, the better for their sin? That <hi>Magdalen</hi> had never loved so much, if she had not so much sinned: had not the incestuous person sinned so notoriously, he had never beene so happy. God tooke the advantage of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2380:100"/>
for his conversion. Had not one foot slipt into the mouth of hell, he had never been in this forwardnesse to Heaven: sinne first wrought sorrow (saith S. <hi>Austine</hi>) and now godly sorrow kils sin; the daughter destroyes the mother: neither do our owne sinnes onely advantage us, but other mens sinnes worke for our good also. If <hi>Arius</hi> had not held a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Substances with a Trinity of Persons; and <hi>Sabellius</hi> an Vnity of Persons with an Vnity of Essences, the Mysteries of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had not beene so cleerely explained by those great lights of the Church. We may say here, as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> If some enemies had not contested against the Church, it might have gone worse with the Church. Lastly, suppose our enemies should kill us, they shall not hurt, but pleasure us, yea, even death it selfe shall worke our good. That Red Sea shall put us over to the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and we shall say to the praise of God, wee are delivered, wee are the better for our enemies, the better for our sinnes, the better for death, yea, better for the devill: and to thinke otherwise even for the present, were not only to derogate from the wisdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and goodnesse of God, but it would bee against reason; for in reason, if he have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> IF it be so, that the malice of wicked men makes so much for the behoofe of Gods people; and that whatsoever they do unto us, is but the execution of Gods will, and full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of his just decree; it may seeme to make on their side, and not only extenuate their evill, but give them occasion of boasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Although <hi>God</hi> disposeth it to the good of his children, that hee may bring about all things to make for his owne glory; yet they intend only evil in it, as namely, the dishonour of God, the ruine of mens soules (as I shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily prove, when I come to shew what is the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cause or end of their temptations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions) and the satisfying of their own ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine enmity, &amp; thirst of revenge. We must therefore learne to distinguish betwixt the act of God, and of an enemy, as indeed <hi>Gods</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do; <hi>When ye thought evill against me</hi> (saith
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2380:101"/>
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his brethren) <hi>God disposed it to good, that he might bring to passe as it is this day,</hi> and save much people alive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. Yea, the holy God challengeth to himselfe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is done in the City, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. but so, as neither wicked mens sins shal taint him, nor his decree justifie them: the sinne is their own, the good which comes of it is Gods, the benefit ours; God wils the same action, as it is a blessing, tryall, or chastisement of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which he hates as the wickednesse of the agent. The lewd tongue, hand, or heart, moves from God, it moves lewdly from Sathan: wicked men are never the freer from guilt and punishment, for that hand which the holy God hath in their offensive actions. To instance in one example or two: Satan did nought touching <hi>Iob,</hi> but what the Lord upon his request gave him leave to do; what then? Did God and <hi>Belial</hi> joyne in fulfilling the same act? No; sooner shall Stygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an darknesse blend with light, the frost with fire, day with night: true, God &amp; Satan will'd the selfesame thing, but God intended good, Satan ill; Satan aimed at <hi>Iobs,</hi> and God at his confusion. God used the malice of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and <hi>Shemei</hi> unto Good; what then? God afflicted his people with another minde
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2380:102"/>
than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did; God to increase them, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to suppresse them. The sinne of <hi>Shemeis</hi> curse was his owne, the smart of the curse was Gods; God wils that as <hi>Davids</hi> chastisement, which he hates as <hi>Shimeis</hi> wickednesse. The curse of the Serpent bestowed blessednesse on Man; yea, our first parents had beene lesse glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, if they had not wanted a Saviour. What then? Doth Satan merit thanks? No, but the contrary, for he only intended the finall ruine and destruction of them and all mankinde, with the dishonour of their Maker. Lastly, the Devill does us good in this particular case, for while he assaults us with temptations, and afflicts us with crosses, he in effect helps us to Crownes. Yet still no thankes to Satan, for to be charitable is more than his meaning; it is that divine &amp; over-ruling providence of God, which we are beholding unto, and to him give we the thankes. Alas, there is nothing in the world, bee it gall it selfe, yea the excrement of a Dog, or the poyson of a Serpent, but mans shallow invention can finde it is good for something: neither doe two contrary poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons mingled together prove mortall; how much more is God able to worke good by evill instruments?

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> WHat other grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth the Word of God afford in this case for the better upholding and strengthning of a weake Christian in his sufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We shall beare the crosse with the more patience and comfort, if wee consider first, that God is specially present with his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their afflictions, takes notice of their sufferings, and allayes their griefe. The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of a Christian are very great for number, variety, and bitternesse; yet there is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient that sweetens them all, the promise of God, <hi>I will be with thee in trouble, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee, Psal.</hi> 91.15. And thou shalt <hi>not be tempted above thy strength</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Againe, <hi>Feare not; for when thou passest
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2380:103"/>
through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the flouds, that they doe not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee, Esay</hi> 43.1, 2. Now as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> said to the trembling Mariner, <hi>Bee not afraid, for thou carriest Caesar</hi>; so, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, be not afraid, for he that is in thee, for thee, with thee, that guides thee, that will save thee, is the invincible King <hi>Iehovah.</hi> And upon this ground <hi>David</hi> was so comforted and refreshed in his soule, <hi>Psalme</hi> 94.19. that hee was able to say, <hi>Though I should walke through the valley of the shaddow of death I will feare no evill</hi>: Why? <hi>For thou art with mee, thy Rod and thy staffe shall comfort mee, Psalme</hi> 23.4. But heare some promises, which more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the matter in hand. <hi>If ye be railed upon for the name of Christ,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>blessed are yee, for the Spirit of God resteth upon you,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. In fine, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever seeketh God truly in affliction, is sure to finde him: and that he is our hope, and strength, and helpe, and refuge in troubles, ready to bee found, the Scriptures are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.4, 15. <hi>Psalme</hi> 46.1. and 9.9, 10. Now if we could but remember
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2380:103"/>
and lay to heart these promises, when wee feele the greatest assaults or pangs, how could wee want courage? But alas, most of us are like the Prophets servant, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. who saw his foes, but not his friends; at least wee are apt to thinke, that GOD is removed from us, when wee any way suffer calamity; as the Israelites doe but want water, and presently they cry, <hi>Is the Lord among us,</hi> or no? <hi>Exodus</hi> 17.7. as if God could not bee with them, and they athirst; either he must humour carnall mindes, or bee distrusted: this confession could <hi>Seneca</hi> make, (but like a Divine,) <hi>God is neere unto thee, he is with thee, he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee</hi>: and surely, if he had not beene with these Israelites, they had not lived; if he had beene in them, they had not murmured. We can thinke him absent in our want, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see him absent in our sinne; yet wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not affliction, argues him gone: yea, he is then most present, when he most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiseth; for <hi>as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolations abound through CHRIST,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. When did <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> see a vision of Angels, but when he fled for his life, making the cold earth his bed, and a stone his pillow; or when was his heart so
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2380:104"/>
full of joy, as now that his head lay hardest. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw great happinesse by Christ, in his peace: but under that showre of stones, he saw Heaven it selfe open, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have this advantage, that they occasion God to shew that mercy to us, whereof the prosperous are uncapable; as we further see in <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 21.17, 18, 19. And <hi>Manoahs</hi> Wife, <hi>Iudges</hi> 13.3. To whom the Angell of the Covenant had not beene sent, if they had not beene in distresse.</p>
               <p>It would not become a mother to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to an healthfull Childe, as to a sick: and indeed some have found their outward castigations so sweetned with the inward consolations of Gods Spirit, that they have found and confessed their receipts of joy and comfort, to bee an hundred-fold more than their paiments, even in this present life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that promise of our Saviour, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>30. So that a Christian is still a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in all his losses, yea, he gaines by his losses.</p>
               <p>Indeed God may be present with us, and yet wee not be pleased; as the Israelites repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a King, when the Lord was their King: Or Christ may be with us, and yet we want something that we desire. Christ was
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2380:104"/>
in the Ship, and yet (say the Apostles) <hi>wee have no bread.</hi> Iesus was at the Mariage, yet, saith his Mother, <hi>They have no Wine, Ioh.</hi> 2.3. Wee may want Bread and Wine, and yet have Christs company: but if food faile, it is because Manna is to come; if Wine bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet grace and salvation is present: if God take away flesh, and gives Manna; deny Sun and Moone, and give us himselfe, he doth us no wrong.</p>
               <p>Now why doth God, by his promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e tye himselfe to be present with us more especially in affliction, but that he may resist our enemies, sustaine us when wee faint, and Crowne us when we overcome; but that he may be exact in taking notice of our particular sufferings; and as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Count our wanderings, put our teares into his bottle,</hi> and enter all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Register, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56.8, 9. All our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more noted by that God that sends them, than of the patient that suffers them; every pang, and stitch, and guird, is first felt of him that sends it: could we be miserable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, we had reason to be heartlesse: but how can it be but lesse possible to indure any thing that he knowes not, than that he inflicteth not? As he said to <hi>Manoah</hi> by an Angell, <hi>Thou art barren, Iudg.</hi> 13.3. so he saith to one, thou
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2380:105"/>
art sick; to another, thou art poore; to a third, thou art defamed; thou art oppressed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that all-seeing eye takes notice from Heaven of every mans condition, no lesse than if he should send an Angell to tell us he knew it: and his knowledge compared with his mercy, is the just comfort of all our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. O God, we are many times miserable and feele it not, thou knowest even those sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes which we might have, thou knowest what thou hast done, do what thou pleasest.</p>

If we consider, that all afflictions, from the least to the greatest, doe come to passe, not by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, chance, or fortune, but by the speciall providence of God, who not onely decreeth and fore appointeth every particular crosse, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29. but even effecteth them, and brings them into execution, as they are crosses, corrections, trials, and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45.7. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. and also or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth and disposeth them, that is, limiteth and appointeth the beginning, the end, the measure, the quality, and the continuance thereof; yea, he ordereth them to their right ends, namely, his owne glory, the good of his servants, and the benefit of his Church, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.19, 20. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.

9. God useth them but as Instruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to worke his good pleasure upon us; our adversaries are but as tooles in the hand of the Workeman, and we must not so much looke to the Instrument, as to the Author; <hi>Gen</hi> 45.5. and 50.20. Well may the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Philistims</hi> doubt whether their plague bee from God, or by Fortune, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.2, 9. but let a <hi>Ioseph</hi> be sold into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he will say unto his enemies, <hi>Ye sent not me hither, but God; when ye thought evill against me, God disposed it to good, that he might bring to passe as it is this day, and save much people alive</hi>: or let a <hi>David</hi> be railed upon by any cursed <hi>Shemei,</hi> he will answer, <hi>Let him alone, for he curseth, even because the Lord hath bid him curse David.</hi> Who dare then say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast thou done so? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. Or let a <hi>Micha</hi> be trodden upon and insulted over by his enemy, his answer shall bee no other than this, <hi>I will beare the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, untill he pleade my cause, and execute judgement for me, Micha</hi> 7.9. The beleever that is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in Gods booke, knowes that his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are in the hands of God, as a Hammer, Axe, or Rod, in the hand of a smiter; and therefore as the Hammer, Axe, or Rod, of it

selfe, can doe nothing, any further than the force of the hand using it gives strength unto it; No more can they doe any thing at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, further than it is given them from above, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> told <hi>Pilate, Iohn</hi> 19.11. See this in some examples; you have <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> following <hi>Iacob</hi> with one troope; <hi>Esau</hi> meeting him with another, both with hostile intentions, both go on till the uttermost point of their execution, both are prevented ere the execution: for stay but a while, and you shall see <hi>Laban</hi> leave him with a kisse, <hi>Esau</hi> meet him with a kisse; of the one he hath an oath, teares of the other, peace with both; GOD makes fooles of the enemies of his Church; he lets them proceed that they may be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and when they are gone to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most reach of their teather, he puls them back to the stake with shame. Againe, you have <hi>Senacherib</hi> let loose upon <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his people, who insults over them intolerably, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. Oh the lamentable and (in sight) desperate condition of distressed <hi>Ierusalem!</hi> wealth it had none, strength it had but a little, all the Countrey round about was subdued unto the <hi>Assyrian</hi>: that proud victor hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt the wals of it with an innumerable army, scorning that such a shovell-full of earth

should stand out but one day: yet poore <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> stands alone blockt up with a world of enemies, helplesse, friendlesse, comfortlesse, looking for the worst of an hostile fury; and on a sudden, before an Arrow is shot into the City, a hundred fourescore and five thousand of their enemies were slaine, and the rest run away, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35, 36. If we are in league with God, we need not feare the greatest of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n; for let <hi>the Kings of the Earth</hi> be <hi>assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the Rulers come together</hi>; Let <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> gather themselves in one league against him; it is in vaine, for they can do nothing, but what the hand of God and his Councell hath before determined to be done; as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmed to the rest of the Disciples, for their better confirmation and comfort, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.26. to 29. Nothing can be accomplished in the Lower-House of this world, but first it is decreed in the Vpper-Court of Heaven; as for example, what did the <hi>Iewes</hi> ever doe to our Saviour Christ, that was not first both decreed by the Father of Spirits, and registred in the Scriptures for our notice and comfort? They could not so much as throw the Dice for his coat, but it was prophesied, <hi>Psalme</hi> 22.18. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.21.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2380:107"/>
It is foretold that they should give him gall in his meat, and in his thirst vineger to drinke; the very quality and kinde of his drink is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied; yea, his face could not be spit upon without a prophesie; those filthy excrements of his enemies fell not upon his face, without Gods decree, and the Prophets relation, <hi>Esay</hi> 50.6. Now it must needs comfort and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us exceedingly, if in all cases we doe but duly consider, that inequality is the ground of order, that superiour causes guide the subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that this sublunary Globe depends on the celestiall, as the lesser wheeles in a Clock doe on the great one, which I finde thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<q>
                     <l>As in a Clock one motion doth convey</l>
                     <l>And carry divers wheeles a severall way,</l>
                     <l>Yet altogether by the great wheeles force</l>
                     <l>Direct the hand unto his proper course.</l>

                  <hi>Who is he that saith, and it commeth to passe, when the Lord commandeth it not? Lam.</hi> 3.37. Suppose the Legions of Hell should combine with the Potentates of the Earth to doe their worst, they cannot go beyond the reach of their teather, whether they rise or sit still, they shall by an insensible ordination performe that will of the Almighty, which they least thinke of, and most oppose; yea,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2380:108"/>
(saith <hi>Austine</hi>) by resisting the will of God they do fulfill it: and his will is done by and upon them, even in that they doe against his will.</p>
               <p>That even Satan himselfe is limited, and can go no further than his chaine will reach, we may see, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.2. More particularly; he could not touch so much as <hi>Iobs</hi> body or substance, no not one of his servants, nor one limbe of their bodies, nor one haire of their heads, nor one beast of their heards, but he must first beg leave of God, <hi>Iob</hi> 2.6. Nay Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is so farre from having power over us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that he cannot touch our bodies being dead; yea, he cannot finde them when God will conceale them, (witnesse the body of <hi>Moses:</hi>) and I doubt not, but as the Angels did wait at the Sepulchre of their and our Lord; so, for his sake, they also watch over our graves: he could not seduce a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor enter into a Hog without license; the whole Legion sue to Christ for a suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not daring other than to grant, that without his permission they could not hurt a very Swine. Now if it be fearefull to thinke how great things evill spirits can doe with permission, it is comfortable to thinke how they can doe nothing without permission;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2380:108"/>
for if GOD must give him leave, hee will never give him leave to doe any harme to his chosen, he will never give him leave to doe the least hurt to our soules. Now as by way of concession every greater includes the lesse, he that can lift a Talent, can easily lift a Pound; so by way of denyall, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greater excludes the lesse. If Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe cannot hurt us, much lesse his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, weake men: but for proofe of this, see also an instance or two, that <hi>a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cannot fall to the ground without our heavenly Father</hi>; and that without leave from him, our enemies cannot diminish one haire of our heads, wee have our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOURS expresse testimony, <hi>Matthew</hi> 10.

Yea, let <hi>Ionas</hi> through frailty runne away from the execution of his embassage and GODS charge, and thereupon bee cast into the Sea, though the waves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him of the Ship, and the fish require him of the waves, yet the Lord will require him of the Fish: even the Sea and the Fish had as great a charge for the Prophet, as the Prophet had a charge for <hi>Niniveh</hi>; for this is a sure rule, if in case God gives any of the creatures leave to afflict us, yet hee will bee sure to lay no more upon us than wee are able, or hee will make us able to beare yea, then shall make for our good and his glory; he hath a provident care over all the creatures, even Beasts and Plants: and certainely wee are more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Fowles or Flowers, yet the Lord cares for them. Will the Householder take care to water the Herbes of his Garden, or to

The body is but the Barke, Cabinet, Case, or Instrument of the soule; and say it fals in peeces, there is but a Pitcher broken; the soule a glorious Ruby, held more fit to be set in the Crowne of glory, than here to be trodden under foot by dirty Swine; and therefore so soone as separated, the Angels convey her hence to the place of everlasting blisse.

               <p>As touching the continuance of afflictions, God so ordereth and tempereth the same, in his mercifull wisdome, that either they bee tolerable, or short, either our sorrowes shall not be violent, or they shall not last; if they bee not light, they shall not be long: grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and sore trials last but <hi>for a season,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.6. <hi>A little while, Iohn</hi> 16.16.

God loves to send reliefe when we least looke for it, as <hi>Elisha</hi> sent to the King of Israel when hee was rending his clothes, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 5 8. Heare what the Lord thy Redeemer saith by <hi>Esaiah, For a moment in thine anger.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2380:112"/>
The Philosophers could observe, that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion violent is wont to be permanent; and <hi>Seneca</hi> concludes, That if the sicknesse be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and lasting, the paine is tolerable; but if violent, short: so if we suffer much, it shall not be long, if we suffer long, it shall not be much. Some misery is like a Consumption, gentle, but of long continuance; other like a Feaver, violent, but soone over. If our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes be long, they are the lighter; if sharper, the shorter. The sharpe North-East winde (saith the Astronomer) never lasteth three dayes; and thunder, the more violent, the lesse permanent. Wherefore cheere up thou drooping soule; if the Sun of comfort be for the present clouded, it will ere long shine forth bright againe; if now with the Moone thou art in the wayne; stay but a little, thou shalt as much increase; for as dayes succeed nights, Summer Winter, and rest travell; so undoubtedly, joy shall suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When did our Saviour heale the Woman of her bloudy issue, but after the Physitians had given her over, and she becomming much worse, had given them over, when shee had spent all she had upon them: for to mend the matter, poverty, which is another disease, was superadded to make her compleatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.

And why doth the goodnesse of our God pick out the most needfull times for our reliefe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? but because our extremities drive us to him that is omnipotent; there is no feare, no danger, but in our owne insensiblenesse: but because when we are forsaken of all succours and hopes, we are f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

never are we neerer to helpe, than when wee despaire of helpe; but because our extremities give him the most glory, and our comfort is the greater, when the deliverance is seene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is expected, his wisdome knowes when aide will be most seasonable, most wellcome; which he then loves to give, when he findes us left of all other props. That mercifull hand is reserved for a dead lift, and then he failes us not; as when <hi>Abraham</hi> had given <hi>Isaack</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Isaac</hi> had given himselfe for dead; when the knife is falling upon his throate, then, then comes the deliverance by an Angell, calling, forbidding, commending him.</p>
               <p>And indeed our faith is most commendable in the last act, it is no praise to hould out, until we be harde driven, but when we are forsaken of meanes, then to live by faith in our God, is thought worthy of a Crowne. O wretched <hi>Saul,</hi> hadst thou held out never so little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without offering, and without distrust, <hi>Samuel</hi> had come, and thou hadst kept the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, whereas now for thy unbeliefe thou art cast off for ever, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.10, to 15. To shut up all in a word, were thy soule in such a straight, as Israel was betweene the red Sea, and the Egyptians; the spirits of vengeance, (like those enemies) pursuing thee

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou must know, that GOD in his wisdome hath set downe a certaine period of time, within which hee will exercise his Children more or lesse: and at the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not before, hee will relieve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them againe.

Foure hundred yeares hee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, that they should be Sojourners in a strange land, where they should be kept in bondage, and evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, <hi>Genesis</hi> 15.

of it after the floud: God will doe all in due time, that is, in his time, not in ours; if at any time the Lord deliver us, it is more than he owes us. Let him (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) choose his owne opportunity that so freely grants the mercy. Againe, he appointed that the <hi>Iewes</hi> should serve the King of Babylon seventy yeeres; not a day, not an houre to bee abated, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 25.11. but at the end thereof, even that very night, <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. it was accomplished; neither did <hi>Daniel,</hi> (who knew the determinate time) once pray for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, till just upon the expiration. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight yeeres hee appointed the sicke man at Bethesda's Poole, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.5. Twelve yeares to the Woman with the bloudy issue, <hi>Matthew</hi> 9.20.

Each of these groaned for a time, under the like burden as thou doest: But when their time which God had appointed, was come, they were delivered from all their miseries, troubles and calamities: and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ere long, if thou wilt patiently tarry the Lords leasure, thou shalt also be delivered from thy affliction and sorrow, either in the

Be our troubles many in number, strange in nature, heavy in measure, much in burthen, and long in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, yet Gods mercies are more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, his wisdome more wondrous, his power more miraculous, he will deliver us out of all, <hi>Many are the troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all, Psal.</hi> 34.19. How many or how great soever they be, or how long soever they continue, yet an end they shall all have: For the LORD either taketh troubles from them, or takes them from troubles, by receiving them into his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rest, where they shall acknowledge that GOD hath rewarded them as farre beyond their expectation, as he had formerly punished

them lesse than they did deserve: this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine well digested will breed good bloud in our soules, and is specially usefull to bound our desires of release; for though we may be importunate, impatient we may not be, stay he never so long, Patience must not be an Inch shorter than Affliction: If the Bridge reach but halfe way over the Brooke, we shall have but an ill-favoured passage. We are taught in Scripture to praise Patience, as we doe a faire day at night; <hi>He that endureth to the end shall be saved, Matth.</hi> 24.13. Much the better for that light, which will not bring us to bed: perseverance is a kinde, of all in all. But not seldome doth the Lord onely release his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren out of extreame adversity here, but withall makes their latter end so much the more prosperous, by how much the more their former time hath beene miserable and adverse. We have experience in <hi>Iob: You have heard,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iames, of the patience of Iob, and what end the Lord made with him:</hi> What end is that; the Holy Ghost tels you: <hi>That the Lord turned the captivity of Iob, and blessed his last dayes more than the first, for hee had foureteene thousand Sheepe, and six thousand Camels, and a thousand Yoake of Oxen, and a thousand she Asses; he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

seaven sonnes, and three daughters, and all his friends came unto him againe with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and comforted him for all the evill that the Lord had brought unto him, Iob</hi> 42.10. to 14. And in <hi>David,</hi> who for a long time was in such feare of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he was forc't to flye for his life, first, to <hi>Samuel,</hi> where <hi>Saul</hi> pursueth him; then to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> where his griefe is doubled; then to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> where is <hi>Doeg</hi> to betray him; after that he flyeth to <hi>Achish</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> where, being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he is in greatest feare of all, lest the King should take away his life, and lastly when he returnes to his owne Ziklag, he finds it smitten and burnt with fire, and his Wives taken prisoners, and in the midst of all his griefe, when hee had wept untill hee could weepe no more, the people being vexed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to stone him; so that, as he had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complayned, there was but a steppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and death; but marke the issue, within two dayes the Crowne of Israel is brought unto him, and he is annoynted King, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. and for the present he was able to comfort himselfe in the Lord his God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. Yea after this, when by that foule sin of Adultery and Murther hee had brought more enemies about his eares (God and Men,

and Divells) having once repented his fault, he was able to say with confidence, <hi>O God thou hast shewed me great troubles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, but thou wilt take me up from the depth of the earth, and increase my honour, Psalme</hi> 71.21. He knew well enough that cherishing was wont to follow stripes: how oft hath a Tragick entrance had a happy end? We read that <hi>Michael</hi> was condemned to death by the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> upon a false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, but before the execution the Emperor dyed, and <hi>Michael</hi> was chosen in his stead.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We have the presence of Gods Spirit, and grace many times, and feele it not; yea, when we complaine for want of it (as Pilate asked Christ what was the truth, when the Truth stood before him.) The stomacke finds the best digestion, even in sleepe, when we least perceive it; and whiles we are most awake, this power worketh in us, either to further strength or disease, without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is done within; and on the other side, that man is most dangerously sicke, in whom nature decayes without his feeling, without his complaint. To know our selves happy, is good, but woe were to us Christians, if we could not be happy and know it not. As touching prayer, every one is not so happy
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2380:119"/>
as <hi>Steven</hi> was, to be most fervent when they are most in paine; yea it were miserable for the best Christian, if all his former prayers and meditations did not serve to ayde him in his last streights, and meet together in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his extremitie; yeelding, though not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible reliefe, yet secret benefit to the soule; whereas the worldly man in this case, having not layed up for this houre, hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from GOD, or from others, or from himselfe. And thus you see that nothing can befall us without the speciall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our good God, who not only takes notice of our sufferings, but sweetneth them with his presence, takes our part, stintes our enemies, and so ordereth the whole, that our griefe is either short, or tolerable; and that though he is oftentimes harsh in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and progresse, and late in comming, yet he comes on the sudden, and is alwaies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in the conclusion.

It is the wonte of Fathers, to hold in their owne children, when they suffer the children of bondmen to goe at large, and doe as they list; yea when diverse children are playing the wantons, if we see a man take one from the rest, and whip him soundly, wee conclude, that alone to be his Child: Wise and discreet Fathers will force their Children earnestly to apply themselves to their studdy or labour, and will not let them be idle, although it be Holy-day; yea constraine them to sweat, and oftentimes to weepe, when their Mothers would set them on their lappes, and keepe them at home all day in the shadowe, for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their white. <hi>Iacob</hi> is bound prentise, while prophane <hi>Esau</hi> rides a hunting: Of <hi>Elkanah</hi> his two wives, <hi>Hannah</hi> was in more esteeme with God, yet barren; and <hi>Peninnah</hi> lesse, yet she was fruitfull, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.

more proves us his, then his stripes, he will not bestow whipping where he loves not: fond nature, indeed, thinkes God should not suffer the wind to blow upon his deare ones, because her selfe makes this use of her own indulgence; but none (out of the place of torment) have suffered so much as his deare Children. If hee had said wee are Idolaters, therefore the LORD hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us, because wee have forsaken him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of (<hi>the LORD hath delivered us unto the Midianites, therefore hee hath forsaken us</hi>) the sequell had beene as good as now tis faulty; for sinnes, not afflictions argue GOD absent; Yea, commonly, the measure of our sufferings is according to the measure of grace in us, and GODS love to us; <hi>he is a chosen vessell unto me</hi> (saith God to <hi>Ananias</hi> touching <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>therefore hee must suffer great things for my sake, Acts</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>Iob,</hi> for a righteous and upright man, had no fellow, by the testimony of God himselfe, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.8.

God had endued him with greater learning and gifts, and intended him an instrument of bringing more glory to his Name. And lastly, as <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>annoynted with the oyle of gladnesse above his fellowes, Psalm.</hi> 45.7. So he was annoynted with the oyle of sadnes above his fellowes: Never any have had so bitter draughts upon earth, as those he loves best: and that of Saint <hi>Austine</hi> is a sure Rule, whom <hi>God</hi> smites not, he loves not; never was Ierusalems condition so desperate, as when God said unto her, <hi>My fury shall depart from thee; I will be quiet, and no more angry, Eze.</hi> 16.42. Thus not to be angry, was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test anger of all: Never were the Iewes more to be pittyed, then when their Prophet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered these words from the Lord, <hi>Why should yee be stricken any more, Isaiah</hi> 1.5. Not to be afflicted is to be forsaken, as the sicke man is in small hope of his life, when the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an giveth him over; so his soule is in a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate case, whom God forbeareth to chastise for his sinnes. Wherefore lift up your hands which hang downe, because of some so are affliction, and your weake knees, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.12. and know, that the palate is but an ill Iudge of the favours of God: As not to be afflicted argues an absolute defect of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2380:122"/>
so, if our troubles be light and few, it is because we are weake and tender, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God imposeth no more upon us, because he sees we can beare no more: when I am stronger I will looke for more, when I am a vessell fit for this strong and new wine, I shall be filled with it, but not before, <hi>Marke</hi> 2.22. The Physitiany will not suffer a milkesoppe to see his veyne opened, but makes him wink; or looke another way; The master giveth not to his sicke servant strong meates, as he doth to the rest, but more dainty far; not because he is worthier than the rest, but because hee is weaker, and in greater need. Will any make choyse of a weake Champion? No more will God, he will either finde us fit, or make us fit to discharge the place he put us in; as when he called <hi>Saul</hi> to be a King, he gave him a Kings heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. And when he called the Apostles to that function, he gave them gifts answerable, so when he calls any to suffer for him, be it Martyrdome, he giveth them the courage of Martyrs, as the times of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> witnesse. But yet, for the most part, he traynes us up by degrees, and doth not make us fit to undergoe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the sudden. We must learne to fence in the Schoole, before we fight in the field;

night and day equall; good and ill fortune in the same measure: for these compositions make both our crosses tolerable, and our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings wholesome. We that know not the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of others, call our owne the heaviest; every small current is a torrent; every Brooke a River; every River a Sea: we make our selves more miserable than we need, than we should, by looking upon our miseries in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying glasse; we measure the length of time, by the sharpnesse of our afflictions, and so make minutes seeme howers, and dayes moneths. If wee be sicke, and the Physitian promises to visit us to morrow with his best reliefe, with what a tedious longing doe we expect his presence? Our imagination makes every day of our sorrow appeare like <hi>Iosuahs</hi> day, when the Sun stood still in <hi>Gibeon.</hi> The summer of our delights is too short: but the winter of our affliction goes slowly of; we are so sensible of a present distresse, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull for favours past, that wee remember not many yeares health so much, as one daies sicknesse, 'tis true, former meales doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our present hunger, but this cottage of ours ruines straight, if it be not new daubed every day, new repaired.

health, and all Gods former favours? if he doe not answer us in every thing, sha'l wee take pleasure in nothing? Shall we slight all his blessings, because in one thing he crosseth us, whereas his least mercy is beyond our best merit? but if we thinke of our deliverance from the fire of hell, this is cause enough to make us both patient and thankefull; though the trifles wee delight in bee taken from us.

Yea, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> thy soares and sorrowes soone ceased, but thy joyes are everlasting. Now me thinks if thou but considerest that thy paines will shortly passe, but thy joy shall never passe away; it should prove a notable soveraigne Cordiall to strengthen thee; not only against reproches which attend thy profession, but even against fire and fagot. Who would not be a <hi>Philpot</hi> for a moneth, or a <hi>Lazarus</hi> for a day, or a <hi>Stephen</hi> for an houre, that he might be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome for ever: nothing can be too much to endure for those pleasures, which endure for ever.</p>

And herein we fare no worse than Christ; did not his spirit passe from the crosse into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise? Did not he first descend into hell, and then had his ascention? suppose thy sufferings be great, what then? Assure thy selfe, that every pang is a prevention of the paines of hell, and every respite an earnest of Heavens rest; and how many stripes dost thou esteeme Heaven worth? Its true, flesh and bloud is so sensuall, that it feeles a little paine in the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a great deale more than the health of the whole body. But let us better consider on it, and behold at once the whole estate of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, we shall see his peace exceed his paine; yea, we shall see both the torments present, and the glory following: hope makes absent joyes present, wants, plenitudes, and beguiles calamity, as good company does the way.
