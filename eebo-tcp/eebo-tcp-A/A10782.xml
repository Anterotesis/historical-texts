         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOraſmuch as I haue lately ſeene two Letters vnder the hande of the late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Couentrie.</hi>
and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and now Lord Biſhop elect of <hi>Norwich;</hi> the one dated 22. <hi>Septembris</hi> 1617. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
6. <hi>Nouembris</hi> following, directed to the ſeuerall Archdeacons, Miniſters, and Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of the ſame Dioceſſe for ſupplying of the wants and defects of Bibles of the new and laſt tranſlation,
being of the greateſt letter and larger volume, as alſo Bookes of common prayer, in ſuch Pariſhes as they
were Wanting. In which buſineſſe his Lordſhip was pleaſed to imploy this bearer <hi>William Bramſgroue,</hi>
who hath already taken much paines therein. And for that I haue receiued credible information, that
many pariſhes within the ſayd Dioceſſe, are yet vnfurniſhed of the ſayd Bookes, notwithſtanding ſtrict
order by me giuen, in the late Metropoliticall Viſitation, holden there for the now Lord Archbiſhop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſince that alſo by the late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Couentrie</hi> and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> for the prouiding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
I therefore as Vicar generall to the ſayd Lord Archbiſhop, being <hi>Custos ſpiritualitatis ſede vacante,</hi> for
the better ſeruice of Almighty God, and edification of the people, haue thought meet to prouide for the
perfecting of that good work ſo well begun, and to that purpoſe do heereby will and require you to make
diligent inquirie, in euery pariſh within the ſayd Dioceſſe, of the defect and want of the ſayd Bookes; and
once more to admoniſh the Miniſter and Churchwardens of euery pariſh, to prouide the ſame with all
conuenient ſpeed, which if they ſhall refuſe or deferre ſo to doe, then foorth with to returne their names
vnto me, that if by my ordinary Iuriſdiction, they will not be brought to ſupplie that defect and abuſe,
that then by power of the Commiſsioners Eccleſiaſticall or otherwiſe, they may be inforced thereunto;
wherein, God willing, I will not faile to take a ſtrict courſe, betwixt this and the beginning of Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe
Terme next. And for that I finde by experience, that the people for the moſt part within that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
are growne into extremes, that is to ſay, ſome ſo prophane or otherwiſe ſo backward in religion,
that they haue no regard of comming to Church, to heare diuine Seruice and Sermons on Saboath dayes
and Holy dayes; ſome others ſo preciſely curious, that they will bar his Maieſties Subiects from all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
recreation on thoſe dayes, though it be after Euening Seruice and Sermon ended, it ſhall not be amiſſe
as you trauell for the diſpatch of your other buſineſſe, that you deliuer to ſuch Churchwardens of euery
pariſh, within that Dioceſſe for their better direction in this behalfe, this ſmall Treatiſe; (<hi>Conteining his
Maieſties declaration to his Subiects concerning lawfull ſports to be vſed</hi>) as ſhall be willing to receiue the ſame.
And I require you to make returne of the due execution heereof, at or before the beginning of Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe
Terme next.</p>
