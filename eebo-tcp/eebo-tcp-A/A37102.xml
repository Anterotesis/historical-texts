            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And indeed (my

upon these Nations,
once I may say almost
peopled with Nobles,
and now in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
deprived both of

'twas easie for me to find
out the Prime of those

drunk up the very dregs
of the Cup, and suffered

as worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves

            <p>My Lord you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Prime of the
Nobility, which God
hath yet been pleased to
spare this miserable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and as you are so, I
could not think any
person fitter for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
of this small
piece; since both your

willing, and your power
able to protect it.</p>

answer to the first; That
I was willing to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my Sovereign as

those many reproaches
and calumnies cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by his back-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the best account (that

all his actions, that he
might appear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

and dirt be

I wholly cast my self on
your Lordship, either
to pardon or condemn.</p>
            <p>But if my love to his

too much in his favour,

was the perversnesse and crookedness of these
times, that no loyal subject might without
danger attempt to write, nay hardly to speak
the truth of his Soveraign: for a sort of men
there were, who having by violence usurped
his Dominions, thought that they had no surer
ground to maintain their unjust possession,
then by scandalizing his most SACRED
MAIESTY and deceiving of his Subjects,

            <p>Gentlemen, it is to you in General
that I present this History, that you may
see, and be sensible, to whom you have been
loyal, and then I believe that you will
judge that your loyalty hath found it's just
reward in being loyal to so just a Prince: and
if any of you have suffered for him, read but
his sufferings, &amp; you cannot value your own.
Yet I intend not this at all to his pretended
<pb facs="tcp:54812:11"/>
Tavern friends; which I believe (whilest
they are so) are so onely there, and indeed I
cannot look upon these as faithfull Subjects;
for how can that man be loyal to his Prince,
who hath not the power to be true unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Drunken subjects, though never so loyal,

to write impartially, where I have not

            <p>If in some particulars affection hath sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Histories of <hi>Englands</hi>
late oppreessours have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
cloy'd and overladed the
exuberant Presse, whole
Volumes daily coming forth; either
of the Actions of the late long Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
or the Life of their aspiring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54812:13"/>
Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> which though
adorn'd with all those flatteries, that
could possibly proceed from the
most beneficed pens, yet cannot in
the least justifie their actions to the
more sober sort of people; for
though their memories may here
smell sweet to some, who have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tasted of their favour, then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
under their oppression, yet do
they but render them to the sufferers
more infamous, and to the Neuter
ridiculous, like <hi>the extolling of Don
Quixot's Chivalry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though there have been
some who have adventured to set
them out to the life, and paint them
in their own colours; yet have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these as far exceeded the
bounds of Truth, as the others came
short of it, rather exasperated by
their own, or to please their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferers,
into so great extremes
have either side been lead, out of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54812:13"/>
fear or flattery, anger or passion.</p>
            <p>Moderation and Impartiality are
the chiefest virtues of an Historian,
and therefore he who writes an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
should chuse such a subject to
write on, where neither fear nor gain
can induce him to flatter, anger or
passion, to too much bitternesse.</p>
            <p>Most of our modern Historians
have proposed to themselves either
profit, advantage or employment by
their Works, which hath made
them run into their so many grosse
errours and flatteries; whilst had
they only endeavoured to represent
things, persons and actions imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
they had gained to themselves
farre greater honour of true Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>I have chosen a subject to write
of, which I conceive may lead me to
a mediocrity, the Persons afflictions
may induce me to pity him, but they
will in most mens judgements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54812:14"/>
me from flattery. Nor need I
out of fear, I being now (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly)
out of his reach, mince
the truth of his (if any) bad actions.</p>
            <p>I confesse the Task I undertake is
highly adventurous, my pen may
slip, times may change, however my
heart shall guide me to an impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

               <hi>Charles</hi> the II. Heir apparent to
the Crown of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and crowned King of <hi>Scots,</hi>
whose History I intend to treat of,
was born on the 29. of <hi>May</hi> 1630.
to the great joy of the King, Queen,
and indeed the whole Nation; for
never yet had <hi>England</hi> a Prince born
of so noble an extract and grand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
his father by lineal right and
descent King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> his mother daughter to that
thrice Illustrious Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54812:14"/>
sirnamed the Great, and
<hi>Maria de Medicis.</hi> By his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers
side was he near allied to
the Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of his Aunt, the noble Princesse
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Elector Palatine of
<hi>Rhene,</hi> and King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by the marriage of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Sister the Princesse <hi>Mary,</hi> to the
Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Thus was he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
to most, of the most Potent
Princes in Christendome. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
might this Nation have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Government, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the vogue of that wisest of men
<hi>Solomon,</hi> who pronounces that
Kingdome blessed <hi>whose Prince is the
son of Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was some years after his birth
(according to the ancient Customes
of <hi>England</hi> for the Kings Eldest son)
invested Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> and
was in his minority brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54812:15"/>
the care of the Earle of <hi>Newea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
till in the year 1646. the Lord
<hi>Hopton's</hi> Army, in which he was,
being near inclosed by Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax,</hi> Generall of all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Forces in the <hi>Devizes</hi> of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
and the King his Fathers affairs
being in a desperate condition all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>England,</hi> he was by the serious
advice of his best friends, perswaded
to ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e shipping, and depart for the
<hi>Scillies,</hi> from whence he was by the
Parliament invited to return to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
but he thought it safer for his
Person to depart from thence to his
Sister at the <hi>Hague,</hi> till the Royall
affairs in <hi>England</hi> might gain a better
posture, which he did, and there
found a reception answerable to his
birth.</p>
            <p>Not long after the King his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Father, being in danger to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in <hi>Oxford</hi> by Generall <hi>Fairfax,</hi>
who returning out of the <hi>West,</hi> had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54812:15"/>
designed to block it up, took care
for his safety, and attended only by
Mr. <hi>Ashburnham</hi> (or as some say,
attending on him) went privily out
thence, and threw himself upon the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Army then at <hi>Newark,</hi> who
shortly after notwithstanding his
confidence of them, for a summe of
money delivered him up most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously
and traiterously to his
implacable Enemies, the <hi>English</hi>
Army. These after many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Treaties, and seeming wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
to come to an accord with
him, on that black day the 30. of
<hi>Ianuary</hi> 1648. most villanously
and trayterously beyond the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the World, murder'd
him.</p>
            <p>Thus far is a short view of those
hardships and afflictions undergone
by this noble Prince, during his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life and raign, we will now
proceed to those he hath since ran
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54812:16"/>
through, which we may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
particularly call his Own.</p>
            <p>Among which the Chief and
greatest, and from whence all his
other miseries flowed as from their
spring head, was the deprivation of
his Kingdome and Royalties; For
that part of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
which had usurped the whole
power or more, were not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to take away his Fathers life, but
by their Proclamation, deprive him
of all right in the Government of
those three Kingdomes, which they
take upon themselves, contrary both
to the Word of God, the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Lawes of the Nation, and his
own undoubted right by birth, he
being lineally descended from that
Family which had successively go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<hi>England</hi> for above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares.</p>
            <p>He was at the time of his Fathers
death, at the Court of his Sister the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54812:16"/>
Royall Princesse of <hi>Orange</hi> in the
<hi>Hague,</hi> in expectation to hear rather
of the Conclusion of a Treaty then
of his Murder, to which effect he
writ by the Lord <hi>Seymour</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Letter to him some short
time before his Death.</p>

            <p>And here he staid till he heard the
heart-breaking newes of his Fathers
Murther, when shortly after he took
his Iourney to the Queen his mother
in <hi>France;</hi> hoping there to get aid,
but found none which might render
him in a Capacitie to revenge his
Father's Death, or demand his own
Right by force: and in vain it was
to think of any fair means to attain
it. Yet there wanted not some friends
of his in <hi>England,</hi> who willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
how ready they were to
adventure themselves for him and
his right, as far as their weak abilities
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54812:17"/>
would stretch, caused under hand a
Proclamation to be printed, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
him King of <hi>England, Scotland,
France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and advising
all his good Subjects to give all due
Allegiance to him; but the low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Royallists then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the great strength, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of the Parliaments Army,
made this Proclamation unvalid,
and those who at a fit opportunity
would willingly have complied with
it, were forced to direct their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the contrary Goal.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>England</hi> prov'd thus
defective to his Interest, not so much
I dare say in Allegiance as power.
Yet <hi>Ireland</hi> is at his Devotion for the
Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Inchequin,</hi> having made a peace
with the <hi>Quondam</hi> Rebels, he is by
joynt consent both of Papists and
Protestants proclaimed King in most
towns of that Nation, <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54812:18"/>
               <hi>London Derry</hi> only excepted, which
were kept from their Allegiance, the
one by the Lieu. General <hi>Iones,</hi> the
other by Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> who joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strove to justifie the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi>'s late ctions.</p>
            <p>He being thus proclaimed there,
is solemnly invited to come over to
them, to which invitation, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
earnestly adds her desires, but
the best of his friends and Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
as earnestly disswaded him,
upon reasons drawn both from pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Policy, since in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the design not succeeding, it
would utterly ruine his hopes with
all the Protestant party then stedfast
to him both in <hi>Scotland</hi> &amp; <hi>England:</hi>
or that if he would needs venture
himself with this party, they desired
him at least to attend, whether by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good event of theirs, there might
be any probability of successe.</p>
            <p>'Tis supposed that this Council swai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54812:18"/>
with him more out of his real af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Protestant Religion,
then any other Politick reason. Yet
he immediately after took a journey
to the Isle of <hi>Iersey,</hi> which startled
some as though he had intended to
have proceeded thence for <hi>Ireland,</hi>
but that suspition proved unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
he was accompanied hither by
his Brother the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> (who
was lately come to him out of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
and many other Nobles and
Gentlemen; the Islanders immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon his arrival most joyfully
proclaimed him King; and the Lord
<hi>Iermyn</hi> Earl of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> was made
Governour of that Island, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Sir <hi>George Carteret</hi> his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Governour.</p>
            <p>The King sends from hence his
Royal Command to the Governour
of <hi>Gernsey</hi> Island, which was then
wholly subjected (<hi>Cornet</hi> Castle only
excepted) to the Parliaments force;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54812:19"/>
requiring him to surrender the said
Island to him, and that his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there might have liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their due obedience: but his
Command proved ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Many affirm, but how true I know
not, that the Reason of the Kings
removal to this Island was out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to surprize <hi>Dartmouth</hi> and some
other places in the West, by the
Levellers help, who having then
made a defection from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Army in <hi>England,</hi> were (say
they) to have joyned with the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allists
for the intents and purposes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
but whether so or no I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affirm; though I can certainly
tell this, that were it so, it proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
for the Levellers were
soon overpowered and quell'd.</p>
            <p>Whilest King <hi>Charles</hi> was here
expecting a Messenger from the
States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> came new's of the
unfortunate overthrow of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54812:19"/>
of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Army, by Lieu.
General <hi>Iones</hi> before <hi>Dublin,</hi> which
caused a general sorrow among all
his followers, for there had been
great hopes and expectations of that
Army, it amounting to no lesse then
twenty two thousand men, and was
esteemed able not onely to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>Dublin,</hi> but likewise to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<hi>Cromwell</hi>'s then new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Army in the field: yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the carelessness of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
or security of the Souldiers,
I am loath to judge: this mighty
Army then beleaguring <hi>Dublin,</hi>
was beat from before it by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
and utterly routed by the
third part of it's Number.</p>
            <p>This overthrow, the repulse of
Sir <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> and Col. <hi>Mervin</hi>
from <hi>London-Derry</hi> by Sir <hi>Charles
Coot,</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s suddain landing
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose motion now there
was no field Army either to attend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54812:20"/>
or oppose, made his Majesties affairs
grow almost as desperate in <hi>Ireland</hi>
as they were before in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Scots Kirk</hi> who had sold
their King into the hands of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
English</hi> Army, after they
heard that they had condemned him
to death, repent them of their Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
wash their hands from any
guilt in his bloud; Expostulate
with the <hi>English</hi> sitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
about their so severe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and protest against having any
hand in his Murder; and to make
the world believe they had yet some
touch of loyalty within them, they
had just after his death proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> eldest
Son to the late murthered King
<hi>Charles</hi> the first, and his lawfull
and undoubted Heir, King of <hi>Great
Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and
had immediately resolved in the
Committee of Estates then sitting to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54812:20"/>
send some sitting persons to treat
with his Majestie about sundry Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;
before his reception to the
Crown: but long Debates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrs
there were in the businesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could resolve what and
whom to send.</p>
            <p>For some there were in this <hi>Grand
Committee of Estates,</hi> who fee'd or
seduced by the Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi>
impeaded to the utmost of their
power and endeavours all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
in the businesse, so that once
instead of debating what or whom
they should send to his Majestie, it
came to be a debate whether they
should send or no, but at length a
letter and propositions was by the
prevailing part concluded on, and
Mr. <hi>Windram</hi> Laird of <hi>Libberton,</hi>
appointed to be the Messenger, who
on the 25. of <hi>September</hi> 1649. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his dispatches, and some
time after arrived before his Majestie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54812:21"/>
at Iersey. The chief of their desires
was to this effect.</p>
            <p>1. That his Majesty would graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
be pleased himself to sign the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, and that
he would passe an Act in Parliament
that every person in that Kingdome
might take it.</p>
            <p>2. That he would passe divers Acts
of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
was concluded on the two last Sessions.
1. For approving of their disclaiming
Duke <hi>Hamilton's</hi> last return. 2. For
receiving severall Acts made by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
for the Militia. 3. That the
Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> may have no nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
voice.</p>
            <p>3. That his Majestie would recall
the late Commissions given to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That he would put away all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
from about him.</p>
            <p>5. That he would appoint some
place about <hi>Holland</hi> to treat with their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54812:21"/>
Commissioners. An honour able Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the most noble Lords in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being to be appointed to attend his
Majesty, to whom likewise they would
send a sufficient provision to maintain
him, a train suitable to his birth and
deserved Greatnesse.</p>
            <p>6. That he would be graciously
pleased to give a speedy answer to their
desires.</p>
            <p>These Propositions were very
stifly debated <hi>Pro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> some
were so fierce that they would have

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
Propositions as dishonourable and
disadvantageous to his affairs. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were of opinion, that it would
more conduce to the Kings Interest
to accept of such Conditions as he
could agree with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
which would be a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
way to attain the Crown then by
<hi>Montrosses</hi> his designs (who had
lately received Commissions from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54812:22"/>
the King to assault the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with what force he could raise)
however the businesse was still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred
and delayed, and no answer
for a good while given to the Lord
<hi>Libberton,</hi> who earnestly prest it, till
such time as answer could come
from <hi>Montrosse,</hi> then in <hi>Holland:</hi>
and out of <hi>France,</hi> touching their
opinions concerning these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
concerning which <hi>Montrosse</hi>
teturned answer to his Majesty, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him <hi>to hear ken to the</hi> Scots <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
whilst they would propose
and agree to any thing which might
stand with his Majesties honour for
the restoring him to his Rights and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities.
That for himself he should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be content to endure banishment
from his Highnesse sight and person,
then in the least prejudice his affairs.</hi>
Thus this faithfull and loyall servant
courted Banishment, as the late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> had done

death) for his Master's good and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but too generous was he, and
had too great a sense of goodness and
gratitude to grant his request, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him this answer, <hi>That he had
so high a sense of his fidelity and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
all along, and that he had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so many signall services both for
his father and himself, that he could
not in honour leave him, and therefore
desired him to presse him no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen Mother likewise ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
presses her son to the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Propositions for
a Treaty, as the onely and readiest
way for the establishing of him in his
Kingdomes. These resolves of his
Mother and the Marquess of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse,</hi>
wrought strongly with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
yet not withstanding they are
as stoutly opposed by the Lord <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Byron, Gerard,</hi> and others,
whose chief opposition proceeded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54812:23"/>
from the alledged Treachery of the
<hi>Scots</hi> to his father, That they were
<hi>Scots</hi> still, and might practice the
same upon him. But the majority
of voices carrying it for a Treaty, it
was resolved on, yet in regard it
would require some time to frame
an answer, Sir <hi>William Flemming</hi>
was sent Agent to the Committee
of Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till such time
as the Laird <hi>Libberton</hi> could be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't.</p>
            <p>Short time after Mr. <hi>Windram</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a Letter &amp;
instructions by word of mouth,
whereby he gave the Committee of
Estates (who having long expected
were therefore more desirous to
hear what he now brought) an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how much he found his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
compliant to their Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz. That as to what acted in the
two last Sessions of Parliament, he was
content a General Act of Oblivion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54812:23"/>
should be passed, but could not approve
it. That neither those of</hi> Montrosses,
<hi>nor Duke</hi> Hamilton's <hi>party in his last
engagement should bear Office in State
without consent of Parliament. That
he had appointed</hi> Breda <hi>in</hi> Holland
<hi>for the place of a solemn Treaty, for
the making of a full accommodation,
and agreement between him and his
loving Subjects of</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>The Contents of his Letter were

                  <p>WE have received your Letters
lately presented to us, by Mr.
<hi>Windram</hi> of <hi>Libberton,</hi> and we
accept graciously all the expressions of
affection and fidelity therein contained
towards us, with your tender resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54812:24"/>
of our present Condition, and the
just indignation which you professe to
have against the execrable Murther
of our Father: And we believe that
your intentions are full of Candor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, as we are, and alwayes really
have been desirous to settle a clear and
right intelligence between us and our
Subjects of our ancient Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which may be an assured
foundation of their happinesse and
peace for the time to come, and an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means to root out all the seeds
of animosity and divisions caused by
these late troubles; and also to unite
the hearts and affections of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
one to another, and of them all to
us their King and lawfull Soveraign;
to the end that by their Obedience to
our Royal and just Authority, we
may be put in a Condition to maintain
them in peace and prosperity, and to
protect them in their Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as it appertains to us according
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54812:24"/>
to our charge and office of a King. And
as we have alwayes resolved to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
whatever is to be done by us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
these good effects, and for the just
satisfaction of all our Subjects in this
Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>We have now thought fit upon the
Return of Mr. <hi>Windram</hi> to command
and desire you to send unto us Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
sufficiently authorized to treat
and agree with us, both in Relation to
the Interest and just satisfaction of our
Subjects there, as also concerning the
aid and assistance, which in all reason
we may expect from them to bring and
reduce the murtherers of our late most
dear father of happy memory to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
punishment, and to recover our
just rights in all our Kingdomes. And
we will that they attend us on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>March</hi> at the Town of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
where we intend to be in Order
thereunto. And in confidence of a
Treaty, as also to make known to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54812:25"/>
and all the World, that we sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be agreed. VVe have resolved to
addresse these unto you under the
Name and Title of a Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and will and expect that you use this
grace no other wayes for any advantage
to the prejudice of us, or our affairs,
beyond what we have given this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
and Title for, namely, for the
Treaty and in order to it. Although
we have considerations sufficient, and
very important to disswade and oblige
us to do nothing in this kind antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
at this time. Also we hope the
confidence which we declare to have in
your clear and candid intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, will furnish you with strong
Arguments to form in your selves a
mutual confidence in us, which by
the blessing of God Almighty by your
just and prudent moderation, and by
that great desire we have to oblige all
our Subjects of that Kingdome, and by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54812:25"/>
the means of the Treaty which we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and hope for may be a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a full and happy peace, and
an assured security to this Nation for
the time to come, which we assure you
is wished of us with passion, and which
we shall endeavour by all means in our
power to effect.</p>

            <p>This is the full of his Majesties
Letter to the Committee of Estates
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and much to this effect
was there another writ by him to the
<hi>Committee of the Kirk.</hi> But this I the
rather fully insert in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Calumnies cast upon it, and by it
upon his Majesty. His enemies here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
taking occasion to carp upon
him, by pretending his inveterate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of revenge, which was so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the last precepts given him by
his dying father. I think, I need not
answer his enemies objection, they
by those carps, only condemning
themselves of a self-guiltinesse, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54812:26"/>
to the more sober sort of people I
shall referre it, and let them seriously
consider whether the beginning,
progresse and end of the Letter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
him not a man more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to peace and quietnesse, then
to revenge and destruction.</p>
            <p>The principal Objection which
his enemies have against him, is, that
he desires the aid of his <hi>Scotch</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to bring the murderers of his
Father to condigne punishment;
does this shew him a lover of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
or of Justice? I would fain
know which of his enemies or of
his Fathers Murderers, would not,
should I have done the same to any
of their so near Relations, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to have brought me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the utmost censure of the
Law.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, these letters are
seriously debated both in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Estates and <hi>Kirk,</hi> the first
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54812:26"/>
order its confideration to a select sub-Committee
of their own, consisting
of nine, Lords and others, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their opinions upon it to the
grand Committee, and these provide
ready a state of the Case to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which was shortly after to assemble.
But mean while a select number of
the <hi>Kirk</hi> and State make up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
who by common consent
were to consider what was to be
done about sending Commissioners
and Propositions to his Majesty;
these had strong and serious debates;
for the arrogant <hi>Kirkmen</hi> would not
have his Majesty admitted into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but upon Conditions which
should make him wholly subservient
to their commands: but the State
would have such tart conditions
wholly waved; and (though their
own were rough enough, yet) at
length a mediation is concluded on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54812:27"/>
between theirs and the <hi>Kirks.</hi> And
the Earle of <hi>Castles,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Burley</hi> and <hi>Libberton,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn
Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ieoffreys</hi> for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Broady, Lawson</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi>
are appointed Commissioners for
the <hi>Kirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These having received their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
and Instructions, took their
journey for <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; arrived at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
some few daies before his Majesty,
got thither. On the 16. <hi>March</hi> 1649.
he also arrived there, and on the 19.
the Lord <hi>VVent worth</hi> Master of the
Ceremonies conducted them to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
being come before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
who in a large Chamber pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
provided, expected them,
The Lord <hi>Castles</hi> in behalf of the
<hi>Estates,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> in behalf of
the <hi>Kirk,</hi> having made their Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
declared the occasion of their
coming, and shewing their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
they delivered the ensuing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54812:27"/>
Propositions in the behalf both of
the <hi>Kirk</hi> and States of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That all those who had been
excommunicated by the Church,
&amp; still continued so, should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
accesse to Court.</p>
               <p>2. That all Acts of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be by him
ratified and approved of. That the
solemn League and Covenant, the
Presbyterian Church-government.
The Directory, Confession and
Catechisme should be enjoyned in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and the same used and
practised in his family, and an Oath
to be taken by him, that He would
never oppose it, or endeavour to
alter it.</p>
               <p>3. That he would by solemn
Oath, and under his hand and seal
declare and acknowledge his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of the solemn League &amp;
Covenant, and the National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54812:28"/>
4. That he would consent and
agree that all civil matters might be
determined by subsequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
matters by the General
Kirk assembly, as was formerly
granted by his Royal father.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To these Propositions his Majesty
demanded,</p>
            <q>
               <p>Whether this were fully and
wholly all that the Committee of
Estates and Kirk in <hi>Scotland</hi> had to
desire or propound? and whether
these Commissioners had power
to remit or recede from any of
these particulars; and further, what
they had to propound concerning
his affairs in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>To which the Commissioners replied,</p>
            <q>
               <p>That they had acquainted him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54812:28"/>
with their full power, according
to the instructions they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Committees of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Kirk in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which his Majesty made
Answers That he would consider
of their Propositions, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not but to return them such an
Answer as might give his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Scotland</hi> satisfaction: and
so dismissed them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But let us thus leave his Majesty
and Council debating about the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners propositions,
and discourse a little about his affairs
under the conduct of the thrice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Illustrious Marquesse of
<hi>Montross,</hi> who having (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the opposition which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
gave to the design) obtained
Commissioners from his Majesty to
levy what force he could on that side
the sea, endeavoured to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54812:29"/>
of his power to effect it, but
chiefly among the Princes of the
<hi>German</hi> Empire, where he found
large and fair promises, but very little
real assistance, onely the Duke of
<hi>Holstein</hi> suppled him with four ships
well arm'd and mann'd, though
these were likewise by some strange
neglect delayed a long time at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi>
which much retarded the
service. Colonel <hi>Cochran</hi> likewise,
who had been sent Agent into <hi>Poland</hi>
to the <hi>Scottish</hi> Merchants there for
assistance of men and money, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received a considerable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of money, and good supply of
corn, disposed of the first to his own
use, sold the other, and himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from the service. General
<hi>King,</hi> who was expected out of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
with a party of Horse, came not
all; so many crosses there were in
the beginning of the businesse as
bad Omens to it's future ill successe.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54812:29"/>
But at length the Marquesse fearing
least if the King should conclude
with the <hi>Scots</hi> before he had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
any thing, his Commissions
would be recalled, fatally resolved
to depart <hi>Scotland</hi> as he was: so
with four ships indifferently well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
(but with not above six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hundred men, and those most
strangers) besides a small Frigat of
sixteen Guns, and one thousand five
hundred good Armes given him by
the Queen of <hi>Sweden;</hi> he set sail, and
this was all the strength he carried
with him from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to assault
that potent Kingdome. Two of
these ships, and those the biggest;
were sent before, and directed to
steer their course for the <hi>Orcades,</hi>
but these unfortunately met with a
storm; and were amongst those
rocky Islands, their men, armes and
ammunition cast away, so that a third
part of the force raised for this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:54812:30"/>
But notwithstanding these fatal
disasters, the sad presages of his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
the noble Marquess proceeds,
and with the small number that was
left him, lands amongst the Islands,
where he gets together a pretty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
number which had almost
the face of an Army, but was for the
most part composed of raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
fellows, a party of these he
sends out, who without resistance
enter the Isle of <hi>Orkney,</hi> there being
no Garrison there; from thence he
dispatches Commissions to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and the Islands adjacent, for the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Horse and Foot, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the inhabitants of those places
to which they were sent, could not
resist, obeyed; and not long after
the sending of those Commissions,
<hi>Montrosse</hi> himself, with those forces
he had, and those Gentlemen, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to engage in partaking of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
landed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the point
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54812:30"/>
of <hi>Cathanes,</hi> the very farthest land to
the <hi>Northwest</hi> of that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The people here whom he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to have joyned with him (were
so sensible of the miseries of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
war, and now more terrified
with the name of Foreigners,) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
their dwellings, and fled away,
some never stopping till they came
to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> who
were now assembled though they
had former advice of the Marquesses
designs, yet could not tell the
place of his landing, but now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
by the flying Countrey: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Lesley</hi> is commanded with the
body of the Army to march directly
towards them for fear <hi>Montrosse</hi>
should grow too numerous: and
Colonell <hi>Straughan,</hi> whose valour
the States highly approved, is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a party of select Horse to
advance before to hinder the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54812:31"/>
levyes, and if he saw oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to fight him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montrosse</hi> in the mean time to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the World, and because the
people should not be startled at his
invasion, whilst the King was upon
Treaty, publishes a very patheticall
Declaration, <hi rend="margQuotes">declaring the justnesse
of his cause, and to clear himself
from the aspersion of sinister ends,
and that his intention was onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some particular persons, who
had against the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
raised and maintained a
war against his Majesties father,
and did now by their wiles and
subtile practices endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the son also; and therefore
exhorting all Subjects of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to endeavour to free themselves
from the tyranny of those who
then by an usurped power ruled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them.</hi> But notwithstanding
this Declaration the Countrey came
very slowly in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54812:31"/>
               <hi>Straughan</hi> in the mean time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
with all possible speed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Royal party, whilest <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse</hi>
had not for indeed he could
not effect any thing Material besides
the fortifying of <hi>Dunbath</hi> Castle: but
the Marquess hearing of the Enemies
approach, made his whole Forces
march at a great rate to recover a
passe; yet neverthelesse before they
could come at it, the front of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
discovered <hi>Straughan</hi>'s forlorn
hope, who marching with hast upon
the Marquesses Army, found them
both almost tired, and out of breath
and Order; however a forlorn hope
of 100. Foot are drawn out to meet
them, who giving them a resolute
Charge, forced them to no Orderly
Retreat, but being seconded by
<hi>Straughan</hi>'s whole body of Horse,
they again maintained their ground,
resolutely Charging upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses
main Body: the Islanders
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54812:32"/>
immediately threw down their arms
and cryed for quarter, but the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steiners</hi>
and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> made an
Orderly retreat for the present into
some bushes, which having a short
time defended, they were at last en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to yield.</p>
            <p>This was a sad blow to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there being
great hopes, that had <hi>Montrosse</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
and kept them in play, both
<hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>State</hi> would have come to
milder Conditions with him: Yet
the Marquess himself escaped for the
present out of this Battel, Though
there were near two hundred slain,
and twelve hundred taken in the
field (for the Country coming in
upon them, few Escaped (Amongst
the Prisoners of Note, there were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Col. <hi>Hurry,</hi> the Lord <hi>Frenderick,</hi>
Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgettey,</hi> Col. <hi>Hay</hi>
of <hi>Noughton,</hi> Col. <hi>Grey</hi> and several
other Officers; together with the

            <p>But long it was not ere this thrice
Heroick Marquess fell into the hands
of these his cruel, Obdurate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
enemies, for though when
he saw the battel at a losse, he had
saved himself by escaping out of the
Field, and had afterwards to disguise
himself changed his habit with a
<hi>Highlander,</hi> yet all could not prevail
to his Escape, for the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
was raised up in armes in search
after him, and a price set upon his
head by the States, but especially the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers exhorted the
people to endeavour his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a thing necessary to their
Salvation.</p>
            <p>At length the whole Countrey
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54812:33"/>
being up in armes about him, and
no way left for this distressed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
to escape, he thought it better
to throw himself upon the Lord
<hi>Aston,</hi> formerly a friend of his, and
now out in the search with some of
his Tenants, then fall into the hands
of his more inveterate and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enemies. But this Lord, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he had formerly been <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse</hi>'s
follower, either out of fear or
covetousness durst not conceal him;
but sent him with a strong Guard to
<hi>David Lesley;</hi> by whom he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
sent to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after brought to his Tryal before
the Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> where
all the while notwithstanding those
many ignominious affronts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
thrown upon him (as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in triumphant manner brought
through <hi>Edenburgh</hi> bound in a Cart)
yet he carried himself with so much
Magnanimity and Courage, That
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54812:33"/>
those of his Enemies, who did not
pity him, yet were almost ashamed
of their villanies towards him.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon
the first newes of this Noble Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
being made a prisoner, met,
and resolved to passe a sentence upon
him before either he was come up,
or had at all answered for himself, &amp;
though, when they allowed him to
speak somewhat for himself, (which
he pronounced with gravity void
of Passion,) yet he had as good have
held his peace; for the sentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agreed upon, it was pass't to this
effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That he should be carried to the
place from whence he came, and
from thence tomorrow being the
21. day of <hi>May</hi> 1650.) be carried
to the high Crosse in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
and be hanged upon a Gibbet
thirty foot high, and there hang
for the space of three hours in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54812:34"/>
sight and view of all people, with
his History and Declaration han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
about his Neck; after which
he should be taken down, behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and quartered; his head to be
placed upon the <hi>Talbooth</hi> or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
house in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and his
leggs and arms over the gates of the
Cities of <hi>Sterling, Glascow, S. Iohns
town,</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> And in case
he repented (by which means his
sentence of Excommunication
might be taken off by the <hi>Kirk</hi>) the
bulk of his body might be buried
in <hi>Grayfriers,</hi> if not, to be buried
in the Common burying place for
thieves and robbers.</q> Thus far did
their unparallel'd hatred and malice
extend even to his dead Corps.</p>
            <p>This Sentence being aggravated
by the Chancellor in the utmost
terms of horrour that his spleen
could invent, was yet mildly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionately
received by this Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54812:34"/>
Marquess, who answered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to it. But, <q>That he took it
for a greater honour to have his
head stand on the prison gate for
this quarrel, then to have his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
in the Kings Bed-chamber;
And least his loyalty should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
they had highly honoured
him, in designing lasting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to four of the chiefest Cities
to bear up his memorial to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
wishing he had flesh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have sent a piece to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
city in Christendome, to witness
his loyalty to his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for his Execution, richly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
in a scarlet cloak laced with
gold, but his Soul adorned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Loyalty the far richer Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the two, he marched along
the street with so composed a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Gravity, that most of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54812:35"/>
Enemies either pityed or admired
him: being come to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he was some time detained
with many frivolous questions of
that flea bitten Clergy, being ready
to mount up the ladder, he said it was
Iacob'<hi>s ladder by which he should
mount to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Speech to the people was
short, and that much to this effect.
<q>That he was sorry if his end should
be scandalous to any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
but that it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to the righteous accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the wayes of the wicked,
that they who knew him should
not disesteem him for this ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
death. That he confessed
it was the judgement of God upon
him for his private sins; but as for
his condemners, they were but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.
That they had perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
judgement and justice, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the poor: yet he desired
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54812:35"/>
God to forgive them, for he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
forgave them. That what he
did in that Kingdome, he did it in
obedience to the just commands
of his Sovereign, to assist him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those which rose up against
him. That it was not his fault that
he lay under the censure of the
Church, since 'twas only for doing
his duty. That for what was said
of him, that he should blame the
King, he said, 'twas most false,
for (saies he) the late King lived a
Saint, and died a Martyr. That if
ever he should wish his soul in any
mans place, it should be in his.
That for the King now living, he
was a Prince under whom any
people might live most happily,
his commands were righteous, his
promises faithfull, and his dealings
just. Finally, that he commended
his soul to God, his service to his
Prince, his good will to his friends,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54812:36"/>
and his name and charity to all
good people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the summe of his Speech
on the ladder, which, and some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
prayers being finished, he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up to the top of that prodigious
Gibbet, where his History and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
being tied about his neck, and
his hands bound by the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he turned about and gave him
some gold, asking; <hi>If they had any
more dishonour, as they conceived it, to
put upon him, he was ready to accept it,</hi>
and then with a great deal of magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
bidding the Executioner turn
him off when he should hold up his
hands, it was accordingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Thus nobly lived, and thus igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously
and yet <hi>nobly</hi> died: the
truest of friends, the loyallest of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the faithfullest of servants, the
best of Masters, and the valiantest of
Captains. <hi>Iames Graham,</hi> Marquesse
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54812:36"/>
of <hi>Montrosse</hi> Earl of <hi>Rincardin,</hi> Lord
of <hi>Groam</hi> and Baron of <hi>Montdieu,</hi>
whose death was not only lamented
as a private but rather as a publick
loss: most of the Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
the unfortunate fall of so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Heroick a person; For he was
endowed with such winning graces,
that wherever he came he was both
honoured and esteemed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nded, both feared
and loved.</p>
            <p>His enemies Malice, though he
was dead, kept still alive; for after
they had beheaded him and cut off
his quarters, they would not permit
that Bulk of his body which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be buried in any other place
then the <hi>Borough Moor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this noble Marquess suffered
not alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for soon after Col. <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
(notwithstanding he pleaded the
benefit of Quarter,) young <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
of <hi>Daersie,</hi> (a most compleat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54812:37"/>
Gentleman) Sir <hi>Francis Hay,</hi> &amp; Col.
<hi>Sibbalds,</hi> two most accomplished
persons, though they had all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be beheaded.</p>
            <p>There was like wise one Captain
<hi>Charters,</hi> who being put in hopes of
life by the perfidious <hi>Kirk,</hi> upon his
recantation, made a long Speech up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Scaffold, acknowledging his
Apostacy from the Covenant, and
desiring to be reconciled to the <hi>Kirk,</hi>
but had notwithstanding his head
struck off.</p>
            <p>This was the fatal and Tragical
Event of his Majesties affairs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
under <hi>Montrosse</hi>'s Conduct:
let us now turn to see how the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at <hi>Breda</hi> went on in the mean
time.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any farther,
give me leave to speak a word or
two, concerning the Magnanimous
Col. <hi>VVil. Sibbalds,</hi> who (say some)
confessed himself guilty of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54812:37"/>
of D. <hi>Dorislaus</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Agent
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which I must ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
confesse I believe upon good
grounds to be only a Calumnie and
Scannal raised from the so far exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Malice of his Enemies, for I can
find nothing either in his Speech at
death, or in any Records of credit
tending to such a Confession, though
much against any likelyhood of it:
nor can I imagine that any man
could with so much resolution as he
dyed with, part from this World, and
have so great a load and blot upon
Conscience. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Great debates there were in the
mean time between his Majesty and
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Treaty, and great demurres
there were upon it, for besides the
striving of some Lords who had a
kind of a serious Antipathy to the
<hi>Scots</hi> perfidiousnesse, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to perswade his Majesty not to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54812:38"/>
trust them who had betrayed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The King himself stuck highly
as he had reason, about the business
of Taking the <hi>Covenant;</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>There was no reason why he
should be enforced to relinquish the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of his Fathers, and whilest he
permitted to his Subjects Liberty of
Conscience, it would be very inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with their so earnestly pretended
desires of a peace and agreement, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him the same priviledge which he
gave them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That Covenant tendred, and so
earnestly prest upon him by them, was
an Obligatory Covenant to bind the
Subjects to him, and not for him to
swear to; and therefore he judged it
sufficiently satisfactory to passe an Act
for the peoples taking it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest these demurres and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
were in the Treaty, the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Commissioners give a visit to the
Illustrious Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whom
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54812:38"/>
they intreat to be a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and their King. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
like wise withdraw's himself for
some time from <hi>Breda</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi>
there to advise with his Aunt the
Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
and other friends, about what
he were best to resolve on or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>But the Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> though
their proposed Conditions were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
unreasonable, yet resolve to
adde more weight to the Scale: the
Earl of <hi>Carnwarth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Murrey</hi>
are sent over to the Commissioners
at <hi>Breda</hi> with new instructions and
propositions; as,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That his Majesty should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all Acts done in some late Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Parliament, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That neither</hi> Montross <hi>nor any
of his Adherents be admitted to come
into the Kingdome of</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54812:39"/>
But notwithstanding the harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Conditions, the King is
earnestly pressed to come to a full
Conclusion with the <hi>Scots,</hi> Though
many Lords of the contrary faction
pleaded for an utter rejectment of
their propositions, alledging to his
Majesty, <hi>That the Covenanters hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
perfidiousnesse to his Father, might
be a sufficient motive and inducement
for him not to trust them; That the
more willing he was to condescend to
their propositions, the more impudent
they were still in proposing things most
unreasonable; That should he accept
of their Conditions, they would so tye
up his hands that he would be then but
a King onely in Title, which he was
without them.</hi> On the other side, the
Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> the Lords <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,
Piercy,</hi> and others of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Council who stood for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
with the <hi>Scots,</hi> urged,
<hi>That his Majesties affairs, both in</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54812:39"/>
Ireland, <hi>under the Marquess of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tross,
<hi>and in the Navy under Prince</hi>
Rupert, <hi>were in so weak and tottering
a Condition, that no help could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them; That all the Princes
in</hi> Europe <hi>were so imbroyled in warrs
of their own, that it was in vain to
crave any foreign aid; And that
therefore there was no way left for his
Majesty to regain his lost Rights and
Kingdomes but by complying with his
Subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and though it
were upon such Conditions as would
at first seem harsh, those Curbs might
in time (possession once got) be thrown
off by degrees:</hi> these reasons swayed
with his Majesty, and the Treaty
went on with a clearer face then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
            <p>But now there happens a strong
demurre, or as most supposed, a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
that would wholly break off
the Treaty, for the newes of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trosse</hi>'s
ignominious death being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54812:40"/>
come to <hi>Breda,</hi> extremely incensed
the whole Court, and those who
were against the Treaty, bestirred
themselves strongly, still endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to avert the King wholly from
it, by telling him, <q>That they had
by thus Murdering his Lieutenant,
Demonstrated to the World what
they would do to him if they had
him in their power. That it was
an act of rashnesse and desperation
to trust them, or to have any more
to do with such a perfidious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
That they only cunningly
and subtilly endeavoured to entrap
him that they might destroy him.</q>
But not withstanding their heat, his
Majesty conceals his anger, (which
doubtless could not but be great, for
the death, and the so ignominious
death of so good and loyal a Subject
and Servant; and that too in his
quarrel and for obeying his just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
(only he expresses his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54812:40"/>
of their so strange proceedings
to the Committee of Estates by a
Message sent by Mr. <hi>Murrey</hi> to this
effect.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That it could not but grieve
and perplex him, to hear, that
whilst they pretended to conclude
a peace, they proceeded in the
way of War; and that whilst they
treated of an Accord with him, they
shed the bloud of his best Subjects,
and that in such a manner, that if
true as reported, they could not
imagine but it must extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
him, he therefore desired
them to give him an account of
their businesse.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To this they return Answer;</p>
            <q>
               <p>That their affections were still
reall to him, and that it rejoyced
their very soules, to hear that he
would be willing to concurre with
them in a peace and agreement,
That as for the Death of <hi>Montross,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54812:41"/>
They desired it might be no obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in the way, for that they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but with a reall intention
to promote his interest.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus they endeavoured to excuse
themselves, but it was not their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
nor their so many reiterated
Protestations of fidelity, but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Kings affaires, which
drew him not long after to conclude
the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the violent opposers of it) by
condescending to most of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
            <p>The conclusion of the Treaty was
soon carried to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where
the Parliament being met, it was
yet by some of those who favoured
the Sectarian party in <hi>England</hi> made
a debate, <hi>whether they should make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more addresses to the King.</hi> So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
were they even after the
Treaty was concluded with him, but
there were found but thirty of these
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54812:41"/>
malevolent persons: so to the major
part of the Votes carrying it in the
affirmative, it was Resolved that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
message should be sent unto
him, to invite him to make all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
speed to his Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
protesting that they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
lives and fortunes in assisting
him to regain his Right and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
but they not onely debarre
him from having those whom he
chiefly favoured to wait upon him,
but likewise prohibit the Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
the Earles of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and
<hi>Seaforth,</hi> and many other persons of
quality's return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
they nominate such persons as they
thought fit out of their own gang to
be officers of his houshold there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iuncto</hi> then sitting and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
in <hi>England,</hi> had certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
all along of the proceeds
of the Treaty between his Majestie
and the <hi>Scots,</hi> together with their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54812:42"/>
Protestations to assist him in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his Rights in <hi>England</hi> by
some who sat in the Parliament of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> betrayed their counsels,
and earnestly solicited the <hi>English</hi> to
assault <hi>Scotland,</hi> before they were
themselves assaulted and invaded,
to which effect they prepare an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
without any just pretence, which
they give to <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> to
command, making him Generalissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
of all the Forces of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
in the room of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Fairfax,</hi> whose Commission
was between taken away and laid
down.</p>
            <p>Some time before his Majestie's
departure from <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
news was brought of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
losse of all Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Fleet,
most of his ships being either taken,
sunk or burnt by General <hi>Blake,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
to the <hi>English</hi> Navy; so though
the Treaty was concluded with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54812:42"/>
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Majestie's affairs went
every where else to wrack.</p>
            <p>At length, all things being in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
his Majesty about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Iune</hi> 1650. took shipping at
<hi>Scheveleng</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
storm, and narrow scape of
some <hi>English</hi> Vessels which lay in wait
for him, arrived at <hi>Spey</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> Some Lords are sent down
to receive him, &amp; to accompany him
to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where two stately hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are richly provided and furnish't
to entertain him.</p>
            <p>He was all along the Countrey
entertained with the general joy of
all the people, several presents being
given to him by the Towns as he
came along. <hi>Aberdeen</hi> presented him
with 1500. <hi>l.</hi> but the Committee of
<hi>Estates</hi> &amp; <hi>Kirk</hi> fearing that such diet
would make too unweildy to their
pleasures, sent an injunction to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
places, requiring them that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54812:43"/>
moneys they had to bestow,
they should bring it unto such Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries
as should be appointed by
them. Thus they permit not the
Subjects to shew their good will to
their Sovereign, nor him to receive
it.</p>
            <p>Nor were the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kirk</hi> as
yet content with those hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but they send him new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
to <hi>Dundee</hi> to sign, which
after some reluctancy he performed;
for indeed he could do no otherwise,
being now in their clutches.</p>
            <p>The Parliament and Committee
of <hi>Estates</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> had while they
expected his Majestie's arrivall been
consulting about the framing of an
Army, every fourth man in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is ordered to be trained; and
sixteen thousand foot, and six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
horse to be raised for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
present service. Of this Army
the Earle of <hi>Leven</hi> is made General
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54812:43"/>
of the Foot, and <hi>Holborne</hi> Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<hi>David Lesley</hi> Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Horse, and <hi>Montgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Major General: the place of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralissimo</hi>
was reserved for the
King, though he never went into the
field with his Army.</p>
            <p>His Majesty being come to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
is received by the Parliament
and Committee of <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Kirk,</hi>
with infinite complements and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of fidelity and affection,
and with great acclamations of joy
from the people, and on the 15. of
<hi>Iuly</hi> is again solemnly proclaimed
King at <hi>Edenburgh</hi>-Crosse, but his
coronation yet deferred by reason of
the then troubles.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>English</hi> Army, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Scots</hi> had expostulaled
them the unjustnesse of invading
their Countrey, was advanced upon
the borders, and at <hi>Muscleborough</hi>
the <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>Montgomery</hi> with a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54812:44"/>
small party, set upon the <hi>English</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but were worsted, and so the
two Armies moved at a distance one
from the other, till they came as far
as <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> had got a
considerable advantage, by reason of
a passe, and bragg'd they had got the
<hi>English</hi> in a pound: but whether
by their own carelessenesse and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>security;
or the over reaching, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and valour of the <hi>English,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, a total loss they had there, the
passe gain'd from them, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly routed and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>I am the shorter in relating the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
between these two Armies, in
regard that though the King was
made <hi>Generalisssimo;</hi> yet he had no
influence upon the Army, which
might rather be called the <hi>States</hi> or
<hi>Kirks</hi> then the Kings; for though he
was there present, and bore the title
of King, yet they had the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54812:44"/>
and made and revoked Laws and
Orders.</p>
            <p>The King was then with the
<hi>States</hi> at Saint <hi>Iohnstones,</hi> when the
news of this losse, and that of
the Death of his Sister the Princesse
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> arrived much about the
same time, and some have been bold
to affirm that the latter grieved him
more then the former, in regard of
the imperiousnesse, which 'twas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> would
have usurped, had the successe answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their minds.</p>
            <p>And sufficiently imperious were
both they and the <hi>Kirk</hi> already, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the ill fortune of their
affairs; for, so great was their inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
towards his Majesty, in
their earnestnesse to purge his house,
in extorting Declarations from him
against his own party and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and in usurping the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of affairs to themselves,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54812:45"/>
in placing guards of their own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
upon his Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That his
sacred Majesty no longer able to suffer
such intolerable affronts and abuses,
went secretly away, accompanied
onely with four horse towards the
<hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Huntley,</hi> the Ealres of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi>
and <hi>Atholl,</hi> the Lords <hi>Ogilby</hi>
and <hi>Newburgh,</hi> with the <hi>Gourdons</hi>
were ready to appear for him with a
considerable party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> was not at this time only
perplexed with a foreign enemy in
her bowels, but with civil distempers
and divisions; for in the <hi>West</hi> there
was a party under the command of
<hi>Straughan</hi> and <hi>Kerr,</hi> who declared
against the actions of the Committee
of Estates,<q> for their too much hast
and precipitation in the Treaty
with the King for their receiving
him before he had given any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a real change. That they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54812:45"/>
believed his profession of the cause
and Covenant was counterfeit, &amp;
therefore refused to submit to his
power;</q> These men were purely
for the <hi>Kirk</hi> against the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Another Party there was in the
North under the Command of
<hi>Huntley, Atholl, Seaforth,</hi> &amp;c. who
declared purely for the Kingly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
disclaiming and disowning
all power or order of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
or Committee of Estates.
These having gotten together a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
party, it was supposed by
the Committee of Estates that his
Majesty was gon to them, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to quiet and allay them if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
an Act of Indemnity was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Parliament for what they had
done; but they sleighted it, fell upon
Sir <hi>Iohn Brown</hi>'s Regiment, &amp; slew
and took prisoners many of his men;
Whereupon Lieu. General <hi>David
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54812:46"/>
Lesley</hi> was sent against; but the
whole businesse after the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to S. <hi>Iohnston<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> ended in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>The third and greatest party were
the Parliament and Committee of
Estates &amp; <hi>Kirk,</hi> who were equally for
King and <hi>Kirk;</hi> these were highly
perplexed and discontented at the
King's going away from S. <hi>Iohns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s,
and the more because they
feared he was gon to the <hi>Atholmen,</hi>
many controversies and consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were had about it; some were so
rigid as to propose, that since he had
diserted them, they should look
no more after him, but let him take
his own wayes; Others were more
mild, and would yet have him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their resentment for his
leaving them; nor wanted there
some sticklers for his Majesty; at
length it was concluded that Major
General <hi>Montgomery</hi> should speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54812:46"/>
march after him, and earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him to return to S. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montgomery</hi> according to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
went, and having had secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that his Majesty was at the
Lord <hi>Dedup</hi>'s house in the North
confines of <hi>Fife;</hi> he first surrounds the
house, and then sends in a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to acquaint the King with the
earnest desires of the Committee of
Estates; that he would graciously be
pleased to return with him to Saint
<hi>Iohnston</hi>'s, but his Majesty at first ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
refused, as scorning to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that slavery which they had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
him to, he was in the mean
time earnestly solicited by <hi>Huntley,</hi>
and the <hi>Gordons</hi> to adhere solely to
them, which he so much seemed to
incline to, that he had almost made
the breach implacable between that
party and the <hi>Kirk;</hi> but at length up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
several propositions granted him,
he returned with <hi>Montgomery</hi> to S.
<hi>Iohnston</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54812:47"/>
The King being thus returned,
and <hi>Huntley</hi>'s party come in by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
those with him to bear pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Offices, a general Meeting
was resolved on to be held at Saint
<hi>Iohnston</hi>'s, which should consist of
King, Lords, Barons, Burgesses and
the Assembly of Ministers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Committee of the <hi>Kirk</hi> are
summoned to meet, but stand off,
alledging that <hi>Sterling</hi> was the more
convenient place to meet in; To
which the States answered, that they
esteemed S. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s the fitter, that
if they would not meet, they should
consult for their own securities, but
at length they consent; The grand
Assembly meets, and all parties seem
now agreed. Several Lords formerly
in disfavour with the <hi>Kirk,</hi> are
received into Command in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or have liberty to sit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
such as <hi>Hamilton, Lauderdale,

in the Army. Thus did their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
begin to be Cemented, which
else must necessarily have hastened
their Ruine.</p>
            <p>About this time the King received
the sad newes of the Death of the
thrice Illustrious Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
Brother-in-law to his Majesty, and
who had demonstrated himself a
true and faithfull friend to him in his
necessities; his Lady the Royal
Princesse <hi>Mary</hi> was by him left great
with Child, and soon after his death
delivered of a <hi>Posthume</hi> son.</p>
            <p>And now on the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the
day appointed by the grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
at S. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s, the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
having been removed to <hi>Scone</hi>
the usual place for the Coronation
of the Kings of <hi>Scotland;</hi> First his
Majesty in a Princes Robe, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
from his Bed-chamber by the

               <hi>Constable</hi> and Marshal to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of presence, where he was by
the Lord <hi>Angus</hi> Chamberlain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a chair under a cloth of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
Then the Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of Barons and Burroughs
entred the Room, and having shown
themselves to his Majesty, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
spake to this effect. <q>Sir, your
good Subjects desire you may be
crowned, as righteous and lawfull
heir of the Crown of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that you would maintain
the present professed Religion, the
National Covenant and Solemn
League and Covenant. That you
would graciously be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them under your protection,
to govern them according to law,
to defend them in their rights and
priviledges by your Royal power,
they offering themselves in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner to your Majesty with
their vowes to bestow land, life
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54812:48"/>
and what else is in their power for
the maintenance of Religion, for
the safety of your Majesties sacred
person, and maintenance of your
Crown, which they entreat your
Majesty to accept, and pray Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God that for many years
you may enioy the same.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King to this made Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q> I do esteem the affections of
my good people more then the
Crowns of many kingdoms, and
shall be ready by Gods assistance
to bestow my life in their defence,
wishing to live no longer, then I
may see Religion and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
flourish in all happiness.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ceremony performed, the

               </gap>nded on a stage 24. foot square,
and seated himself in a chair to hear
the sermon; upon this stage there was
another smaller stage erected, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Throne stood. His Majesty
being seated on the Chair, a sermon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54812:49"/>
was preached by <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
of the Commission of the
General Assembly: Sermon being
ended, the National Covenant of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; the solemn League and
Covenant were distinctly read;
which done, the Oath was ministred
in these words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I <hi>Charles</hi> King of great <hi>Britain,
France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> do assure and
declare by my solemn Oath in the
presence of Almight God the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of all hearts, my allowance
and approbation of the National
Covenant, &amp; of the solemn League
and Covenant; and faithfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
my self to prosecute the ends
thereof in my station and calling;
and that I for my self and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
shall consent and agree to all
Acts of Parliament enjoyning the
National Covenant, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
League and Covenant:
and fully establish Presbyterian
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54812:50"/>
Government, the Directory of
Worship, Confession of Faith,
and Catechisms in the Kingdome
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they are approved
by the general Assemblies of this
Kirk, &amp; Parliament of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that I shall give my
Royal assent to Acts and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of this Parliament passed,
or to be passed, injoining the same
in my other Dominions. And that
I shall observe these in mine own
practice and Family, and shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make opposition to any of
those, or endeavour any change
thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King having thus solemnly
sworn, the National covenant, the
solemn League and Covenant, with
the Oath subjoined, was by him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwritten
in the presence of them
all; which done, the King ascended
the other Stage, and sate down in
the Throne. Then the Lords great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54812:50"/>
Constable and marshal went to the
four corners of the Stage, <hi>Lyon</hi> king
at Arms going before them, who
spoke these words to the people:
<hi>Sirs, I do present unto you the King,</hi>
CHARLES, <hi>the Rightful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
heir of the Crown and Dignity
of this Realm; this day is by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of this Kingdom appointed for
his Coronation. And are you not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have him for your King, and
become subject to his commandments?</hi>
At this action the king stood up, and
shewed himself to the people round
about, who expressed their consent
by their joiful acclamations, crying,
<hi>God save King</hi> CHARLES <hi>the</hi>
Second.</p>
            <p>Then his majesty descended from
his Throne into the chaire, where
he sate to hear the Sermon, of whom
the minister accompanied with som
others of his Tribe, demanded if he
were willing to take the Cornonation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54812:51"/>
Oath, according as it was contained
in the eighth Act of the first Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of King <hi>James</hi> the VI. his
Royal grandfather. The King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
he was most willing. Then
was the oath read aloud by the <hi>Lyon</hi>
King at Arms in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Because that the encrease of
Virtue, and suppressing Idolatry
craveth that the Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be of one perfect Religion,
which of God's mercy is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
professed within this Realm.
Therefore it is statuted and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our Soveraigne Lord, my
Lord Regent, and three Estates of
this present Parliament. That all
Kings, Princes, and Magistrates
whatsoever, holding their place,
which hereafter at any time shall
happen to reigne and beare rule
over this Realm, at the time of
their Coronation, and receit of
their Princely Authority make
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54812:51"/>
their faithful promise in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Eternal God: That
enduring the whole course of their
lives, they shall serve the same
Eternal God, to the uttermost
of their power, according as he
hath required in his most holy
Word, revealed and contained in
the New and Old Testaments, and
according to the same words shall
maintaine the true Religion of
Christ Jesus, the preaching of his
holy Word, and the due and right
ministration of the sacraments,
now received &amp; preached within
this Realm, and shall abolish and
gain-stand all false Religions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the same, &amp; shall rule the
people committed to their charge
according to the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God revealed in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Word, and according to the
laudable Laws and Constitutions
received in this Realm, no waies
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54812:52"/>
repugnant to the said Word of the
Eternal God, and shall procure
to the utmost of their power, to
the <hi>Kirk</hi> of God, and whole
christian people, true and perfect
peace in time coming. The rights
and rents with all just priviledges
of the crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to pre
serve and keep inviolated, neither
shall they transfer or alienate the
same. They shall forbid and repress
all in all Estates and Degrees, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Oppression, and all kinde of
Wrong in all Judgement. They
shall command and procure that
Justice and Equity be kept to all
creatures without exception, as
the Lord and Father of mercies be
merciful unto them. And out of
their Lands and Empire they shall
be careful to root out all Hereticks
and enemies to the true Worship
of God, that shall be convict by
the true <hi>Kirk</hi> of God of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54812:52"/>
crimes; and that he shall
faithfully affirm the things above
written by the solemn Oath.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Oath thus read, the Minister
tendered it to the King, who kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and holding up his right hand,
sware thus. By the Eternal &amp; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
GOD, who liveth &amp; reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for ever, I shall observe and keep
all that is contained in this Oath.</p>
            <p>Then was the King disrobed by
the Lord Chamberlain of the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Robe, with which he entred the
church, and vested with his Royal
Robes, &amp; so supported as before, he
removed to the chair placed on the
<hi>North</hi> side of the Kirk, whither the
sword was first brought from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by Sir <hi>William Cockburn</hi> of <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi>
Gentleman usher, who delivers
it to the great Chamberlain, and he
making a short speech, delivers it to
his Majesty, by whom it was given
into the great Constable's hands,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54812:53"/>
and by him girt to the King's side.</p>
            <p>Then his Majesty sitting down in
the Chair, the spurs are put on him
by the Earl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Archibald</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Argyle,</hi>
takes the Crown into his hands, and
after a short Prayer made by the
minister, puts it upon his Majesties
head.</p>
            <p>Which done, the Lion King of
Arms, the great Constable standing
by him, called the Nobility one by
one, who came all, and kneeling,
and touching the Crown upon the
King's head with their right hand,
swore thus: <hi>By the Eternal and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, who liveth and reigneth for
ever, I shall support thee to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</hi>
The obligatory Oath was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
read to the people, they hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up their hands.</p>
            <p>Lastly; after the Earls of <hi>Craford</hi>
and <hi>Lindesay</hi> had delivered his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
the Scepter, he returned again to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54812:53"/>
the Stage, where he was installed in
the Throne by the Marquess of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi>
and after a short exhortation of
Master <hi>Robert Douglasses,</hi> returned
to his Pallace with the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his head in the same manner as
he came.</p>
            <p>This is a full relation of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
performed at his Majesties

            <p>Presently after the coronation the
King and Nobles returned in a most

Kings Majesty having a guard to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

were now given as well to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists

was made Liev. General of
the Army, and <hi>Middleton</hi> Lieu. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Horse.</p>
            <p>The levies came in apace to the
general Rendezvouse, which was
appointed on the <hi>East</hi> part of <hi>Fife,</hi>
whither his Majesty in person
went to encourage his souldiers,

The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>
which had adiourned to give time
for his Majesties Coronation; being
met again, there were strong endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
of the Kings, that several Lords
of the Royal party should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their seats in Parliament; but
the Assemblies of the <hi>Kirk</hi> at <hi>Sterling</hi>
and <hi>Aberdeen</hi> as strongly oppose it,
and shew themselves discontented
both at this proposal, &amp; likewise at
the new Levies, in regard they were
there admitted to commands in the
Army, as they now desired to have
place in Parliament; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these murmurings, they
were upon their reconciliation to
the church, and passing the Stool of
Repentance, re-admitted to their
places in Parliament, such were
Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Marquesse of
<hi>Huntley,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Calender, Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and others.</p>
            <p>But stil not only many of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54812:55"/>
(notwithstanding there was
a select Committee appointed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
and punish such persons who
any way confronted and murmured
against any designs or acts of State)
raile against these proceedings; but
some of the Nobles too are discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
insomuch that the Earle of
<hi>Sutherland</hi> utterly refused to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with them, and if he could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
would have opposed them by
force.</p>
            <p>And indeed very many or most of
the Presbyterians were discontented;
For the Royal party by the admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those Lords and others, was
grown stronger then the Kirk's, and
now bore all the sway, which made
the proud Marquess of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and
other Covenantier Lords murmur
at, being afraid lest in time they
should wholly be laid aside, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already seen one of their party
begun with; for the Earl of <hi>Louden,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:54812:55"/>
who customarily had the Lord
Chancellorship of the Kingdome,
was removed from his place, &amp; the
Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> constituted Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
in his stead.</p>
            <p>Yet on the Covenanters side there
wanted not some Ministers, such
were Mr. <hi>Robert Douglass,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>David Dicks,</hi> who endeavoured to
beget a right understanding in both
parties, that these sparks of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
might not at last burst out into
a flame, as 'twas very much feared
they would; but rather that in this
time of danger they might lay aside
all animosities, and unite together
against the common Eenemy, who
else would be the ruine of them
both.</p>
            <p>And now his Majesty to keepe a
correspondency abroad, sends the
Earl of <hi>Dumferling</hi> Ambassador to
the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> he had likewise
at the same time several other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54812:56"/>
or Agents abroad in the
Courts of several Princes, to require
aid; but never found more then
what fair and sugared promises pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>And about this time Sir <hi>Henry
Hide</hi> being sent over to <hi>England</hi> from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> (whither he had bin
sent as Ambassador from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to the <hi>Grand Signior)</hi> by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Bendysh</hi> his means, who was
then Ambassador for the Republick
of <hi>England,</hi> (but yet deem'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of more loyalty to his Prince,
then to have sent his Ambassador to
be murder'd, if he could have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it) after somewhat a formal trial,
suffered death on a Scaffold before
the Royal <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for
having taken Commissions from his
Soveraign.</p>
            <p>And not long after him Captain
<hi>Brown Bushel,</hi> who though he had
formerly been an enemy to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54812:56"/>
father, yet now suffer'd death
upon the Tower-hill <hi>London,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done some signal services by
sea for his present Majesty.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Kings affairs
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the special busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in hand were, the compleating
the levies to 15000. foot, and 6000.
horse, which went on apace; and the
fortifying the towne of <hi>Sterling,</hi>
which his Majesty intended for the
place of his chief residence, to the
hastening of the which his Majesty
went often in Progress to view the
Works, and encourage the pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers.</p>
            <p>And time it was to hasten those
Works, for the <hi>English</hi> drew every
day nigher &amp; nigher towards them,
having already taken the Fort of
<hi>Blackness,</hi> which lay between <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
and <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
not accounted so great a
loss as the surprizal of the Earle of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54812:57"/>
               <hi>Eglington</hi> and one of his sons by a
party of <hi>English</hi> horse at <hi>Dumbarton;</hi>
for this Earl was a person of a great
deal of power in that Nation, and
his taking very much obstructed the
going forward of the Levies.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sterling</hi> being almost fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sufficiently, his Majesty removed
his Court hither; where whilest he
was, his Birth-day being the 29. of
<hi>May,</hi> was kept through <hi>Scotland,</hi>
with all such tokens of joy, as are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
upon such occasions; but the
town of <hi>Dundee</hi> exceded all the rest,
for besides their equal expressions of
Joy, they presented his Maiesty
with a rich Tent, six pieces of Field
Ordinance, and set out a Regiment
of horse towards his assistance at
their own charge.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sterling</hi> likewise were the
head-Quarters kept; most of the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Army Quartering about it,
whither <hi>Middleton</hi>'s leavies from
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54812:57"/>
the North being come, and amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to about 8000. men, it came to
be a dispute whether these should be
a distinct Army by themselves, or be
joined with <hi>Lesley</hi>'s Southern Levies;
but at length it was thought most
convenient to joyne them; and his
Majesty to prevent those animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which might arise between <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi>
and <hi>Lesley</hi> for the General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
took upon himself the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the whole.</p>
            <p>From hence his Majesty sent a
messenger to the Parliament still
sitting at S. <hi>Johnston's,</hi> with these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:</p>
            <p>1. That the Act about the Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of malignants should be revoked
and disannulled, and that an Act
pass for its repeal.</p>
            <p>2. That there might be no more
any mention of the name of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
amongst them.</p>
            <p>3. That Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54812:58"/>
of <hi>Seaforth</hi> and <hi>Callender</hi> &amp;c. might
have as full command in the Army
as any others.</p>
            <p>The demands were strongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<hi>vro &amp; con</hi> in the Parliament;
the Marquess of <hi>Argile</hi> and others
of the covenanted strain, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by all means possible to oppose
them; yet at length, though with
much difficulty, they were carried
in the affirmative, it being urged by
the more moderate sort too, that
the granting of these would be the
only way to take away all animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
between those parties which
they intended to unite.</p>
            <p>The Parliament having granted
these things to his Maiesty, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
large Commissions and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for the compleating of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
about the beginning of <hi>June</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
leaving all things (in relation
to civil and intestine distempers in a
calm and quiet) all parties seeming
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54812:58"/>
to be pleased, and their actions uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
towards the opposing of their
common Enemy <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest these things were thus
transacted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a great and
terrible plot was discovered against
the <hi>Juncto</hi> then ruling in <hi>England</hi> &amp;
their government in assistance of his
Majesty to his just Rights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was chiefly laid by those Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
who had been such dire
Opponents of his Majesty's blessed
father of happy (yet unhappy) me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<hi>viz.</hi> the greatest part Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Ministers, who had most of
them formerly belcht out such fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
from their Pulpits as had set
both Church and State in a combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
but now whether out of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
sence of their errour (which I
have the charity to believe it was)
they had a desire to return to their
Allegiance to his son their lawful
and native Soveraign; or out of an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54812:59"/>
ambition by joining with their
<hi>Scottish</hi> brethren (which I am loath
to judge) to get the power again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands, which was snatched
from them by the Independent <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Army, and the <hi>Iuncto</hi> of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in <hi>England,</hi> they had laid a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to raise both a contribution of
money, and levy men for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
assistance here; but their plot
was betrayed by the intercepting of
letters in a ship forced by foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into <hi>Ayre</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but
bound with provisions for the <hi>Isle of
Man,</hi> whereupon the chief underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in <hi>London</hi> were apprehended,
<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher
Love,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Drake</hi>
and others, of which two, <hi>viz. Mr.
Gibbons,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Love</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by a High Court of Justice,
and suffered Death on the Tower
Hill, for that cause against which
they had once so strongly declared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:54812:59"/>
But to return again to the chiefe
Scene in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>English</hi>
Army had long had a desire to bring
the <hi>Scots</hi> to a field-battel, which his
Majesty upon sundry good reasons
and serious advice declined: So
<hi>Cromwel</hi> endeavoured to the utmost
of his power to force them to it, &amp;
therefore several times fac'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
Army which lay encamped at
<hi>Torwood,</hi> within three miles of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
but could not yet draw them
out of their trenches, the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
being imagin'd to proceed from
their stay for <hi>Argile, Huntly</hi> and <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi>
who were gone into their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Territories to compleat the
King's Levies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi> perceiving that he could
not draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to a Field-bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
upon a sudden draws off his
Army, and transports sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot, and four Troopes of
Horse over unto <hi>Fife,</hi> on such a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54812:60"/>
suddain that it startled his majesties
whole Army; and <hi>Cromwell</hi> with an
unparallel'd expedition faced again
the royal Army with a resolution to
fall upon their Rear, if they should
attempt a motion thitherwards; but
they offered not to stir; for already
order had been given to Sir <hi>John
Brown</hi> Governour of <hi>Sterling,</hi> to
march with four thousand Horse &amp;
foot to drive out that party of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's</hi>
which were already landed in
<hi>Fife;</hi> of which intelligence being
brought, <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Okey</hi> with two
Regiments of Horse, and two of
foot are with all possible hast wafted
over to reinforce the party already
there; with which additional sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of men they routed Sir <hi>John
Brown,</hi> who expected none but the
first landed party, taking himself &amp;
several other Officers of quality pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
&amp; killing two thousand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, and taking near 1200.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54812:60"/>
prisoners: and shortly after <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
transports most of his Army over
the <hi>Fife,</hi> and resolving to stop the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
which the <hi>Scots</hi> had over by <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
marches to S. <hi>Iohnstone</hi>'s and
takes it almost upon summons.</p>
            <p>His Majesty seeing the <hi>English</hi>
Army was advanced so far North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
thought it in vain to attempt
the forcing them back; and knowing
that the <hi>Scots</hi> naturally fight better
in anothers then in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
resolves to advance with all
possible speed into <hi>England, where</hi> he
yet hoped, notwithstanding the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the late design, to find some
loyal souls to joyn with him for the
Recovery of his Right and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>Many were there who opposed this
intention of his Majesty, and among
those Dvke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was one of the
chiefest, whose dislike may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
appear by his Letter to Mr.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54812:61"/>
               <hi>Crofts</hi> after their Advance to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</p>
            <p>We are now laughing, <hi>(sayes he)</hi>
at the ridiculousnesse of our present
state; we have quit <hi>Scotland</hi> being
scarce able to maintain it: and yet we
graspe at all, and nothing but all will
satisfie us, or to loose all. <hi>I</hi> confess <hi>I</hi>
cannot tell whether our hopes or fears
are greatest; but we have one stout Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
Despair: for we must now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stoutly fight or die: all the Rogues
have left us, <hi>I</hi> shall not say whether
out of fear or disloyalty; but all now
with his Majesty are such as will not
dispute his Commands.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding his dislike,
and his and others oppositions, yet
the Kings resolve takes place, and on
<hi>Iuly</hi> the 31. 1651. his Majesties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
began to advance from <hi>Torwood</hi>
near <hi>Sterling,</hi> steering their course
directly for <hi>England,</hi> which they
entred six dayes after by way of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle;</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:54812:61"/>
This march of the Royal
Army made <hi>Cromvvell</hi> with the
greatest part of his forces imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
recrosse the <hi>Frith,</hi> and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
send Major General <hi>Lambert</hi>
with a select party of Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
to fall upon the Rear of his
Majesties Army, whilest they hoped
that Major General <hi>Harrison</hi> who
then lay near the borders with about
three thousand Horse and Dragoons,
would attach them in the Front;
shortly after Himself followed with
the rest of the Army which could be
spared, amounting to about eight
compleat Regiaments of Foot, and
two of Horse.</p>
            <p>But then this, greater preparation
is made against him in <hi>England,</hi> for
the <hi>Iuncto</hi> then sitting at <hi>Westminster</hi>
not only interdicted all aid or assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
either of men or monyes to be
given to his Majesty under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of High Treason; but also in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54812:62"/>
all or most of the Countries had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a numerous force to be raised, the
<hi>Church-Militia</hi> of the City of <hi>London</hi>
being likewise sent out against him;
and for the present impeading of his
march, two thousand of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-<hi>Militia</hi>
of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> and
four thousand out of <hi>Lancashire</hi> and
<hi>Cheshire,</hi> under the command of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Birch,</hi> had joyned with <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides all this, many of the
Royal Army had in their march de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
their Colours, and near a
fourth part of the Army was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but these were most of them
such, as were not very well affected
to the businesse nor cause they went
about; and therefore there was but
little misse of them, for the rest of the
Army marched on chearefully, and
continued to the utmost push sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and loyal; and were so conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
obedient to all Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54812:62"/>
that 'tis believed that in all
their march through all that in part
of <hi>England</hi> they hardly took the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of sixpence forcibly.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this unwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
civility of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, and
his Majestie's earnest invitations, the
Countrey came very slowly in, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
besotted, dulled and contented
with that slavery they then lay under
or over-awed by an armed power, I
cannot well tell, but such was their
backwardness, that few or none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Estrich</hi> his
son with a Troop of Horse came in
to him, during his long tedious
march through <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did his Majesty with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
take that course which was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by most he should; for the
great fear of his Enemies, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
hopes of his friends were, that he
would march directly for <hi>London,</hi>
but he contrary to their expectations,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54812:63"/>
being coming into <hi>Lancashire,</hi>
struck off at <hi>Warrington,</hi> either
doubting the enterprize for <hi>London</hi>
too hazardous, or out of the hopes
had of the forces, it was expected
Major General <hi>Massey</hi> might raise
in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> which was the then
generally vogued reason.</p>
            <p>But before his Majesty could passe
over <hi>Warrington</hi> Bridge, he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to try the stoutnesse of his
souldiers; for here <hi>Harrison</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
if possible to stop him, and
was endeavouring to that purpose to
have broken down the Bridge; but
his Majestie's forces by a swift march
from <hi>Charley,</hi> prevented his design,
and forced him to an engagement.
The dispute was somewhat hot and
long, but at length his Majesty got
the better; for he gained a free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
over the Bridge, though with
the losse of some men.</p>
            <p>This bridge gained, his Majesty
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54812:63"/>
marched on towards the <hi>West,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any opposition: and indeed with
as little assistance or increase of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
yet being all along as he came,
proclaimed King of <hi>Great Britain,
France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by an <hi>English</hi> man,
whom he had created King at
Armes.</p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>Tong Norton,</hi> his
Majesty sent a Trumpet with his
Royal summons to Colonell <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>BY</hi> your Trumpeter <hi>I</hi> received
two Papers, the one containing
a proposition, and the other a direct
summons for the rendition of the
town and Castle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the
Custody whereof <hi>I</hi> have received by
Authority of Parliament; and if you
believe me a Gentleman (as you say
you do) you may believe I will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to my trust, to the violation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
neither Allurements can perswade
me, nor threatnings of force; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when but paper ones compell me?
what principles <hi>I</hi> am judged to be of, <hi>I</hi>
know not; but <hi>I</hi> hope they are such as
shall ever declare me honest, and no
way differing herein (as <hi>I</hi> know) from
those engaged in the same employment

they are imbarqued in, <hi>I</hi> resolve to be

            <p>Thus flat a denyal did his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Royal summons receive here;
nor did his Commands to Sir <hi>Thomas
Middleton</hi> Governour of <hi>Chirk</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in <hi>Flintshire,</hi> for the levying of
men for his service, find better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
            <p>But from hence his Majesty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
his course for <hi>Worcester,</hi> where
he arrives on the twenty second of
<hi>Angust,</hi> and notwithstanding some
resistance made by the Parliaments
souldiers, quickly enters by the help
of the towns men, who joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their Allegiance and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
here 'twas again solemnly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54812:65"/>
whether they should remain
here or march for <hi>London,</hi> and was at
length concluded that in regard
of the Long and tedious marches
that the Souldiery had had, it would
be much better to tarrie here; that
after some refreshment they might
be able with more vigor and courage
to endure the brunt.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> who had
some few daies before his Majesties
arrival at <hi>Worcester</hi> brought him a
supply of two hundred and fifty foot
and sixty horse, which he had
brought with him out of the Isle of
<hi>Man,</hi> and was returned back into
<hi>Lancashire,</hi> out of hopes that by his
influence upon that Countie he
might get a more numerous force
there, having got together a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
partie, was routed by Col.
<hi>Lilburn,</hi> who was there with a partie
to watch his motions; and was
first engaged by the Earl, out of a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54812:66"/>
design he had to hinder <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s
joyning with a Regiment of <hi>Crem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s;
which was sent for the same
purpose towards <hi>Manchester,</hi> but
the Engagers themselves were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated;
and most of the Earles chief
Commanders and the Gentlemen of
note with him taken prisoners, such
were the Lord <hi>Witherington,</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Tilsley,</hi> Sir <hi>William Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
Col. <hi>Boynton,</hi> and sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>His Majesty being now at <hi>Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
and resolving there to stay and
endure the utmost brunt, all prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
possible are made, for the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the place and gaining all
advantages possible; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Line and several Mounts were
quickly raised by the Pioniers, and
all passes about the Town and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it secured.</p>
            <p>But Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> on
the Republick's side, sending sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54812:66"/>
a party of Horse to discover
the difficulty of the pass at <hi>Vpton,</hi>
(where Major General <hi>Massey</hi> (for
his Majesty) lay with a party of about
300. Horse and Dragoons) those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
fellows being not above fifty
in number, adventured over upon
one piece of Timber, which had
been carelesly left from arch to arch.
And though <hi>Massey</hi>'s men took
the allarm, yet was <hi>Lambert</hi> so quick
in sending over relief to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
(whom the Royal party had
beleaguered in a Church) that the
pass was clearly gained, and Major
General <hi>Massey</hi> forced to retreat
(though as honourably as ever man
did) for himself still brought up the
Rear, in which service (though his
Horse was slain under him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shot in the arm) yet he got off
with a very inconsiderable loss.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Caomvvell</hi>'s Army began
to joyn with all those parties, which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54812:67"/>
had conspired there to ruine his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
whom they accounted already
like a Bird in a Cage; for his Royal
Army consisted (at the most) of not
above 10000. fighting men, whereas
the Army that then beleaguer'd and
encompassed them was one of the
greatest that had (during the whole
time of the late warre) been raised
in <hi>England,</hi> amounting (according
to common computation) to some
50. or 60. thousand Horse and Foot;
so that (as I have been well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
this Army, though in a more
sanctified strain, bragg'd and insulted
more over his Majesty, then the
<hi>French</hi> Army at <hi>Agincourt</hi> did over
the thrice Illustrious King <hi>Henry</hi> 5.
Yet notwithstanding their assurances
of making him their prize: it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God (though not to give him
the successe that <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. had)
yet to deliver him out of their bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty
hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54812:67"/>
When I speak of the Armies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
over his Majestie's misery; I
hope the Reader will understand me
in the generality; for though many,
and perhaps the major part were
glad at these his straits; yet many
noble and candid loyal souls there
were, whom nothing but a tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
impulsion could have forced to
have born Arms against their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sovereign. It being well known
that thousands were forced out of
several Countreys to serve against
their wills, and them too put into
the brunt of the battel, as though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
for the slaughter.</p>
            <p>But for all these numerous forces
which encompassed the Royal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
they were chearful and resolved
to sell their lives at a noble rate, his
Majesty by the example of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage, principally encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
them: so that many vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
sallies were made upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54812:68"/>
and though their supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries
forc't them to a retreat, yet
was it very seldome or never igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>But now the fatall day draws nigh,
a day before so eminently auspicious
to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and as unfortunate to
the <hi>Scots, viz.</hi> the third day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi>
The sight was occasioned
thus: <hi>Cromvvell Fleetwood,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Republick party, had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the gaining the pass at <hi>Vpton,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make themselves a
clear passage to the City, that their
Army might joyn in the Leaguer,
to which end and purpose they orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the making of two Bridges, the
one over the <hi>Severn,</hi> the other over
<hi>Thame,</hi> over the last or which passes
Lieut. Gen. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> went to attach
the <hi>West</hi> side of the Town, which so
allarum'd the Royall Army, who
then lay within their Leaguer at St.
<hi>Iones,</hi> that to prevent their drawing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54812:68"/>
nigher, they sayled out with the
greatest part of their horse and foot,
and a stiffe encounter there was, 'till
over powred by numbers more then
by valour, which they demonstrated
to the utmost of mens strength: they
were forced to retire again into their
Leaguer, leaving more of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
dead bodies in the field, then of
their own.</p>
            <p>But whilst this encounter was on
the <hi>West</hi> side of the Town. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
having pass't his Army over <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi>
he march't directly to the
Town on that side, whereupon his
Majesty in person, and in the head of
the Horse, sallied out upon him, and
that with so much valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s own life-guard,
and the best of his old Souldiers.
(who were thought almost invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
vvere forc't to retire, 'till secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by those numerous supply's of
fresh souldiers, vvho served only like
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54812:69"/>
the <hi>Turkish Asapi,</hi> to blunt the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
swords, so that their wearied arms
no longer able to hold out, were
forced to retreat, and at length (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the generous example
of his Majesty, who performed things
worth wonder) to a disorderly flight;
and notwithstanding his Majestie's
earnest endeavours (in which he had
his horse twice shot under him) to
bring them again to a rally, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
fruitlesse; for the <hi>Cromwellian</hi>
Army pouring forth their numbers
upon them, permitted them not so
much time, but following them
close at the heels to the Town, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which they fled, entred pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
with them.</p>
            <p>And now notwithstanding their
flight, and the danger of their own
lives; yet had they so much care of
their Sovereign, that the whole cry
through out both Town and Army
was nothing else but <hi>Save the King,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54812:69"/>
Save the King;</hi> for him they knew
it was that the <hi>Iuncto</hi>'s Army chiefly
looked after, and indeed in great
danger he was; for notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the earnest desires of many of his
friends, and particularly Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
who pressed him to have a
care of his safty, and reserve his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to a more fortunate day; yet his
Majesty was hardly induced to quit
the field, nor would he till he saw
all absolutely lost; for <hi>Cromvvel</hi>'s
Army having as I said followed the
Royallists into the Town, and got
possession of one side of it, and after
by two or three strong assaults
upon the fort Royall (where
the <hi>Cheshire</hi> men (never before
found so disloyall to their Prince;
and therefore found now their
due) who out of three thousand men
sacrificed the lives of 1600 to the
Ghosts of those new Royallists
which were all put to the sword in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54812:70"/>
it) it vvas taken by storm; and now
when it was almost to late, his sacred
Majesty thought it high time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for his safety; and so vvith some
Nobles and Servants not vvithout a
great deal of difficulty, (for hovv
could it be othervvise vvhere there
vvas such hard search made for him,)
he quit the field, and by the most
unfrequented roades that they could
possibly find out, rode to the Farme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of a Noble Gentleman on the
borders of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> vvhere they
no sooner arrived but his Majesty
disrobed himself of his princely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
and accoutrements; and
particularly of a Chain of Gold or
spannar-string worth three hundred
pounds sterling, the present of a
<hi>Scottish</hi> Lord, vvhich he bestovved
upon a servant of his there present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
vvhich done for his farther disguise,
he proceeded to the cutting of his
hair, and the Cote affording neither
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54812:70"/>
shears not scissars to perform it, it was
by the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> cut off with a
Knife.</p>
            <p>And now every one is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to shift for himself, and this poor
Prince left alone to the sole prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Almighty, he choosing
none but one friend to accompany
him, with whom he wandred into a
Wood, (within four miles (say some)
of <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> where finding a
hollow Oke, he was now content to
make it his Pallace, for here he
for some daies concealed himself,
his Friend still towards night going
out to provide him some refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during this his solitary confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi>
who was commanded with the
rest to seek his fortune, was by
chance pursued by some souldiers,
but meeting with a Countrey fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
formerly a Souldier in the Old
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54812:71"/>
King's Army, he was by him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
though somewhat strangely,
for he carries him into a Malt-house
belonging to Mrs. <hi>Iane Lane,</hi> and
having no other convenient place
to hide him in, clapt him under the
kilne, though there were then some
fire in it, and the malt smoaking on
the top. In the mean time the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
then in pursuit of him, entred
the house, and having made about
three quarters of an hours search e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where else, but not at all suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the kilne, where they saw the
fire, they departed, and the Lord
<hi>Wilmot</hi> was taken out of the kilne
almost ready to faint with the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the heat.</p>
            <p>The countrey-fellow having thus
secured this Lord, acquaints Mrs.
<hi>Lane</hi> with what he had done, and
she extremly glad of it, gets him to
her house, where in conference she
enquires of the King's safety. The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54812:71"/>
Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> gives her the former
relation of his miseries and distresse,
which forces tears from the tender
hearted Gentlewoman, she earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entreats him to take some course
for the finding out of his Majesty,
and conducting him to her house,
she being resolued to venture her
life had she ten thousand, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of his Royal Majesties.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> glad of so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
an oppertunity to serve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and so great a probability of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
him, the next night finds him
out, and conducts him from the
Royal Oak to the House of Mrs.
<hi>Iane Lane,</hi> where after a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling
of his hard fortune, consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was had for a conveniency for
his Escape beyond sea, and at length
it was concluded that <hi>Bristol</hi> would
be the most convenient place to
take shipping, That his Majesty
should ride before Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54812:72"/>
the name of <hi>William,</hi> servant to Mr.
<hi>Lastel</hi> her father in Law, who was
likewise to go with them; and thus
it was immediately given out, that
Mr. <hi>Lastel</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> were to take
a jonrney into the <hi>West,</hi> to visit some
friends, and shortly after they set
forward.</p>
            <p>In this journey there happened
many accidents worthy commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and first, the King's Majesty
riding now as servant to one of the
faithfullest of his subjects, in a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cloak, though not without that
respect that durst be given to him;
complains to Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> that the
Cloak wearied him, whereupon she
desires Mr. <hi>Lastel</hi> to carry it, and
long they had not rid so, but they
meet upon the Road her Brother-in
law, who amongst other questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
demanded of her, if her father
must carry her mans Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ok, to which
she readily answered, that it was so
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54812:72"/>
big that it often endangered the
throwing her off the horse, and that
she had therefore desired him to
carry it.</p>
            <p>The next, and indeed most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
accident of all was, that coming
into a Town which they were to
pass through, there was a troop of
horse there to be quartered, drawn
up, which at distance caused some
fear; but at length with a resolution
they passed on, and the Captain ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them for honest travellers,
made his Troope open to the right
and left, and so permitted them to
pass.</p>
            <p>Another accident there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which one may say was almost
comical in this Tragedy; Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi>
coming into the Inne, leaves his
Majesty under the name of <hi>William</hi>
her servant, in the Kitchin, with
whom the maid enters into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
she asks him where he was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54812:73"/>
born, and what trade he was, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
at <hi>Brumingham,</hi> &amp; a Naylor's
Son; and after a great deal of other
discourse, the Jack being down, the
Maid desires him to winde it up;
which he willingly undertakes; but
goes the wrong way about it, and
somewhat prejudices it; at which
the maid grew angry, asking him
where he was bred, and telling him
he was the veryest clownish booby
that ever she saw in all her life; <hi>wch</hi>
railing of hers made his Majesty not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his present misery, go
out of the room smiling.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> notwithstanding his
Majesty went as her servant, yet had
a greater respect for him before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
pretending him her Tenant's
son; but on the Road she would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ask what he would have to
dinner or supper; and what piece of
that he liked, which she would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be sure to get made ready, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54812:73"/>
give him, he stil sitting at the lower
end of the Table.</p>
            <p>But to come to the end of their
Journy; being arrived at <hi>Bristol,</hi> they
lodged at the house of a noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
there, and Kinsman to Mr.
<hi>Lastles:</hi> the King finding it to be a
house of a great resort, feigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sick of an Ague, and so keepes
his Chamber all the day, coming
down only at nights; but one night
coming down, and being somewhat
cold, he craves a glasse of Wine of
the Butler, who carries him into the
Butlery: This Butler having before
served his Majesties Father in the
Warres, looking earnestly upon
him, suspected him to be the King;
so easily wil Majefty appear, though
veil'd in the utmost disguises; and
thereupon pulling off his hat, told
him very ceremoniously, That he
might command what Wine he
pleased; of which the King tooke
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54812:74"/>
no notice, but drinking off his Wine
went out: Yet the Butler could not
satisfie his suspition, but went up to
Mr. <hi>Lastell's</hi> and demanded of him
how long he had had that servant?
Whereupon Mr. <hi>Lastells</hi> was very
angry at his boldness in daring to
ask him such a question: but the
Butler still persisted, and whispering
told him, that he believed it was the
King: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Lastells</hi> seeing
he was discover'd, sends immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
up for his Majesty, whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
with the Butler's discovery
of him, with whom the King was
somewhat angry, in regard he did
not first acquaint himself with his
suspition, it not being impossible,
but Mr. <hi>Lastells</hi> might not have known
him to be the King: but upon pardon
asked by the Butler, it was granted
by the King, and he afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
very instrumental in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
conveyance through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:54812:74"/>
But here at <hi>Bristol,</hi> the chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
they had in hand failed them;
for though there were a little Bark
lay there, judged most covenient
for the businesse; yet the Master
would for no reward transport a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
person, though he was so honest
as only to deny it, and made no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
search or inquiry concerning
the Person, which might perhaps
have tended to a discovery.</p>
            <p>This design here failing, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
desired to be brought some
miles Westward, to the house of a
worthy Gentleman, whom he knew
to be a trusty friend; where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he findes the Gentleman in the
Field with his Servants: Having
discovered himself to him, he was
by him conveyed to a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
stand 'till night, (having first
taken leave of his true friends, who
had thus far conducted him with the
danger of their Lives and Estates)
from whence he was in the dusk
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54812:75"/>
conveyed into the House, and there
carefully concealed for a week, till
such time as preparation could be
made in some <hi>Western</hi> Port of a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
for him, but coming afterwards
there where it was provided, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to dine with a Parliament-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
then there, he thought it the
safer to loose the benefit of that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
then adventure to imbarque
himselfe singly, which might breed
suspition, and perhaps have bin the
means after so many deliverances,
to have betrayed him into the hands
of his enemies.</p>
            <p>This passage then likewise failing
him, he returned back to the place
from whence he came, and there
concealed himself three weeks lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
till in the end it being resolved
on, he by the assistance of Mr. <hi>Ph.</hi>
was conveyed through the most by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
they could imagine, to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomans
house in <hi>Sussex,</hi> where
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54812:75"/>
he lay some few daies, til a person of
true worth and honor made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a faithful master, who with
a small Vessel wafted him to a smal
Creeke in <hi>Normandy,</hi> to the great
content of the Kings sacred Majesty,
and all his loyal Subjects, and to the

            <p>Perhaps the Reader may think it
tedious that I have given so large a
relation of his Majesty's escape from
that fight at <hi>Worcester;</hi> but it was a
work so full of wonder and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and so many false relations
there are abroad, that I could do no
less then recount all those miseries
&amp; hardships which this poor Prince
endured for the sakes of us his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
&amp; more would he wilingly have
endured, even death it selfe, to the
redeeming of us from the tyranny
and oppression which we then groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

But let him that shall look upon
the several passages of his, read them
over and over, consider the several
difficulties he passed, the many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
he was in to be betrayed, the
countrey being up round about, the
summe of money set upon his head,
for which, many hundreds out of
covetousness made it their business
to search for him; and they wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
ingenuously, that God was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so merciful to any people, as to
us, in delivering his sacred Majesty
so wonderfully out of the hands of
his Enemies, who breathed out no.
thing but his death and destruction,
that we may yet have hopes to be
a happy Nation.</p>
            <p>But let us now return to give a ful
account of this dismal loss at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
in which most of his Maiesty's
foot were either made a prise or a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to their enemies swords; of the
horse there escaped 3000. out of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54812:76"/>
field, but were most afterwards ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taken or knockt on the head by
the Countrey in their flight; three
thousand were judged flain in the
Field, and about seven thousand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
prisoners; whereof the chiefe
were; the Earls <hi>Derby, Lauderdale,
Cleaveland, Shrewsburgh,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Wentworth;</hi> and many other
noble persons taken in the pursuit:
And the chief of those taken in the
battel were, the Earls of <hi>Carnwarth</hi>
and <hi>Kelly,</hi> the Lord <hi>Synclare,</hi> Sir
<hi>Iohn Packington;</hi> the Maior Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<hi>Montgomery</hi> and <hi>Piscotty;</hi> and
the <hi>Virgil</hi> of this Age, that thrice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
worthy Mr. <hi>Richard Fanshaw,</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour
of the renowned <hi>Pastor Fido,</hi>
and Secretary to his Majesty. As for
the thrice noble Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> he
was taken, but not overcome; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred,
but not vanquish't. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having made a most Heroick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
he was reduced under his

enemies power, more for want of
strength then valour; but death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in at those wounds which he so
gallantly received in defence of his
Soveraign, soon after released him.
Major General <hi>Massey,</hi> though he
escaped the field; yet his wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desperate, he was forced to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
himself to the Countesse of
<hi>Stamford,</hi> and was by her son, the
Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby,</hi> after the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his wounds, sent up prisoner to
the Parliament, and by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Tower, from whence
he not long after escaped, and went
to his Majesty beyond sea.</p>
            <p>This strange and wonderful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
(as the Juncto at <hi>Westminster</hi>
gave it out to be, though they had
six to one in the field) made that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarian
party cock-a-hoop; and to
make it the greater, publick days of
Thanks-giving are appointed to
make God the patronizer of their

treasons; and now they boast in all
their discourses how clearly it might

and disowned their adversaries.</p>
            <p>I think a modern Writer hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:54812:78"/>
But this Nation is so highly sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the injustice put upon them by
those who pretend so much right
in their Cause, that there's no Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Subject but will think according
to reason, that it was not the justice
of their cause, but our own and the
Nation's sinnes which caused God
to raise up these men as scourges
both to Prince and people; and to
the Prince onely for the Peoples
sake.</p>
            <p>Some I have heard, which out of
a spirit which I cannot well define,
have endeavoured to brand his
Royal Majesty with Cowardize in
this battel; which from whence it
could proceed, unlesse from their
own coward nature, which would
insimulate another in that of which
themselves are guilty, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
since <hi>Cromwell</hi> the greatest of
his Enemies (because the most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of his Kingdoms) yet had so
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54812:78"/>
much of truth in him, as to give a
high and noble Character of his
Valour.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, <hi rend="margQuotes">We have now
said enough of this fatal battel,</hi> the
seeming ruine of the Royal Interest
in <hi>England,</hi> unless God of his mercy
be pleased to restore it for the good,
peace and quiet of these Nations,
since without it we cannot hope to
enjoy any.</p>
            <p>His sacred Majesty being landed
in <hi>France</hi> near <hi>Havre de Grace;</hi> from
thence with a Noble Lord in his
Company, posted directly for <hi>Roan,</hi>
where they stayed to alter their
disguises, and furnish them with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
answerable to their Qualities;
his Majesty from thence having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't
Letters to the <hi>French</hi> Court
to acquaint his friends there of his
safe arrival, which doubtlesse cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
no little joy in those who were
real to him, and almost despaired
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54812:79"/>
ever again to have seen him. The
Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> sends his own
Coach to fetch him, &amp; several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of quality go to meet him; by
whom he was attended to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
there received with all possible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of joy, lodgings and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
being forthwith provided for
him in the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

arrival he was visited by the Queen
his Mother, &amp; the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
who of all persons in the Kingdome
exprest himself the most ready to
do him service; and the next day
visits him again, accompanied with
his Daughter <hi>Madamoiselle.</hi> He is
likewise courted by the Dukes of
<hi>Beaufort, Longueville, Guize,</hi> the
Marshal <hi>Thurine,</hi> and many other
Peers and Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> who all
congratulate his safe deliverance.</p>
            <p>And now his Majesty having lost
all hopes of any further means of
attaining his Dominions by force,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54812:79"/>
leads here a retired life; yet living
in regard of his high alliance &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
in great esteem with all the
<hi>French</hi> Nobility: Insomuch that
notwithstanding his present low
condition, there was very great
talk of a match to be made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the <hi>Madamoiselle de
Orleans,</hi> the richest Princes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom;
yet by some means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it came to no effect though the
Queen of <hi>England</hi> his Mother, was
an earnest promoter of it, and also
of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Longneville</hi>'s
daughter.</p>
            <p>Whilest these things were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting,
hapned that lately reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Fracture between the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> &amp; Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> most
of the Princes of the Blood siding
with the first; &amp; the King of <hi>France</hi>
(who was newly declared of age to
sway the Scepter himself) with the
last. The cause of the quarrel was
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54812:80"/>
that extravagant power which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi>
a stranger had usurped in the
government of the Kingdome, both
depriving the Princes of the Blood
of their Right, and oppressing the
people; whose daily murmurings
more encouraged the Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: This power he had got
into his hands in the Regency of the
<hi>Queen</hi> Mother, whose grand favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
he only was.</p>
            <p>The Princes therefore, though
they could not during her Regency
who so much loved him, yet hoped
they might effect something now
the King himself is come to govern;
to which intent they charge him
with several miscarriages of State,
which the Cardinal defends, and the
King also enclines to his side by the
instigation of the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet nothing but the Cardinal's
banishment will satisfie the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who join the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54812:80"/>
them, then in the service of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
with an Army of ten thousand
men; so that they intend with his
assistance (if they could not obtain
their desires by fair means) to have
forc't it.</p>
            <p>Thus these differences were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at such a height, that nothing
but a Civil War was like to ensue;
which made his Sacred Majesty of
<hi>England</hi> use his utmost endeavours
to compose and stay this breach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to an utter overflow; to
which effect he daylie went to and
fro betwixt the King &amp; the Princes;
endeavouring to bring them to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
urging by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the miseries and calamities
that must necessarily fall upon every
man's head by a Civil War, telling
the King that the late Example of
his Royal Father of happy memory,
might be an inducement to him to
be at peace with his Subjects, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54812:81"/>
then embroil his Kingdoms in
a bloody War, by which though he
might for the present gain the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
yet in the end he would still be
sure to have the worse.</p>
            <p>Yet these Arguments, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
earnest endeavours for peace
and reconciliation, produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but only contract an unjust <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
upon him from both parties for
his good will; the Princes believing
that he counselled the King against
them, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> again him:
So that he lost the love of both by
endeavouring to make them love
one another; yet notwithstanding
the ill successe he had, this Noble
Prince stil pursues his pacifick inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
til such time as he gains a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the <hi>King, Cardinal</hi>
and <hi>Princes:</hi> but this proves ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
for the <hi>Princes</hi> heightened
with the aid they expected from the
Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> instead of coming to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54812:81"/>
an accord, onely exasperate differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>Yet his sacred Majesty ceases not,
but indeavours to bring them yet to
a peaceable compliance; and in order
thereunto procures another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
where he himself would be
Moderatour; but this proves as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
as the former; For the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was above all others
outragious, and would come to no
agreement, except <hi>Mazarine</hi> were
first banished <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
King as violently persisted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
against it, alledging, <hi>That he
had approved himself both a faithfull
servant, and an able Minister of State.</hi>
So instead of agreement, both sides
prepare for Warre, yet are both
sides equally angry, and exasperated
against his sacred Majesty for his
good will towards them and the
nation, the one and other party ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that both he and his Mother
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54812:82"/>
had given counsels opposite to their
designs.</p>
            <p>But that which above all exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Princes against his Majesty
of <hi>England,</hi> was the sudden luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmness
of the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> in
the businesse: For though he had
drawn off his Army, as though he
had complied with their resolutions
to come to a battel; yet being sent
for by the Princes to advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Paris,</hi> he refused to come,
which made the Princes believe
there had been some underhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing
with him; and that which
most of all increased their jealousies
that King <hi>Charles</hi> had a hand in it,
was this, The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Camp of <hi>Lorain</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him in the name of the Princes
to come up and fight, found there
his M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jesty &amp; his Brother the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> in private conference with
<hi>Lorain,</hi> who withdrawing when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54812:82"/>
               <hi>Beaufort</hi> appeared; &amp; <hi>Beaufort</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duke's aversness to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
confirmed him, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the Princes of the King of
<hi>England</hi>'s endeavours, whereby he
had withdrawn <hi>Lorain</hi> from their
party: This coming to the peoples
ears who were absolute favourers
of the Princes, and invetrate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> so extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
them against the <hi>English Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
that they threaten violence and
indignities to their persons, and are
not afraid to affront the <hi>Queen</hi> their
Mother, in her Coach; which made
his Majesty to avoid the popular fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
retire himself from the <hi>Lovure</hi>
to St. <hi>Germane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>Cardinal</hi> less incensed,
though under a more politick vail:
For though both Princes &amp; People
might imagine and believe that his
Majesty had counsel'd things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to their intentions, yet the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54812:83"/>
very wel knew that he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
the King as the best course, to
consent to his departure out of the
Kingdom; and that if he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to draw <hi>Lorain</hi> from their
party, 'twas only out of a desire he
had to expedite their agreement; he
therefore resolves to thwart him in
all his designs.</p>
            <p>And so he did to the utmost of
his endeavours: For his Majesty
though suspected by the Princes, in
his several conferences with <hi>Lorain</hi>
to have endeavoured to divert him
from them, was onely transfacting
with him for the recovery of his
Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> out of the
hands of the <hi>English</hi> Republick; to
which effect several Articles were
drawn up between the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Taaf;</hi> two of
which were:</p>
            <p>1. That the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi>
should transport an Army of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54812:83"/>
10000. men at his own charges into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
there to join with such as should
be found Loyal, for the Recovery of his
Majesties Rights in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>2. That the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> should
by his Majesty be invested with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Title of <hi>Protector Royal of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Articles though drawn up,
never came to be signed; the cause of
which some have imagined to be
the disability of the <hi>Duke</hi> to perform
the Enterprize without the Aid of
some other Prince; but we may in
more reason guesse, it proceeded
from the strenuous endeavours of
<hi>Mazarine</hi> (his Majesty's so lately
made-enemy) to divert the Duke's
Army, then from any other cause.</p>
            <p>Many in <hi>England</hi> upon hearing
of these Propositions made to the
Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> (which I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54812:84"/>
some believe to have never
proceeded any farther then Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Dukes) feared his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
too great inclination to the
<hi>Romish</hi> Religion, which fear his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-retirement
at St. <hi>Germain</hi>'s, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
there was no need of: For
here he spent his time wholly in
Piety and Devotions, according to
the best Worship of the Church of
England, never forgetting to pray
for those his Enemies who were
not only content to have deprived
him of his Kingdomes, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
belched forth both slanders
and maledictions against him.</p>
            <p>His Majesty having staid at S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>
till such time as the heat of
the popular fury was over; which
decreased still towards him as they
found <hi>Mazarine</hi> more averse to
him, returned again to the <hi>Lovure;</hi>
where during his abode, his brother
the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> (who had a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54812:84"/>
long time been detained by the <hi>Iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
and was lately permitted by them
to go to his Sister the Princess Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in <hi>Holland</hi>) came to him, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
from the <hi>Hague</hi> by Sir <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduke
Langdale</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard
Greenvile;</hi> he was at his arrivall at
<hi>Paris</hi> honourably received by the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> Mother;
and courted according to his birth
by the rest of the Grandees and
Peers of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Likewise during his Majesties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
here, arrived his <hi>Quondam</hi>
Preserver Mrs. <hi>Iane Lane,</hi> who after
she had taken leave of his Majesty at
<hi>Bristow,</hi> returned home; and lived
for some space in a great deal of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
not doubting she could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed:
Yet at length by what means
I know not, (though indeed I have
heard of many relations that I dare
not relate any) it came to light; yet
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54812:85"/>
she had some timely notice of it,
whereupon she who had formerly
disguised his Majesty in a Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
habit, now disguises her self in
that of a Country wench; and that
trots on foot (to save her life which
she was like to loose for having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
saved his sacred Majesties)
quite crosse the Countrey to <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
where she found shipping
which convey'd her safe into <hi>France;</hi>
great search after her departure
there was made for her, but in vain;
which so incensed the Souldiers
that they burnt down to the ground
that poor Cottage where his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
first took shelter after his Escape
from <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She being arrived in <hi>France,</hi> sends
a Letter to the Court, whereupon
his Majesty almost overjoyed at her
Escape who had been the cause of
his, immediately sends some persons
of quality in Coaches to conduct
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54812:85"/>
her to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither being near
come, himself with the Queen his
Mother, the Duke of <hi>York, Glocester,</hi>
went out to meet this Preserver of
the life of their Son, Sovereign and
Brother; the Coaches meeting, and
she being descended from her
Coach, his Majesty likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends,
and taking her by the hand,
salutes her with this gratefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>Welcome my life,</hi> and so put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her into his own Coach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
her to <hi>Paris,</hi> where she was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with the applause &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the whole Court: &amp; she could
indeed deserve no less; for I believe
neither past or future ages can or
will ever parallell so great a pattern
of female Loyalty and Generosity.</p>
            <p>Whilst his Majesty was thus pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

by the help of the Officers of the
army, &amp; <hi>Lamberts</hi> instrument, makes
himself immediatly King of <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> &amp; <hi>Irelaand</hi> (which govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he had often swore against)
though under the title of Protector.</p>
            <p>This (I must needs say) Noble
Tyrant, having got the Dominion
of three such Kingdomes into his
possession, made it now as much his
study to preserve himself safe in his
Estate and <hi>Grandezza,</hi> as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to acquire it; to which purpose
he thought it most suitable to that
design, to make some remarkable
disturbance amongst the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Princes; then to contine that
War (begun by the <hi>Iuncto</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
several motions of a Treaty
passed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:54812:87"/>
His sacred Majesty, though he had
sundry times before solicited the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of those United Provinces
for the regaining of his Right in his
Kingdomes, now more earnestly
upon secret intelligence of the first
motions of this Treaty, sends the
Lord <hi>Gerard</hi> his Embassadour to the
United States, more earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
them to own his Interest
then before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proffering, that if they
would vest out a squadron of good
Ships under his Flag, he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them himself in person.</p>
            <p>His Sister, the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi>
and other of his friends in the Low
Countries, addicted to his Interest,
earnestly prosecutes his desires, and
use their utmost influence on the
States of the United Provinces for
the performance of his propositions.
Nor are there five of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
nor <hi>Van Trump</hi> himself their
Admiral unwiling to comply with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54812:87"/>
him. Only the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi>
the most potent at sea, stands out,
chiefly out of the disgust they had
lately taken to the family of <hi>Orange,</hi>
whose Interest and command they
were fearfull, might be restored,
should his Majesty, who was Uncle
to the young Prince, be invested in
his Territories.</p>
            <p>His Majesty likewise to advance
his hopes of their assistance, when
Monsieur <hi>Bortell</hi> came from those
United States to negotiate a League
with the King of <hi>France,</hi> used his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Interest to promote the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in fine brought it to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
period: notwithstanding the
United States sent no other answer
to his Embassy then a cold Letter of
Complements.</p>
            <p>His designs thus failing him here, he
directed himself to a more hopefull
course, by interposing himself a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
with the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; other <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:54812:88"/>
Princes for an accord and peace
between the two mighty Crowns of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And indeed two
such potent <hi>Monarchs</hi> had been in
better capacity with their joynt
forces to have assisted him (had the
peace went forward, as there was
great hopes) then the United States
of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> but Cardinall
<hi>Mazarine</hi> by a piece of secret State-policy,
endeavoured to obstruct all
proceedings which might tend to a
Treaty or accord.</p>
            <p>Nor was this Cardinal's Spleen to
his Royall Majesty yet allayed; for
his supposed Council against him in
the forementioned difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Princes; but far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prejudice him &amp; his affairs,
he endeavours the promotion of a
peace betwixt the <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
&amp; the <hi>French</hi> King his Master,
which, though opposed by all the
force &amp; Interest that either himself
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54812:88"/>
or the Queen his Mother had in the
<hi>French</hi> Court; yet was by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
(whose will was a law all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
government in that Kingdome
being but a meer shadow) vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried on, and an Ambassadour
sent over to treat of an accord:
where having been sometime in
<hi>England,</hi> his Majesty was by secret
intelligence informed that the chief
Article insisted upon in the Treaty
(by the <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) was
the excluding himself, relations and
followers out of the Kingdome of
<hi>France</hi> and it's Territories; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
least the treaty should be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
concluded upon those terms,
and he ceremoniously excluded, he
thought it more honourable himself
to leave that Kingdome of his on
accord; and having taken his leave
of the King of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; the rest of
the Nobility accompanied with his
Cousin Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> he departed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54812:89"/>
for <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi>
had long been Ambassador for
him to solicite aid and assistance.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding his Brothers
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> staid
still in <hi>France.</hi> The first having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of the Marshal of
<hi>Turine</hi> against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
such Eminent services as had
made him deservedly esteemed a
most valorous and prudent Prince;
insomuch that notwithstanding his
Youth he was made Lieu. Generall
of the <hi>French</hi> Army, and thought
so well worthy that Command, that
when <hi>Turine</hi> (the most esteemed
Generall the <hi>French</hi> have for a long
time had) lay desperately sick, and it
was expected that he should breath
his last; he was by the King of <hi>France</hi>
sent to, to desire him, that seeing
there were so little hopes of this life,
he would nominate such a General
of his Army as he might judge fit to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54812:89"/>
succeed him: To which <hi>Turine</hi> answered,
that if his Majesty would have his affairs
prosper, he should make choice of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
valorous, and fortunate Generall;
which if he did, he could make of choice
of no fitter person then the thrice Heroick
Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his Brother the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
he remained at the Pallace Royall
in <hi>Paris</hi> with the Queen his Mother; who
shortly after the Departure of his Royall
Majesty, endeavoured by all the bonds
of filial obedience and the most prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Arguments could be used, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to become Roman Catholick:

of a Royall Mother was poured
forth upon him, which brought him the
deprivation of his Tutor, his Servants,
and all Comforters in these temptations:
But that Noble Prince was so far indowed
(during this affliction) with the Principles
of the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
besides that naturall piety and constancy,
flowing from his most religious Father of
blessed Memory, that by the depth of
Truth and Reason, he defended himself
against these attempts. After this he is
committed to the care of one Mr. <hi>Walter

some few daies their journy together, 'till
the Prince parted from him to go visit

the first place of his Residence in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
whither his Sister the Royall
Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> came to visit him;
and they no doubt during the time of
their being there, were as merry as two
such afflicted Princes could.</p>
            <p>But let us a little leave his Majesty at
the <hi>Spaw</hi> and look into his Kingdomes
where <hi>Cromwell</hi> that he might secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in his ill-gotten Estate, endeavours
by all means possible either to take away
the lives or wholly impoverish and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his Majesties loyal Subjects; who are
continually charged with something,
which he by his usurped power takes hold
of to destroy them: several persons are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and charged with a design to
have seized on the Tower, and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his Majesty King of those Kingdoms
which by right were his: for tryall of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54812:91"/>
which persons, a High Court of
Justice, (a thing we now in <hi>England</hi>
know very well) was erected for the
tryall of those persons, and Col.
<hi>Iohn Gerard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Vowel,</hi> and
<hi>Sommerset Fox</hi> were condemned to
be hanged, drawn, and quartered:
(for no lesse then High Treason for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
though there were then no
Act in being making it Treason to
conspire against the Power then in
being in <hi>England</hi>) But somewhat of
the sentence was remitted, and
Col. <hi>Gerard</hi> was beheaded, and
Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> only hanged, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>
reprieved.</p>
            <p>I have always observed that in all
the tryals made by those High courts
of Justice for plots (as they call
them) there hath still been some one
person, who though brought to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
have either not been condemned
though look't upon by the people
as eminent in the businesse as any)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54812:92"/>
and though Condemned, yet have
been reprieved; what others guesse
of it, I will not determine; I know
what I do.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that his Majesty had
alwaies the ill fortune to have such
false servants about him as have for
the Lucre of money either betrayed
any enterprize of his for the gaining
of his right, (the <hi>Protector</hi> especially
being very prodigal in such expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
his intelligence as most affirm,
standing him in no less then two
hundred thousand pounds <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>)
or else those persons engaged
for him, being many of them deboist
fellows, (and who often ran upon
designes uncommissioned) have
in a Tavern both layd and betrai'd
their own undertakings; or else
some here in <hi>England,</hi> who have
undertaken in such businesses, have
either for fear or gain betrayed both
their Prince, friends and Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:54812:92"/>
Thus much for <hi>England;</hi> let us
now take a view of his Majesties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Kingdome
was not yet wholly conquered, for
the Lords <hi>Seaforth, Atholl, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne,
Kenmore,</hi> and <hi>Glengary,</hi> and
several others who had some of
them been formerly followers of the
Noble Marquesse of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> by
Commissions to the Earle of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne</hi>
had levied sundry small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in their several Territories;
which all joyned, would have made
up a considerable Army, besides the
help which they expected <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
should bring them out of the
Low Countries, they therefore
made all possible speed to joyn; but
in their match the Earl of <hi>Glencarne</hi>
is set upon by Col. <hi>Morgan,</hi> his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
routed, himself hardly escaping.</p>
            <p>This defeat of <hi>Glencarn</hi>'s who
was the chief, though it discouraged
the rest, yet made them not wholly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54812:93"/>
desist; for they had yet hopes of
those supplies which they expected
<hi>Middleton</hi> to bring out of the Low-Countries,
who at length arrives &amp;
brings with him <hi>Monroe</hi> to be his
Lieu. General, he being Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionated
General; which highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
<hi>Glencarne,</hi> who had been
the greatest instrument of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
raising (which was now joyn'd
and made up a Considerable body)
who protested that he would not
raise an Army for others to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
so high a dispute there was
between <hi>Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Monroe;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that many affirm, though
some say the contrary, that it came
to a Duell, in which <hi>Monroe</hi> was
worsted and disarmed by <hi>Glencarne;</hi>
however the dissention still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
for <hi>Middleton</hi> pretended that
he had not power to take away
<hi>Monro</hi>'s Commission which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by his Majesty, &amp; <hi>Genclarn</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:54812:93"/>
scorning to be under him, being of
Nobler blood, and accounting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as good a Souldier, deserts the
Army with five hundred Horse in
his company, &amp; goes in to General
<hi>Monck,</hi> with whom he makes his
Composition.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding his deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(caused by those differences
amongst themselves for superiority,
the only way to ruine any designe)
<hi>Middleton</hi> pursues his businesse and
Commission, and had made up a
pretty considerable Number, when
Generall <hi>Monck</hi> engaging him at
<hi>Lougherry</hi> after a hot dispute totally
routed him, scattered his party, and
had almost taken himself Prisoner,
but he escaping returned again into
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus his Majesties ill fortune still
attends his affairs, God still permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Enemies to taper up in the
World &amp; advance themselves, not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54812:94"/>
that he in the want of us, but that
we in the want of so Noble a Prince,
might be yet farther Miserable.</p>
            <p>But let us return again to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> where he having
staid a while, courted by all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Grandees, at length takes his
journey in company of the Princesse
Royall his Sister towards <hi>Colen,</hi>
where being arrived, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with all possible honour and
demonstrations of joy and affection,
the great Guns discharging at their
entrance, and the Deputies of the
City coming out to meet them in
solemn manner, &amp; conducting them
in great pomp to the pallace provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for them by the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
of the City.</p>
            <p>Shortly after their Arrival, the
Grandees of the place entertained
his Majesty and his Royal Sister at a
sumptuous Banquet or Collation,
where they expresse in many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54812:94"/>
complements, the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
they had of his Majesties
condition, and the great honour
which he did them, in being pleased
to come and visit their City.</p>
            <p>After a short time of abode here
his Majesty was envited by the
Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> to his Pallace at
<hi>Dunsell-dorf,</hi> where he &amp; his Sister
were most sumptuously and Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertained for some daies; and
here the Royall Princesse took her
leave of her Brother his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and returned for <hi>Holland,</hi> the
King accompanying her on her way
as far as <hi>Red nguen,</hi> and from thence
returned back again to <hi>Colen,</hi> where
he was joyfully received.</p>
            <p>And now more of his Majesties

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54812:95"/>
enough before it was like to take
any effect, which appeared by his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
the <hi>London Militia</hi> in the hands
of his own <hi>Criado</hi>'s, his apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sir <hi>Henry Littleton,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn
Packington,</hi> and many other of the
Royall party; yet he lets it still go
on, that he might have the better
colour for keeping his Scaffold in
ure, whilst he having certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of all proceedings from his
hired Agents, had care to prevent
them when they just came to the
height, that he might then lay the
surer hold on the undertakers: so
now, though he was sure to prevent
all risings which might be near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
yet he lets others in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
more remote to go on so farre,
as they might only raise to a head,
but not have any secure place of
strength to retreat to, in case of a
defeat, where they might again have
made a head. The surprizal of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54812:95"/>
               <hi>shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>Chirke</hi> Castles are to
that effect now prevented. But a par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyin
<hi>Dorset</hi> &amp; <hi>Wiltshires</hi> made a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
consisting most of Gentlemen,
who surprized <hi>Salisbury,</hi> took away
all the Horses, and Marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> where they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a greater force to rise with them;
but being eagerly pursued by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Crook</hi> with a party of Horse,
were overtaken at <hi>Southmolton</hi> in
<hi>Devonshire,</hi> and after a hot dispute,
most of them either slain or taken;
but Sir <hi>Ioseph Wagstaffe,</hi> the chief
Commander of this small loyal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
escaped. The Captains, <hi>Penrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock,
Grove</hi> and <hi>Iones</hi> were taken,
&amp; afterwards being tried by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> were
condemned to death: Captain <hi>Iones</hi>
was reprieved, but <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruddock</hi>
were beheaded at <hi>Exceter,</hi>
The last of which parted nobly with
his life, and died with a resolution,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54812:96"/>
worthy of the cause for which he
suffered. Many others likewise were
hanged for this enterrize.</p>
            <p>Yet these and their fellows might
have come off better, had other
Counties as they promised, risen to
their assistance; for all the Countries
in <hi>England</hi> had designed (as they say
to rise; but whether besotted,
dull'd and fearful, or else prevented
by a force upon them, I cannot tell;
but sure I am they fail'd. Yet in

in several places, but dissipated by
their own fears, at <hi>Hexam</hi> Moor the
Gentry in that shire had a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vouz,
of whom Sir Hen. <hi>Slingsby</hi> was
taken, &amp; remained prisoner in <hi>Hull,</hi>
till such time as he was brought up
to <hi>London,</hi> where he suffered death
under pretence of another design;
as shall in due time be declared.</p>
            <p>But now the Protector finds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course to rid himself of all such
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54812:96"/>
               <hi>English</hi> men as were Loyal to their
King and Countrey. Several of those
who were active in the late design
and had been taken, are out of the
Prisons hurried aboard Ships; and
though they were free-born <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
men, and many of them Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
sent to be slaves in the Foreign
Plantations; nor were they alone
served so, but many who though
they had not actually stirr'd, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Protector known as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
not very well affected to his
Tyrannical Government, were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
taken out of their houses and
shipt away in like manner; it not
being enough for him when he had
impoverished them by taking away
their Estates to look upon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
on their misery at home, but to
make them as much as in him lay
the scorn and derision of the World
by selling them to those Plantations,
a punishment usually inflicted on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54812:97"/>
none but thives and vagabonds.
Yet I hope those Noble soules who
were thus dealt withall, account
those miseries and hardships they
have endured but little in respect of
the cause for which they suffered
them.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> in his
journy from <hi>Paris</hi> with the Marquess
of <hi>Ormand</hi> touched at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
where he found his Sister newly
returned from her journey with his
Majesty; and having staid with her
some time there, she accompanied
him to visit their Brother the King
again at <hi>Colen,</hi> with whom she staid
till after the Fair at <hi>Franckford,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Majesty accompanied with
his Royal Sister, the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
the Marquesse of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>Newburg,</hi>
and seueral Ladies and persons of
Quality went in progresse; part of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54812:97"/>
the way they went by Land, and
the other part by water; being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented
in all Princes Countries
through which they passed, by their
chief Ministers of State, and saluted
with the great Guns from their
Towns and Castles: but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
being come into the Terrrito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> they
were saluted by his grand Marshal,
who in the name of his Master
the Elector, invited his Majesty,
the Princesse Royal, and the Duke
of <hi>Glocester</hi> to his Court; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the intent of their progress
was to see that renowned Faire at
<hi>Franckfort</hi> which now drew nigh,
his Majesty sent the Lord <hi>Newburgh</hi>
back with the grand Marshal, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thankes to the Elector for his
civilities; but desiring to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
rill their return, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
with his Royal Sister and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not faile to come and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54812:98"/>
give him thanks in person, and so
his Majesty with his Noble compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
continued their journey.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at <hi>Franckford,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was brought to his Majesty that
the Queen of <hi>Swethland</hi> (who had
some time before voluntarily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
her Kingdom into the hands
of <hi>Carolus Gustavus</hi> her Kinsman)
was passing that way in her intended
Journey for <hi>Italy,</hi> whereupon his
Majesty sent a Noble Lord to
acquaint her Royal Highnesse the
Queen <hi>Christina,</hi> that he was ready
to wait npon her at what place soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
she should be pleased to appoint
for an interview; her Majesty recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the message with a great deal
of affection, telling the Messenger
That she was highly obliged to his
Majesty of <hi>England</hi> for so great an
honour, and that if he pleased, she
would not fail to meet him at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningstein</hi>
a villiage not farre from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54812:98"/>
               <hi>Franckford,</hi> where his Majesty for
the time resided.</p>
            <p>And accordingly there these two
Potentates, (both equally deprived
of their Kingdomes, onely with this
distinction, the one voluntary, the
other by force and Tyranny) met;
The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> being there
first attended his Majesty: &amp; he being
come was immediately admitted,
in a room there purposely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and having had neer half an
hours private discourse with her,
the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was admitted,
and presently after the Lords that
attended his Majesty; there passing
between their two Majesties many
ceremonious complements; and so
after a little longer discourse they
took their leaves. The Princess Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
being a little indisposed went not
to this interview.</p>
            <p>His Majesty having tarried at
<hi>Franckford</hi> as long as seem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54812:99"/>
to that Royal Company in
his departure thence according to
the promise he had before made by
the Lord <hi>Newburgh;</hi> passed through
the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> his Countrey,
resolving to give him a visit, but that
Noble Prince had so much of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in him that he met his Majesty
a great part of the way, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
him with his Royal Company
to a Pallace of his, where he sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously
entertained them for three
or four dayes; and then himself in
person accompanied them a good
part of their way to <hi>Colen,</hi> from
whence shortly after his Majesties
arrival there the Princess Royal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
for <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean the Protector of
<hi>England</hi> having a good while before
made a peace with the <hi>Hollander,</hi>
fearing that the Nation should grow
rebellious to him, if they lay free
from Warres, which would fill
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54812:99"/>
their purses; resolues to keep them
low, and at diet; to which effect he
begins a war with <hi>Spain</hi> at first in his
Western Territories, but soon after
(that businesse not succeeding) in
his <hi>Europaean</hi> quartars, which made
<hi>Mazarine</hi> with all hast possible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the concluding the League
Offensive and Defensive with the
Protector, which being by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
to be as benificial for his
own interest as for the <hi>French,</hi> was
easily and willingly assented to; but
the chief Article of this Peace was
that his Majesty, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi>
and <hi>Glocester</hi> with all their relations
and friends should be expelied out
of, and no more admitted into the
Kingdome of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly had the <hi>French</hi> King
had but the least touch or sense of
honour, he would have counted
this the hardest condition in the
World, or indeed he would never
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54812:100"/>
at all have treated with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
but that he should yield to such
a condition, as to banish out of his
Kingdome those who came to him
for succour and relief in the utmost
extremity that ever Princes were
put to, and these too his nearest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
being Brothers and Sisters
children: And this to make a league
offensive with him who had murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Father, and expelled them
out of their Dominions. What was
this? but the owning of that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and aggravating their oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
instead of relieving them. But
neither honour nor relation can
stand in competition with self Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
            <p>His Majesty had before fore-saw
what the event of this treaty would
be, and had therefore wisely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
himself from <hi>France</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a complemental Explusion.
But the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who in regard
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54812:100"/>
of the great command which he had
in the Army, had stai'd there till the
conclusion of the League, was now
warned to depart with all his reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
(consisting of a gallant number
of young <hi>English</hi> gentlemen bred up
under his valour and conduct) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
those many great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
which he had performed for
that Kingdom, in requital of which
he had only a complemental Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
made him for the necessity of his
departure, &amp; a small time respited
for his stay, during which he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
by the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> then, in
<hi>France,</hi> and other <hi>French</hi> Grandees;
but more especially by the Marshal
of <hi>Turine,</hi> who extreamly loved im
and above all others expressed a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for his dismissement; but at
length the day perfixed being come,
his Grace having solemnly taken
his leave of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the
Queen his Mother, and the rest of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54812:101"/>
his friends at the <hi>French</hi> Court, he
takes his journey towards <hi>Flanders,</hi>
accompanied by the Earle of <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
and severall other <hi>English</hi>
Lords.</p>
            <p>For upon the rupture of the peace
between <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and the
King of <hi>Spain, Don Iohn de Austria,</hi>
Governour Royall of the Low
Countries, for his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
(commiserating our Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Condition, now that his
Interest might stand them in some
stead,) had sent the Count <hi>De Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saldagne,</hi>
his Ambassadour to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> then resident
(as I said before) at <hi>Colon,</hi> inviting
him into the Low Countries, and
assuring him in the name of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Majesty all possible service
and assistance: which invitation his
Majesty graciously accepted, and
soon after took his journey from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> and being
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54812:101"/>
come to <hi>Bruges,</hi> the place appointed
for his reception, he was received
with all honour imaginable, and
conducted to a Pallace purposely
provided for him, where he hath
for the most part ever since remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Hither the Duke of <hi>York</hi> came
accompanied as aforesaid, having
first in his way touched at <hi>Brussels,</hi>
where he was magnificently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and complemented by <hi>Don
Iohn,</hi> to whom he freely proffered
his service in the Wars, which was
accepted with a great deal of
thanks, &amp; though he had not at first
a command given him correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to that which he left in the
<hi>French</hi> Army, yet was his prudence,
courage, valour, and conduct in no
lesse respect, as afterwards by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> esteem of him appeared,
From thence he went to wait on his
Majesty at <hi>Bruges,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54812:102"/>
with an affection correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the near alliance with his
sacred Majesty.</p>
            <p>Before his Majestie's departure
from <hi>Colen,</hi> there happened a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
of one of those persons, who
under pretence of waiting upon
him, Captain <hi>Manning</hi> by name)
discovered unto the Protector all
his Designes and Counsels, who
being found out was by his Majesties
Command sent to a strong Castle
adjacent to <hi>Colen,</hi> there to be
kept close prisoner. But all the
Court being highly incensed against
him for his perfidiousnesse, one of
his Majesties Servants (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to order) pistol'd him as he
was lighting out of the Coach at the
Castle gate, giving him lesse then
the due regard of his so abominable
treachery.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> being arrived
(as I said) at <hi>Bruges,</hi> was highly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54812:102"/>
by all the persons of quality
there resident; and his Majesty,
(who not withstanding <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s
earnest endeavours, either to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
disable, or make slaves of his
loyal subjects, had nevertheless some
true friends io <hi>England,</hi> who were
still ready to venture lives &amp; estates
for his so just cause) had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a considerable number of such
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> whose Loyalty
had banished them from their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
and who were ready at all
occasions to assist both his Majesty
and themselves for the recovery of
his and their just rights and estates;
but the continual advice which
<hi>Cromwell</hi> alwaies had from those
treacherous persons which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
about his Majesty, made all
enterprizes tending to the regaining
of his Kingdoms, and redeeming of
his subjects liberty ineffectual.</p>
            <p>This Army which his Majesty had
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54812:103"/>
quartered near the sea side to be
ready on all occasions for transport,
was afterwards (since there was no
apparent hopes that his Majesty
might make any succesfull use of
them) imployed in the service of the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his Majesty of <hi>Spain</hi> had then
great need of men in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the
<hi>English</hi> Protector having according
to articles agreed upon between
him &amp; the <hi>French</hi> King, sent over six
thousand foot for his assistance in his
wars against <hi>Flanders,</hi> in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which help the <hi>English</hi> were
to have <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which was agreed
on to be beleaguer'd by the joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst in the mean time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
<hi>Cromwell</hi> is by a parcel of a
Parliament, of which Sir <hi>Thomas
Withrington</hi> was Speaker, invested
with his power, and installed in
<hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, and now he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54812:103"/>
those dignities which were
formerly the Kingly rewards of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
upon his co-partners and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
and whether in mockery of
that Government which he had so
violently endeavoured to abolish,
or out of a perjured intention to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it in himself, which he swore not
to endure in another, he established
a Pageant House of Lords, who
though then made to rule &amp; domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
over the Nation; yet were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
most of them persons not fit
to be servants to some mean Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks:
this was that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he had so solemly
sworn against; but when men have
once forgot their Loyalty to their
Soveraign, what vices will they not
run into.</p>
            <p>But to return again to <hi>Flanders.</hi>
The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Armies had
according to the articles concluded
on betwixt them beleaguer d <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:54812:104"/>
which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> knowing to be
a place of great importance, and an
inlet into <hi>Flanders</hi> by sea for <hi>English</hi>
Forces, used his utmost endeavours
to raise the sieges; to which effect he
levied what Forces he could, either
by his own or his Majesties influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp; having made up a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army himself in person, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by the <hi>English</hi> Dukes of <hi>York</hi>
&amp; <hi>Glocester,</hi> together with those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
formerly addicted to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
service, advanced towards the
joyntforce of the <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>English</hi>
then beleaguering the Town, who
understanding by their scouts of his
approach, left such Forces in the
leagure as might secure them within
from a sally, and drew up towards
<hi>Don Iohn,</hi> who had encamped near
<hi>Fuernes:</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi>
were (notwithstanding those forces
they had left in the trenches) much
more numerous then the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:54812:104"/>
both in horse and foot, which made
them the more resolved in the
Encounter; for though the others
came to raise the siege, yet the besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
were the first assaulters.</p>
            <p>The first brush began with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
hope of <hi>English</hi> infantry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of above three hundred, who
desperately charged upon a party of
the <hi>Spanish</hi> foot (which had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n themselves upon a
rising ground, and seconded by
<hi>Lockart</hi>'s Regiment, commanded
by Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Fenmick,</hi>
and some other additional supplies
of <hi>English</hi> Infantry, routed not only
them, but the other bodies of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
foot drawn up on the same
manner. In this charge Lieutenout
Colonel <hi>Fenwick</hi> received his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
wound, and some other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Commanders were slain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Cavalry seeing their
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54812:105"/>
foot so easily put to a rout, began
likewise to flie, nor could by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoors
be perswaded to stand;
whereupon the <hi>French</hi> Horse who
had all that while stood still, and
seen the <hi>English</hi> do execution on the
Enemies foot, with a full career pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
their flying Enemies, of whom
they found little opposition, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what was made by the thrice va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>giment, who
for a time made the whole <hi>French</hi>
Army to stand, &amp; saved the lives of
many of their flying friends, which
else had been sacrificed to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
fury, whilst in the mean time
they dedicated their own lives or
persons to their safeties.</p>
            <p>For after they had made a very
noble and gallant resistance, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by numbers, and having no
supplies to refresh their wearied bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they were forced to yeild to
their Enemies numbers, or trust to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54812:105"/>
the swiftnesse of their horses heels;
but very few of them escaped, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which were the Dukes of
<hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> though the first
was not heard of till three daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which made some suspect that
he was taken by the <hi>French</hi> Forces,
but by <hi>Turine</hi> after at a fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
nobly releast.</p>
            <p>I may particularly take occasion
here to commend the valour of the
Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s own Troop, who
indeed bore the brunt of the whole
Battel, though I cannot deny but
they were seconded by some very
Noble spirits of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but
the personal valour of Mr. <hi>Henry
Bendish</hi> son to Sir <hi>Thomas Bendish</hi>
Ambassadour for the <hi>English</hi> Nation
in <hi>Turky</hi> (who had the ill fortune to
be taken prisoner) must not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>Let us now change the Scene a
little to <hi>England,</hi> where the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54812:106"/>
begins to die the Scaffold in as
deep a purple as the Vest given him
at his late Instalement bore; and
that not onely with the bloud of
those seculars that were loyal to their
Soveraign, but having as he thought
now secured to himself the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his hand reaches to the sacred
Clergy, nor will he strike at a reed
or a shrub amongst them, but imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Ancient fable of the <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian</hi>
Thunder, strikes at the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
the <hi>Atlas,</hi> the mainest pillar and
support of the Protestant Religion;
for no lesse then the Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Hewet's</hi> blood will now satisfie
his insatiate Cruelty; a man whose
vertues and piety as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
expression, so I think was
the manner of his death beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>This Doctor &amp; Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi>

in <hi>Hull</hi> Castle) with many others are
accused of a design to have seized on
the Tower of <hi>London</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gazine

several others to be their assistants,
and that especially in <hi>London,</hi> who
while the Doctor was securing the
Tower, must fire the City of <hi>London</hi>
in several places.</p>
            <p>Those that make plots may as
easily discover them, and with as
much ease prevent them; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
could do both: but to make
some shew of a great deel of fear in
the businesse; Worthy Alderman
<hi>Tichburn</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54812:107"/>
of <hi>Ormond</hi> had lately been in

the Common Enemy (for so was

ready with a potent Army, &amp; ships
hired to transport them on the Sea
coasts of <hi>England,</hi> and that therefore
the <hi>Militia</hi> should be settled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding
hands, meaning such either
whose interest or fear must render
them faithful to the Protector; short<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
after, according to the common
course, the persons to be accused are
apprehended, the chief of which
were Dr. <hi>Hewet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohu Mordant</hi>

Col. <hi>Ashton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Henry Mallory,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Woodcock, Iohn Betteley, Edmund

The ordinary Tyrannical way of a
High Court of Justice must do it;
Sir <hi>Henry Slignsby</hi> (who was brought
prisoner from <hi>Hull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Castle) was the
first who came before them, and is
accused for having endeavoured to
draw the Governor of that Castle
from his Allegience (<hi>excellently
good!</hi>) to the Protector, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not guilty, yet was by two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
found ready, convicted and
condemned.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> being come before
them (according to the example of
his Royal Master King <hi>Charles</hi> the
first) refused to plead or own the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the Court, for which
contempt (as they were pleased to
interpret it) he had the same sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
pronounced against him, and
was afterwards together with Sir
<hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> executed on Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> brother to the Earl
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54812:108"/>
of <hi>Peterborough</hi> disavowed likewise
the Authority of the Court; but at
last being induced to plead, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
so was Mr. <hi>Woodcock,
Mallory, Fryer, sumner,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
were sentenced but reprieved;
<hi>Ashton, Stacy,</hi> and <hi>Bettely</hi> were
hanged, drawn and quartered in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we must not forget the
magnanimous death of <hi>Iohn Bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
who having made a Speech,
clearing his Innocency and the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Cause, undauntedly leapt
off the Ladder, and died a worthy
sufferer for the Royal Interest.</p>
            <p>His sacred Majesty (during these
strange Murders and oppressions of
his Subjects in <hi>England</hi> by a power
which had usurpt the Regality) is
forced to sit still; his urgent necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
not giving him leave either to
revenge their deaths or redeem the
surviving, who heavily groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54812:108"/>
the yoke, his onely remedy now
was his prayers to God (which he
pursues with an earnest devotion)
that he would be pleas'd in his good
time to deliver his faithful Subjects
from those miseries and burdens
they then struggled under, and
without doubt God hath heard, and
will perform his pious desires.</p>
            <p>As an introduction to which it
pleased the DIVINE MAJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STY
to take out of this world the
grandest opposer of his Majesty's
Right, OLIVER CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL,
who from a mean begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
had raised himself by force to
be the arbitrary Governour of these
Nations, is by the Almighty called
to give an account of his actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the High Tribunal of Heaven,
where are neither false witnesses nor
interessed Judges, and that on the
same day on which he had gained
two such signall victories over his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54812:109"/>
Majestie's forces at <hi>Dunbar</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,
viz.</hi> on the third day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he thought he had so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
secured the Government of these
three Nations for himself, and that
he nominates his son <hi>Richard</hi> for his
Successour, a person, to speak the
truth, as not at all endowed with his
fathers courage, so not at all inclined
to his ambition: one, whom if fame
lies not of him, could have willingly
been content to have surrendred his
Protectorship to the Kingship of the
lawfull heir, and (by law) undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Successour.</p>
            <p>But those Officers of the Army,
whose ambition, though not in so
high a degree, had so engaged them
as Complices to <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> in
his high late designes against his
King and Countrey, had so great a
load of guilt upon their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that they could not hear of,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54812:109"/>
much less agree to the admission of
his sacred Majesty.</p>
            <p>Nor was it indeed only thus, but
some ambitious spirits there were,
and particularly Maj. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eneral <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
whose high-flown thoughts
made him fancy Idea's in his brain,
and forc't him to attempt the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
to make him Commander
of these three Nations, as <hi>Oliver</hi> (by
his means) had done before, which
designes of his in the sequell, ruin'd
him, and discovered those grand
cheates and abuses which that party
had put upon the Nation, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to enslave them to their
own arbitrary power, whilst they
pretended those strangely taken
names of Religion and Liberty as
hereafter will appear.</p>
            <p>And these passages I shall the more
fully insert, as tending so much to
his Majesties Interest here, &amp; to the
undeceiving of his good subjects,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54812:110"/>
who are not blinded with Interest
which the Usurpers had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make the most potent men in
the Mation, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sums of money, by selling such
cheap penny worths of the Kings,
Queens, Bishops, Deans and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
lands, which together with the
purchases of the Estates of such loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
subjects to his Majesty, as those
in power were pleased to stile De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
had near infatuated a
good part of the Nation.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, let us now begin
with these distractions. 'Tis an old
Proverb in <hi>English, When thieves fall
out, then honest men come by their
Goods:</hi> may it now prove as true as
old, which (God be praised) we
have some reason to hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> the greatest,
though most heroick enemy of his
King and Countrey being dead, his
son <hi>Richard</hi> was proclaimed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54812:110"/>
and for some times seemingly
complyed with; but <hi>Lambert</hi>'s am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
which had long lain hid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
now to appear, and something
he whispers into the ears of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which mixt with the great love
they had formerly for him, easily
creates a dislike of <hi>Richard</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which afterwards grows
to such a height, that by a joynt-Conspiracy
the Protectorship is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted,
and <hi>Richurd</hi> deprived of
his Government, the taking away of
which he as willingly consents to, as
they are ready to deprive him of it.</p>
            <p>This was the first jarring which
this Generation had amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which notwithstanding was
composed by the Protector's easie
consent, without the shedding of
one drop of blood. But there yet
remained to his Deposers the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
task, since they were sufficiently
sensible that though they had pull'd
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54812:111"/>
down one civil Government, they
must be inforc't (though never so
unwillingly) to set up another.</p>
            <p>For they very well knew, that they
had already so much gull'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they could not but now
be sensible of their many abuses; yet
they fly to their old pretences of
Religion and Liberty: and under
that pretence (since they must at
least establish the face of a civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they call again (Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to have one like themselves)
that <hi>Iuncto</hi> which was formerly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by <hi>Oliver, those that murdered
their King, and had for some years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
their Native Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I cannot tell whether it were
their inclinations in the Generall, or
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s particular perswasions,
which called these men even out of
the grave of infamy to sit again in
the House, and rule as Lords <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi>
over these Nations, though I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54812:111"/>
have a great deal of reason to believe
ir was the latter, since <hi>Lambert</hi>'s am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
might rather prompt him to
begin with those men, and con over
an old one, experimentally taught
him by his old Master <hi>Oliver,</hi> then
hazard the venture of a new lesson.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Iuncto</hi> being thus recall'd
to their seats in the House, and the
exercise of their former Arbitrary
power and authority by their <hi>Quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
servants of the Army, accept of
the invitation; and accordingly met
in the Parliament House, whether
likewise there assembled severall of
those Members which had formerly
been secludec and debar'd sitting in
1648. These demand now an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
right with the others, either to
Consult or Vote; but as they had
been formerly violently thrust out:
so they are now forceably kept out
by the Officers of the Army.</p>
            <p>This causes another as great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54812:112"/>
of their affairs. For these
secluded Members do not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
their right by Law and Reason
(which could nothing prevail with
sword-men) but Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>
and some others levy Armes now
more truly in defence of Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
priviledges then those raised in
1642.</p>
            <p>This small Army rtised in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
gave <hi>Lambert</hi> as fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to put in execution his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
designes, as possibly could be;
for he being sent with the greatest
force of the Army against Sir <hi>George</hi>
easily overcomes him, takes him
prisoner, and retakes those Holds
which he had possest himself of, and
so returns victorious.</p>
            <p>This fortunate successe revived
his antient credit with the Army,
and now he begins to practise the
ruin of those which he had so lately
set up, that he might give full scope
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54812:112"/>
to his own Ambition. They found
out his designes, but yet not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hinder them, are forced short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after to submit to a dissolution.</p>
            <p>Thus was this Nation hurried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
changes of Government, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall
confusions, by persons
who endeavoured only to promote
their own ends and self-interest; yet
by these strange endeavours of their
own, they only lost themselves, for
the people, beginning now to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their juggles, do as much detest
them; and though they might for
the present force the people to a
submission by sword-law; yet
could no Government whatsoever,
by them establisht, be firm or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
since it must be settled contrary
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the people.</p>
            <p>For even those who were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such strong enemies and opposers
of Monarchy or Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
undeceived by those many
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54812:113"/>
delusions which they see put upon
the Nation (by those who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so much to Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the settling of a Free State
or Commonwealth, whilst they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely their own ends) are
now as much affected as they were
formerly disaffected with Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
Government, finding that
thofe who adventure to change a
settled Government before they
have determined of another in its
stead, run into fancies and <hi>Chyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's,</hi>
and vainly endeavour to build
castles in the air. but to proceed.</p>
            <p>This party being thus divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, there were great
hopes, and certainly, greater
wishes that that power wherewith
they had for some years past, arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
governed the Nation by turns,
might at lenght come to a period,
which by the eye of reason was now
in greater proability then ever, they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54812:113"/>
by their intestine divisions running
headlong to their own ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fleetwood, Lambert,</hi> and the rest
of the Officers of the Army, have
now the sole Authority, and having
the longest sword, make their wills
a law; yet somewhat to satisfie the
people, and to make at least the face
of a civil government, they set up a
new kind of a thing which they
composed of themselves, and some
other choice persons which they
call a <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> and to
these they give full Authority over
these three Nations, without ever
asking the peoples consent.</p>
            <p>This Government is far more the
scorn and derision of the people, then
the other, yet notwithstanding their
spirits are by constant use so subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to slavery, that their assinine
backs are forced to endure this as
well as other more intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
they not daring all this while
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54812:114"/>
to adventure the regaining of their
Liberties, nor indeed do other then
by their tongues expresse their hate
and anger.</p>
            <p>But all this while those divisions
of theirs, and the peoples being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them, and extremely for his
Majestie's interest, it being a rule in
Politicks, that the peoples hatred to
an Usurper doth alwayes produce
their love to a lawfull Prince, nor
had they before, 'till deluded by
those Tyrannizers any time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the miseries of their lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
which now they begin to
compassionate, and seeing him the
only person whom these men ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by all means possible to keep
down, hatred to their tyrannies,
makes the people naturally desire
his restauration, and him whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they thought justly expulsed,
they think it both Justice, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to reinstate, as much considering
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54812:114"/>
it to be their own as his interest, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
having taught them the
difference between the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by one gentle Prince, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Rusticks.</p>
            <p>Thus far did these mens divisions
invest his sacred Majesty with the
love of his people, who in the mean
time lives retiredly at <hi>Bruges,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
either what the good will of
his subjects might do for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to his Right, or what the
successe might be of that Treaty
which was then (the grand action of
<hi>Europe</hi>) in agitation between those
two potent Monarchs <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> from whose joynt-forces he
might expect so great a supply as
might have reinstated him in his
Dominions by force, a course most of
all opposite to his Majestie's nature,
who even in private things never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
any thing by violence, which
he can obtain by intreaty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:54812:115"/>
Yet great hopes had the Royallists
both in <hi>England</hi> &amp; abroad, that this
Treaty would produce some good
effects; yet it went on very slowly,
and after a great deal of tediousness
came to a cessation, and from that to
an interview between the two grand
Officers of State, <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi>
Count <hi>De Olivares,</hi> chief favourite
to his Catholick Majesty, &amp; Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Mazarine,</hi> chief Minister of
State to the most Christian King;
these being met upon the Frontier,
his sacred Majesty of great <hi>Brittain,</hi>
was invited thither by <hi>Don Lewis de
Haro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty received this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at <hi>Diepe</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> whither
he had privately withdrawn himself
(as likewise had his Brother the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Calice</hi>) that they
might be in a readinesse to have
come over into <hi>England,</hi> upon any fit
opportunity, they having received
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54812:115"/>
many invitations from their friends
here, about that time when Sir
<hi>George Booth</hi> was up in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> &amp; all
<hi>England</hi> in a manner gaping for him.
But Sir <hi>George</hi> being (as I said before)
overcome, his Majesti's and the
whole Nations hopes fail'd, and the
fanatick power still continued <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty therefore from <hi>Deipe</hi>
begins his journey towards the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Spain,</hi> which journey he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make privately, and being
first come to <hi>Roan,</hi> he was there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
entertained and feasted by Mr.
<hi>Scot,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Merchant, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
his Majesty to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Church, about three miles
from the City, where with a great
deal of Devotion and attention he
heard a Sermon.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Roan,</hi> his Majesty accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oneen</hi> took
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54812:116"/>
Post, steering their course directly
for <hi>Bayonne</hi> (near which the two
great Officers of state were to meet)
not staying in any place, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by all means possible to
travel undiscovered as was before
resolved.</p>
            <p>Being come near to the end of
his Journey, advice was sent to <hi>Don
Lewis de Haro</hi> of his Majesties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
who immediately (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a very gallant Train)
came forth to meet him, and being
come near unto him, <hi>Don Lewis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
from his horse, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the place where they met
was very dirty, kneeling down, he
clapt his hands about his Majesties
Knees, and with a great deal of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
kissed them.</p>
            <p>His Majesty was from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
with becoming Ceremonies,
to the place appointed for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation
(<hi>Don Lewis</hi> riding all the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54812:116"/>
way bareheaded by him) where he
was entertained with all possible
splendor and gallantry.</p>
            <p>Many overtures and propositions
there passed, between his Majesty
and <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> touching
what aid and assistance might be
granted him by his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
for the regaining of his rights
and Kingdoms; his Majesty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by all means possible, to
promote and further the present
Treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
and to bring it to a happy conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Marriage of the King of
<hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Infanta, it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so much to his Interest, that till
the conclusion of it, nothing could
be effected by those Princes, which
might any way promote his Right
or possession.</p>
            <p>To all his desires or propositions,
the noble count <hi>De Olivares</hi> returned
pleasing answers, and carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54812:117"/>
with so much respect towards
him, that he could not have been
more submissive to the Catholick
Majesty of <hi>Spain</hi> his Master.</p>
            <p>His Majesty having some time
been treated here, returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
through <hi>France,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
some part of his way by
<hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and repassing the rest pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
by Post as he had formerly
passed it, till he came to <hi>Charinton</hi> &amp;
<hi>Paris,</hi> where his Mother was, with
whom he staid some few dayes
(though he was not now Courted
and caressed by the <hi>French</hi> Nobility
as formerly (and then returned to
his residence at <hi>Brussels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesties private departure
from <hi>Brussels,</hi> and his privacy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his whole journey, made it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
believed, that both he and his
Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who lay
at <hi>Calais,</hi> were come over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that they lay here concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54812:117"/>
expecting according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of things, either to discover or
secure themselves: nay so certain
was the belief even those in power
had of it, (who had not so good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
as <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>) that
many persons were apprehended
for them, and particularly one Mr.
<hi>Colt</hi> was taken for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
and kept in prison for him, till such
time as certain news arrived in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
of the Dukes return to <hi>Brussels.</hi>
Several other persons likewise suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
imprisonment for being pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be like either his Majesty or
his Brother.</p>
            <p>His Majesty living retired at <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
the continuance of the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>England</hi> among those who
had usurped his power, doth still
highly promote his interest. For
though <hi>Lambert</hi> had routed Sir
<hi>George Booth,</hi> and by it declared ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
against a Free Parliament
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54812:118"/>
(for which, as the undoubted right
of the Nation, Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and
his Party took up Arms, yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
could not be content, but now
once put in the way, they began
violently to hanker after their long
lost Liberty.</p>
            <p>Nor could the turning out of the
<hi>Rump</hi> (for so had the people out of
Disgrace termed the <hi>Iuncto</hi> which
then sate) whom then inveterately
hated, any whit now sweeten them
in their slavery, but they continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
murmured out &amp; agravated their
oppressions one to another, and
though they came to no violence,
yet 'tis suspected it was more out of
the hope they had that Generall
<hi>George Monck,</hi> (who was then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
with his Army out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
should assert their Liberties,
(which somewhat allayed the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fury) then out of any fear or
Cowardise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:54812:118"/>
But in the mean time their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
seem'd utterly to fail them,
for the <hi>Rump</hi> had by their industry
so inveigled most of the Army from
<hi>Lambert,</hi> that by their help they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
&amp; take their seats in the House
and dissolve his <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi>
command the Soldiers of his Army
to repair to their appointed Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

their orders, marching up his Army
quite through <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Nation had so great hopes
of the Noble General, that in all his
passage through <hi>England,</hi>

               </gap>he is
courted with addresses from the
Gentry of every County, remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the distractions they long had,
and were still like to lye under, and
inteating that they would be (as they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54812:119"/>
hoped hee'd prove) the Deliverer
and saver of his Countrey; that to
settle them in some way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Parliament might be
called by the free Votes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they might no longer be
Governed by such Wolves, as onely
made a Prey of them, nor their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
be subjected to the awe
and force of an exorbitant Army.
To all these desires he returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
promising such things as
might be for the good of the Nation</p>
            <p>But being come to <hi>London</hi> (where
he was received with a great deal of
<hi>joy</hi>) he put the people almost quite
out of hopes of him, nay rather into
a fear, that instead of proving their
deliverer, he would be the means to
enslave them; for by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Rump,</hi> he enters the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with his whole Army, imprisons
many of their <hi>Common Council,</hi> digs
up their Posts, and breakes down
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54812:119"/>
their Gates, whilst the stupifi'd Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
having now fear added to
their slavery, durst hardly murmur
at, but with sighs and nods bid <hi>adieu</hi>
to their Liberty.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
the Noble Generall revives
their hopes, and retiring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the City, refusing to be
subject to the <hi>Iuncto's</hi> command
Shortly after he admits those Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House of <hi>Commons</hi> which
were in 1648. forceably excluded
by the Army, for having given their
Votes that the Rings Concessions at
the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> Treaty, were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grounds for a peace and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
who having taken their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the House, we had now got a
step towards our ancient happinesse,
one of the three Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>viz.</hi> the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
permitted to sit freely, a thing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54812:120"/>
not known so us in twelve prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
years: God of Heaven of his
mercy to these Nations, grant, that
the other two may in his due time
admitted to the discharge of their
power and trust, that these Nations
once so famous under that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may no longer continue to
be the scorn and derision of foreign
Countries.</p>
            <p>And great hopes there is now that
these Kingdomes may again return
to be happy, since disloyalty (the first
cause of their miseries and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
begins, blessed be God, every
day to be depressed, and loyalty to
flourish, many of those who formely
with a zealous fury broak their oath
of Allegiance to their King, wishing
now that they had a King to shew
allegiance to; &amp; perceiving that all
innovations of Government are not
whatsome would have themseem to
be, <hi>viz.</hi> ways to liberty &amp; freedom,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54812:120"/>
but meer baits of ambitions self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
men, to hook in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to slavery.</p>
            <p>But to return to his Majesty
in <hi>Flanders;</hi> of whose itenary life
we have already given you a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account; it will not be
impertiment to say somewhat of
his sedentary and retired living,
that by his oeconomy we may
judge of his Monarchy, and of
the government of those few sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in his Family, of that of his
three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>His Majesty hath spent most of
his time, wherein he hath been
out of his Dominions, in <hi>Flanders</hi>
under the protection of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> nor had
he ever any where else so setled
a Court and habitation, as here,
where his chiefe attendants are
the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> the
Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earle of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54812:121"/>
               <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and many others,
Nobles and Gentlemen, whose
loyalty to his sacred Majesty and
his Royall Father hath made
exiles to their Country; a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
number of which he makes
use of for his Councell, doing
nothing without serious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
advice; and yet being of so
stagacious a judgement that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he sayes is seldome contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by the most judicious of
his Councellors, not out of feare
or flattery, but out of a reall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to, and concurrence with his
judgement.</p>
            <p>And indeed those great opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
which he hath had, by his
so long being abroad, of diving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the great Councels of Forrein
Princes and States, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
make him a person of a very
perspicuous understanding, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54812:121"/>
him with all those qualities
which may deservedly attain the
name of Great, and render him
as well an able Statist, as a King;
he having during his expulsion
travelled through, and lived in
the Countries of three the most
potent Princes in Christendome,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Emperour's of <hi>Germany,</hi>
and the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and
<hi>France;</hi> and so to the Germain
resolution added the Spaniards
prudence, and the Frenchmans
expedition.</p>
            <p>To these extraordinary helps
which never a Prince in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
can boast of, we may yet
adde, those more then ordinary
gifts wherewith nature hath been
pleased to endow him, which
being so extreamly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
we can hardly now discern;
but that it may be known what
they were, take the character of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54812:122"/>
an Honourable Lord upon his
death bed, who speaking of him
when about fifteen or sixteen
yeers of age, hath these words:
<hi>Truly I never saw greater hopes of
vertue in any young person then in
him: Great judgement, great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
strong apprehension, much
of honour in his nature, and a very
perfect Englishman in his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
So that both nature and
industry have seemed to use their
utmost endeavours to make him
a perfect Prince, his very afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
turning in this to his benefit,
and making him in knowledge
and sufferings (the Refiner of
knowledge) unparraleld. Some
forreign Princes as well envying,
as pittying hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> expulsion.</p>
            <p>This perfect knowledge of his
he hath indeed had but small oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to practice, except a little
in <hi>Scotland:</hi> where, I think, hee
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54812:122"/>
demonstrated himselfe a person
so prudent and carefull in his
affairs, that it is beyond my pens
expression.</p>
            <p>His Subjects good was his only
care; nor did he ever act any
thing but what might tend more
to theirs then his own interest;
still consulting whether it might
benefit them, not himself.</p>
            <p>His Letter to Col. <hi>Mackworth</hi>
Governour of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonstrates his affection
to his very enemies; he would
win, not conquer the hearts of
those who though they have
broke their Allegiance to him, yet
hee would esteem still his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>He would not conquer with
blood, lest he should be thought
a Tyrant. He endeavours by faire
means to attain the love of his
Subjects, that what ever his very
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54812:123"/>
enemies think of him) he may
approve himself to be a just
Prince.</p>
            <p>And did fortune give him po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
yet would he rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
blandishents then force.
He knows that whilst he kills a
Subject he weakens his kingdom.
Rebels themselves may be found
usefull; and though justice can
not, yet his Majesties clemency
will admit their pardon; but if
they resist to the utmost, their
blood is on their own heads. <hi>What
man is not willing to destroy him
who he knows would be his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is his justice and his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
mixt together; he would
not kill, where he might with
safety save. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r does his unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
innocency raise fancies or
fears in him. As he is guilty of
nothing, so ther's nothing hee
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54812:123"/>
fears. Whilst he endeavours to be
true to his subjects, those endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
force a belief in him that
his subjects will be true to him.</p>
            <p>His very nature enclines him
to a compassion. He pitties those
that will not pitty themselves;
and whilst they are conspiring his
destruction, his prayers procure
their safety. Nor can the utmost
of their injuries provoke him to
a retalliation. He hath learned
not only of God, but of the King
his father, to forgive his enemies.</p>
            <p>Nor is it his desire to obtain his
Kingdomes that makes him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to forgive his enemies, but
his desire to forgive his enemies
that makes him willing to obtain
his Kingdoms: he counts the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his Royalties but as a
transitory dignity: the pardon of
his enemies a Divine and lasting
one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54812:124"/>
Neither is his piety lesse then
his justice, they are both in the
Superlative degree, he hates
wickednesse, not because the
world should see him glory (that
would make him an <hi>Hypocrite</hi>)
but because God abhors it; tis
Love not Fear makes him Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
he Fears God only because
he Loves him.</p>
            <p>He hates not the Vicious, but
abhominates their Vices, his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
extends not to persons, but
to things; He dislikes not the
Swearer, tis his Oaths he abhors
he hates not the Drunkard but
his Drunkennesse.</p>
            <p>Yet does his mercy extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their sins, as he is a King so
he is a God, he is gracious to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
as well as just to punish;
nor can a submission or reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but overtake his remission.</p>
            <p>His constant service of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54812:124"/>
others to live by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he sleeps not without invok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the blessing of the Almighty,
nor do his eyes open without a
returned thanks, He knows 'tis
God alone which can restore and
protect him: nor can the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
of man prevail against
Him.</p>
            <p>Nor does his publick devotion
shew him less zealous then his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
the one demonstrates him
full of Zeal, the other void of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie;
he would have others
holy as well as himself; he knows
that saying concerns him, being a
King, above all private Men, <hi>Non
nobis solis nati sumus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Private persons are not alone born
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, muchless Kings, the
publique concern is their duty:
'tis not enough for the Master of
the house that he be godly, whilst
his Family is wicked. There
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54812:125"/>
must be Precept as well as Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and if need be, correction as
well as instruction.</p>
            <p>This makes his Majestie deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
famous; he counts it as
great a fault to suffer a sin in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whilst he hath power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it, as to commit it himself; he
knows that what crimes soever a
Magistrate suffers willingly to be
committed, he brings upon his
own head.</p>
            <p>He is therefore above all things
carefull not to father vice, lest he
should be accounted vicious: he
detests that in another which did
he commit, he knows he might
justly detest himself for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
by Example to reforme
that in others which he knows
were it in him would seem odious
to them.</p>
            <p>He abhors vice, as well because
it is so, as because God abhors it.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54812:125"/>
His nature inclines him to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and as he cannot admit 'its
contrary in himselfe, so he cannot
endure it in another.</p>
            <p>His constancy in Religion is no
less conspicuous then his piety.
His discerning judgement knows
what is truth, and that truth is
followed by his setled will; Yet
he hates not the Popish Religion,
but their Idolatry; he abhors not
them, but their false worship:
He loves all that know <hi>Christ</hi> at
all, but wishes that they might
know him more.</p>
            <p>His stedfastnesse in Religion
proceeds not from self-interest;
he sticks not so much to the true
Protestants, because he knows
the English to be addicted to that
Religion; because hee thinks
it for his benefit; because he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
that it would prove very
difficill to obtaine his Crown
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54812:126"/>
and leave it. But, because he
knows it to be true.</p>
            <p>He knows the Prince is born
for the people, as well as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for the Prince. He knows
their interests to be inter woven.
He knows that without them he
cannot stand; yet will he sooner
loose them then relinquish ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>He is the perfect pattern of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
but more of Patience, his
afflictions have not made him
repine, he knows God to be just:
he believes that as God restored
<hi>Iob</hi> twofold, so will he likewise
restore unto him his Kingdomes.
Yet he thinks it just in God to
suffer them to be detained from
him.</p>
            <p>He laments more his Subject
slavery then his own Exile, he
grives that they have been so long
blind, yet rejoyces for their sakes
that they have now a Glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54812:126"/>
he constantly prays for the
restoring of their fight, not so
much because they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
his, as their own Rights and
Priviledges.</p>
            <p>He is inwardly troubled and
perplexed at the many Schisms,
Sects, and Heresies that are raised
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he is
sorry that their rise is from some
mens envy towards him; he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and his pitty produces his
prayers for them. He is willing
that though they will not obey
him, yet that they may serve God.</p>
            <p>He was never heard to curse his
Enemies, many times to pray for
them, and desire God to forgive
even his Fathers Murtherers; his
good will surpasses their cruelty:
And whilst they are conspiring
his Destruction, he is praying for
their Salvation.</p>
            <p>He is a perfect Enemy to all
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54812:127"/>
Debauchedness, he is sorry those
who pretend themselves his
friends in <hi>England</hi> are so great a
scandal to him: He wishes that
they would so carry themselves,
that he might adventure to own
them as his Friends; for he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not the good will of
those who drink his Health for
the liquors sake, nor wishes
for their help who over their
Sack only swear they will Fight
for Him.</p>
            <p>He is no greater a hater of vice
then a Cherisher of vertuous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he loves them in his very
Enemies, and often grives when
he finds occasion to think that
many of them will rise up in
Judgment against his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Friends.</p>
            <p>He is most exactly just in all
his Commands, and faithful in
performance of all his Promises.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54812:127"/>
Take the Character given him by
the dying Marquesse of <hi>Montrose
For his Majesty now Living</hi> (saith
he) <hi>Never People I believe may be
more happy in a King, his commands
to me were most Iust, in nothing that
he promiseth will be fail: He deals
justly with all Men,</hi> &amp;c. So punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
is he, that when a word is once
gone out of his Mouth he will
rather suffer by it then break it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, he is the pattern
of Patience and Piety, the most
Righteous and Justest of Kings.
The most knowing and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
of Princes. The Holiest
and the best of Men. The seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
punisher of Vice. The strictest
rewarder of Virtue. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantest
perseverer in Religion.
And the truest lover of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>This a short Character of his
illustrious Majesty, which I fear
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54812:128"/>
those that know him will rather
think to come short of then reach
his due praise, so sweetly vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is he in all his Carriages, so
affable in his discourse, so void of
passion and anger, that he was
never yet heard or seen in Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
the utmost extent of any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that ever was discerned in
him, being towards one of his
Menial Servants, who justifying
himself in what he had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
his Majesty with some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
told him that he was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Fellow.</p>
            <p>Yet this is that Prince whose
vertues we have given leave to
Forraign Nations to admire,
whilst we our selves have rested
as well ignorant of his deserts, as
destitute of our own Liberty
whilst either infatuated or blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those who have Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
usurped governments over
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54812:128"/>
us, we have been contented to sit
still and see him expulsed and
exiled from his due Rights and
Royalties, and our selves from
our Freedome and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Nor hath God alone been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to us in endowing his sacred
Majesty with such Heroick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
but he hath given us a stock
of noble Princes, who seeme to
emulate Virtue in one another,
and grow up like Royal Oaks to
maintain the Honour and Glory
of this Nation, but are yet and
have a long time been the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of it, all the Nations in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
laughing at the <hi>English</hi> folly,
who slight that happinesse which
they might enjoy.</p>
            <p>As for the illustrious Duke of
<hi>York</hi> his Fame is spread so farr o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the World, that my self have
heard the very <hi>Turks</hi> commend
and applaude his Vallour which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54812:129"/>
was so esteemed of among the
<hi>French,</hi> that before he arrived at
twenty one years of Age he was
by that King thought worthy the
command of Liev. General of his
Army's, which he managed with
such care and prudence that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
any affair he took in hand,
produced not its desired success;
and since, his being in requital of
his services, complemented out of
that Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> though
he hath not had such eminent
commands conferr'd on him by
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet have they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
thought him worth the
Highest imployment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> he
is esteemed by most to be fitter
for a Counsellour then a Souldier.
His Carriage is grave, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
severe; of a Sagace Genious
and understanding, &amp; very much
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54812:129"/>
prying into State Affairs, which
have made most judge him the
fitter for a Council board.</p>
            <p>These three Princes, are like
three <hi>Diamonds</hi> or <hi>Pearls</hi> which
we have ignorantly cast away, &amp;
not come to know the worth of
them till we come to want them,
Their vertues having made them
resplendent throughout all the
World, and rendred them, if we
justly consider it, the only means
whereby we can attain to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
for what Nation can be
more blessed then that which
hath for her Prince a just King to
Govern, a Valiant Duke to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and a Wise Counsellour to
Advise.</p>
            <p>May the God of Heaven then open
our Eyes and let us at length see our
Errour, and heartily repent of it, by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54812:130"/>
calling our Native Soveraign to the
possession of his due Rights, Which
the Divine Majesty (I hope) will be
Graciously pleased to grant.</p>
