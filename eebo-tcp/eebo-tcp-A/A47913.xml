            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Reply to the Second Part of the
Character of a Popish Successor.</head>
            <p>WHoever duely considers the Bent, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the <hi>Two Characters</hi> here in question, will
easily Discern that the <hi>Exclusion</hi> of the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> is the Least part of the Authours, either
<hi>Hope,</hi> or <hi>Pretension.</hi> For there are but Two ways to bring it
about, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or a <hi>Rebellion.</hi> As to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the King hath over and over Declared himself against
it; and most Expressly in his Late Declaration, <hi>(Apr. 8. 1681.
P. 7.)</hi> in These words, (speaking of a Total Exclusion) <hi>[A
Point, that in our own Royall Iudgment, so nearly concern'd us, both in
Honour, Iustice, and Conscience, that we could never consent to it.]</hi>
Now with what face shall any Subject Presume to Importune his
Soveraign; or how can he Expect, by a Pamphlet, to Gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, to the Violation of all these Duties? And yet we see the
Point pursued, though no way in the world to be Effected but
by a Sedition: which, by the method taken, a body would sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be the Business too; for the Dint of the Discourse strikes
altogether that way. 'Tis the <hi>Popish Successor</hi> I must Confess that
makes the <hi>Report;</hi> and the Wind drives the <hi>Smoak</hi> in the face
of the <hi>Duke;</hi> but 'tis the <hi>King</hi> all this while that receives the
<hi>Shot.</hi> As for Example: He takes ye the <hi>Treachery</hi> of a <hi>Wolf,</hi> the
<hi>Fierceness</hi> of a <hi>Tyger,</hi> the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of a <hi>Pardon'd Traytor;</hi> and
here's, in short, the Composition of his <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor;</hi>
with <hi>Slavery</hi> and Damnation at his Heels. This Frightfull
Figure puts the People naturally upon That Question, <hi>Act. 16. 30.
What must we do to be sav'd?</hi> Why truly (says the <hi>Character)</hi> the
King has lost himself Strangely with sticking to his Brother.
<hi>[His Peoples Knees are almost as Stubborn, as their Petitions and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
have been Ineffectuall. (And I am affraid there are too many, who
in Detestation of that One</hi> Gangreen'd Branch of Royalty, <hi>can scarce
forbear (how Vndutifully soever) to Murmur, and Revile, even at
that Imperial Root that Cherishes it.</hi> Pa. 10. Part 1.] Insomuch that
<hi>[in Studying to Prevent Tyranny, they grow Iealous of</hi> Monarchy, &amp;c.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95359:3"/>
               <hi>And so far from Supplying the Real and most Pressing Necessityes of</hi> his
<hi>Majesty, that they are rather well pleas'd, and Triumph, in his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Wants: and that perhaps; when his Glory, nay possibly when his</hi> near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Safety <hi>calls for their Assistance.</hi> P. 11.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Writer of the Character has told the People a Heavy
Tale here, but what if their</hi> Knees will not bend? <hi>what if there be</hi>
Murmurings <hi>and</hi> Revilings; <hi>and not one farthing of mony to be
gotten? Are we ever the nearer the</hi> Disinheriting <hi>of a</hi> Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
<hi>for all this? No; But if the King will not yield, the</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<hi>will shew you a Trick for that too. The</hi> Lords Anointed?
<hi>[I</hi> would ask <hi>(says he)</hi> what this LORDS ANOINTED Is? And
who 'tis is our <hi>Native Soveraign?</hi> When instead of being <hi>Free Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Pope</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> shall rule over us, and <hi>we</hi> are made <hi>Slaves</hi>
and <hi>Papists?</hi> P. 20.] And then below: [What's a <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               </hi>ence,
to a King of <hi>England?</hi> Alas! That Bugbear, <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
is a <hi>Notion</hi> crept into the World, and most <hi>Zealously,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as <hi>Ignorantly</hi> Defended <hi>[Kings</hi> were made for the <hi>People,</hi> and
not the <hi>People</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> P. 21.] <hi>And yet once again.</hi> [If now at
last Popery must, and shall come in; (as by Law it cannot) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must be restor'd by <hi>Arbitrary Power:</hi> If a <hi>new Monarchy,</hi>
then a <hi>new Conquest;</hi> and if a <hi>Conquest,</hi> Heaven forbid we should
be Subdu'd like less then <hi>Englishmen;</hi> or be Debarr'd the Common
Right of All Nations, which is, to <hi>Resist,</hi> and <hi>Repell</hi> any <hi>Invader,</hi>
if we can <hi>P. 21.] Now to run it short (he might e'en as well have
told us in plain Terms;</hi> Look to your Selves my Masters; Here's a
<hi>Popish Successor</hi> coming on that will send yeu all to the Devil. Ye have
the whole Nation on your side, Never trouble your heads about the <hi>King.
What's a</hi> KING? What is this <hi>LORDS ANOINTED?</hi> Is he not
<hi>Our Servant?</hi> May not we <hi>Resist</hi> him if he <hi>Invade</hi> us? <hi>Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
is a <hi>Bugbear and does not concern us here in</hi> England,
Wherefore let us Maintain our <hi>Rights,</hi> or fall like <hi>Englishmen. If
This be not a Sedition, Contriv'd Chalk'd out, and Justified.
I do not know what Is.</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95359:3"/>
Upon a Thorough Examination of this Piece, I find it to be
only a <hi>Pompous, Wordy</hi> Thing, and wholly made up of <hi>Shifts,</hi> and
<hi>Suppositions;</hi> without so much as <hi>one Argument.</hi> either <hi>Offer'd,</hi> or
<hi>Answer'd,</hi> upon the Stress of the Question: so that I shall; both
for the Readers ease, and my own, pass over the Ramble of his
Discourse, and keep my self as close as I can to the Subject in
hand.</p>
            <p>It is the main Scope of his Design, first, to shew the People a
<hi>Popish Successor,</hi> in Imagination, as <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Hideous</hi> as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
and <hi>Malice</hi> can <hi>Paint</hi> him. 2. to set forth the <hi>Absolute Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of Barring, and Precluding such a Successor, upon pain of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi>
and <hi>Damnation.</hi> And 3. Since the King will not be wrought
upon, against his Brother; To teach his Subjects a way of doing
it by themselves; by <hi>Absolving</hi> them in this Particular Case from
the Common Tyes of <hi>Christianity, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To These Three General Heads, I oppos'd Certain Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Considerations, which he takes very little notice of in
his Reflections upon my Papers, though the whole
sum of this Controversie does most undeniably depend upon
the Resolving of those Points. But of this hereafter. As to
the rest, I followed my Parallel, betwixt the <hi>Bare-fac'd Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi>
and the <hi>Disguis'd;</hi> betwixt the Proceedings of <hi>One and
Forty,</hi> and of <hi>Eighty One,</hi> as a necessary Precaution, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Pretence of <hi>Abolishing</hi> the <hi>NAME</hi> of Popery, we might
not <hi>Establish</hi> the <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the first Page of the</hi> Preface, <hi>it is observed upon</hi> L'Estranges
Character, <hi>that</hi> [the sole Drift of his Book was not in the least to
Expose Popery any further, then to make the Fanatical and Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles agree, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! and what can expose <hi>Popory</hi> further then to prove it
<hi>Fanaticism;</hi> and to Range the <hi>Papists</hi> with the <hi>Smiters of their
Fellow-servants,</hi> (Matth. 24. 49.) and according to that Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sentence, <hi>(Matth. 24. 51.)</hi> to appoint <hi>Iesuits</hi> their Portion
with the <hi>Hypocrites?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take his Opinion <hi>(says the Character)</hi> abstracted from that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and his whole Book has no other aim, but to make All our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Popery, and a Popish Successor; and all the whole Plot against
the King, Religion, and Government (to use his own Phrase, P. 69.)
but <hi>a Painted Lion upon a Wall;</hi> and the Opposers of those Dangers
<hi>a reall Bed of Vipers.</hi>

               <hi>He Proceeds in his Preface, to the Invalidating of my</hi> Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
<hi>betwixt</hi> Forty One <hi>and</hi> Eighty; <hi>and upon my saying, that the</hi>
very Sound of <hi>Popery</hi> did the business against the Last King, as well
<hi>without</hi> a <hi>Ground,</hi> as <hi>with</hi> it; [What's all this (says he) but to tell
us, because a <hi>Bugbear</hi> Frighted us <hi>once,</hi> therefore a <hi>Real Fiend</hi> must
not Fright us <hi>now?</hi> Because a <hi>Judas</hi> once <hi>Kiss'd</hi> and <hi>Betray'd,</hi> and
a <hi>Joab Embrac'd</hi> and <hi>stabb'd,</hi> therefore no man must ever <hi>Kiss</hi> and
<hi>Embrace</hi> without a <hi>Treacherous</hi> and <hi>Murtherous Intention?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what's all this; (say I) but to tell us, on the Other side,
that though the <hi>Bugbear</hi> of <hi>Forty One</hi> prov'd a <hi>Reall Friend</hi> to us,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95359:5"/>
we are yet to take the <hi>same Fiend again,</hi> in <hi>Eighty One</hi> for a <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear?</hi>
And so for <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Ioab,</hi> If the <hi>Same Iudas,</hi> kisses again,
and with the <hi>Same Words</hi> in his Mouth too, why may we not
suspect the <hi>Same Intentions?</hi> And likewise if the <hi>Same Ioab</hi>
Embraces again, and the Old Ponyard be found about him still,
(the <hi>Deposing Maxims</hi> of <hi>Forty One,</hi> which is the very Case)
Have we not Reason then to believe that he has <hi>Murder</hi> in his
<hi>Heart?</hi> And Hear him once again now.</p>
            <p>Because a Knot of <hi>Achitophels</hi> once <hi>Pretended</hi> Grievances where
<hi>none was,</hi> to accomplish their own Wicked Purposes, therefore no
Subject shall, or may Petition or Vote, though in a <hi>Legall, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

and that in the Plainest and most Imminent Exigence of a Nation,

            <p>My Answer must be still the same; that the very <hi>same Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phells,</hi>

Good People, that I meddle with neither <hi>Votes,</hi> nor <hi>Petitions,</hi>
but only with Seditious <hi>Libells</hi> that carry the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Petitions:</hi>
as who should say <hi>[Take notice,</hi> (my Countrymen) the King is

            <p>Th Grievance of the Nation <hi>(he says)</hi> is a Popish Successor; and

which have, or can be <hi>Alienated,</hi> or <hi>Estranged,</hi> by his Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and too Vigorous Defence of a Successor, so universally Odious.</p>
            <p>This Clause is to Possess the People, that the Excluding of a
<hi>Popish Successor</hi> would do the whole Business. It is a Great Blessing
to the Party that men of this Kidney are never to be put out of
Countenance; for the Authour would Blush else at a Suggestion
that every man that can read, is able to Contradict. Here's the
Subject of a <hi>Popish Successor</hi> Started, and the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
King,</hi> in <hi>Possession, Invaded,</hi> by every Pamphleter that
Presumes to handle this Question; for there are <hi>Popish Forts, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Castles, Popish Militia's, Popish Guards, Popish Courtiers, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Councellors, Popish Iudges, Popish Iuries, Popish Bishops,</hi> and in
fine, <hi>Popish Torys,</hi> and <hi>Tantivys,</hi> as well as <hi>Popish Successors.</hi> And
All these Popish Circumstances must be either Remov'd, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd,
to the good liking of the Faction; or else the Diverting of
the Succession (according to the Ordinary language of the Press)
is as good as nothing. And then to Crown the Contumely, That
Prince is Charg'd with Affecting an <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> whole almost
Fatal Concessions already have but barely left him Power enough
to keep the Crown on his Head. But what's the meaning now, of
Cramping, and Imposing upon the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, what's that to
<hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Plot?</hi> The Solution is this: The Faction, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
upon both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> finds it Expedient to Attaque
<hi>both together;</hi> to the end that the Project upon the score of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
may hold out till they have Gain'd their Ends upon the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next Intimation of the Kings having lost the Affections
of the People; for asserting the Rights of his Brother, (though
according to <hi>Honour, Iustice</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> as his Majesty himself
Declares) This Intimation (I say) is so far from the Report of
a <hi>Truth,</hi> (as appears by the almost Unanimous Addresses of the
Nation to the <hi>Contrary,</hi> that it is clearly an Artifice to Render his
Majesty low in the Opinion of his People.</p>
            <p>He Passes now to a Reflection upon Times and Times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to my thinking, the Reason lyes strong and Directly against
him. <hi>[The Miseries of the Late Civil Wars)</hi> (he says) <hi>are too live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Peoples Memorys, for them ever to be wrought up again into
the</hi> same Frenzy.] Now I fancy on the other hand, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ig
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95359:6"/>
off so Cheap, and with so much Profit and Advantage for
<hi>one</hi> Rebellion, is a great Encouragement for the same Persons to
venture upon <hi>another.</hi> I am the larger upon the Preface, because it
is somewhat better Colour'd then the Text.</p>
            <p>Though the Deluded Multitude <hi>(says he, Ibid.)</hi> were then put out
of love with <hi>Kings,</hi> they found too soon, by Wofull Experience, that the
<hi>Protectorate</hi> was ten times <hi>worse,</hi> and whatever Prejudice they had
conceived against the Old Vnhappy <hi>King,</hi> yet the Grievous Oppressions,
Taxes, and standing Armys, under <hi>Cromwell,</hi> quickly open'd their
Eyes, and to their own Sad Cost, Assur'd them, they had not mended,
but Marr'd their Condition by Rebelling. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would he had Explain'd himself whether it was TOO SOON
in the <hi>Peoples</hi> opinion, or in his <hi>own.</hi> And then he speaks again
as if the Rebellion had been <hi>only</hi> the setting up of the <hi>Protector;</hi>
for he takes no notice of any Grievous Oppressions, Taxes and
standing Armys till the <hi>Protectorate</hi> of <hi>Cromwell;</hi> And all the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi>
(betwixt Driving the King from <hi>London,</hi> and the setting up
of that <hi>Mock-Royolet)</hi> under the Blessed Administration of the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> was only a Certain kind of method peculiar
to the Godly for the asserting of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the
<hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> against the Fears of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and
<hi>Popery.</hi> I come now to the Conclusion of his Preface.</p>
            <p>I will confess <hi>(says he)</hi> This present Age has Derived one thing

and like him too, be left most Helpless when we most want it]</p>
            <p>The Authour may be pleas'd to take notice; that our Business
does not lie with the <hi>Wolf</hi> in the <hi>Fable,</hi> but with the <hi>Wolf</hi> in the
<hi>Gospel;</hi> the <hi>Wolf</hi> in <hi>Sheeps Cloathing:</hi> and that the very Wolves
that Worryed the Flock under the Last King, are now again
Grinding their Teeth at 'em under This. And so much for his
Preface; We shall now proceed to his Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon my Arguing, that if</hi> Christian Princes, <hi>under Articles of</hi>
Treaty, <hi>and</hi> Agreement, <hi>keep</hi> Touch <hi>even with</hi> Infidels, <hi>much more
will</hi> Christians <hi>keep Touch with one another.</hi> [What Relation

then to the force of his <hi>Reasoning</hi> I should, upon such an occasion

is the <hi>Same</hi> to another <hi>Prince</hi> and to a <hi>Subject;</hi> so that our

what, say I, if his Conscience shall tell him he will be damn'd if

            <p>I will allow that he that is <hi>Daring</hi> enough to <hi>Attempt</hi> any thing,

gets nothing upon this Point, unless he can make out <hi>Temerity,</hi>
and <hi>Breach of Faith</hi> to be <hi>Virtues.</hi> But the Great Danger I find
is in a <hi>Bigotted</hi> Papist, and either our <hi>Popish Successor</hi> is <hi>That,</hi> or
<hi>That Danger</hi> does not fall into this <hi>Case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had we an Heir Apparent <hi>(says the Character, Ibid)</hi> of no more
Religion then a <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>a Nero,</hi> and yet at the same time were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
Master of the Moral Virtues, possibly he might steer, <hi>&amp;c. Now
would I fain have the Author of the Character, and his Deputy
to lay their Heads together upon this Text. We might do well

Reply upon</hi> L'Estrange, [If his Royal Highness <hi>(says</hi> L'Estrange)

he would have Render'd himself a <hi>Protestant</hi> to the Eye of the <hi>World,</hi>
though a <hi>Papist</hi> in his <hi>heart;</hi> That being the only means to have

Character-maker <hi>Reflects upon such a Supposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder <hi>(says he)</hi> to what Readers these Authours write, that
at this time of day, they would make us believe that his Squeamishness
against the <hi>Test,</hi> and the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> made our Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Heir quit his Honourable Employmentn! As we better remember,
'Twas not so much the <hi>Test,</hi> as the <hi>Test-makers,</hi> that Disgusted him.
His natural Antipathy to Parliaments, his Continual Little thoughts
of that Great Councell, (and less of them he will have if ever he comes
to the Crown) with his Disdain, that such Insolent Earth and Ashes
should dare to give Laws to his Divinity. So that in short, his <hi>Pride,</hi>
not his <hi>Conscience</hi> got the <hi>Ascendent;</hi> and whatever Advantages
he might have gain'd by-keeping his Employments, and swallowing the
Oaths, yet such is his <hi>Perverse,</hi> and <hi>Stubborn Haughtiness, that he
would rather cry,</hi> Sink Interest; Perish Succession; and even <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
it self,</hi> rather then Truckle to what I Scorn.</p>
            <p>The Reader will take notice here, of the shifting of the <hi>Scene,</hi>
and that the Business is no longer the <hi>POPISH Successor,</hi> the <hi>BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOTTED
Successor:</hi> but the <hi>PERVERSE,</hi> the <hi>STVBBORN,</hi> the
<hi>HAVGHTY Successor:</hi> The Successor of <hi>no Religion at all.</hi> So
that he has Chang'd his Battery, from the <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi>
of the <hi>Successor,</hi> to the temperament of his <hi>Humour:</hi> and the same
Bolt strikes a <hi>Perverse KING</hi> to the Heart, as well as a <hi>Perverse
SVCCESSOR.</hi> Nay, the Character lays violent Hands upon it
self in this Paragraph, and cuts the very throat of its own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
What's become now of all his Expanded Rhetorick, and
his Embroder'd Allegories? One hasty word has laid this mighty
piece of Ostentation level with the ground: And the <hi>Character-man</hi>
has discharg'd the <hi>Successor,</hi> of the most dangerous point, out of
his own Mouth. Why here's no <hi>Popery</hi> in the Case, it seems.

and 'tis the <hi>Character-maker</hi> Probably too that has the

<hi>Character-maker</hi> may be somewhat akin too?</p>
            <p>Now for the Dukes <hi>Antipathy</hi> to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> I never heard this

charg'd upon him, but by those that had an <hi>Antipathy</hi> for <hi>Kings;</hi>
And all this is only Fleshing of a Faction upon the <hi>Duke,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for further Attempts upon his <hi>Majesty himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Gross and Palpable Contradiction of himself; <hi>First</hi>
in casting the whole weight of <hi>his Argument,</hi> and of <hi>our Danger</hi>
upon the <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Bigottery</hi> of the Duke. And then in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to be of <hi>no Religion at all;</hi> and so far from <hi>Bigotted</hi> to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he would Sacrifice even the <hi>Popedom it self</hi>
to his <hi>humour;</hi> (which shews that he writes his Gall, not his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
The Reader will not be surpriz'd, I suppose, at the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any Calumny, after so Malicious, and so Shameless an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.
This is to prepare the Reader for another peice of
Confidence and Invention in the Story of one <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hux,</hi> P. 3. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if it were possible, he has outdone himself.</p>
            <p>Take notice that this Relation was first expos'd to the World,
(at least I never heard of it before) in the <hi>Second Letter</hi> about the
<hi>Black Box,</hi> under the Title of <hi>[A Letter to a Person of Honour,</hi> &amp;c.]
The <hi>Character</hi> calls him <hi>Rohux;</hi> the <hi>Letter Monsieur Rohan:</hi> the
one being only an Improvement of the other, and the Original
came into the world with the <hi>Black Box,</hi> unless possibly the Hint
might be taken from the Story of <hi>Marsilly,</hi> the Person that Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the Triple Alliance, who having been in <hi>England</hi> went away
again about his Business; was taken afterwards by a Party of <hi>French</hi>
out of one of the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> carried to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
there broken upon the <hi>Wheel.</hi> This Account of <hi>Marsilly</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with that of <hi>Rohux</hi> in all the Circumstances of an <hi>Agency</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> his <hi>Seizure,</hi> and his <hi>Execution.</hi> Now though this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
carries in the very face of it the most Manifest Marks of
Falshood, in Respect, not only of the Incoherence and Incredibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Parts of it; but in regard also of the (almost) Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the Particulars coming to light, which are therein
Suggested; I shall yet, over and above, Recommend to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>user
of these Papers, the Disagreements betwixt the <hi>Character,</hi>
and the <hi>Letter,</hi> which will abundantly Evince the whole matter
to be only a Scandalous Contrivance.</p>
            <p>This same <hi>Rohux</hi> (says the <hi>Character,</hi> P. 3.) was Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
as an <hi>Agent</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to Implore his Majesties Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>French</hi> King in favour of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and
apply'd himself to his Royal Highness to Facilitate his Access.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Letter</hi> says, that <hi>Monsieur Rohan</hi> (as he is there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95359:8"/>
call'd, came into <hi>England</hi> to treat with the King concerning an Allyance
betwixt his Majesty, and Forreign Protestants, meerly for the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Religion, and that having acquainted the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
with his Errand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee'le first observe the Differences, as we go; and afterward,
set forth what mov'd the Author of the Character to change his
Tale. The <hi>One</hi> makes <hi>Rohan's</hi> business to be a General Proposal
of an <hi>Allyance;</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> only a Bare and Particular <hi>Intercession</hi>
for the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> only makes the Duke <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with the Proposal; the <hi>other</hi> Addresses Expressly to the Duke
for his <hi>Recommendation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now says the</hi> Character <hi>again.</hi> [This Royal Heir, or Masquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

Cordial Friendship Embraces the Poor <hi>Hugonots</hi> Cause; and day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>French</hi> Ambassador, and tells him how one of the <hi>French</hi> Subjects
had very Arrogantly and Scandalously Calumniated his Great Master,
with Opprobrious names of <hi>Tyranny, Oppression,</hi> and <hi>Breach</hi> of
<hi>Faith;</hi> into which very language he himself before had Exasperated
him, on <hi>Purpose</hi> to make his Ruine <hi>Secure,</hi> which the Bare accusation
of a suit in behalf of his Religion would not alone have Effected. The
Ambassador, (as bound in Duty, for the vindication of his Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
desires a further Testimony of the Offence and Offender: which
the Royal Informer effectually gives him, by appointing another Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Rohux;</hi> Where Privately he Plants this Kingly Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as an Honourable Eves-dropper to overhear a Repetition of the
whole Discourse, and Confirm his Belief from his own Ears. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
P. 4.) Contriv'd and Manag'd as heart would wish, the
Ambassador Posts over this <hi>Rohuxs</hi> Treachery to <hi>France,</hi> whilst he, Poor
unsuspecting Innocence, Continues his Dayly Prayers to his Great Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
But finding in time so many Dilatory Demurs, He luckily at last
Discovers he is Betrayed: Vpon which, Dreading the French King,
not daring to Return to <hi>France,</hi> He steals away into <hi>Switzerland</hi> for
his Protection; but the <hi>French</hi> King being advertiz'd of his Motions,

gets him Trep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

forced out from thence into <hi>France</hi> he is broken upon the Wheel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now hear the</hi> Letter. <hi>Mounsieur Rohan</hi> hauing acquainted the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> with his Errand, after he had in a Private Conference
or two transacted with the King about it, this Royal Prince, out of his
wanted kindness to <hi>Protestants,</hi> and the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> caused
<hi>Ruvigni</hi> (Lieger Ambassador from <hi>France</hi> at this Court) to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Hangings at <hi>St. James,</hi> while he made this Innocent Gentleman
discourse over the whole busness. Vpon which, Mr. <hi>Ruvigny</hi> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to acquaint his Master with it, <hi>M. Rohan,</hi> who, (upon some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that the Duke had betray'd him) had withdrawn hence to
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> was there seized by a Party of <hi>French-</hi>Horse, and
brought to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> whence, after some time of Imprisonment, he was
carried to the Place of Execution and broken on the Wheel.</p>
            <p>Here's nothing in this <hi>Letter,</hi> of the <hi>Seeming Friendship</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in the <hi>Character;</hi> the Promises of <hi>Assistance;</hi> the Plot of
<hi>Revenge,</hi> the Trepanning of <hi>Rohux</hi> into Outrages against his
Master, nor of the Dukes Lewd Contemplations upon the whole
matter, which 'tis Impossible for him to give an account of too,
and fitter, in short, for a <hi>Stage</hi> then a <hi>History.</hi> So that all these
Aggravations are only the Old Story Corrected and Amended,
with <hi>Additions,</hi> for the Credit of his <hi>Character.</hi> And what's his
Authority now for this Diabolical Report, but that Infamous
Composition of Forgery and Scandal, the Letter about the <hi>Black
Box?</hi> Wherein, after all these Vile Imputations upon his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highness, the Duke comes off yet better in't then the King.</p>
            <p>After his Utmost Effort upon this Romantick Master-piece of
Defamation, he lets himself down for a while into a vein of Quirk
and Cavill, and then takes wing again (<hi>P.</hi> 8.) into another fit
of Rapture and Imagination.</p>
            <p>Were there a Country <hi>(says he)</hi> where Commissions of Peace, day
after day, and Time out of mind, have been taken away for daring but to
lift a hand against a Son of <hi>Rome;</hi> Nay, at the same time; when all
other Recusants have been Prosecuted, and that with Encouragement,
and Reward: And all by a Royall Heirs Pretection and Interest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This way of Trifling might do well enough in a Chimney Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with a <hi>Once upon a time there was a Country,</hi> &amp;c. but Majesty is
not to be play'd with at this Idle Rate. The Plain <hi>English</hi> of it is
this; [Look to your selves Good People; the King is Popishly
affected; he will not let any man touch a Papist, but the poor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95359:9"/>
Protestant Dissenters all this while; they go to pot; &amp;c,] and
then he thinks to bring it off by casting it upon the Interest or
Power of the Duke with his Majesty. The very affirming of it
is a Scandal; for how does he know whether it be so or no? Or
what if it were so? Is it not the <hi>Kings Act, whoever</hi> advises him
to't? Or can any man say that the King does an ill thing (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
influenc'd) without reflecting upon his Majesties Honour and
Justice? Beside the Evident untruth of the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> the
Laws being vigorously Executed against the <hi>Papists;</hi> and the
<hi>Recusants,</hi> on the other side Indulg'd, till they so far abus'd the
Kings mercy by dayly affronts, that it was not safe to forbear
them any longer.</p>
            <p>His Ninth Page is stuff'd with Reflections upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and first, upon the <hi>Bench</hi> for the Sentence upon <hi>Harris</hi> for
Publishing the <hi>Appeal;</hi> a Libel that excites Rebellion, and supports
it self in the Encouragement of it, upon this <hi>Position,</hi> that <hi>He that
has the worst Title makes the best King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again in the same Page <hi>[had the Papists Execrable Blow
succeeded, the Bloud of Majesty might in all Probability have found
the same Inquisition as the firing of</hi> London. What is this but to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
an Imputation upon the House of Commons, that had the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of the whole matter before them; and likewise upon
his Majesty himself, his Ministers, and Courts of Justice; as if
they had not done their parts toward the Discovery of it in their
Respective Stations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet once again (Ibid)</hi> Has not our Late Design against both
King, Religion, and Government, in Contradiction of the Vnanimous
Vote of the whole Nation in Parliament, being Confidently Retorted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> And that too without the least Proof or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
for't? And then how easily might the Papal Policy have made <hi>a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Murther,</hi> a <hi>Fanatick Stab?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They do ill Certainly that turn the <hi>Popish</hi> Plot upon the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians;</hi>
and little better sure, that turn the Plots of the <hi>Scottish
Presbyterians,</hi> and their <hi>Fellow-Covenanters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> upon the
<hi>Papists:</hi> And for the <hi>Popish Policy</hi> of making a <hi>Popish murder</hi> a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
Stab;</hi> that's only a shift they learn'd of the <hi>True Protestant
Papists,</hi> that turn'd a <hi>Fanatick murder</hi> into a <hi>Popish Stab.</hi> I proceed
now to Page 11.</p>
            <p>Now in my apprehension <hi>(says the Authour)</hi> never did any man so
forget himself as Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has done here: He believes here, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95359:9"/>
that Vnchristian Impression, as the Allowance of Perjury, is only the
Tenet of some profligate wretches wholly lost in Brutality and Blindness.
<hi>But at the latter end of his Book, (P. 83.) he downright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
that Belief, and says, Pope</hi> Pius Quintus <hi>absolv'd the
Subjects of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>from all their Oaths of Allegiance to
her for ever.</hi> So that now belike it was not only the Maxim of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid
profligate wretches, but even of the Great Successor of
<hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in my Apprehension, the Author is every jot as much out
of the way as <hi>L'Estrange;</hi> for the <hi>Same Person</hi> may be a <hi>Pope,</hi>
and a <hi>Profligate wretch</hi> into the bargain; even by the Concession
of <hi>Baronius</hi> himself, and the best of their own Writers.</p>
            <p>In the twelfth Page I am Corrected again; <hi>Mr.</hi> L'Estrange
(he says) <hi>forgets himself, a little further in this Point; and says in
the</hi> same 83. Page, [That the <hi>Romish Iesuit</hi> holds, that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is founded in Grace,</hi> and upon that Principle, Deposes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Princes, <hi>&amp;c. then adds,</hi> that the Pope may deprive a King
of his Royal Dignityes for Heresie, Schism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by the Authors leave Those Two Words <hi>THEN ADDS,</hi>
refer to another Paragraph. My business being only to shew Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Instances wherein the very worst Positions of the <hi>Romish Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
are Match'd, if not <hi>Out-done,</hi> by the <hi>Covenanting Iesuits;</hi> and
as much the <hi>Tenets</hi> of <hi>Profligate Wretches</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> side as on the
<hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He takes me to task again <hi>(P. 13.) for</hi> saying <q>[That in the Case
of a <hi>Popish</hi> King, who is either kept out, or Driven from the
Exercise of his Right by the tumultuary License of the Rabble,
an Oath of Abjuration, in Case of any fair opportunity for him
to Assert his Claim with his Sword in his hand, will be so far
from Engaging any man against him, that yeilded contrary to
his Conscience, to Swallow it, for the saving of his Stake, that
he will find no Firmer Friends to his Cause, or Interest, then
those men that are stimulated both by Honour and Revenge to
the Execution of their Dutyes.]</q> And upon this Clause, <hi>(he says)</hi>
'tis plain, that by those <hi>Abjuring-Oath-Swallowing Friends,</hi> I can
mean no other but the <hi>Church of England Protestants. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
(P. 14.) once again for</hi> laying so wretched, so Despicable
and so cowardly a Condescention at their Dores, as the Abjuration of
Gods anointed, and their Native Sovereign, to save a Stake, a Cow,
a Farm or a Cottage. Aye, But that Abjuration is but a Copy of their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95359:10"/>
Countenance he tells ye. Fye Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> this is worse and worse!
What? the Members of the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Communion of Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
break a Gospel Precept, as to come to a <hi>So help me God,</hi> with
a Lye in their Mouths, and <hi>a</hi> Reserve in their hearts; to play the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
and that too, even with Oathes; and to do so Impious an <hi>Ill</hi>
that <hi>Good</hi> may come of it?</p>
            <p>What a Stir is here about nothing? My Reasoning lyes thus:
If it comes to a Push, the Enemies of the Successor will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
have recourse to their old Practise of Imposing an Oath of
<hi>Abjuration,</hi> for the securing of themselves in their Usurped Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions:
And <hi>if any</hi> (say I) <hi>shall be so weak, or so wicked, as to take
it,</hi> It will only serve for a Spur to their Revenge, so soon as they
shall meet with a fair opportunity to Break it, without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon them at all to the contrary. So that I do not say,
either that it is <hi>Lawfull</hi> to take such an Oath, or that any <hi>Church
of England-men</hi> will <hi>Submit</hi> to do it; but that whoever shall be so
far Prevail'd upon, will find himself both bound in <hi>Conscience</hi> to
break it, and Prick'd in point of <hi>Honour</hi> to Avenge himself upon
the Imposers of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would here desire the Reader to wash his Eyes; for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is about to shew him</hi> [one of the most notorious falshoods averr'd
that ever look'd Light i'th face.] <hi>(P. 15.) And</hi> this <hi>is it.</hi> L'Estrange
<hi>says in the Case of</hi> Harry the Great, <hi>[The People of</hi> France, <hi>though</hi>
Roman Catholicks, <hi>would not submit to the Dispossessing of a</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Successor.] <hi>Now says the Character;</hi> [The Roman Catholick
People of <hi>France</hi> were so far from admitting this Protestant Successor to
the Throne, that 'tis Recorded, they shut their very Gates against him;
and so little acknowledged him their King, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the States
of <hi>France</hi> were for setting up no less then Three Competitors against
him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very true; the <hi>Iesuited,</hi> and the <hi>Rebellious Papists</hi> of the
<hi>League</hi> did shut their Gates upon <hi>him,</hi> as our <hi>Iesuited Covenanters</hi>
shut the Gates of <hi>Hull,</hi> and other places here in <hi>England</hi> against
<hi>our Sovereign.</hi> But still there was a Party of <hi>Honourable,</hi> and <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Roman Catholicks</hi> that joyn'd with the <hi>Protestants</hi> in his Defence,
and Support; And if the Authour of the Character had not been
very much to seek aswell in the <hi>Civility</hi> as in the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
he would never have call'd that a <hi>Point-Blank Falshood,</hi> which
has the Best Authority of <hi>France</hi> to Vouch it for an <hi>Vnquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Truth.</hi> And then so many of his Roman Catholick-Subjects
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95359:10"/>
adhering to him, notwithstanding the Popes Declaring against
him, makes it a clearer Case that his Holynesses Deposing of an
Heretical Prince does not Absolve all Papists from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to him. In one word; It was upon that Revolution, with
the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as it was not long since with the <hi>Protestants</hi>
in <hi>England.</hi> Those that were <hi>Factious,</hi> and <hi>Seditious,</hi> took up
Arms <hi>against</hi> their Prince; and those that were <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Loyal,
Assisted</hi> him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on with a Flourish upon the Instance of</hi> Sigismund <hi>King
of</hi> Sweden, [In whom <hi>(says he)</hi> Neither Magnanimity, Iustice,
All the Cardinal vertues that adorn'd him, nor all the Promising Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Accomplishments of Nature, strengthen'd with all the Bonds
of Protestations, Oaths, or Sacraments, could hold the Head-strong
Violence of his Religion.] <hi>P. 16.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is first an Argument drawn from a <hi>Particnlar</hi> to an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality;</hi>
as if, because this Prince brake his Faith; no Popish
Prince ever did, or will keep it. Would either the Authour of
this Character now, or his Deputy take it well to be paid in his
own Coin, or by his own Measure? Here's an Opposer, in truth,
of his <hi>Royal Highn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the fairer blow at his <hi>Person</hi> has Discharg'd the Point of <hi>Religion.</hi>
This Opposer (I say) of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> has let fall many Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
words (as is already prov'd) in his two Characters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>Majesties Person, Authority,</hi> and the very Frame of the

of his <hi>Royal Highness</hi> are Enemies to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>

            <p>Toward the bottom of the <hi>Seventeenth Page,</hi> the Character
makes an Invidious Descant upon the hopes the <hi>Papists</hi> had of a
<hi>Toleration;</hi> but not one Syllable of the Persons that started
those hopes, nor upon what Interest, and Consideration the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was set affoot. Now he knows very little of our Affairs, who
does not understand that none were so forward and so Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
for the Gaining of the Dukes Assistance toward such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
as those very People that are now so Clamorous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Royal Highness <hi>for</hi> it. Not that any such Disposition
was wrought by his Interest, but they Labour'd it however, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Plausible Pretext; that Provided the <hi>Dissenters</hi> might
be eas'd on the <hi>one</hi> side, they would do their best also and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves that the <hi>Papists</hi> might be eas'd on the <hi>other.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Nineteenth Page,</hi> smells of the <hi>Romance: Second Ajax, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisses,
Palladium; Troynovant; Tullia,</hi> &amp;c. as if the Author were
speaking to us by his Deputy: And then toward the bottom of
the Page, Enter the True Author again; who (P. 21.) guides his
Deputy's hand while he writes these words. <hi>[The Author of the
Character is a Person so far from laying his hand on his heart, and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Benefit to Royal Pardons, or Acts or Oblivion, that I must say
this Truth for him, Ianuary 48. was past before he was born.]</hi> I would
he had taken in the other two Figures (16.) to have told us what
<hi>Century</hi> he speaks of. There was a Gentleman of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the late times, that would needs make himself the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Killing no Murther;</hi> and had like to have been hang'd for

            <p>The Remainder of his Discourse is almost wholly Forrein to
the matter in Question, Insisting Principally upon two Points;
the <hi>Danger,</hi> and the <hi>Inconvenience</hi> of a <hi>Popish Successor;</hi> wherein
I have declar'd my self in my first Character (P. 3.) that <hi>[I
take All his Suppositions of Difficultyes and Hazzards in the Case for

but yet admitting them so to be, that very Concession will not
do his Business. The second Point is, Whether <hi>the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

               </gap>
Question I have thus deliver'd my self in my <hi>Case Put</hi> (P. 9.)
<q>[Some are of opinion <hi>For</hi> it; others <hi>Against</hi> it; but the <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or <hi>Illegality</hi> of such an <hi>Act,</hi> is a Point that I am not willing to
meddle with either one way or other. For whether the Thing
may <hi>Lawfully</hi> be done or <hi>not;</hi> there may be <hi>Danger</hi> yet and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience</hi>
in the Putting of the Question.]</q> And so likewise in
my <hi>first Character</hi> (P. 53.) <q>[As to that way which is matter of
Parliamentary Cognizance I reckon it my Duty to Acquiesce in
the Legal Issue of their Debates; as an Authority to which I
have ever paid a Duty and Veneration.]</q> So that it would be
utterly superfluous to spend Time, and Words, upon an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein I can for Quietness and for brevity sake allow him
his asking, and preserve the main of the Cause still untouch'd.
But for such Passages as fall in by the by; and properly within the
Compass of my Design, I shall take such notice of them as I find
Pertinent to my Purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> 24th. <hi>Page, he makes his Gloss upon that Clause in the
Oath of Allegeance where we swear to be</hi> faithfull to the Kings
Lawfull Heirs and Sucessors. [There's nothing in that Oath <hi>(says he)</hi>
that binds them to the <hi>Person</hi> but to the <hi>Thing;</hi> to no Particular man,
any further then he is <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Successor; Lawfully</hi> so; and no man
truly is either <hi>Heir</hi> or <hi>Successor,</hi> till he Inherits, and Succeeds.</p>
            <p>Now if this Clause binds us not to the <hi>Person,</hi> but to the <hi>Thing;</hi>
We swear Fidelity Previously to the <hi>Right,</hi> which takes place
before the <hi>Succession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Lowest Line of this Page, he Lodges the Absolute Power
of the Law in the <hi>Three Estates in Parliament.</hi> And P. 25. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
this Position, under the notion of <hi>the Higher Powers of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
King Lords and Commons;</hi> which is a Flat denial of the <hi>Kings
Sovereign Power.</hi> And since he is pleas'd to set up a new form of
Government, He should do well to furnish us with a New Oath
of Supremacy too: That instead of Declaring the <hi>Kings Highness</hi>
to be the <hi>only Supreme Governour</hi> of this Realm; We may Swear
Faith and True Allegeance to <hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> and to
<hi>their Highnesses</hi> Lawfull Heirs and Successors. This <hi>Coordinate</hi>
Imagination was the Main Pillar of the <hi>Late Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See what Work he makes now upon these following words in
my <hi>(First Character.</hi> P. 60.) <q>With Reverence to the Utility and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95359:12"/>
Constitution of good and wholsome Laws, it is not presently to
Cite a Statute, or say <hi>there's a Frecedent,</hi> for those Laws, that
are Repugnant to the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> and <hi>Common Right,</hi> are
Nullities in themselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>(says he.)</hi> Here's one of the boldest Master-strokes of the Pen
that ever came in Print. This Point once gain'd, All the <hi>Protestant</hi>
Laws since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the whole Fabrick of the Present
Government, are Totally Subverted. 'Tis but a Popish Successor belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and maintaining that all the Protestant Laws ever since <hi>Harry the
Eight's</hi> Perversion, are against the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Nullityes in themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Logique, I perceive, is all of a piece: If <hi>one</hi> Popish Prince
be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or a <hi>Faith-breaker, All MVST</hi> be so. If <hi>one</hi> Statute
<hi>BE</hi> found against <hi>Common Right,</hi> therefore <hi>All MAY BE</hi> so. And
then, what fear, (I say) of a Popish Successors Damning All
Protestant Laws, when 'tis a Known Rule that the Judges are the
only interpreters of the Law? But These <hi>Possible Nullityes</hi> will
find better Quarter perhaps from <hi>Walker,</hi> then from <hi>L' Estrange;</hi>
and therefore I shall refer Mr. <hi>Deputy</hi> to the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Pag.</hi> 116. 117. Printed at <hi>London</hi> 1648. <q>The Authority of
the <hi>Iudges</hi> is <hi>Iudicative;</hi> whose Office is (upon Cases brought
before them) to determine <hi>whether an Act be Binding or no:</hi> (For
Acts of Parliament <hi>against Common Right, Repugnant,</hi> or <hi>Impossible,</hi>
are <hi>Voyd:</hi> Coke 8. fol. 118. Dr. and Student. L. 1. C. 6.) and to
expound the Meaning, and Signification of the Words of such
Act.]</q> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was a man of Law, and Abilityes; and far
from a stickler, either for <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or <hi>Popery:</hi> Nay, even a
Borderer upon <hi>Coordination</hi> it self. But yet he brings himself off,
with a <hi>Distinction,</hi> from the poynt which our Authour swallows
<hi>Whole.</hi> It is most certain (says the Other, <hi>Pag. 116.) that when
the Three Estates in Parliament have pass'd any Act, Their Power
Determins, as to that Act; and then, the Authority of the Iudges Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</hi>
And whereas the Character <hi>(Pag. 25.)</hi> calls King, Lords,
and Commons, the Higher Powers of <hi>England,</hi> without any more
adoe; Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> qualifyes it, (Pag. 117.) <hi>[Though this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
(says he) <hi>has always been Ruled by King, Lords, and Commons;
yet by the</hi> King Architectonicè, <hi>and the</hi> other Two Organicè; <hi>the</hi>
King <hi>as the</hi> Architect, <hi>the</hi> Lords <hi>and</hi> Commons <hi>as his</hi> Instruments;
<hi>Each in his proper Sphere of Activity, without interfering: And till
This again come in use, look for no Peace.]</hi> This was the Principle
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95359:12"/>
of 41. and 42. brought off as well as the matter would bear.</p>
            <p>From hence he proceeds upon the agitation of the Question of
<hi>Disinheriting;</hi> which (as I have said before) is nothing at all to
my business; nor of any moment in the least to the deciding of
this Controversy, till all other Rubs and Difficulties that lye in
the way to't shall be first clear'd: and especially that undenyable
Impediment of the Kings Refusal; which must be allow'd on all
hands (whether the thing may be Lawfully done, or not) to be
an Obstacle not to be Disputed, or Oppos'd.</p>
            <p>The Character-maker, (Pag. 26.) finding himself pinch'd,
upon the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> according to the Practice
and Precept of the Primitive Times, and the very Text of Holy
Writ it self; brings himself at last to this Notable Resolution of
parting with his Religion rather then his Argument.</p>
            <p>The Correspondence <hi>(says he,</hi> P. 26.) between Ours and the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians</hi> Case is here so incoherently ballanced, <hi>[by L' Estrange,]</hi>
that never were Arguments more Fantastical. The <hi>Primitive
Christians</hi> preacht Obedience to <hi>Nero; Yes,</hi> and they had forfeited
their Christianity, if they had done otherwise. But what was that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro?</hi>
An <hi>Absolute Monarch:</hi> And what those <hi>Primitive Bishops?</hi>
Not such as <hi>Ours;</hi> they were not a part of the <hi>Legislative</hi> Power of
the Nation, as <hi>Our Prelates</hi> are. If <hi>Nero</hi> invented Racks, Tortures,
and Gibbets, for Persecuting or murthering the poor Christians; he did
it by his own uncontrolable Authority; nor were those <hi>Primitive Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
call'd to make <hi>Laws,</hi> and therefore had not the Lawfull power of
the least Vote in moderating of <hi>Nero's Cruelty,</hi> or in redresse of the
<hi>Christians Torments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author begins now, to speak <hi>English.</hi> First, he slips in
the difference of the Case betwixt an <hi>Absolute,</hi> and a <hi>Limited
Monarch.</hi> 'Tis true; the <hi>One</hi> Acts according to his <hi>Pleasure;</hi> the
<hi>Other</hi> is so far bounded by <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> that it is a Violation
of <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> in Ordinary Cases, to pass those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
But what is all this to the <hi>Subjects Obedience?</hi> For 'tis as
much <hi>Rebellion,</hi> in <hi>Them,</hi> to take up <hi>Arms,</hi> contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a <hi>Limited Monarch</hi> that plays the <hi>Tyrant;</hi> as against an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Prince</hi> that Governs by his Own <hi>Will:</hi> For the <hi>Duty</hi> of the
<hi>Subject</hi> is the same to the <hi>One,</hi> as to the <hi>Other;</hi> unless there be
some clear and explicite Provision, or Stipulation in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Contrary. And his Other Shift, upon the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt <hi>Their Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ours,</hi> looks as if Mr. <hi>Deputy</hi> had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95359:13"/>
written that out of his own <hi>Mother-wit,</hi> without consulting his
<hi>Oracle:</hi> For how should that Diversity of the Case operate upon
the poynt of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> to make it <hi>more</hi> or <hi>lesse</hi> a <hi>Duty?</hi> He
has but one way in the world, that I can see, to support his
Argument; and that must be by destroying his Cause: For if
there be no more then this in't that the Primitive Bishops had
no Votes in Parliament, which our Prelates have, his Meaning
is, that when they come once to Vote in Parliament, they <hi>Act</hi>
no longer in the condition of <hi>Subjects;</hi> which is a further Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of himself upon a <hi>Coordinate State:</hi> Only I think he had
as good have kept himself under the <hi>Blind</hi> of a <hi>Legislative Power,</hi>
without <hi>Translating</hi> it into <hi>the Power of MAKING LAWS;</hi> For
though the Two Houses may be properly sayd to <hi>Make,</hi> or to
<hi>Prepare Bills;</hi> yet the making of <hi>Laws</hi> is the Sole Priviledge of
the Supreme Magistrate. If by what he says of the Power (or
Right rather) of moderating Votes, he intends only Offices of
Mediation, or Councell; so far, 'tis well enough: but if he stays
there, 'twill never do his business; for there must be Resolution
also, and Action, as well as debate, and Advice; and that's the
thing he does more then intimate he would be at, in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of this Paragraph.</p>
            <p>We are not <hi>(says he pag. 30)</hi> to wait Gods further Pleasure, and
Providences to come, with so entire a Resignation, till we neglect a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Preservation, when approaching Ruine Threatens us.</p>
            <p>The Question (with the Author's favour) is not the <hi>neglecting</hi>
of <hi>Lawfull means,</hi> but whether the <hi>Expedient</hi> here under Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be <hi>Lawful,</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> And the Writer of the Character is so
candid, as in the next Clause to come within a very little of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with <hi>L' Estrange,</hi> in the <hi>Negative. [However</hi> (says he)
<hi>that the Authors Opinion may not appear so strangely Enormous, nor
his Passion so wholly destructive to Government, and so opposite to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
as his Answer would render it, let us make a little Explanation
of the Character,</hi> &amp;c.] But he does yet, in the same Page, declare
himself, that <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> may be layd aside, under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of a <hi>Popish Succession;</hi> That is to say, It is <hi>Lawfull</hi> for <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Subjects</hi> to Resist a <hi>Popish Prince,</hi> in the <hi>Actuall Possession</hi> of
his <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> For so he expounds himself (P.
27.) upon the word <hi>Successor. No man</hi> (says he) <hi>truly is either
Heir, or Successor, till he Inherits, and Succeeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then he palliates the matter over again (pag. 31.)</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95359:13"/>
               <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> (says he) is due to our <hi>Native Prince</hi> we have
none due to a <hi>Forreign Invader;</hi> and 'tis a plain case, that the <hi>Popes
Supremacy</hi> entring into <hi>England</hi> is an <hi>Invading,</hi> and <hi>Usurping</hi>
Regality.</p>
            <p>How the Opinion of a Prince shall discharge Subjects of their
Obedience to Laws, I cannot imagine; Or by what Right one
sort of People under the same Government shall pretend to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
another in such a Case. Or I would fain know, whether
upon the same Ground they may not alter the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
as well as destroy the <hi>Lawfull Successor.</hi> Or, in one word,
is not the Government already overthrown, and all the Laws,
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> dissolv'd in this very <hi>Position?</hi> Those Laws that have
made us the Envy of the Christian world, and the Glory and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
of the Reformation. And again; if the People may be
Judges in <hi>This Case,</hi> they may, upon the same pretense, be Judges
in any <hi>Other;</hi> and as well exterminate a Prince for any <hi>other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as for his <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Tis but for Mr. <hi>Deputy</hi> to tell the People,
that the <hi>King himself</hi> is not <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>Govern;</hi> and what has his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to expect, but to march after his Brother? Grant but this
Point, that the <hi>Multitude</hi> (who are, in effect, <hi>Hands</hi> without
<hi>Heads)</hi> shall over-rule the <hi>Laws;</hi> where are we then, but in a state
of Horrour and Confusion, and Effectually in the Possession of
One Hell upon Earth as the Earnest of Another; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Religion at all, and every ones Knife at the throat of his
Brother? But am I a Subject to the Kings <hi>Religion</hi> or his <hi>Title?</hi> Or
where shall I find the <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Bounds</hi> of my <hi>Civil Duty?</hi> In the
<hi>Law?</hi> Or, in the <hi>Character?</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> makes my <hi>Allegeance, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute;</hi>
the <hi>Character</hi> makes it <hi>Conditional:</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> binds me to
be True to his Majesty, his Lawfull Heirs and Successors, without
any regard to <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That Religion;</hi> the <hi>Character</hi> discharges me
in case any of them should happen to be <hi>Papists.—[Magno Iudice
se quisque tuetur.] King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> are of <hi>One</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Mr. <hi>Deputy,</hi> of <hi>Another.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> obliges me, upon
pain of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Estate;</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> upon pain of <hi>Damnation:</hi>
But then comes the Author of the <hi>Character,</hi> with the <hi>Serpents Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi>
in his Mouth, and supersedes all. <hi>Hath God sayd ye shall
not eat of every Tree of the Garden? And the Woman said unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden; but of the
Tree which is in the midst of the Garden, God hath said,</hi> ye shall not
eat of it, <hi>neither shall ye</hi> Touch <hi>it, least ye</hi> Dy. <hi>And the Serpent sayd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95359:14"/>
unto the Woman,</hi> ye shall not surely Dy; <hi>for God doth know that in
the day ye eat thereof, Then</hi> Your Eyes shall be opened, <hi>and</hi> ye shall
be as Gods, <hi>knowing Good and Evill.</hi> Gen. 3.] There's no great
Disproportion either in the <hi>Appetite,</hi> or <hi>Temptation.</hi> There's the
Voice of <hi>God</hi> in both cases, on the <hi>One</hi> hand, and the Voice of the
<hi>Serpent</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[I cannot find (he says) by this Text, <hi>By Me Kings reign,</hi> &amp;c.
But that <hi>By Me Subjects possess their Lawfull Inheritance,</hi> might
Claim the same Right. P. 32.]</p>
            <p>The Question is not, the Kings Dispossessing Subjects of their
Lawfull Inheritance, but the Subjects Disspossessing a Prince of his
Lawfull Birthright; And by his Argument, <hi>Popish Subjects</hi> may be
<hi>Dispossess'd</hi> as well as a <hi>Popish Successor,</hi> and <hi>Phanatical</hi> Subjects too
as well as <hi>Popish;</hi> If a point of Occasional or Preventional Prudence
shall over-rule a Positive Law: And according to his Descant,
<hi>By me Kings are DEPOSED</hi> (that a House of Commons may
Reign) is as good Divinity as <hi>By me King REIGN,</hi> though the
One is a matter of Divine Institution, for the Comfort of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in General, and the other only a Divine permission for the
Punishment of some Particular Princes or People. And see now
how Extravagant an Instance he has brought in for his support.</p>
            <p>Nor can I perceive <hi>(says he Ibid.)</hi> that there lyes so much Stresse in
Gods giving the Government of the Earth, Man, and Beast, unto whom
it seemed meet unto him, as to <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> in the Text, but that a
MENE, MENE, TEKEL, VPHARZIN, written by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
own hand against his Impious Heir, the <hi>Sacrilegious, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Belshazzar</hi> was as much the word of God, and had as much <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution</hi> in it as <hi>By me Kings reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Application here, is not only Rude, and Impertinent, to
the Highest Degree; but the Argument flyes directly in the face
of him; unless he can shew such another <hi>Hand-writing upon the
Wall,</hi> against his <hi>R. Highness,</hi> as is here produc'd against <hi>Balshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar:</hi>
Beside that the Intervening of an Almighty Power in the
Case, does as good as tell us that the Disinheriting of Princes is a
priviledge Reserved, by God, Peculiarly to Himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds (P 33.)</hi> to Invalidate <hi>(as he pretends)</hi> the Chief
Argument of all my Discourse, and the Fundamental Design of my whole
Pamphlet, <hi>viz.</hi> The Un-alterable Right of Succession.] <hi>And advances,
Confounding</hi> Extraordinary, <hi>with</hi> Common <hi>Cases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now so far am I from laying the Stress of my Discourse upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95359:14"/>
that Text, that I have Industriously Declin'd the Question, as
the last Article to be handled in this Controversy. And then he
spoils the Cause with the very eagerness of defending it, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conclusions from God's Unaccountable Actings, upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Revelation, or Direction, to the Practices of men that
are under certain Common, and Indispensable Rules and Methods
of Obedience and Government <hi>[So Timely a Care</hi> (says he p. 34.)
<hi>did the Great Founder of Empires, the Divine Omnipotence take, to
shew that the Dispensations of Majesty, for his Peoples good, and his
own Glory, were to be preferr'd before the Soveraignty of Birth, that
Blinder Gift of Chance.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This does only prove that God Reserves to himself a Freedom
of Dispensing with his own Laws, but not the least shaddow of
any such Power Delegated to the People, to Dispense with Gods
Laws; and let any man Consider, whether is the more Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Provision for <hi>the Glory of God, and the Good of his People,</hi> that
men should be Ty'd up, though (with some Inconvenience) under
God's Appointment, to the Orders of Government, where the
Publick Peace is preserv'd, and the Harmony of Humane Society
maintain'd, or to leave the Multitude the Judges of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which only belong to the Supreme Magistrate, and at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to change Governments and Governours as often as they
please, which must Inevitably run into Consequences of Bloud
and Confusion. And if this be not the thing he would be at,
what's the meaning of his recommending the Precedent of the
Late King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to the <hi>English,</hi> as a <hi>Practicable Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have we not had <hi>(says he, Ibid.)</hi> a Late King of <hi>Portugal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pofed,
as <hi>Delirious,</hi> and <hi>Frantick,</hi> and Consequently renderd by Law
Vncapable of Reigning; and All this done by <hi>HIS OWN SUBJECTS,</hi>
and those of <hi>HIS OWN</hi> Religion, without the least Reflection of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Rebellion, or the Aspersion of lifting a hand against the Lords
<hi>Anointed.] As who should say,</hi> what a stir is here made about the
Duke of <hi>York?</hi> As if it were such a matter to Exclude a Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.
I'le shew ye a way to get quit of the <hi>King himself</hi> though a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi>
and in the <hi>Legal Exercise</hi> of his <hi>Authority. But then
you'l say there must be</hi> Delirium, <hi>or</hi> Frenzy <hi>in the case? Just so much
as was found in the Late King will be enough to do the Business.
Do but possess the</hi> People <hi>once that the</hi> King <hi>is a</hi> Papist, <hi>and that
single Charge of</hi> Popery <hi>Includes all</hi> Inabilityes. <hi>For (says our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
Ibid.) There must go so strong a dose of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madness,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95359:15"/>
both together to make up the Composition of a <hi>Popish</hi> Heir to the
<hi>Protestant Crown</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> Especially an heir that can be so Fond
of the <hi>Gew-Gaws, Bawbles</hi> and <hi>Trumpery</hi> of <hi>Romish</hi> Superstition,
as to Hazzard Three Crowns for them—So that if in Truth he but
fairly stood the Test of an <hi>Old Statute</hi> we have already, the <hi>Begging</hi>
of his <hi>Reversion</hi> would be so Fesible, that it would be Cross we won,
and Pile he lost <hi>(P. 35.] Here's a short way of Putting the</hi> King <hi>as
well as the</hi> Duke <hi>out of Capacity to Govern. First; say that he
is a</hi> Papist, <hi>and then,</hi> Beg <hi>the</hi> Possession <hi>of the Crown, as well as
the</hi> Reversion, for so being.</p>
            <p>We are come now to the End of the <hi>Character Complete,</hi> which
is so far from being a <hi>Defence of the first Part against</hi> L' Estrange's
<hi>Papist in Masquerade;</hi> that first he has not spoken One Syllable to
the Point in Question. <hi>2ly</hi> In the very Title of <hi>Complete,</hi> he does
as good as Confess that he has no more to say. And <hi>3ly.</hi> he has
in the <hi>18th.</hi> page of his <hi>Second Part</hi> Blown up the very Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his <hi>Former;</hi> and Effectually of his whole Pretense, and
Design.</p>
            <p>The Scope of his Discourse is briefly this; First, to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Duke as Odious and Dangerous to the Nation, as Art
and Malice can make him, by Virulent Reflections upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
under the Dreadfull Character of a <hi>Popish Successor. 2ly,</hi> To
shew from the Precedents of former Times, that it is no new
thing for the Supreme Power to Divert the Succession. Now as
to the Danger of a Popish Successor; so far was I from Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, that for Quiets sake I gave it for Granted <hi>(Papist in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade</hi>
P. 3.) So that he must not call his <hi>Character Complete, A
Defence against</hi> L Estrange, of what <hi>L' Estrange</hi> did not <hi>oppose.</hi>
And for the Point of the <hi>Succession;</hi> I have not said one Word
whether it may lawfully be done or not; but on the Contrary,
Industriously Declin'd it; (as I have shew'd already P. 18.) So
that his Mighty Defence is only a Beating of the Air, and a Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
upon two <hi>Topiques</hi> out of the Limits of the Controversy: The
First Point being out of doors upon the admittance of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and the Second Postpon'd out of this regard, that it is a king
of a Preposterous Question to enquire whether it may be done or
not, if the King would agree to it, before we know whether the
King will agree to it or no: And this way of Pressing it, will bear
yet a worse Construction, his Majesty having already, and over and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95359:15"/>
over Declar'd that he cannot in Honour, Justice and Conscience
Consent to it.</p>
            <p>As to the Title of the Character Complete, it Expounds it
self, in the Concession, that he has said all that he has to say.
Nor shall I need to Enlarge upon that Stabbing Contradiction of
himself, which I have already noted. (P. 10.) Only in one word
I shall recommend it the second time to a Remark. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he Grounds all the Dangers, Terrors and Fatalityes of a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
Successor upon the Dukes <hi>Bigottery</hi> in the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion,
he Discharges us (P. 13.) of all those Apprehensions, by a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Averrment that the <hi>Duke</hi> is so far from being a <hi>Bigot,</hi> that it
is his <hi>Pride,</hi> and not his <hi>Conscience</hi> makes him a <hi>Papist;</hi> and <hi>that he
would rather see the Popedome Perish, then lose his Humour.</hi> Wherein
first, he dissolves his Argument. <hi>2ly,</hi> He betrays himself manifestly
to Espouse the Interest of a Faction against his Judgment. And <hi>3ly.</hi>
He Authorizes (in so doing) the Disinheriting of a Prince as
well for his <hi>Complexion</hi> as his <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is not all neither. For after the frighting of the <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
and <hi>Impious,</hi> with the Fears of <hi>Slavery;</hi> and the <hi>Weak,</hi> and
<hi>Scrupulous,</hi> with the Dread of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> (in case of a
<hi>Popish Successor)</hi> Representing the Calamity to be wholly Insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable;
and making it a Point of Conscience, upon what terms
soever, to Prevent it; he chalks out to the People such a way for
the doing of it as shall much more certainly destroy the <hi>King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
and the <hi>Monarchy</hi> then the <hi>Successor.</hi> He sets forth the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of doing the thing: His Admiration that the King
should Refuse it: How he has lost the Hearts of his People by it;
and all the way bespattering his R. Highness, though two thirds
of the dirt fall upon his <hi>Majesty.</hi> Resolving all at last into Two
or Three Modest Propositions, upon the Foolery of <hi>Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
the <hi>Fundamental Sovereignty</hi> of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> &amp;c. Upon
which Positions, If the Duke be thrown out to day, the King is
almost sure to follow him to Morrow. His Reply upon my Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to these Positions is in Effect rather a Yielding of the Cause,
then a Defence of it: But such a Yielding, as Discovers only an
Impotency (though with Great Good will) of Defending it. This
is the Substance of his Discourse, and how far it will be found a
Defence of his <hi>Former Character</hi> against the <hi>Papist in Masquerade</hi>
will best appear, upon Comparing the <hi>Reasons,</hi> and the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
on <hi>both Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95359:16"/>
               <hi>It is the main Drift of his Pamphlet to Terrify People into a
Dread of his R. Highness, and into Undutifull thoughts toward
his Majesty by the Dismal Story's he tells of the Danger of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Successor. Now say I on the other side (P. 3.)</hi> It would have
been Fair Play in the Character-writer if he had Ballanc'd the Dangers;
and told us, This is the Danger One way, and that Another. For <hi>First;</hi>
there are many Dreadfull Dangers, which we cannot avoid, <hi>but by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring</hi>
Greater: As the Leaping of a Garret Window when the Fire
has taken the Stair-Case; which is only a Prudent Election (under a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
Necessity) of the less Evil of the Two. Now the same Action
which would have been a <hi>Madness, without</hi> that Necessity, becomes
an Act of <hi>Prudence with</hi> it, The Great Danger of the <hi>Leap</hi> being War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Greater danger of the <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It happens many times, that we have no other choice
before us, but either to suffer the Highest Degree of Misery that
can befall us in this world, or else to Prostitute our <hi>Souls,</hi> for the
saving of our skins and Fortunes. Now under such an Exigence
as this, let the Prospect of things be never so terrible, we are
to oppose the Duty of <hi>Christians,</hi> of <hi>Subjects</hi> and of <hi>Honest men</hi> to
all Hazzards whatsoever, and patiently to <hi>Endure</hi> whatever
we cannot with <hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> either <hi>Resist</hi> or <hi>Decline:</hi>
According to the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Martyrs</hi> who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
their <hi>Profession</hi> with their <hi>Blood,</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi> without <hi>Resistance.</hi> So that we are not to
Govern our selves by a naked Speculation of the Perils that we
are to Encounter; and the means of Avoiding them; without
enquiring into the Consistency of those means with the measures
of <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again</hi> (P. 51.) [We shall now Counterpose Dangers to
Dangers. Here is a <hi>Present</hi> Opposed to a <hi>Future;</hi> A <hi>Greater</hi> to
a <hi>Less,</hi> and a <hi>Protestant King</hi> to a <hi>Papist.</hi> The <hi>Present</hi> Danger is
the Probable Effect of these Intoxicating Methods to the People.
If Fancy was Poyson to the Multitude under the <hi>Late King;</hi> the
same Fancy in a Larger Dose, and with less Corrective to it, will
be at leaft as strong a Poyson to the People under this. So that
we are in Forty times a Greater Danger of a Sedition at Hand
then of a Popish Successor at a Distance. Now what is there
in the Future to weigh against the Life of the King, the
Safety of the Church, the Law, Government, and the Peace of
the Kingdom? There may Possibly be a Popish King; and there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95359:16"/>
may Probably not. <hi>And then</hi> (P. 3.) I must Distinguish betwixt
the Unhappy Circumstance of being under the Allegeance of a
Prince of that Persuasion, who is Actually in <hi>Possession,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
of his Power; and the Remote <hi>Possibility</hi> only of that
Danger; And a <hi>Possibility</hi> too of such a Condition, that a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
things may Intervene to Prevent it: As the Contingences
of <hi>Issue, Survivorship,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to the Ballance of a Greater Danger and a Less (P. 52.)
We'le e'en take the matter as they suppose. A King upon the
Throne that's Principled for Arbitrary Government and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but so Clogg'd and shackled with Popular and Protestant
Laws that if he had never so great a mind to't there is not a
Subject in his Dominions, that would dare to serve him in his
Design. But on the other hand; there's no King at all, No
Church, No Law, No Government, No <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> no Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right, no Property, no Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again</hi> (P 52.) Here's a <hi>Protestant</hi> Prince Expos'd for
fear of a <hi>Popish</hi> one. Is the Chimera of a Future Danger of more
value to us then the <hi>Conscience</hi> of an Incumbent, and Indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Duty? Shall we take pet at God Almighty's Providence
and not go to Heaven at all, unless we may go our own way?
Shall we Levell a Shot at the <hi>Duke</hi> at a distance, if there be no
coming at him but through the Heart of our <hi>Sovereign?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover</hi> (P. 53.) The Diverting or Disappointing of the
Succession must be either by <hi>Prevention,</hi> or by <hi>Exclusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be danger from a Popish Successor, during his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectancy
<hi>within</hi> the Kingdom; the Danger is Infinitely Greater
if he be Driven <hi>out</hi> of it. For <hi>First,</hi> (supposing it the Peoples
Act, (which the Character does manifestly allow of rather then
fail) there must be an <hi>Illegal,</hi> and <hi>Popular Violence</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
it; and there's the Peace of the Government broken alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Beside that the Authors of that Violence can never be secure,
but by following it with <hi>More,</hi> and <hi>Greater.</hi> And this comes
presently to be a natural Transition from a <hi>Murmur</hi> against a
<hi>Successor</hi> to a <hi>Tumult</hi> in the <hi>State:</hi> In which case, the King has
only this Choice before him; either to part with every thing
for the asking, or to stand the shock of a Rebellion. Now take
it either way, Here's much a Greater Mischief <hi>Incurr'd</hi> then
that we <hi>fear'd:</hi> Beside a <hi>Standing Army, Taxes</hi> and <hi>Oathes,</hi> that
follow in Course; and a new set of <hi>Liberty-Keepers,</hi> and <hi>Major-Generalls</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95359:17"/>
to secure the Peace.</p>
               <p>This is the Scene of things at <hi>home;</hi> and if we look <hi>abroad,</hi>
we shall undoubtedly see the Successors Interest and Reputation
encreasing dayly, in regard of his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> his <hi>Title,</hi> and his
<hi>Religion</hi> (P. 54.)</p>
               <p>Now in Case of a <hi>Popish King,</hi> who is either <hi>kept out,</hi> or <hi>Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ont,</hi> from the Exercise of his Right by the Tumultuary Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the Rabble: whether that King makes any Attempt
or no, the Nation must be at the Charge, at least of a <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
War,</hi> and of <hi>Impositions</hi> to maintain it. And this will be the
Inconvenience, even in the Bare Prospect of the State of the
Nation, without striking a Blow; But from <hi>Scotland</hi> at least, if
not from <hi>Ireland</hi> too, they must Expect to be Ply'd with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Alarms, till the Insupportable Expense of Guarding the
<hi>Borders</hi> and <hi>Coasts,</hi> shall make them as Sick of their <hi>New Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots</hi>
as ever they were of their <hi>Old ones;</hi> and force them at last
to render themselves, and their Spoyl, to the Irresistible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of as many Powers, as will be then Confederate to their
Destruction.</p>
               <p>And then comes in the <hi>Popery in Earnest,</hi> that was dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but in <hi>Fancy</hi> before. When this new King shall, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Act and forfeiture of a seduc'd and unforeseeing people, be
delivered from the Fetters of both <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> Who
brings in Popery then, but they that Discharg'd him from those
Sacred Bonds, by the folly and Contumacy of their own Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
Undertakings? Compare now the Danger of a Popish
King bounded by Protestant Laws, and Ruling over a Protestant
People, where he may be as happy as an Imperial Crown, and
the Affections of his Subjects can make him. Compare I say,
a Popish King under these Gracious and Obliging Circumstances,
in the Quiet Adminstration of his Government, with a Prince
that is forc'd to make his way with his Sword for the Recovery
of his Own; and is not only Prick'd on by the Impulses of
<hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> but Animated by the <hi>Pope himself,</hi> and
Provoked by <hi>Indignation,</hi> to take the Utmost Advantage of that
Foolish Forfeiture: the People themselves having Cancell'd the
Bonds of Authority and Obedience. Let any man Compare
these two Cases, and then speak his Opinion. (P. 55.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet once again.</hi> If it be reasonable to Believe (as we are
often told, and no Mortal can deny it) that our Religion is an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95359:17"/>
Eye-sore to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that this Island would
make a Considerable Addition to our Victorious Neighbours
late Conquests, what way in the world could be propounded,
more to the Advantage, both of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the bringing of matters to the Issue here
in question? When in the Powerfull, and Liberall Assistances to
this supposed King, for the Regaining of his Own, the One and
the Other are but doing of their own business: This Prince, in
the mean while, being led to the One by <hi>Inclination,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
upon the Other by <hi>Necessity (Ibid.</hi>)</p>
            </q>
            <p>I shall leave it now to the Reader to Judge how far the <hi>Second
Character</hi> in Reply upon <hi>the Papist in Masquerade,</hi> may be admitted
as a Defence of the <hi>Former.</hi> It is the Authors design, in both Parts,
by Amplifying, and Rhetoricating upon the Dangers of a <hi>Popish
Successor,</hi> to transport the People into the most Desperate Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Acting &amp; Suffering all Extremities rather then submit
to that Inconvenience. Now (as is already said) the <hi>Danger</hi> of
a <hi>Popish Successor</hi> is a point that I have given for Granted before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;
and no part of the matter here in Controversy. Nor is
the <hi>Danger</hi> it self (simply consider'd) of any Concluding Force,
in this Case; for First, a <hi>Less</hi> Danger comparatively must give
way to a <hi>Greater. 2ly.</hi> Let the Danger be never so <hi>Great,</hi> if we
cannot avoid it with <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> we must resolve to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide</hi>
it. <hi>3ly.</hi> Here is a <hi>Certain,</hi> and a <hi>Greater</hi> Danger Incurr'd for
the Avoidance of an <hi>Vncertain</hi> and a <hi>Less. 4ly,</hi> Here is a Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
wrought in the <hi>Present</hi> Government of a <hi>Protestant</hi> King for
fear of a <hi>Popish</hi> King to <hi>come. 5ly.</hi> his Majesty having Positively, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times Declar'd, that he cannot in <hi>Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> agree
to the Disinheriting of his Brother, and that therefore <hi>He will
never do it;</hi> the Exclusion of his R. H. which is here aim'd at, can
never be compass'd but by a Rebellion. <hi>6ly.</hi> In making a mockery
of that which he calls the <hi>Bugbear</hi> of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> the very
Position that seems to be Levell'd at the <hi>Duke,</hi> Destroys the <hi>King.
7ly.</hi> Upon a Fair Collation of the <hi>Publique Danger</hi> both ways;
that of <hi>Expulsion,</hi> or <hi>Exclusion</hi> (over and above the <hi>Iniquity)</hi> is
Evidently much Greater then the <hi>Admittance</hi> of him; and the
Ready way to <hi>bring in that Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> which they
Pretend to <hi>fear.</hi> Beside that it is Manifestly the Project of the
Book, and of the Abettors of it, to Reduce This King to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95359:18"/>
straits of his Late Majesty, and leave him at Last his Fathers Game
to Play. Upon the due Ballancing of these Cases, the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
depends; and that which he calls a <hi>Defence</hi> has not one
word of <hi>Argument</hi> upon any of the Passages above Recited; the
whole Discourse being rather a <hi>Flourish,</hi> then a <hi>Debate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say nothing of the Dangerous Consequences that may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
and probably arrive upon the Agitation of this Question,
by exposing the Life of the <hi>Present Prince,</hi> to a thousand Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes,
and Hazzards, in the Contemplation of either <hi>Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>Establishing</hi> the <hi>Successor;</hi> Whereas in the Regular Course
of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> there's no place for those Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Deliberations. And to me it seems to Imply less Veneration
for the Sacred Life of a Prince, then we ought to have; if we can
with so much Indifference, think of the <hi>Death</hi> of our <hi>Present Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi>
and yet at the same time enter into <hi>Fribbling</hi> and <hi>Captious

Now there is none of these Hazzards or Difficultyes, upon the
Succession of a Prince that comes to the Crown by a Right of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,</hi>
where the Government is quietly Devolv'd upon him by
the Gentle Methods of <hi>Providence,</hi> without the Irregular, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary
favour of the <hi>People;</hi> and without any <hi>Eccentrick</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Passions, to the Peril or Detriment of the Publique. Nay
the very <hi>Enquiry</hi> was look't upon by Antiquity, as a thing so Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
&amp; Undutiful, that the <hi>fifth Council</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> Punish'd the very
<hi>Question, [who should Succed to the Crown after the Death of the
King?]</hi> with <hi>Excommunication;</hi> and <hi>that Decree</hi> was Confirmed
also by the <hi>next following Council.</hi> Not but that a man may love the
King and the Government, and yet out of a misguided Zeal Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Succession. But there is also a <hi>Designing,</hi> a <hi>Spitefull,</hi> and
<hi>Seditious</hi> Mixture even in that Composition; as appears by the
Writings and Practices that are Employ'd in favour of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
First, as to the <hi>Designing</hi> Part, the Cause is not manag'd
according to the Peaceable Methods of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> but
in such a manner, as to Irritate and Enflame the Multitude by
Arguments rather of <hi>Terrour,</hi> then of <hi>Reason.</hi> 2ly, the <hi>spite,</hi> and
<hi>Malice</hi> of the Humour shews it self manifestly in this; That
they are little better then Stark mad upon the striking of them in
that Vein, and forget what they Owe to the <hi>Heir of the Crown;</hi> the
<hi>Character</hi> of an <hi>Illustrious Prince;</hi> to the <hi>Brother</hi> of their <hi>Sovereign,</hi>
to the <hi>Bravery,</hi> the <hi>Virtues,</hi> and the <hi>Services</hi> of his <hi>Person;</hi> to the
<hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Safety,</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of their <hi>Country;</hi> to the <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> of a <hi>Protestant Prince;</hi> to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of
their <hi>Profession;</hi> and to the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Subjects.</hi> They cast off all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to Modesty and Good Manners, in their Ribaldry, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings;
and lay themselves so <hi>open</hi> in these Intemperate Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
that they might with a better Grace Expose themselves
<hi>naked</hi> in the <hi>Market-place.</hi> He that shall compare this way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sending,
or Propagating <hi>Religion,</hi> with the Rules and Precepts of
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> will easily satisfy himself of what Spirit they are. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Seditious Intent of the Libells that have been Publish'd
upon this Subject, is as Clear as the Light; for at the same time,
while they are hammering into the Peoples Heads a dread of the
<hi>Succession,</hi> they are likewise. Practicing upon the Honour of the
<hi>King,</hi> and Undermining the <hi>Monarchy.</hi> For what's the Reason of
our Scriblers Insisting so obstinately upon this Particular; but
First; as a Point which the People will most probably take fire at.

And <hi>2ly,</hi> as a thing which they are sure before-hand his Majesty
neither <hi>can,</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> ever Consent to? And from hence, they
take their Rise to a Deliberation how the Business may be done
<hi>without</hi> him: till by foft, and Insensible Degrees, they Screw the
Government off the Hinges.</p>
            <p>The First Clamour is against the <hi>Successor,</hi> for fear of <hi>Popery;</hi>
and against the <hi>King himself</hi> upon the <hi>Rebound,</hi> for not going their
way to work to <hi>Prevent</hi> it. Their next Complaint is either for
want of, or for Fruitless <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and nothing can be more
Scandalous, or Dangerous, to his Majesty, then these two Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes.
So soon as they have wrought upon the People to <hi>Think ill</hi>
of the King, their next work is to Dispose them toward the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of him ill: And this is done by <hi>Provocation,</hi> and <hi>Perswasion:</hi>
for it is a Fair step toward the making of a man believe it <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
to do a thing, if he can but be brought to have a <hi>Mind</hi> to do it.
By <hi>Remonstrances,</hi> and <hi>Appeals,</hi> they Compass the <hi>Former;</hi> and
then by <hi>Positions,</hi> and <hi>False Principles</hi> Insinuate the <hi>Other.</hi> It is First
the Kings <hi>Duty,</hi> they say, to Call <hi>Annuall Parliaments. 2ly.</hi> To let
those Parliaments <hi>sit</hi> till they have Redress'd all <hi>Grievances. 3ly.</hi>
They Inferr from hence, that the <hi>Common Hall</hi> is to Prescribe
both the <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Business</hi> for these Parliaments. <hi>4ly.</hi> That
the <hi>King</hi> is made for the <hi>People,</hi> and not the <hi>People</hi> for the <hi>King;</hi>
and therefore what <hi>he will</hi> not, <hi>they may,</hi> and <hi>must. 2ly,</hi> that <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Obedience is a Bugbear;</hi> And <hi>Defensive Arms Lawfull</hi> in the
Case of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Religion. 6ly,</hi> It is but <hi>Cares</hi> or <hi>Ianeways</hi>
declaring, that the <hi>Clapping</hi> up of the <hi>Protestant Ioyner</hi> is a <hi>Levying
of War, upon the Commoners of</hi> England, and the Business is done.
To Conclude, What is the Upshot of all this Libelling Contest,
but to set up a <hi>Popular Faction,</hi> under Colour of Opposing a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Successor,</hi> and at the Instance of a Pragmaticall Club of <hi>Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeres,</hi>
to put Three Kingdoms again in a Flame, for the Rosting
of their <hi>Eggs?</hi>
