         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Know 'twill be expected, and 'tis, I confeſs, no more than what is Reaſonable, that I ſhould here give thee ſome Brief Account of the Cauſes inducing me to make theſe enſuing Lines Publick. If either I, or another man have received any Perſonal Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Relation to our ſelves or our Profeſſions, what has the World to do with that? Thoſe, and thoſe only, are to be made Acquainted therewith, whoſe Particular Concernment it is to
<pb facs="tcp:107560:3"/>
Arbitrate, and do Acts of Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man. To raiſe a Hue and Cry for the Loſs of every Triffle, and ſet the Beacons a burning upon the Approach of every Petty and Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Veſſel? would make but a ſtrange kind of Diſturbance in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Commonwealth: And no leſs degree of Madneſs may it appear to be, for Men of Private Condition to write Letters of Sad Complaints to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Matters appertaining to their own Particular Affairs, and then to put them in Print when they have done, with an Epiſtle before an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and Solemn Appeals to the whole Body of the People to paſs their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict upon the Caſe, who are moſt like to be in the Right, and who in the Wrong.</p>
            <p>And then to make a Deſcription at large how ſuch an one was taken Ill,
<pb facs="tcp:107560:3"/>
and what ſeveral Sorts of <hi>Medicaments</hi> were thought upon by one Phyſitian, which were all again diſallowed of by another; and ſo by that means, to ſwell up a Publick Narrative with little elſe beſide an Account of their own Fewds and Janglings, and Paltry Diſcontents may ſeem to be an Enterprize of juſt as weighty a Concernment as the other was before, and undertaken to every whit as Wiſe and Uſeful a Purpoſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they do fall out or fall in, as the People are wholly unintereſſed in the Quarrel, ſo are they likely to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much the better nor the worſe which Party ſoever gets the Victory. Is it not uſual for moſt men whoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velyhood comes in after the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Wrangle and Squabble, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another as Deſpicable as they can, to the end that thoſe who appear to be the Braveſt Champions in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter may be able to bear away the
<pb facs="tcp:107560:4"/>
Greateſt Share of the Employment to their own Side? And is it not enough for the Spectators to be ſet a Laughing at them for their Foolery when they do ſo? But that Proclamation muſt be made for all others that would be apt to paſs by without taking the leaſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what had happened, to be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come in and deride them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe two, as they lie the faireſt in the Way, ſo are they the moſt Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of all other Objections beſide, that I can think of; and could we but get clear of them, I ſee no great Reaſon to the contrary, but that the whole of what has been Propounded, did it not fail in ſome Points relating to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Performance, might be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as Paſſable enough; but that is a Thing not at all to be either Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Juſtified by us here in this Place;
<pb facs="tcp:107560:4"/>
but rather to be left to the more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Determination of ſuch, as ſhall be willing to be at the Trouble through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine it.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the former of theſe, I have only this to plead on my own behalf, That notwithſtanding the Inſtances put may indeed ſeem to have a Reſpect, but to one or two particular Perſons at the moſt. Yet the Reaſon of the thing is of a much larger Extent as comprehending under it no leſs than a whole Community of Men; there being ſcarce a Countrey Phyſitian now living in <hi>England,</hi> but who either has been already, or elſe at ſome time or other in probability may come to be involved therein; and therefore what has been affirmed of one or two, may in a Senſe proper enough be applied to them all in General: And then the Benefit ariſing from the <hi>Memorandum's</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107560:5"/>
given, can never be excepted againſt as reſtrained unto a few.</p>
            <p>And albeit it be ſcarcely to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined for any actually Reſident in the Country to be ſo invincibly Stupid, as not to be convinced before-hand, of the Truth of what they ſhall find aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either through their own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or the Complaints of thoſe they at ſome times or other may happen to have had Communication withal. Yet ought it not however to be eſteemed of as loſt Labour, to be confirmed in the Belief of what they knew to be ſo, by the concurrent Teſtimony of others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves. The doing ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Office may ſerve as an Additional Corollary to their Heap, and be uſeful to them, if for no other purpoſe, yet at leaſtwiſe to excite their Care and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken their Diligence for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Inconveniencies for time to
<pb facs="tcp:107560:5"/>
come, as without it might poſſibly have been ſo much the more apt to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them.</p>
            <p>But as for ſuch young Gentlemen, who are in a manner unacquainted with the World, and who living ſtill in the Univerſities, have both their way of Employment and Place of Reſidency as yet wholly to chooſe: Such an Allarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s this may prove to be of much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Conſequence to them; for they by making a due Improvement of ſo Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable an Advertiſement, may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the better how to diſpoſe of their own Affairs, and not be enſnared in a Nooſe all on the ſudden, they never ſo much as dreamt of, as thouſands others have been before them, to the utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing both of themſelves and Families, as might be eaſie to ſhew how and which way; but that all is ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered in the Sequel of this
<pb facs="tcp:107560:6"/>
Tract. I ſhall therefore make the more haſte to the other Objection as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
            <p>And here again, though the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples produced may be but one or two for Number, yet are they virtually as many as the Inhabitants diſperſed up &amp; down the whole Nation; who might all of them have been ſerved with the very ſame Sauce, had they but fallen under the ſame circumſtances the others did, and but ſent for the ſame or ſuch-like Wiſe and Faithful Counſellors to have afforded them their Aſſiſtance, or may yet in good time, when ever the like Difficult Occaſion happens to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf: And then neither can the Uſefulneſs of what has been Obſerved be manely a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le to Exception upon the latter Score. Becauſe all ſuch as in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Times ſhall chance to fall ill of any Dangerous Diſtempers have an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107560:6"/>

I know ſome will be apt to ſmile at this laſt, as ſuppoſing it to be a meer Folly to go about to oblige thoſe by Obſecrations and Intreaties, that could never be prevailed upon by any Senſe of Honour and Conſcience, and the Engagements they have ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: But then they are ſuch as have neither Conſcience nor Honeſty, to which an Obligation (if to any thing) ought to be faſtned; that we have been all this while ſpeaking about, and ſo they are ſoon anſwered.</p>

And though, 'tis true, a good Man may do well for the Sake of Virtue alone, and though he ſhould have no Superviſor at all to overſee him in his Actions: 'Tis neither impoſſible nor unlikely but that the Bad may receive the Sureſt Check of all to put a ſtop to the fulleſt Career of their evil Practices from ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Conſiderations; ſuch as is the Fear of Shame, and Cenſure, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Report: And if they have any feeling left them what the meaning of theſe things is, 'tis ſcarcely imaginable but that they ſhould have the Faculty

ſeeing ſuch a Caſe is like to be ſo much the more narrowly ſifted into, and ſet forth with all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; whereas many things of a like Nature thronging in a Croud together, cannot be attended to with an equal Regard, but muſt, and will of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prove an hinderance to one another.</p>
            <p>Whence it often happens, that what might very well have deſerved a more ſerious and thorough Diſquiſition, comes to be huddled over with too much Brevity; which in all Caſes is no other than the immediate Parent of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and the Grandmother of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Miſtakes, and by that means a Neceſſity is occaſioned of making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame things ſeveral times over; as we find it in divers Authors, which had they been handled more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly at the firſt, and debated upon with that deliberation which the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might have required, might have ſerved but once for all; and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Tautologies which we meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſo often afterwards, have very well been ſpared.</p>
            <p>And then in the Second and Third Places, for the Reaſon is one and the ſame to both; becauſe ſome few of a Kind or Profeſſion have been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as Blameworthy; therefore, to imagin that either any others, or all the reſt of thoſe Orders, who neither are, nor ever were intended to be ſuch, ſhould find themſelvs agrieved thereat, is juſt ſuch another wild and fantaſtical Surmiſe, As to ſuppoſe that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Perſons belonging to any Community whatever, ſhould be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wiſe, or Learned, or Good; if that could but be made out for an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis to build upon, then indeed the taxing of any one of the whole Rank, might well be interpreted an inſuring of them all: As they ſay it fares with the Strings of ſome Muſical Inſtruments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

an equal height; touch one, and you would ſtir them all: But ſo long as the contrary is known to be moſt undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true, it can be no Diſparagement to the beſt Societies in the World to have it ſpoken, becauſe ſo eaſily to be proved that there have been, are, and ever will be ſome Faulty perſons amongſt them. Nay, 'tis ſo far from being any Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution at all to the Worth of thoſe that are in no wiſe guilty, that it commends it but the more, and ſets it off with ſo much the purer a Luſtre: Becauſe had there been no Vice, there would have been no Virtue; and were it not for the Badneſs of ſome Men and Women in the Wotld, there could never poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been any Good. Nay the very World it ſelf, ſetting aſide Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Prodigies, and other ſuch-like Deformities of Nature, could never in any ſound Sence have been ſaid to have been made perfect; becauſe this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon above, gives Beauty and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:107560:11"/>
to moſt of the things that are found in it, which would have neither the one nor the other if conſidered in themſelves. VVe account ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be Diſcreet, and Juſt, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, but they are the Fools, and Knaves, and Debauches that make them ſuch. And thoſe very Ladies which are wont to Attract the Eyes, and engage the Affections of almoſt every one they come a neer, little think how much they ſtand indebted to the Blemiſhes of ſome of their own Sex for the place they hold in the good Opinion of their Admirers. And therefore I can ſee no reaſon why any VVomen, whoſe Diſpleaſure is worth the ſerving, ſhould pretend to take any thing amiſs that can be ſaid of them as deſerve to hear ill. Not only becauſe there can be no great hurt in Slandering any one with a matter of Truth, but upon the very account of their own Intereſt: For if they are ſuch as moſt VVomen would be thought to

be, and I, for my part, am willing to believe they are, unleſs the Faults and Miſdemeanours of thoſe who are their Foils, had by ſome means or other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to have been rendred conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Thoſe very Qualifications, upon the Score of which they are wont ſo highly to value themſelves, had never in the leaſt meaſure come to have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of.</p>
            <p>And this might very well have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for the anſwering each of the two Particulars at once, might it have been but applied in the ſame proportion it bears to both of them alike. But in regard ſo much has been ſpoken in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the excuſing a word or two, and that when let fall but by the by only; becauſe a little ſlenting upon that Sex, which is ſo much given to take Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Whereas the very Scope and Drift of the whole Deſign has been for no other end (as the Title Page tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſeems to intimate) then

the expoſing the Unworthy Dealing of ſome Phyſicians to publick Scorn and Contempt. I cannot but hold my ſelf obliged in the beſt ſort I can, to beſpeak the formable Opinion of thoſe Learned and Worthy Perſons, who though wearing the ſame Titles, and inhabiting the ſame Place with them, do yet (I believe) as much abhor and deteſt their <hi>Leiger du Main</hi> Tricks, as either I my ſelf or any other man; and I do hope, and reſt pretty well aſſured, That as there has not been any one Syllable of ought ſpoken by me intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Prejudice: So that neither it will be ſo underſtood by them. I do from my Heart believe the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Phyſicians now living in <hi>London,</hi> to be the moſt Able, Learned, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way well qualified Perſons of any that are to be found again of the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion throughout all <hi>Europe</hi> beſide, as they have ever had the Honour, and that moſt deſervedly, to be accounted
<pb facs="tcp:107560:12"/>
of. The more then the pity, that theſe their good Parts ſhould be abuſed to ſo ill purpoſes, by ſome rotten and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members amongſt them; and ſo much the more need (one would think) there ſhould be to ſet ſome Marks of diſtinction to difference the one from the other. And if I out of a Fit of Zeal for the publick Good, rather than any great depth of Judgment, have been ſo little mindful of my own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as to ſet a helping hand to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting that which I conceived to be ſo honeſt an Undertaking; I hope no good Man will ſee any juſt reaſon wherefore to be offended with me for it. I may perchance deſerve ſomething of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for intermedling in a Brangling Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which might have been much better for me, to have paſſed over in Silence, but ſurely nothing at all of his Diſpleaſure. Particular Premiſes can never include any ſufficient <hi>medium,</hi> for the warranting any Univerſal Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

No more can the vicious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of ſome few of a Profeſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix any juſt matter of Ignominy upon the Reputation of thoſe that are good; But enough of this has been already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to under the former Head, which if it ſhall not be adjudged Satisfactory, I have only one ſhort Requeſt to make to them to whom it is not, and that is, That they would be pleaſed but to make the Caſe their own: as to ſpeak the Truth of it, 'Tis impoſſible for any one rightly to apprehend the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of another man, unleſs he do ſo.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch but imagine themſelves to have been at a great deal of Coſt, and Pains, and Expence of Time more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than the other two; to have fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and qualified themſelves for an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and when they had uſed their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Diligence in order to the attaining that End, and had at laſt pitched upon a place of Abode every way commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb facs="tcp:107560:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to their liking: How would they whiſtle it to have a Malepert man of their own Rank (and ſome years their Junior in that College, whoſe very Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes obliges each Member belonging to it, to a civil reſpectfulneſs one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another) without other provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Cauſe of diſtaſt given him, other than what proceeded from the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Depravedneſs of his own can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kred Nature;) ſally forth amongſt their Patients, and there beſtir himſelf the beſt he could to poſſeſs their minds with wrong Notions of their Diſtempers and prejudices againſt all rightful ways of Cure taken by them, and all this out of a wanton Humour to bring them into a Diſrepute with their Neighbours, and to convert the good opinion they might otherwiſe have been apt to have had of them into a meer Loathing and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me yet put the Queſtion a little further home, and ask them, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:107560:14"/>
or no, if they had right on their ſide, and were able to make it appear ſo to the World, they would forbear to uſe the only means that was left them, for the juſtifiing themſelves and Actions, for fear of giving offence to ſuch as had no juſt reaſon to take any; and ſo out of I know not what ſcrupulouſneſs of fancy ſuffer their own Credits, and the lives of their Patients, ſo oft as the ſame Project came to be renewed, to lye at the mercy of thoſe who never had, nor were never like to have any regard at all to either. If they ſay they ſhould not, as 'tis moſt probable they will, then neither am I by their own confeſſions to be blamed for what I have done; but if they ſhould, though the groundleſs ſcrupuloſity of ſome be no warrantable Rule for others to take example by; I care not much however, for this one time, if I do ſubmit my ſelf to the moſt rigorous ſeverity even of their own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and ſo let them cenſure me as
<pb facs="tcp:107560:14"/>
they think fit. And now I have made this bold challenge, I cannot foreſee that ſo great hazard I am like to run thereby; becauſe to be a Sot and a Dunce and an utter Ignoramus are the higheſt of Titles, the learned Rabbies, I have been endeavouring to decypher by their good would ever allow us poor Country Phyſitians to be in any capacity of attaining unto; as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſeries of their deportment towards us, and ſometimes their diſcourſes bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out occaſionally make evidently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to appear: And then I'd fain know what ſiniſter Accident that can poſſibly befal us in any undertaking we ſet about, can render our Perſons more contemptible or our Condition much worſe. But be it as it will, whatever may become of me and my ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments when the buſineſs is brought to the upſhot; I do not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair but that (as it falls out with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happieſt Projectors) ſome benefit may
<pb facs="tcp:107560:15"/>
chance to redound to others, though I my ſelf ſhould be made a loſer thereby, and that will be the compenſation for the prejudice I am put to ſuſtain, every way as ample as I deſire.</p>
            <p>It was, for ought I know, and, which is ſomewhat more, am apt to believe, and now and then when I think upon it ſeriouſly to pleaſe my ſelf (I confeſs) with the conceit thereof) prove an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the ſaving much uſeful Blood and Spirits in the Bodies of a multitude of good people, who upon the reading over the Arguments contained in this little thing (though proſecuted I muſt needs acknowledge with weakneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) ſhall not be altogether ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to lend an ear to every plauſible pretenſion, as otherwiſe they would have been.</p>
            <p>And 'tis not altogether impoſſible, but that ſome who by one chance or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may happen to peruſe theſe Lines, and are withal conſcious to themſelves of having deſerved the Character they
<pb facs="tcp:107560:15"/>
ſhall find beſtowed upon them (though 'tis very likely withal they'd ne're be brought to acknowledg ſo much) may when they perceive their Actions taken notice of, be induced ſo far forth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their manners, as not to inſult over their equals in every thing but pride and conceitedneſs, with half that dominering Lordlineſs that formerly they were wont. And it be but out of fear that as the thing is come to be commonly known, ſo the next time they come to act it in publick, it may as publickly be laughed at.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak the plain Truth of the matter, though I all along make my ſelf a party principally concerned; the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that has been offered is admitting of no other way of management. Or at leaſtwiſe this being the beſt that my dull and barren fancy was able to ſuggeſt to me; yet the main Scope I have from firſt to laſt intended, has layen couched under theſe two particulars before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which if I obtain, I ſhall have
<pb facs="tcp:107560:16"/>
had my end; but if I miſs of it, though every thing elſe ſhould ſucceed that may ſeem deſireable upon any, or indeed all other accounts beſides whatever, it will ſignifie but very little or nothing to me. But I both muſt, and ſhall for ever look upon my ſelf to have been totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the lateneſs of this Publication, ſo long after the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given: I have only one ſhort word to alledge in the vindication of my ſelf, which is, That though I had finiſhed what I have now written timely enough yet there being ſome things contained in it of a reflecting nature, which could not be avoided. And I being then enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a buſineſs, the moſt important of all others to the concernments of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life; which was not to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withal and any thing like Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie at the ſame time.

            </opener>
            <p>HAving been lately informed of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſſage befalling you in your practice concerning your Patient. Sir <hi>H.

            <p>I was given to underſtand how, that after Sir. <hi>H. F.</hi> upon a Fall he had received near <hi>Windſor,</hi> was committed to your care. A Phyſician from <hi>London,</hi> by the importunities of ſome friends of his, was brought down to viſit him. How that the many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Diſcourſe inſiſted upon almoſt all the way they came, was to bewail the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Condition of the unfortunate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe hard hap it had been to catch his harm ſo far diſtant from <hi>London</hi>; the only place (as they conceived) where the means of Relief in that and the like dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſadventures was to be ſought for;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107560:17"/>
That his Lady was much to be blam'd for not looking out for better advice ſooner, and for having ſo little reaſon with her, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon the fumbling skill of a poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Doctor.</p>
            <p>How that the Learned Man, ſo ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was carried into the Parlour, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved bitterly to inveigh againſt the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of your Preſcriptions; without ſo much as taking time to ſee any, or hear any account given of what had paſſed before his coming thither; moſt magiſteriouſly to have iſſued forth his orders for the taking away of thirty Ounces of Blood from your Patients Arm, Peremptorily alledging there was an abſolute neceſſity for ſo doing: The only poſſible ſcruple remaining with him, being this; whether or no ſuch wholeſom advice might not come ſomewhat of the lateſt, through the ſupine neglect of thoſe fooliſh people who had been all this while about him to ſo little purpoſe; as the uſual pretence upon ſuch occaſions is wont to be with all the Fraternity of like Principles with himſelf; ſo that if the Buſineſs had come to have ſucceeded well, the credit of the Action, had been wholly his, if otherwiſe, the Odium and Diſgrace thereof had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to your ſhare. A pretty trim Invention this, and a cheap way of gaining glory to

ones ſelf; becauſe hazarding nothing at all the mean while for it; unleſs it be a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents life; or another man his good name; or ſo forth: A couple of petty and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable things.</p>
            <p>I hear, how that the Lady was a little ſurpriz'd at ſuch unwonted confidence; and conſidering with her ſelf; that he had loſt Thirty Ounces already, was not altogether ſo forward as was expected, to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to this ſo ſudden a motion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe was ſeverely chidden for her way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs; and given further to underſtand, that unleſs his commands were punctually obſerved, her Husband was, in reaſon, to be looked upon as no other than a loſt man; and ſo ſhe might do even as ſhe pleaſed, chuſe whether ſhe would have his Life ſaved when it was offered, or not: But ſhe, it ſeems, being a Perſon to be ſwayed with ſome thing elſe, beſides paſſionate words, and big looks, remained utterly diſatisfied with theſe his haſtie concluſions, and abſolutely refuſed to follow his directions, unleſs hapning to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by your approbation: that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was bemadded thereat, threatned a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of Town, at break of day, next morning, (pretending I know not what ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of occaſions) unleſs your more early arrival there hapned to prevent him. All

            <p>If it be ſo, Sir, I heartily congratulate your ſafe eſcape, from this notable undermind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtratagem, that was ſo artificially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, for the blowing up of your reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and glad I am with all my heart, that the inventer thereof (be he who he will) was ſo luckily catched in the ſame trap, he had deſigned for another. Truly ſuch a facetious ſtory as this is, deſerves to be laught at right heartily; becauſe ending Commically: but had the Plot taken effect, and the blame of the miſcarriage lighted upon your head, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the loſs of your Patients life to boot, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Give me leave to tell you, Sir, that you have run a kind of deſperate hazzard; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe happening to be brought of by a meer contingency, all the ſecurity you had being bottomed upon the ſlight Baſis, of but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107560:18"/>
womans opinion: And where there is one in that or a like caſe, the deciſion of the point being referred to their arbitrement, would have given it on your ſide, there are five hundred would have inclined to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite party; and have been apt to have cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out without any further examination of the matter, that the doctor from <hi>London</hi> had ſaid it, and it muſt needs be ſo: Ay indeed muſt it, Ay and all that, and a great deal more; and this had paſſed for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as irrefragable as demonſtration it ſelf: as good have ſet your ſelf againſt a Torrent with a pitchfork, as to have preſumed to have muttered the leaſt ſillable in oppoſition againſt it. But all muſt have been done, and you muſt e'ne have ſuffered: There had been no remedy: For if he had dyed, no body had killed him but you, for not cauſing him to be let blood in a ſufficient quantity ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But if he had happened to ſurvive, then the Gentleman from <hi>London,</hi> had ſhewn himſelf an incomparable Artiſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed an unexemplified cure, not only ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man's life, that's a matter of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſuch rare Practicioners, but what is ſomewhat more dificult, reſtored him to his ſenſes and memory again: which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interventions of his happy aſſiſtance had been irrecoverably loſt. Then had not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107560:19"/>
only the Patient himſelf, but his Dependents and Family been indebted for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to this moſt excellent perſon: And it had been an obligation of ſo endearing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as never to have admitted of a plenary recompence by any poſſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, that could for ever after that have been paid him: Then had he rode back to <hi>London</hi> in moſt triumphant maner, vaunting and boaſting in all the companies he had come into of the happy reliefe he had given to one in the country, juſt at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtant of being caſt away, through the ill mannagery &amp; want of skill of one that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a Doctor amongſt them. And then the Country Doctors, they muſt have been frumped and ſcoffed at; juſt as the poor Curates are wont to be at an Act or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, and forced to look ſimply, ſo of't as they had chanced to meet with any that had been diſpoſed to have been pleaſant with them. And now what a ſad and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition are you, and I, and a hundred more of us in, who by the inauſpiciouſneſs of the Planets we were born under, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to take up our Abodes in Country villages, to be thus always liable to ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages as theſe are, and left to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a part of extravagant hotheads, to put tricks upon us at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107560:19"/>He that is a Heathen in his principles, and a meer Atheiſt in his practice, in fine, that is either a fool or a knave, or both or all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whether he be Emperick, or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or Apothecary, or Legal Phyſician, if coming but fron <hi>London,</hi> and dignified with the Title of a City Doctor, he carries all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and is at liberty to make havock of us, with the turning of a finger, in ſpight of all the defence in nature, we are capable of making for our ſelves; Unleſs through their own hair-brained, raſh actions they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be plunged into a manifeſt abſurdity; as in the caſe but newly recited; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mine parallel to it as ſhall be ſhewed anon.</p>
            <p>As thus; the evidence of the matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as tranſparent as Chryſtal, and he who has but half an eye in his head, cannot chuſe but be made ſenſible of it, at the very firſt bluſh; All we who live near the City, muſt unavoidably upon the declining condition of our beſt Patients, evermore be Subject to have ſome or other of them to be brought down upon us. The new Phyſitian is like the riſeing Sun; every ones eye is caſt upon him for ſome Ray of comfort: his preſence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways brings hope along with it, at leaſt, though it ſhould afford nothing more, And what ever falls from his mouth, hit or miſs,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107560:20"/>
is uſually eſteemed of by the company as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs then Oracle. The women never fail to gather about ſuch a one at his firſt arrival; whoſe hearts as they are ever tender, ſo are their tongues talkative: And I pray, Good Sir cry they, what may your Judgment be in this matter, life or death? we have had a reſtleſs night here: ſuch and ſuch things have been adminiſtred before your coming: we wiſh they may not have been too hot nor too cold: Do you believe them to have been all proper? Ah! this is luſcious language to a proud heart and a haughty mind! this feeds the ſwelling humor till it be ready to burſt again, and this flyblows the mans head with conceitedneſs, ſo as to make him utterly forgetful of his duty both to himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: For whilſt the bladder of pride is thus bloated up, he takes himſelf for ſome other Creature then what really he is, and looks upon all his equals with pity and diſdain. And now he is put into the way his <hi>Genius</hi> ſo much inclines him to, he may very well be let alone to act his own part: For ſeeing others have been forward to declare the good liking they have of him, he is reſolved not to be over-baſhful in ſetting a value upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; be domineers, and he dictates, and his ſentences are all irreverſable, admitting of neither diſquiſition, alteration nor appeal;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107560:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but muſt all be ſubmitted to with a blind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and an implicate faith: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in fine can ever be performed regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it ought, unleſs happening to agree with the exact platform of this wiſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. There is no tutor inſults more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly over his young pupil, then ſome that I could name, do over thoſe they are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-induced to conſult withal: eſpecially if they find any of the family peeping in upon them to make obſervation of their Actions: for then ſomething muſt be ſpoken in a key higher then ordinary: Some latent Error u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a more ſerious review diſcovered, and the pen ſnatched out of the others hand to mend it withal, and if it be but on purpoſe to ſhew who gives check to the conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and where alone the Legiſlative Power lies.</p>
            <p>'Tis true if he be a man of uprightneſs &amp; integrity, as there is a number of ſuch in this City, to give them their juſt due: then he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtifies what was done formerly, if in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his conſcience he believes the Phyſitian to have proceeded according to the rules of art. But if otherwiſe: he fairly debates the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, and labours either to convince him by making it appear where the miſtake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay, and is willing upon your reaſons ſhewn
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107560:21"/>
by the other to be overcome by him: and brought over to his opinion.</p>
            <p>But if on the other hand as is not ſeldome ſeen (and we have already ſuppoſed) he proves to be diſingenious and baſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide of that moral honeſty, which all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians by their education, and ſome by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their relation to particular Societies are more eſpecially obliged to, as there is no profeſſion of men whatever, but muſt of neceſſity have ſome that are bad amongſt them. Then he projects all the ways he can how to ſalve his own credit, &amp; conſign the other over to the condemning power of the giddy multitude, who as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to take up the moſt malicious ſlanders upon Truſt without ſo much as exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the reaſonableneſs of them, whether likely to be true or falſe; ſo are they as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious to improve a calumny to the utmoſt; and help it forward with all the agravating circumſtances, it can poſſiibly admit of.</p>
            <p>He uſually tels them for his part, that truly he could have wiſhed it had been his fortune to have been ſent far ſooner. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things being proper to be done at the beginning, which are not altogether ſo ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable at the full height of a diſtemper, much leſs at what time Nature is almoſt overcome; but that which he preſcribes is the only
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107560:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thing as the caſe then ſtands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poſſible to do the party good, and if that will not, he knows nothing elſe can.</p>
            <p>There are degrees of wickedneſs, and if the man be not fully fledged therein, it may be this reprehenſion ſhall ſerve the turn, which though but gentle in compariſon of the unmercifulneſs of ſome others, yet (if believed) is of ſufficient validity to clip the wings of his Antagoniſts (for ſuch he eſteems and ſuch he takes him to be,) ſo as to keep him from ever ſoaring over-high in the good opinion of his neighbours. But now if he bent to be miſchievous indeed, either through the propenſity of his own nature or prompted to be ſo by the inſtigation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Then he goes a down right way to work, and finds fault with every kind of thing right or wrong that has been made uſe of, before his coming: And all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions he makes are rais'd for no other intent whatever, but meerly to deprave.</p>
            <p>Was the Patient let blood, why what cools or chils him? There being more need of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then Subſtraction, of pouring freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his veins (could it conveniently be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) rather then letting any out, becauſe in this caſe the diſtemper is to be carried off by fervent and a more quick Circulation of the blood, whereas now it Reſtagnates and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focates
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107560:22"/>
the man, who might have done as well as any one in <hi>England,</hi> had he not moſt unfortunately happen'd to have been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and over-tampered withal.</p>
            <p>But if there was no blood at all taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, why then the caſe becomes clearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and that was the only Remedy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, &amp; ought to have been celebrated upon any condition; but now 'tis too late, the humors being all quarred and ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Noble parts, which might eaſily have been drawn away by Revulſion when time was. And then he gives a grave no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If he finds he hath been purged pretty tite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that has utterly dejected Nature: if but gently, then it has done the more miſchief, by ſtirring the humors only, and not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removing them, if moderately and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both extreames, then 'twas wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and ſhould not have been done at all, but he ſhould rather have been ſweated or vomited, or any other courſe taken with him then that which was, and the like is to be ſaid indeed of any other application what ever. All which, and a great deal more, being

moſt maliciouſly ſuggeſted by him, and with the ſame Rancorouſneſs of mind entertained by the Goſſips of the place, (I ſpeak in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, &amp; would have my words taken as they are intended, in reference to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation) who are always ready at hand to make their obſervations how matters go; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they run with it immediately, and happy is that Woman that can make the firſt ſtep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her neighbours threſhold, to carry a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe lamentable Tidings; how that the Doctor from <hi>Lond,</hi> is juſt now come, and ſays there might have bin an other gets courſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is ſo eaſily performed. For 'tis but a bold mans crying out againſt a wrong courſe, and his being ſent for too late, and there is a firm foundation laid for the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ever malicious ſuperſtructure Mr. <hi>Slanderer</hi> ſhall Judge convenient, and he who is but qualified according to that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Character we have been all this while making a deſcription of, and has once let fly theſe words; is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count perched up above the common Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of all his equals, and veſted with an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority far ſurpaſſing the abſoluteneſs of any Judge; for whereas a Judge is to act by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his commiſſion barely, and has his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107560:24"/>
power limited and circumſcribed by the known Laws of the land, whereby he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of following the tract of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen plain Country-men, the Verdict of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which is to take Precedencie of his ſentence; here's one has the Law put into his own hand; or rather indeed; who makes his own Liſt his Law, and takes upon him to Arraign, Judge, and Condemn at meer Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Peradventure. A Piſh, and a Tuſh, and a diſtorted countenance, are of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſufficient to diſpatch the credit of as good or a much better Phyſitian then himſelf in a breathing while, if happening to have the place of his Reſidence without the Precincts of the City-wards: And the very name of a Country Doctor puts in a bar of Exception to all he can either ſay or do; and in a word renders him a meer outlaw to the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of claim, to either civil reſpect or fair uſage: And all they who are thus exalted above them, look upon themſelves as privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to trample them to pieces, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Worms or Muſhromes, as often as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty mood chances to be upon them, 'tis an ancient cuſtom 'tis true, as has been ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that's all that can be ſaid for it: But 'tis as wicked as unreaſonable; indeed ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked a one, as that, though it may, and does oftentimes no doubt Miniſter occaſion

            <p>And I could wiſh that all ſuch, as cannot but know themſelves to be highly guilty in this particular, my meaning is of oppoſing and thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the thing how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light and trivial it may haply appear to Vulgar eyes, is not ſo in its own nature, but to be reflected upon by ſuch as will Judge rightly of it, under a far different Notion: becauſe when once this common bank of charity comes to be tumbled down
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107560:25"/>
tis eaſy to diſcern what an Ocean of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and thoſe none of the meaneſt ſort neither, ſtand ready to enter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the breach; Becauſe he that has once ſhewn himſelf a buſie body in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prove his Brother a fool: 'Tis ten to one if he do not in the next place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf to be an Errant Knave, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing upon thoſe mad preſcriptions which otherwiſe he would have been aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of: For has the other taken a wrong courſe indeed, and has he ſaid it then? ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to give his own tongue the lie, he is engaged in point of credit to run counter to all the other party has done before him. And when once maters arrive to that height it may very well be ſuſpected that he who made but little conſcience of breaking the ninth Commandment, will be as regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of violating the Sixth; and he who could think it no crime at all, to bear falſe witneſs againſt his Neighbour, will with as little regret of conſcience, be inclined to the Commiſſion of Murder: Eſpecially when it may be brought about after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct way: And when egged on thereto by Pride and Malice, and a fearleſneſs of ever being called to an account; but inſtead thereof being ſo ſurely provided of a Cloak-Father on whom to lay the obliquity of the

inſconſed in Cable, and inveloped about with Cordage, even from the head to foot, are then fierceſt of all, to give forth their orders for the joyning of the battel: and after the ſame manner do theſe prime Artiſts let out their mad receipts upon the bodies of the miſerable Patients, and when they have done that, ſtand by, and ſee how well Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Diſeaſe combate together, and are all the while (to the praiſe of their great prudence, be it ſpoken) free from danger, and out of Gun-ſhot themſelves.</p>
            <p>It ſtrikes me with amazement, ſomtimes when I think on't, that the beſotted Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are about the ſick party are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at ſuch a fulſome way of Procedure, but can be content to hear them out in what they have to ſay, and ſuffer them to go on in a ſlandering backbiting way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out check or controll, as ſome do, ſo as to fleſh and encourage them in this their ſly kind of Knavery, and 'tis a wonderful ſtrange thing to me, that they don't urge them to make good what they ſay face to face, ſeeing the parties are ſo near together, who are of theſe different perſwaſions, and ſeeing it may be done with ſo little trouble, to the end they may be the better enabled to come to the knowledge of the truth of the buſineſs, and to paſs ſome little eſtimate how
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107560:26"/>
matters ſtand themſelves, though every Man is not a Phyſitian, yet he muſt be a very dolt indeed, who is not ſo far forth a Maſter of his own Reaſon, as to underſtand ſence when 'tis ſpoken upon ſo common a Subject, and their are few by-ſtanders at a bar of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but upon a faithful opening of the cauſe on both ſides between the parties, may be able to give a gueſs ſomething near the matter where abouts the iſſue is like to reſt. Whereas they, who have an ear only for the Plaintiff, can never Judge of things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially; but muſt unavoidably be Subject to miſtakes and incertainties, and it be but for this only Reaſon, becauſe the knowledge they are capable of having, is no more than contingent; if happening to be true, well and good: 'tis more than he who receives the information, could reaſonably have been aſſured of, and conſequently ought not to acquieſce in; becauſe it was equally proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it might have been falſe. So that albeit in the profound Myſteries of Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wrangling, it be looked upon by thoſe who are well Verſed therein, to be a huge ſtep towards the carrying of the Cauſe, to be able to cry Whore or Thief firſt: Yet amongſt ſober and diſcreet perſons, the Caſe is far otherwiſe; and that very Circumſtance of <hi>Pre-occupation,</hi> in drawing up the Charge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107560:27"/>
againſt another, inſtead of aggravating the Crime, does but abate the Clearneſs of the Teſtimony given in, and render the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants Allegations ſo much the more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak hardly behind ones back, and to be the Inventer of little detracting Stories, to the Diſpraiſe of another Man, who may be ſuppoſed in the Opinion of the world, to ſtand upon Grounds equal with ones ſelf, is a practice ſo mean and ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and creeping baſe, that 'tis a Riddle to me, that any who does but pretend to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learning or Parts, or an ingenuous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, ſhould ever condeſcend upon the moſt tempting provocation, to make uſe of it. What then we ſhall think of thoſe who can ſpeak ſmoothly to a mans face, and yet upon the turning into another Room, ſo ſoon as ever they can fit themſelves of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and place to vent their Malice in, muſt be darting out their ſlanderous Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions againſt thoſe they juſt before ſeemed marvellouſly to approve of? This is an Action ſo purely Diabolical, and ſmells ſo hot of Brimſtone, that thoſe Noſtrils muſt be dull indeed, that ſcent it not at the firſt Breath. It can be reſembled to nothing more fitly than the killing a man when fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len faſt aſleep, or the ſtabbing of one behind,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107560:27"/>
what time he leaſt of all thinks on't. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all ſuch as have hearts bad enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the doing of ſuch vile things as theſe, if their Wit were but proportionable to their ſpight, one would think however, they ſhould be deterred from the performance of them; becauſe if their meaning come once throughly to be underſtood, as 'tis plain enough to every indifferent capacity that it ſhould; they might very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with a good ſmart Chiding, inſtead of a welcom Entertainment, and ſo no doubt they ſometimes do, as in the Caſe but newly inſtanced in, and divers others, which every ones Experience may be able to furniſh them withal. But ſuch, alas! is the Folly and Madneſs of the World, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally ſo tame, as to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be miſerably impoſed upon by theſe palpable Abuſes; and under a pretence of having their Eyes opened, are content to be led about by the Noſes any whither; they are made to believe, that a ſtrange Cure, (ſuch as theirs is, be it what it will) can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wrought but after a ſtrange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner. Their own Doctor, poor man! 'tis true, might haply do well enough, were he to wade in ſome ſhallow Stream he had been acquainted with before; but as the Caſe ſtands, he is now quite our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107560:28"/>
of his Depth, and at a plunge what to do, and which way to turn himſelf; that is in plain Engliſh, leſs daring and adventurous about mad projects than themſelves; and when once they have brought ſimple people to that paſs to ſwallow any thing they'd have them, then let them alone to make the beſt of their eaſineſs of Belief; for now they have gained the point they aimed at, and like the Wolves in the Fable, when they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Sheep to leave off the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Dogs, whom they pretended to have had ſome evil Deſign upon them, have it in their power to deal with the wretched defenceleſs Creatures as they liſt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Daughters of old <hi>Pelias,</hi> when they were once throughly poſſeſſed with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their Fathers being made young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what deſperate undertaking was it that they either ſcrupled or boggled at: the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et tells us, that ſhe who was the moſt Pious above all the reſt, ſhewed her ſelf the moſt forward, and active inſtrument, in cutting the Old mans throat, and draining his very heart blood out, and all out of a ridiculous hope that much better and freſher might be transfus'd into the room of it; which duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Office, ſo ſoon as ever they had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, away flies ſhe who had given them this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107560:28"/>
good Counſel, hurried by a pair of Winged Dragons in the Air; and ſo they were fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left in the Lurch, with the Ghoſtly Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of a Father's murdered Body before their eyes to gaze upon, and to bewail their own Credulity when it was too late.</p>
            <p>The parallel is the ſame to a hairs breadth, in the Caſe we have been deſcribing. The Patient waxes ill, and upon Summons, down comes a man of rare Parts and profound Skill (or is believed to be ſuch at leaſtwiſe, and then 'tis the ſame thing in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, though not in all) and he looks gruff, and talks big; and uſually the more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant his Diſcourſe is, the more 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by thoſe who deſired his Aſſiſtance; for ſhould there be any reaſon to be given for what he ſays, that would utterly ſpoil its Excellency; becauſe capable of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and appearing like ſomething vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common, which they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear from him. And then ſo ſoon as ever the Word of Command is given, though perchance ſo haſtily, that 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any mortal Wight living within ſo narrow a Compaſs of time as is then taken, to arrive to the perfect knowledge of all Particulars neceſſary to be conſidered of: Yet notwithſtanding all that, without ſo much as examining what proportion it may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107560:29"/>
bear with the preſent Exigency of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſuffering others to do it for them; What running, what hurrying, what poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what packing, to have it ſpeedily put in execution! Every Minute ſeeming ſeven years till the Will of the Learned be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And when the Remedy does come to be made Trial of, inſtead of growing better, it may be the Patient becomes much worſe than he was before; and if it be a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one as is not ſeldom ſeen, then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the applying of it, he falls downright into a ſinking condition, and ſo dies away under their hands; and then they look upon one another like a company of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, Giddy-Brain'd and Beſotted Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and whatever they confeſs with their Mouths (if they have any kindneſs at all for their deceaſed Friend) wiſh in their hearts at leaſt-wiſe, they had been better advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>As for his part who did the Miſchief, to carry home the Compariſon, he is far enough out of hearing, before ever the effect of his wretched Counſel comes to take place; and when he knows it, ſo little is he concerned thereat, as that he is in as fair a way as ever for the trying ſuch another Experiment. And the next time he is invited out upon a like occaſion, the very ſelf ſame Game comes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107560:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be played over again, ſome few Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Time and Place only excepted; and he puts the ſame Tricks upon Phyſitian, Patient and By-ſtanders, and abuſes every one of them in their Order, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn; and ſo he runs round in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and no one knows how to trap him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107560:30"/>
ſo regularly, or to have been never ſo happy in their Practice; all's one for that, a hundred to one but that at ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall have a Slur put upon their moſt innocent Actions, which ſhall both ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Credit, and bring their Perſons into a Diſrepute; Calumny being ever of that defiling Nature, that like the Dirt raked out of the Channel, if it be but luſtily ſet on, it ſhall very rarely be ſo waſhed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as not to leave ſomething or other of a ſtain behind it; eſpecially, if happening to be performed by a Party, who in caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdoing, is in all likelihood to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the very ſame Penalty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, there are two things, which conſidered of barely in themſelves, render it an extream difficult Matter for any Countrey-Phyſitian whatever, to arrive to any eminency either of Eſtate or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But if the Acceſſion of what we have been ſpeaking of, happen to fall in likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then next to impoſſible.</p>
            <p>The firſt whereof is, the exceeding thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Inhabitants they have to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Citizens, as they live cloſe together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo many of them may be viſited in a little time; whereas a whole day will ſcarcely ſuffice for the going from one Family to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107560:30"/>
in the Countrey, as the Caſe may be, and where the groſs Sum is but ſmall, there a little Abatement brings it to juſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>And the Second is, That Spirit of cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Countrey-Folk are generally indued withal; whether it be from the variety of Objects, multiplicity of Buſineſs, the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of the Place, or Humour of the People, or what elſe may haply be ſaid to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, I ſhall not much trouble my ſelf to enquire; yet certain it is, we ſhall ſeldom or never obſerve theſe Inhabitants who take up their Dwellings in populous Cities, to be half ſo diligent in ſearching into the condition and qualifications of their next Neighbours, as your Country-people uſually are, who as they pry narrowly with their Eyes, ſeldom fail to ſpeak as broadly with their Tongues whenever occaſion ſerves, and to Trumpet out all, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time more than all their Miſcarriages for the information of others, that they have been at the pains to make Diſcovery of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He that either is ignorant of, or unwilling to believe this untoward Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of too many, let him but lend an ear to the frivolous Reports that Neighbours in the Countrey are pleaſed to buſie themſelves every day to ſpread about of one another,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107560:31"/>
and he will quickly be brought to confeſs that the matter of the Aſſertion is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without Grounds. The Rule we have given us to walk by, is, to <hi>love ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> as we would have others deal by us; in place of which, commonly ſucceed Envy, Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings, Evil Surmiſings, the worſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions upon the moſt harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Actions, together with a Delight in nothing more than the Ruine and Downfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of thoſe very perſons we are ſo much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged above all others to be in love withal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whenever the Gentlemen we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing about, happen to ſtrike in with a ſort of People thus excellently well qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how utterly impoſſible is it for their Deſigns to do otherwiſe than take effect? 'Tis like the meeting of Fire and Brimſtone together, where the one is full out as aptly diſpoſed to receive, as the other to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. And when things are thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Wiſh, they are only with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> when he overcame the gentleſt of his Enemies, juſt to ſtretch forth their hands to receive the Victory when offered: There is only need of an Attempt in ſome Caſes; and this is one of them. How happy then muſt thoſe Perſons be accounted of, who are thus highly priviledged above others?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107560:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And how great an Act of Self-denial muſt that be in caſe of a fair opportunity preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, not to make uſe of thoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>I have always had this Notion thoroughly fixed in my head, ever ſince I have had any thing to do with Commerce in the World; that the readieſt way to maintain the greateſt correſpondence with thoſe we live amongſt, was to maintain the leaſt of all. Becauſe though intimate acquaintance be a <hi>Medium</hi> proper enough if conſidered in it ſelf, both to beget love and cement affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together: Yet by accident and through the evil diſpoſition of thoſe it oftimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be found amongſt, it produces a quite contrary effect, and becomes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Makebate &amp; Incendiary of others again in the Nation.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of which if we but conſider things aright, is no whit difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, in regard thoſe who meet often together, can never well be ſuppoſed deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſome matter or other, fit to make the ſubject of their diſcourſe. And then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not probable for all to be of the ſame mind, much diſcourſe cannot chooſe but gender a great deale of diſputing; no diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation though never ſo frivolous can poſſibly be managed without oppoſition; that and

Which gradation onee admitted of, as indeed 'tis as evident as the Sun ſhining at Noonday, what can be more Natural than for thoſe of the ſame Neighbourhood to be evil affected one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another. To ſay nothing of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other little circumſtances, which do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day fall out, and miniſter new and freſh occaſions for a petulant humour to work upon. To all which may be added the unalterable diſpoſition of ſome men, to envy all their Superiors, malign their equals and deſpiſe whomſoever they conceive to be beneath them.

            <p>Thoſe perſons at a diſtance being ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more willing to be determined in their thoughts, by the teſtimony and character which ſhall be given by ſuch as live nearer hand, becauſe as they have the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities of making their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the mans actions; ſo likewiſe may they reaſonably be imagined to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to paſs a right ſentiment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, ſo that if he fails here, 'tis like ſtumbling at the Threſhold, he muſt look to have good ſucceſs no where, but to be affronted and baffled, in every action of moment he ſhall happen to be intereſted in afterwards, throughout the courſe of his whole life.</p>
            <p>Purely upon which conſideration, and no other motive of what nature or kind ſoever, though I had relation to many places ſince my leaving the Univerſity; I never yet durſt entitle my ſelf an inhabitant of any one of them, but like ſome Knight Errand upon

his journey; or the Iſland <hi>Delos</hi> in the Sea, before the birth of <hi>Latona</hi> her Children; have evermore kept my ſelf in a kind of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comotive poſture.

            </p>
            <p>Where, before ever I could put my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Purpoſe into execution, down comes that Monſter of Ingratitude Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his <hi>quondam</hi> Journeyman, and ſerves me the very ſame Trick for ſubſtance that the other Gentleman his Neighbour did you. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſame part might have been acted by another as well as by him. I have already ſuppoſed it, and the Subject Matter hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to treated about, is a ſufficient Evidence thereof; but yet I have reaſon for my own part to take it moſt kindly from his Hands, becauſe I am principally to thank my ſelf for his being ſent for, and becauſe it was an Action ſo like the Authors own ſelf, and ſo patly ſuiting With his <hi>Genius.</hi>

            <p>For what could be more agreeable, than for one, who had the Foundation of his Practice laid in the Defamation of his own Maſter, to contrive the carrying on the remainder of the

work by the ſelf-ſame kind of Ingenuity.

            <p>About the latter end of the Month of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> I was ſent for to a Lady of good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, aged upward of Sixty, of but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtitution of Body, and much addicted to the Scurvey and Gout; as the knottineſs of her Joynts, pains in and about her Limbs, together with ſeveral other Indications not at all neceſſary to be here recounted, made ſufficiently enough to appear. Her Urine was pale and clear, without the leaſt ſhew of Sediment; and her Pulſe but low. The reaſon of her preſent Indiſpoſition was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from walking abroad in a cold and damp Garden. 'Twas ever her Cuſtom, and ſhe owned it, when ill at any time, to conſult with ſeveral Phyſicians, to hear what each of them had to ſay to her, but to follow the Directions of few, or none of them, when ſhe had done. And if at any time ſome one above the reſt proved to be ſo happy as to prevail with her, to fancy ought of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107560:34"/>
'twas at beſt obſerved after ſo lame and imperfect a manner, that by a kind of Synechdochical Interpretation, a part was to be taken for the whole: And let what would be debated, and reſolved upon, and by whomſoever, ſhe would be ſure to reſerve the caſting Vote to her ſelf; and in the cloſe of all, determined the ſtate of the Controverſie that way which ſeemed the moſt agreeable to her own Opinion. I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be of this Temper, and ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it ſhould be taken notice of, ought in reaſon to be ſo much the leſs poſitive in preſſing any thing I perceived her obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet againſt; but rather to endeavour to work her over by degrees to what I looked upon in my Conſcience to be moſtly for her Good. There are ſome Natures, may by a gentle complyance be brought to the doing of divers things, who will be compelled to juſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>That which ſhe ſeemed to complain of principally at this time, was a Pain in her Head and Side: As a Remedy againſt which I propoſed Bleeding at the very beginning; but that was a thing ſhe utterly diſliked of, and deſired with ſome paſſionateneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that it might no further be inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>The day was too far ſpent to admit of a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107560:34"/>
purgative Potion, and which I at that time a little ſcrupled at (I muſt confeſs) had it been more early, for fear of calling in the Arthritick Humours towards her Stomack and Bowels. But the application I was more eſpecially inclined to, and that which ſhe her ſelf beſt liked of (whoſe Approbation was in no wiſe to be left out) was a Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Clyſter, as conſidering moſt Gouty Bodies to be generally oppreſſed with Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs; hers I knew to be ſo in an eminent manner, and therefore conceived ſo much the better hopes of drawing down ſuch Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulenties as might give annoyance to either Part above mentioned by way of Revulſion. Upon the admiſſion of the Clyſter, ſhe avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundance of Wind, reſted pretty well that night, and was in ſome hopes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the next day; but the Pains in her Cheſt and Head, though ſomething remitted, yet continuing in part, and her Stomach but weak withal, I adviſed her farther to the keeping cloſe to her Bed, and the drinking once in five hours time three or four Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of a good ſprightly Cordial, which I oft found by experience to be of a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Nature, ſome few drops <hi>S. C. C.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto ſuperadded; and that between whiles ſhe ſhould not forget to take plenty of Poſſet-Drink, in which <hi>Marygold</hi>-flowers,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107560:35"/>
               <hi>Sage,</hi> and Shavings of <hi>Hartshorn</hi> had been throughly decocted; the intendment of which Preſcription was chiefly bottomed upon theſe Reaſons following.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, To ſecure her Stomach from the influx of Noxious Humours, which upon the leaſt diſturbance might be apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated there, and keep them off at a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To digeſt and expel thoſe Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulenties that the Clyſter had as yet left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removed.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, Though I was not ignorant how indiſpoſed a Body ſhe had for Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Yet I did believe it however an apt means to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſerate and keep open the Pores thereof, ſo as to let forth thoſe Fuliginous Vapours by a kind of inſenſible tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which could not be avoided otherwiſe. Which laſt, though it be a Doctrine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but by a few, yet is it of general uſe; and by all ſuch as apprehend it as they ought, and ever will be looked upon in very many caſes as a Remedy ineſtimable; and I could heartily have wiſhed that the Lady her ſelf had been one of that ſmall number, who had been able to have judged of that particular Intimation as of right it deſerved, perchance it might have been ne're the worſe for her; or at leaſtwiſe have been willing to have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107560:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſubmitted to it upon the Authority of thoſe that did. But Phyſicians are only to give forth the beſt directions they can, and then to acquieſce in the Integrity of their own Conſciences. 'Tis a thing impoſſible for them to tranſmit their Notions into the Heads of thoſe who have not capacities to receive them.</p>
            <p>And then as for the ſo frequent repetition of the Decoction before recited, I, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood no better, dull Creature as I was! remained hugely well ſatisfied in my own thoughts with ſuch alike reaſons to theſe. Firſt, I conſidered, that notwithſtanding ſhe had never as yet from the time of her firſt illneſs, had any the leaſt Symptoms of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appearing upon her, as indeed ſhe never had any till the Tueſday before her death: Beſides, what was occaſioned by one ſingle Fit of an Ague (which upon the uſe of fitting Remedies, as ſhall be ſhewed in its proper place) never returned afterwards; Yet that was an evil however, both to be feared and armed againſt, and that not only upon that one general Account, becauſe few other Diſtempers of what kind or nature ſoever, but what are oft times found to be the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers thereto; but alſo becauſe the acute pains in the Membranous Parts of her Body, and the Inflammation in and about her
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107560:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Throat ſhe had hitherto ſo often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, might ſeem in ſome meaſure more immediately to threaten it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For that I had perceived her Stomack to be much infeebled, as was very clear, to ſet aſide many other Circumſtances, from her exceeding proneneſs to vomit upon every light occaſion. Whereupon thought I, what more inoffenſive Nouriſhment and eaſie of digeſtion could poſſible have been adminiſtred to her, than that was?</p>
            <p>It came to my mind likewiſe, of how very thick and coagulated a ſubſtance the Blood of Scorbutick People is uſually found to be, and how deſtitute for the moſt part of that Serous Humour that ſhould render it more fluid, and be a means to help it forward in the performance of its Circulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I was brought to conclude without any great matter of ſcruple, that the moſt probable Expedient for the reducing it to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting temper, muſt be by a plentiful inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of ſomething of a like nature, unto that which by its abſence had occaſioned it to be ſo, and which might the ſooneſt and moſt eaſily of all others be communicated to the whole Maſs.</p>
            <p>But now, What thing is there in nature approaches nearer to an Identity with Blood, than Milk doth? abſtract but the Colour and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107560:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome few accidental Differences, and that man muſt have more than an ordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile head-piece who is able to reſolve where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the diſagreement lies betwixt them, ſo as really to diſtinguiſh the one of them from the other. From whence it follows by the cleareſt evidence of Demonſtration, that the loſs of thoſe uſeful qualities whenever they happen to be wanting in the Blood, is beſt of all repaired by the acceſſion of ſome ſuch others as are to be met withal in a Milky ſubſtance; and therefore the Decoction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by us cannot otherwiſe chooſe but be of ſingular uſe in the preſent caſe we are now arguing about, as muſt needs appear to any one who has but a Stock of Reaſon, competent enough to make a due compariſon between ſuch ſenſible Objects as ſhall be preſented to his view.</p>
            <p>In Milk there are three parts deſerving conſideration, two of which are of a more groſs ſubſtance convertible into Cheeſe and Butter, and both of them are known to be great Supporters of humane Life; but the other remaining, is of a thin and ſubtile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſolvible into Whey only. The two former may well be looked upon as no whit ſubſervient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> our Deſign, not only becauſe diſagreeable to an infeebled ſtomack through which they are to paſs, and in which they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107560:37"/>
were to be more laboriouſly wrought upon before ever they could become good Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; but likewiſe becauſe partaking in too great a meaſure of thoſe other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications which the Bloud was ſuppoſed to abound withal more than ſufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But the Wheiey part, of which our Decoction ſolely conſiſts, both recreates the Stomach by a nouriſhment ſtanding in need of little or no concocting at all (which if it did, Nature could in no wiſe afford at that time, as being otherwiſe more buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.) And being thence carried away without any great matter of difficulty into the Veins and Arteries where the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is more immediately ſeated; may well be ſaid to do greater execution there: I ſay it again, and will prove it when I have done, much greater Execution by its preſence there, than any other Remedy beſide of what kind or quality ſoever. My Reaſons are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as has been already intimated, being once communicated to the Bloud, it ſupplies it as much as is poſſible with thoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it ſtood in want of before its arrival thither, is capable of being impregnated with the Virtues of ſeveral Medicaments, and thoſe very uſeful ones too, which are not altogether ſo fit to be made uſe of in their own ſubſtance; and then if conſidered
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107560:37"/>
ſimply and in it ſelf, is apt to obviate and prevent all that other train of horrid Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which divers ſick people are found obnoxious to upon the ſmalleſt alterations. Was the Radical moiſture nigh-hand waſted before? This furniſhes it with a freſh Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Was the Circulation put to a ſtand? This renews its Courſe, and maintains it from the time of its admiſſion in a conſtant moveable Diſpoſition. 'Tis this contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the Heart, irrigates the Brain and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Parts of the Body; which, as they are the only Organs deſtinated to ſenſation, ſo if happening to be drawn into a conſent with others that are actually inflamed, preſently become heated and diſtempered together with them, ſo as to haſten on Convulſions, Phrenſies, an invincible Reſtleſneſs of both Body and Mind; and in the concluſion of all, even Death it ſelf. Upon which Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I was always careful to ſee her well ſupplied of what I conceived ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to her Preſervation; and to put thoſe who were Attendants upon her often in mind of the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>I perceived by the whiſtling of her Pipes that her Lungs were ſomewhat oppreſſed, and in danger of Suffocation: and therefore for the timely preventing any inconvenience that might ariſe that way, to the incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>In the mean while, to make good the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion but newly laid down, let it be but throughly conſidered of for what end, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theſe Pectoral Decoctions are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Are they not (as the Name ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indicates) ordained as a Remedy againſt the Affections of the Cheſt; they are ſo undoubtedly, and ſo underſtood by all. And yet for all that, the uſual way of admitting
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107560:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them is ſo very praepoſterous and contrary even to common Sence and Reaſon, as muſt clearly appear to any one who has but the leaſt Knowledge of the Structure of Mans Body, and the Relation the Parts thereof ſtand in, one towards another; that 'tis ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible but that almoſt the whole of the Preparation ſhould be rendred in a manner ineffectual for the attaining of thoſe purpoſes unto which it was primarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, and to deſcend to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the particular nature of the thing it ſelf: Whether or no it be from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of the Denomination? all Drinks being generally looked upon in ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech to denote ſomething, then the moſt uſeful, after it comes to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down; or from the prevalency of an Erroneous Cuſtom, the doing whereof, as it ſometimes proves all the warranty it hath; ſo likewiſe for the moſt part all the reaſon it carries along with it.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo it comes to paſs, that in caſe of all <hi>Catarrhs</hi> and Diſtillations; whether riſen from ſome cold, newly taken, or an ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body going before, or from what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe origination, elſe imaginable. The Pectoral Decoction, whenever it comes to be uſed; is with the ſame haſty ſpeed ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107560:39"/>
to make its enterance into the Stomach, that all other Drinks commonly are. And the poor ſilly Patients are apt to ſatisfie themſelves very well in what they have done when they ſo take it: and to expect the greateſt benefit of all after its admiſſion thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in ſo much that ſome perſons have been known to take down huge quantities thereof upon that only Score; and then to have fancied to themſelves ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of advantage to have redounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; which if hapning to be ſo as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, muſt needs be no other, than the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own fancies indeed. Becauſe the only poſſible way to come at the Lungs, and ſo by conſequence to do them good, is down ſtraight way by the Larynx or Windpipe (as has been formerly ſuppoſed) and therefore whatever Medicament comes once to be tranſmitted beyond that; and is but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have made its approach to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the Oſeing, cannot otherwiſe chuſe but be paſt all poſſibilitie of arriving at the Cheſt, unleſs any will be ſo vain as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to fetch a compaſs about by the Veins and Arteries; and ſo to viſit it in its progreſs along in Circulation with the Bloud; which Opinion, as it can never be defended with the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon; ſo neither can it be long adhered unto by any ſober and conſiderate man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:107560:40"/>Becauſe in the firſt place, the Stomachs even of the moſt healthful, are conſtantly affected with an acid kind of Juice; which will be ſure to impart ſomething of its own quality to whatever Liquor it comes to have any communication or intercourſe withall; and then after its departure thence into the Venal and Arterial Veſſels, whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes united as it were, and incorporated into one Body with the Bloud: what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of change and alteration muſt it of neceſſitie be ſuppoſed to undergo again? So that albeit in its priſtine Eſtate it may, and ought to be accounted of as purely Pectoral. Yet after all theſe ſhiftings, changes, and variations; It would ceaſe to be ſo any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as becoming of a quite and clean diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature from what Originally it was And therefore if happening from that time forward to contribute any thing of Relief unto the Patient; it can in no wiſe be al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowed to do ſo under the former Notion of being Pectoral; but upon ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cidental account: and ſo any decoction whatever, that was not Pectoral, might have done every whit as well.</p>
            <p>But farther, it being by way of Conceſſion granted (though it can never be proved that theſe firſt qualities, it was at firſt endur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed withall, have not been all this while im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paired;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107560:40"/>
but to have remained altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; and in the ſelf ſame condition they were in from the beginning. Seeing nothing can be ſaid to operate after any ſort whatever where it ſelf is not. I would far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demand which way, and by what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtinct it ſhould be directed to its jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, ſo as to find out thoſe very parts which ſtood in need of its aſſiſtance; becauſe in all likelyhood ſome competent portion thereof muſt be ſubject to be diverted in its courſe by ſweating; otherſome again be drained away by Urine. And then as for the Reſidue which ſhall be tranſlated thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It muſt either paſs upon the account of Nutriment, or ſome other Title beſide. If the former, than no other part of the Body whatever, but what may lay as fair a claim thereto, as the Lungs can be ſuppoſed to have; becauſe Nature, being the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mother to them all, deſigns the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of her nouriſhment to every part of the Body alike; If the latter; It muſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilty make ſome reaſonable ſtay there, in order to the producing ſo generous an effect; which is another matter extream difficult to conceive of: becauſe then it muſt all on the ſudden ſhake hands with a new Acqaintance, in whoſe company it is ſuppoſed to glide along, and with whom it had juſt before as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107560:41"/>
it were contracted a new League of Alliance; and which is it ſelf always maintained in a progreſſive, endleſs motion; as being ſtill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed on a little more forwarder than it was before, by every repeated <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the Heart. Beſides after all that can be either ſaid or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the advantage gained thereby, amounts only to thus much; to be conveyed ſo far forth as the extremities, or meer out-parts of the Lungs, whereas the Grievance calling for Redreſs, lies much more inwardly and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; even within the very Cavitie of the Windpipe it ſelf: and the divided &amp; ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Branches thereof; (I ſpeak now of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs,</hi> &amp; Diſtillations, for which theſe Drinks are frequently miſapplyed: not but that there are Caſes in which the Lights may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any thing at all of a Diſtillation from above what time Pectoral Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are allowed to be alike proper, as they are now; but thoſe being but rarely ſeen in compariſon of the others: and the very ſame way of application we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for, being moſt deſervedly even in them to be preferred: It makes nothing at all againſt what I have been diſcourſing about) and that as proceeding firſt of all from the matter of the <hi>Catarrh</hi> ſo falling upon them. Or Secondly, from ſome noxious qualitie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it in its Deſcent, both which are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107560:41"/>
ſure to ſet the Lungs a coughing: The One of them as filling up that ſpace which by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it was never ordained for: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not long to be endured there: The Other by irritating thoſe Veſſels it happens to approach unto by the ungratefulneſs of its Touch. And neither of theſe two Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences can poſſibly be remedied by any thing remote, or kept at a diſtance from them.</p>
            <p>No, it muſt be ſomething nearer hand, that is to ſatisfie ſuch Intentions as theſe are. Something that by joyning it ſelf with the matter of the <hi>Catarrh,</hi> may have an innate aptitude to abate its acrimony; take away or prevent that viſcide toughneſs, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little ſtay is wont to be contracted there, and thereby become a means to help Nature, disburthen her ſelf the more eaſily, when a Fit of Coughing ſhall next ſucceed: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be able by ſome virtues of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervailing nature immediately to affect the very parts themſelves that have been preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced thereby; and that in the very ſame places where they had received their harm, which can be admitted of no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than by way of Lambative only; and ſo long as Pectoral Drinks are ſo taken, I have nothing at all to object againſt the free uſe of them. But becauſe I find the cuſtom,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107560:42"/>
but now reprehended, ſo conſtantly put in practice; and that not only by the common rout of ordinary People; but alſo ſuch as would willingly be thought to be of abilties, to render a reaſon for what they do: I have choſen to inſiſt the longer upon this tedious, though I hope not altogether unprofitable, digreſſion; which being at an end, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to go on where I left off before; only craving leave before I do ſo, to acquit my ſelf from an Obligation I lye under, of giving a brief account of the Medicament, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red might be taken in Lieu of the other, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the manner of its preparation, which was no other in ſhort but this. To take ſome few Cloves of Garlick, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them for a convenient time in a ſufficient quantity of Fountain-water made ſcalding hot; and ſo to be boiled up with a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Sugar to the conſiſtencie of a Syrop.</p>
            <p>This I knew to be of efficacie for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of her Pipes, and the exonerating them of that burthen they ſeemed at preſent ſo much oppreſſed withall; and which could be hurtful to none who did not afterwards catch cold upon it; which inconveniencie I looked upon her to be ſufficiently ſecured from, as being under an indiſpenſable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of keeping within her Chamber; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107560:42"/>
then by reaſon of her averſneſs to meddle with any thing, with the compoſition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe had not before hand been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. I both preſcribed the way of making and applying it at large: Leaving her to the conduct of her ſelf and attendants, ſome few general directions excepted.</p>
            <p>For now there began to be a ſeeming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of her firſt illneſs; and we were all willing to conceive hopes, at leaſtwiſe, of a farther amendment ſuddenly to follow after.</p>
            <p>That Phyſician who ſhews himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prodigal of his Viſits amongſt the more fickle ſort of his Patients, ſhall quickly give them a Surfeit of his company, and therefore it may do well ſome times, and upon ſome conſiderations to withdraw for a little time; though perchance upon others of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a longer continuance amongſt them might not have been altogether improper.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the <hi>Friday</hi> following; which was ſome two or three days after, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſent for, upon a freſh Summons: The Nature of her Diſtemper, being now much altered from what it was before; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converting it ſelf apparently in the form of a down-right <hi>Ague,</hi> ſhe had been held for ſome two hours ſpace together with a ſhivering all over, which afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107560:43"/>
in a burning fiery Fit: at the time of my arrival there, I perceived her to be both hot and feaveriſh; and her Pulſe, never ſo till then, exceeding quick and high.</p>
            <p>The Reſult I came to upon the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency, was This; that an intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was by no means to be tampered with all till the Paroxyſm were over. How that Nature was then buſie about her own work, which none could do for her, eſpecially at that juncture of time, ſo well as ſhe her ſelf; and therefore not to be diverted; but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way I knew, and the moſt likely to help on with the ſame deſign with hers, was by a plentiful drinking down of a decoction of <hi>Cardumus Benedictus</hi>; that thereby the febrile matter would in probabilitie be ſomewhat diminiſhed by Sweat and Urine: The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in her Bloud, and heat within her Bowells come to be the better qualified, and her Body by reaſon of a Specifick Virtue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly incident to that Plant; rendered ſo much the leſs diſpoſed for a ſecond Invaſion at another time.</p>
            <p>Adding withall, that the next Morning, when the preſent commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion was at an end; I ſhould adventure to give a purgative Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might gently evacuate her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, where the <hi>Fomes</hi> of the Diſtemper was (as I conceived) principally contained;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107560:43"/>
and this I was the more inclinable to do, in regard I foreſaw what inconvenience was like to befall one in her weak condition, in caſe any more ſuch acceſſions as that ſhould not have been ſeaſonably prevented.</p>
            <p>I have not forgotten what, I was ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing e're while, my great fearfulneſs of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her at the beginning of her Illneſs; as being unwilling to offer any occaſion of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of thoſe Humours more inwardly, which might happen to lurk near her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and the Regions thereabouts, and could very well have been content to have been of that opinion ſtill, had Circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the ſame they were.</p>
            <p>But Neceſſity, as it is always to be obeyed in the firſt place; ſo is it capable of neither Conſultation nor Advice, but is evermore determined to one and the ſame thing. Whereupon the next morning I gave her the common <hi>Oxford</hi> Infuſion, much in uſe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what time I was a Student there, and which I have had frequent experience of for many years ſince; ſome gentle Syrups only ſuperadded thereto, which wrought very kindly and moderately with her: And from that time forward ſhe never complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her Aguiſh Diſtemper more: Her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy continued ſoluble for ſome competent time after it. In order to the reſettlement
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107560:44"/>

               <hi>Die Dominic.</hi> the Pains of her Head were pretty well aſſwaged, but apt to recur ſtill at times: And now over and above ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſeized on with a kind of Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Drowſineſs, ſo as to be much more heavy to ſleep, than at any other times of her former Illneſs: Wherefore fearing a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Humours upon the Nervous Parts of her Head; and in order to the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch Accident that might poſſibly have ſo fallen out, I forthwith cauſed an <hi>Epiſpaſtick</hi> Plaiſter to be laid to her Neck, as alſo to each of her Ankles and Wriſts.</p>
            <p>She complained very much of a burning heat about her Throat, and the parts adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereunto; for the mitigation of which ſhe had a Gangariſm prepared of Barly-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>q. ſ.</hi> in which the Leaves of Bramble, Cinquefoil, Columbines, and Red Roſes had been boiled; ſweetned with Syrop of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries to her taſt, and rendered gratefully

            <p>On the Monday I found her Eſtate to be but low; and conſidering that many things had been refuſed at the firſt of her illneſs, which were not at all fitting to be directed now; nor ſhe in a condition fit to receive them if they ſhould: I began to caſt about with my ſelf; to conclude on ſomething that might be anſwerable to ſeveral indications at once, and that without too much diſturbance to an enfeebled Body in the applying of it. That which occurred to my thoughts upon that occaſion, was a Plaiſter to be laid to the Region of her Stomach and Cheſt; yet ſo as to take in all thoſe other parts adjoyning, by the acceſſion of whoſe heat the Stomach

            <p>Upon the Tryal of which Remedy I laid no little ſtreſs, could it but have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have continued on. Firſt of all, becauſe the Application being outward, and nature but weak, I apprehended it the more fitting, becauſe it might be made uſe of with little or no trouble. Secondly I perceived her Stomach and Cheſt to be much oppreſſed with Wind; and this I looked upon to be a proper means both to diſſipate and expel it.</p>
            <p>I have ſomewhere met with an Author, who in the Diſcription he gives of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the lower Belly, and the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within it, makes mention of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who by accident had hapned to be deprived of his Cawl, that common Apron as it were of the Bowels; and that he was from that time forward ſo ſeized on with a perpetual chillineſs in thoſe parts that were wont to lye over againſt it, that he was forced to wear a Cloth bound round about him on the one ſide of his Belly, in lieu of what ſhould have been placed innermoſt for the ſpace of his whole Life time afterwards.</p>

There is nothing but reaſon, or at leaſt ſome ſhew and appearance of it, that can ever ſeem to be a fit match to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon, and he who has reaſon on his ſide in matters of this nature, and can yet ſit down well ſatisfied, and ſuffer himſelf to be overborn by meer pertneſs, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a Set of idle pretenſions; which when they come to be enquired into, vaniſh into emptineſs; and nothing deſerves in my opinion no other <hi>Encomium</hi> for this his ſo high an inſtance of patience, than that of a contented Coward. As for uny own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that I confeſs is a matter carrying but little of conviction along with it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to another man. But Truth is Truth, by whomſoever ſpoken, and he who is able, either by the ſelf-evidence of the thing, or any good, cloſe way of arguing to make out what he has to ſay to be but conſonant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, has little cauſe to trouble himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about

the cenſures of the world, but may deliver his mind freely, without either A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie or Preface: But now theſe Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents above-mentioned, being in ſeveralty ſuch as included a potential warmth in each of them. What could be more conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, then to expect that, when their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come to be united as it were, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated into one, they ſhould be apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſomething thereof unto thoſe parts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt which they had been ſo directly placed, and were ſo very nearly in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withall.

But the <hi>Liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107560:46"/>
it has done; and therefore I was in hopes (whether groundleſly or no, let others judg) that what was of ſo enlivening and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nature, and withal could be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as to involve them all, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate liberally of its virtue to each of them, might prove the moſt effectual Expedient above all others for the anſwering ſuch an Intention; that is to ſay, the ſubduing that exceſs of windineſs, that had been both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſheltered in thoſe overchilled and empty Paſſages; which I apprehended, as well I might, to have been one main occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her ſo frequent Vomiting. For though I deny not but that many other Cauſes may, and do often concur in the producing the ſame Effect; Yet is it Wind eſpecially that gives a diſturbance to the Stomacks of ſuch as have loſt their Appetite beyond any of the reſt, and therefore ought in reaſon to be principally regarded.</p>
            <p>Nature we all know to abominate a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi>; and whatever ſpace is not repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſomething elſe, will, and muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably, be filled up with Wind. But after a Fit of Vomiting, the Stomack is become emptied of that Suſtenance which of right ought to be contained there: And if it be at a time when it is weakned with much Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is unable to take more into the room of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107560:47"/>
it. Whence wind ſucceeds of courſe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſuppoſition but now laid down) and from thence is conveyed by an eaſie paſſage into the Bowels, cavities of the Spleen, Liver, and Sweetbread, and divers other hollow Parts and Paſſages, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch for the performance of ſeveral good Offices are diſpoſed of thereabouts, and from thence is returned back again frequently to annoy the Stomack, eſpecially that which is pent up in the <hi>Colon,</hi> is by conſtant experience found troubleſome in this reſpect; for that being for Scituation higher moſt of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inteſtines beſides, and immediately placed under the lower Region of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, by its perpetual heaving and raiſing up that part ſcarce ever ſuffers it to reſt in quiet; but having given it a diſturbance once, is as ready as before, to haſten on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Fit; and ſo on for a continuance, till either Nature makes head againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Enemy, and chaſes it forth of the Body (for the helping forward which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign what is now pleaded for, ſeems to me to be of no ſmall efficacy) or elſe ſuffers her ſelf to be quite vanquiſhed and overcome by it, and ſo Death ſteps in and puts an end to the Conteſt. And to ſpeak the truth of the matter, in caſe of great weakneſs and a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Vomiting ſucceeding thereupon;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107560:47"/>
this grand Inconvenience is ſo very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be attended to, that other Symptoms in compariſon thereof, though otherwiſe dangerous enough, cannot in reaſon lay claim to near ſo much of the Phyſicians care, becauſe, unleſs Vomiting ceaſe, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for life to hold out long. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſo many other horrid miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which owe their riſe and original to that of Vomitting; ſomewhat the more of regard upon thoſe Accounts, if not for its own ſake, ought to be had unto it. Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Bloud, is granted on all hands to be a grievous Symptom, and the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therof are both extream, dangerous, and ſad; but as the Caſe may ſtand, an avoidance of Bloud from the Lungs, may very well be, and is oft times brought to paſs by a Fit of Vomiting going before: for what more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe of the Body can poſſibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined than what is occaſioned from thence. Nature ſeems to do the very utmoſt ſhe can, ſo oft as put upon that act of Expulſion: and to ſet her ſelf about the performance of it, with no leſs than her whole Might. How do the Eyes ſparkle, the Sinews labour? and the Muſculous Parts of the Body gather and unite their Forces to a Head? And then is it ſo great a wonder, if in all this commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrugling of the Parts, ſome one
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107560:48"/>
ſlender Vein or Arterie of the Lungs ſhould happen either to be opened or burſt in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Surely whenever it does fall out to be ſo, Nothing can more readily be accounted for, or more eaſily underſtood. Again, Reſtleſneſs, Convulſions, and Lightneſs of the Brain, are other frightful Affections; and looked upon by moſt, and that not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly with the greateſt horrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. And theſe alſo we very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſioned through a Fit, or more of Vomiting, as may moſt evidently be made appear to any one that will but ſeriouſly conſider of the matter. For in that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agitation of the Body are have been juſt now dicourſing about, and which muſt eaſily be comprehended by all who do but pretend to know any thing belonging to the nature of ſickneſs. When the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thus inverted, the Liver cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chuſe, but in that very act, to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily compreſſed alſo: whence the Choller contained with in the Bladder of Gall, is with the greateſt violence imaginable driven forth into the <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>denum,</hi> and thence again by a contranatural motion forced to aſcend up into the hollowneſs of the Stomach; as is moſt evident by the abundance of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, which at ſuch times, and upon ſuch occaſions is uſually evacuated by the Mouth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107560:48"/>
And here by the way, I cannot avoid taking notice of that wretched Fallacy divers peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are wont to put upon themſelves, whilſt they miſtake the Choller ſo rejected for a certain pernicious Humour that had lain lurking (as they imagined) for ſometime within the Receptacles of their Stomacks.) O, cry they, this Vomitting muſt needs have done me a great deal of good; I ſee plainly it has, becauſe of its clearing my Stomack of that which common Sence and Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me muſt needs do a great deal better out than in, whereas that which they behold with ſo much of contentment was never in their Stomacks at all (at leaſtwiſe under that Form) till the Fit of Vomiting brought it thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor had been there then, if the Fit of Vomiting had never been; But I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume what I left before. I affirmed but even now thoſe evil Affections of the Head to be likewiſe oftimes in a great meaſure brought about by an Antecedent Fit of Vomiting: And my Reaſon is, becauſe the Choller was by that means forced to mount again up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Region of the Stomack, and when it arrives there, it muſt be apt to ſpoil and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter all that Supply of Nouriſhment that ſhall be taken in afterwards, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing it ſelf with what it finds there, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces Nature to carry it about the Body a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

time, which being an Excrement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſharp and firie above all others, and ſo very prone withal to be gadding up into the Head, is by this Act of Cohobation (as it were) rendred much more ſo then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore may very well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to produce thoſe many and great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations there, which we have before laid down in our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, as I conceived my ſelf to have had ſome grounds of hope for a good Effect upon the Parts already mentioned: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the Cheſt and Lungs themſelves, and that for the ſelf-ſame reaſons before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; for they being likewiſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by this External Medicament, and the Midriff together with them. I did with as full an aſſurance look for a removal of all Flatulenties thence, as from the Region im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately below it. Upon which Iſſue I was induced to believe, that, as there would have been a far leſs diſtention of the Parts; the cauſe which oppreſſed them being by that means taken away: So likewiſe by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that a much greater Vacancy of Place would neceſſarily have enſued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and ſo a Courſe come to be found out for a more full and liberal reſpiration.</p>
            <p>Theſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> are the Ends I aimed at, and theſe the Medicines I made uſe of in order
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107560:49"/>
to the attainment of ſuch Ends, which, what tendency they might have to the purpoſes they were deſigned for, whether any, or none at all; a greater, or a leſs than what ſucceeded in the room of them, though I have alleadged ſomething of reaſon (I am apt to think ſo at leaſt wiſe) for the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Proceedings, and could have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much more from my own Experience in other like Caſes: That's a thing howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be left to the Deciſion of ſuch as are wholly unconcerned in the Matter, as being the likelieſt of all others to prove the moſt upright and impartial in delivering their Sentiments thereupon.</p>
            <p>'Twas enough for me to be rounded in the Ear by one of the Female Sex; and ſuch are commonly the great Sticklers in matters appertaining to Sick People: That let it be how it would, I might ſet my heart at reſt for that, there being one a coming, that would cauſe all to be taken off again in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for a Liniment of <hi>Sperma C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when I had deſired for my ſhare; but the continuance of the Plaiſter before mentioned moſt humbly ſhewing my reaſons for that, as I thought but modeſt requeſt: 'Twas held a Boon too unconſcionable to be granted; but all muſt be ordered preciſely according to his own way and method. And 'twas honour enough to me to be the <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to ſo learned a man.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107560:52"/>
which cannot I confeſs but be apt to ariſe in the minds of ſome; and that is, how it can be poſſible for me to make reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the actions of a perſon I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſeemed to concur withall; and call into queſtion the doing of that which in ſome ſenſe I may truly enough be ſaid to have had a hand in the doing of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer the matter of our immediate concernment, dividing it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe two Branches: The One of them touching her being Let Bloud; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fitneſs of the Medicaments at that time preſcribed to be made uſe of. The firſt of theſe being done, not only without my conſent, but clearly againſt it: I am left at liberty to ſhew my diſlike of that, and declare my reaſons; when I have ſo done, without giving colour to any where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ground any the leaſt cauſe of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt me for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it being poſſible to joyn with another, as well in a Paſſive, as an Active Senſe; and to do a thing rather by conſtraint, than from any real impulſe of ones own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations. It may be pardonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to proteſt againſt that at one time which one has been neceſſitated unto at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And you Sir, who are a Phyſician, and cannot chuſe but be ſenſible what it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107560:52"/>
to have a Patient, of whoſe concerns you have been equally tender, as if they were your own, raviſhed forcebly out of your hands through the blind zeal of a Pack of (which though otherwiſe wiſe enough, yet as to ſuch matters as theſe, I may truly ſay) ignorant Relations, who muſt have their wills obeyed, though to the ruine of their Friend; and then to have had odd Tricks, and wild Experiments tried upon ſuch a one before your face, and in ſpight of your teeth; and after all this, to be in danger of being uſed much worſe when out of your ſight. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe are things which though they may poſſibly be apt at the firſt to ſet Choller a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a working; yet upon a better deliberation, and a more ſerious review may ſeem to have as natural an effect an other way; and that is to excite to a little compliance, though it ſhould be ſomewhat againſt the Hair; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tis a vain thing to make reſiſtance, and 'twere but meerly to obſerve how a poor Patient were dealt withall, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of ſuch a one at the laſt.</p>
            <p>There is a Violent, as well as a Natural Motion; and both may be allowed of, as expedient, according as the Caſe may be; and 'tis Excuſe lawful enough ſometimes for the Obliquity of a mans Actions, that he had it not in his power to have done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107560:53"/>
The very Heavenly Bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though allowed of on all hands, to be the moſt Regular in their Courſes, all ſave one of them, though they may have diſtinct Principles of Motion within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are forced notwithſtanding; to give place to one that is quite contrary, becauſe violent from without; and the bare hope of being thereby put into a capacity of doing ſome future good, has even in the account of State-Policy, been looked upon as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſpenſation for the commiſſion of ſome faults which ought not otherwiſe to have been born withal,</p>
            <p>But the way I ſhall chuſe to take to, as touching this ſecond particular, ſhall be to reſolve of nothing that is at all diſputable my ſelf, but barely to make a repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat was acted, for others to paſs Sentence concerning it. And being in a manner forced upon the Vindication of my own Method, endeavour to do it in ſuch a way and manner, as to make it obvious to every vulgar Underſtanding, that is not bent to be croſs; and poſſeſſed with too great a prejudice before hand, which had been the ſafeſt, and conſequently the moſt eligible of the two. And ſo long as I hold cloſe to theſe Limitations premiſed, can be content barely to ſtate matters of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107560:53"/>

            <p>And firſt of all, in order to the making good what has been thus ſolemnly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; it may be hugely well worth the while to enquire into the doubty reaſons that ſhould infer ſo abſolute a neceſſitie for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo aged a Perſon Blood, and that after ſhe had lain ill for ſo long a time; and not only ſo, but why the ſelf-ſame experiment that had been tried but juſt before to ſo little purpoſe; all circumſtances remaining in a manner much the ſame, ſhould come to be put in practice a ſecond time. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is to be noted, that after ſhe had been blouded; and obſerved to fail inſtantly upon it: and that that Account had been given to the great Oracle of Learning: He returns them back anſwer without the leaſt ſcruple or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitancie, that the ſame Action was by all means to be repeated, and which for this only reaſon was omitted to be performed, becauſe what time the Meſſenger could be back to deliver his charge; ſhe was in the judgment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107560:54"/>
of all the By-ſtanders in a dying condition.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all ſuch Puzling Queſtions, and ſuch perfect Riddles to me (and ſo I am apt to believe they muſt appear to all others beſides that are not utterly deſtitute of their thinking faculties) that I cannot chuſe but ſtand in admiration, that any who pretends to either common ſenſe or honeſty (to ſay nothing at all of knowledg in Phyſick) ſhould ever take the freedom of letting himſelf looſe to ſuch Giddy-brain'd Extravigancies. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this, if any thing may well be accounted of as down-right trifling in the moſt important Affairs; a kind of playing at Croſs and Pile with Peoples Lives. Unleſs we ſhould rather term it a ſpecious way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Remedies much more deadly than the Diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who are willing to be thought Learned <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and Wiſe Men, are ſeldom to ſeek of a Reaſon for their doings, though their Reaſons ſometimes may fail of being true. The Cauſe alleadged, as I well remember, for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Bloud the firſt time; and 'twas no doubt, upon thoſe very miſtaken Grounds, that the ſame Method was preſcribed to be uſed again afterwards, was, that 'twas a Pluriſie of the Lungs: and all Pluriſies making a dreadful ſound, becauſe ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107560:54"/>
requiring Bloud: This with the Adaption of a New Name, the By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders knew not well what to make of; but ſuſpecting however the worſt to lie at Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; It went down as glibly with them, as 'twas uttered gracefully by the Speaker. And yet all thoſe, who have the leaſt ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in either <hi>Grammar</hi> or <hi>Logick,</hi> will tell us; That a Pluriſie of the Lungs, is no leſs a Solaeciſm in Speech, than a Podagra in the Hand, or a Cheiragra in the Foot; becauſe if the Denomination be ſuppoſed to be taken from the Pleura, which is the Skin incompaſſing the innermoſt part of the Cheſt; Then nothing elſe beſides can be properly ſaid to be affected with that Diſtemper upon any account whatever in contradiſtinction to that Part. But all the moſt charitable Conſtructions are to be allowed to ſome Mens Words and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and little enough: and 'tis to be preſumed, that thoſe who have a vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the World, cannot be at leiſure always to ſpeak Senſe; and 'twould be a great deal of pity to tie ſuch up ſtrictly to words, who abound with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious matter; and who can never be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ignorant of the true meaning of the thing, let their Expreſſions be never ſo abſurd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107560:55"/>Wherefore to let paſs ſuch poor advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as theſe; as not worthy the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. I ſhall chuſe rather to inſiſt on another courſe, as both comporting much better with my own <hi>Genius</hi>; and (if I am not miſtaken) much more ſubſervient to my deſign, which tends not ſo much to the expoſing a Ridiculous Expreſſion as to the making diſcovery of an Enormous Deed. For the better effecting whereof I ſhall take leave to lay down this firm and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Poſition: to wit, that every pain in the Side, that is accompanied with a Cough, and a mixture of a little Bloud with the Spittle, is not a ſufficient argument from whence to infer a Pluriſy, be it of what part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it will; whether of the Lungs or Cheſt, it makes no great matter; and therefore all ſuch as ſhall fall to Bleeding of their Patients without Reſtraint; upon no better a pretence than that, may chance to repent it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they come to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better; and ſo may all ſuch as have been ſo fooliſhly credulous as to truſt to their raſh advice. No, there are other Symptoms to be attended to of equal regard with theſe: And when ever they are found wanting, the Diſtemper is to be looked upon, and really is ſo, of a different nature from a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, whatever a haſty man may be apt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107560:55"/>
to conclude to the contrary. Ile' inſtance only in a Concomitant Feaver, which is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be regarded above the reſt: and that was never diſcernible in this Lady during the time of her whole ilneſs excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when an Ague-Fit was upon her; and then 'twas impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, and juſt the Morning before ſhe was let Bloud; what time her Pulſe was obſervable to ariſe a little more than ordinary: but as for the conſtant Tenour and Temperament of her Body, 'twas for the moſt part mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately cool, (bating the inflamation in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Throat) and her Pulſe but low and ſmooth: and albeit there was ſome ſmall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bloud to be ſeen in the matter of her ſpitting, yet withal 'tis to be remembred what has been already obſerved, that 'twas uſually at ſuch times when a Fit of Vomiting had gone before: and then what ſo great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if a violent compreſſion of the parts of the Cheſt ſhould prove the occaſion of a little iſſuing forth of Bloud there, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the Veſſels are weakeſt, and put moſt upon the ſtreſs: and then why might not a Medicine that had been proper for the reſetling of the Stomach have been adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very good ſtep towards the removing this inconveniencie alſo? I ſhould have thought for my own part it might have done
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107560:56"/>
every whit as well: but all are not of the ſame mind, never were, nor never ſhall be: and what paſſes for ſenſe with one, and really is ſo, may yet be decried for folly by another. And there are a proud ſort of People in the world, old-excellent at beating down a good opinion, and when they have ſo done, ſetting up another, that is ſtark naught, in the room of it: and as they have a facultie of ſlighting whatever ſuits not with their own perverſe humours, ſo that which does, ſhall be ſure to be made the moſt of, and it be for this only reaſon, that 'tis a darling of their own fathering, if not begetting: and becauſe they are pretty well aſſured before hand of the facil natures of the people they are to deal withal, whom they know willing to be impoſed upon by every ſilly pretence and idle imagination.</p>
            <p>And yet I am fully perſwaded, that all ſuch as are not too unreaſonably much bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed in their judgments already, and can but be content to ſtay the examining a matter under all its circumſtances with a little ſeriouſneſs, will ſoon be brought to give in their Virdicts. That let what other courſe in nature imaginable have been looked upon as poſſible to have done her good. Bloud-letting however muſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107560:56"/>
in all likelihood have been exempted from that Catologue, and on the contrary, that all thoſe that would have gone the right way to have continued her Breath longer in her Body, eſpecially when reduced to ſo very low an Ebbe; muſt have laid it down as one of their firſt Principles to have kept her Bloud ſtill running in her Veines.</p>
            <p>The Matter is as Tranſparent as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, unleſs it be to ſuch as are as precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in their Councells, as they are poſt-haſt in all their Journeys they undertake.</p>
            <p>The only Reaſon why <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> is ſo generally agree'd on on all hands: In the Caſe of Pleuriſies being no more in ſhort but this; becauſe there neither is, nor can be any Pleuriſie in nature, but what uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally implies a Feaver, as that again a Fermentation and Ebullition within the Bloud. And though a Feaver be commonly reckoned amongſt the infallible Marks whereby to judg of a Pleuriſie; as if ſo be it were ſomething in nature of a later date than it; or that by force of its cauſalitie had ſome dependance thereupon, upon which ſcore we have been induced to give it the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Concomitant: The Learned will inform us, that theſe words though ſpoken
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107560:57"/>
in the Vulgar, are yet to be underſtood in the Senſe, the Wiſe intended them, and then Feavers will be found to be ſo far from being Symptomatical, that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Pleuriſies will be rather owing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And for the ſake of this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation alone it is, that Bleeding is held to be of ſuch indiſpenſible neceſſity: for were but that away, there could be no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretence for Boud-letting at all; becauſe ſo long as ever the Bloud continues in a Mediocrity of Temper, and ſo long it does; whilſt there is nothing of Fermentation in it; it cannot but paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſmoothly, and uniterruptedly within the Veſſels, as waters when they are low move peaceably in their own Channels. But when once the Febrile Matter comes to be ſet a working, and the Fermentation to ariſe to ſome height; the Caſe is then different from what formerly it was; and the whole Maſs of Bloud appears to be clearly another thing; Its motions becoming now much more brisk and vigorous, and it's courſe more rapid; and like the violent ſtreams oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a Land-floud, it neither knows how to flow quietly as it ought, nor yet to be confined within its appointed Bounds, but as 'tis apt to ſwell high upon every
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107560:57"/>
the leaſt hindrance; ſo likewiſe to force open a wrong Paſſage, as opportunity ſhall be given, and ſo becomes extravaſate, and breeds Annoyance to the parts it lies upon, which if we will ſpeak to the point in hand, is the formal reaſon of all Pleurities: for where-ever the Blood and Humors are extravaſate, there will Tumefaction, for the moſt part, of courſe ariſe; That, and Diſunion of the Veſſels, if upon membranous parts, infer pain; but pain brings on inflammations; which by as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a conſequence, attract a greater affluence of humors to the ſame place; which, by their coming on, produce a yet farther degree of heat, &amp; that again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the whole Maſs of Blood, by drawing it into a conſent, and ſo the Rupture is made wider, and all other Symptoms depending upon theſe, ariſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in proportion with them. And now the Blood paſſing by way of Circulation in a full Channel through the Cheſt; and it being abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the preſervation of humane Life, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual reſpiration ſhould be maintained and kept up there which being impoſſible to be performed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by a frequent dilatation of the Lobes of the Lungs, it comes to paſs, that it meets uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with greater oppoſition in the Cheſt, than in any other part of the Body beſides; and this is the beſt account I know of, that can be given of the ſo frequent falling out of Pleurities. And when the Caſe ſtands thus, there is no other courſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, always a reſpect had to the Ability of the Patient, but to breath a Vein immediately; and ſo to give check to this impetuous motion; and 'tis abſolutely as clear and unqueſtionable a Method to ſlake its Fury, as the ſubſtracting Fuel from a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cauldron, is a means to reſtrain its heat; or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107560:58"/>
the deriving Waters from a Veſſel almoſt top full al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, is, to prevent its running over.</p>
            <p>And whenever ſpitting up of Blood, and a pain in the ſide proceeds from the Cauſes before recited, that Phyſitian, who is againſt the letting his Patient blood (where ſtrength permits) may very juſtly be looked upon in the eſteem of all, as the Deſtroyer of his Life; becauſe he defers the uſing the Means, which in probability was the moſt likely to have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Cure; according to the known Axiom, <hi>Qui vult Finem, vult etiam Media ad Finem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then on the other hand, he that will needs be taking away of Blood at meer random and rovers, without any neceſſity putting him upon it, nay, when there was all the reaſon in the world, why he ſhould much rather have let it alone; under a pretence of I know not what imaginary Diſcovery no where to be found, unleſs it be among the wild <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of his own Phantaſtical Brain, deſerves in my Opinion, the ſame ſeverity of Cenſure which the other did; becauſe ſuch an one, by his unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, deſpoils his Patient of that Blood, which he had not haply to ſpare, and conſequently could not loſe: without a manifeſt prejudice to his Health, and ſo runs him upon a Miſchief alike dangerous with the former; it being poſſible to attain the ſame End, not only by divers, but even contrary courſes, as we know thoſe who depart from one another directly North and South, may yet arrive both at the ſame Point, if they do but hold on their Journey, and keep conſtant to their Meridian.</p>
            <p>There is doubtleſs a Time and a Seaſon to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for all things under the Sun: The Wiſe man
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107560:58"/>
hath long ago taught us that Leſſon; and Common Reaſon and Experience ſeems every day to inculcate it unto us. There is a Riſe, and a Stay, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in both Perſons and Things, and every one of theſe different Circumſtances ſtands in need of a diſtinct manner of conſideration; ſo as that; what is proper at one time, may be look'd upon as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unfit to be done at another. And if at the beginning of a Diſeaſe, when the Blood, is rank and high, it may ſeem perchance to call for ſome moderate Correction, it follows not from thence, that the ſame Method is to be inſiſted upon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the Body has been weakned by long Sickneſs. And albeit thoſe who have Youth, and Strength, and Nature on their ſides, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough depart with ſome ſuperfluous Humors, as the Caſe may be; yet ſuch as are paſt theſe Advantages, are not to be ſo dealt withal. An Aged perſon is ſcarcely to be let Blood upon any conditions; &amp; if at all, ſurely much rather at the coming on, than the declination of a Diſtemper. And therefore that Phyſitian, who upon the Bleeding ſuch an one, ſhall perceive him to fall into an apparent ſinking condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet perſevere in the repetition of the ſelf-ſame courſe again, diſcovers himſelf to be a man of a moſt perverſe and obſtinate Spirit; who, ſo he can but ſatisfie his own ambitious humour of being willing to be thought never to be in the wrong, cares not what Miſchief he does to poor innocent Creatures, who put their Lives into his hands, and reſign up themſelves by an implicit Belief to the guidance of his Opinion. Methinks it ſhould be an Argument to ingenuous Natures to be the more truſty, by how much the more they find themſelves to be truſted; and to be therefore the more ſcrupulous of doing an Injury, by how much
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107560:59"/>
the more they perceive it left to the Liberty of their wills, to do an Injury if they pleaſe: But there are ſome in the world ſo highly conceited of their own dear ſelves, they had rather die the Death than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Fault; and therefore no wonder they had rather others ſhould do ſo, than be reduced to the ſame Inconvenience. And yet this being liable to Miſtakes, is a Matter ſo very common, nay a property indeed ſo inſeparable from humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he whoſe demeanor is ſuch, as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved himſelf exempted from that which is every ones lot, deſerves, in my mind, rather to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his real folly, than envied at for that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preheminence he is apt to fancy to himſelf, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other men.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the ſo much controverted Point of Phlebotomy lights ſo directly in our way, it may not be amiſs, before we take leave of it, to enquire into the Cauſes, how it came to gain ſuch footing in the world, that was ſo rarely practiſed, and with ſo great caution and warineſs in former times. Certain it is, that mens Bodies are for ſubſtance now the very ſame they were heretofore: And if we peruſe ancient Authors, we ſhall find the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Diſeaſes to be likewiſe much the ſame. As for the Climates we live in, they are as unalterable as the Heavenly Bodies which make them; and men were every whit as ingenious, and learned, and wiſe then, as they are now; and yet to one that was let Blood amongſt the Ancients, we may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Multitudes of our own experience; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce a Diſeaſe incident to mans Body, for which Blood-letting is not preſcribed by ſome or other as a principal Remedy: And thoſe whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions ſcarcely agree in any one thing beſides, are
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107560:59"/>
obſerved however oft-times to concur in this, the breathing of a Vein, and taking away a little blood, ſo that it may ſeem now to paſs amongſt us for a kind of a <hi>Catholicon</hi>; the help at a dead Lift, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo oft made uſe of, for contrary Ends &amp; Purpoſes, to become the only <hi>Medium</hi> that was ever yet found out for the reconciling contradictions; a thing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto believed impoſſible, and beyond the power of Omnipotency; and therefore what can in no wiſe be freed from the imputation of a contradiction in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Surely, there muſt be ſomewhat of Myſtery in this Matter, more than what is commonly diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore to be at a little pains about the ſearching into the Reaſons thereof, may perchance deſerve to be accounted of as ſomething more than barely loſt Labour, if it be but to give light into ſome mens Actions, which might be apt to paſs otherwiſe unobſerved, and to caution divers unwary people how to behave themſelves when they come to be concerned in a like Caſe.</p>

            <p>And when the Phyſicians objected their want of Skill, and buſying themſelves about ſuch Matters, as they had never been bred up to, and conſequently had nothing to do to meddle withal; they Nicked them again, by ſhewing the People a way how to ſave Fees; and few being ſuch infidels, as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what ſeemingly made for their profit, though otherwiſe attended poſſibly with many real and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderating Diſadvantages, which they could not be wrought upon ſo throughly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. A great number of wealthy perſons, who had Money good ſtore in their Purſes, to have paid an able Phyſitian for his Advice, had they ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not Brains enough in their Heads to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand wherein the Fallacy lay, that was put upon them, inſtead of ſending for a Doctor when they came to be ſick, would take a ſhorter Cut by half, and only apply themſelves to the Apothecaries.</p>
            <p>How this was reliſhed by all ſuch, whoſe Intereſt lay at ſtake, and were made ſufferers thereby, is no whit hard to conjecture; and yet it would have mended the Matter but little to have uſed many Words in diſputing the Caſe with ſuch as were bent upon their own ways; and to leſs purpoſe would it have been openly to have fretted and fumed at it (though there's no doubt to be made, but that in ſecret many did both) eſpecially ſeeing the minds of men are generally ſo perverſe as to be but the more forward for the doing of a thing, by how much they perceive others whom they delight to vex, to be offended at their Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:107560:60"/>Whereupon ſome of the Phyſitians who had more wit, and leſs honeſty then the reſt, bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a timely Expedient to put an end to this ſo growing a miſchief, before it was too late, to regain their reputation amongſt the people they were now more then in danger of loſing, &amp; bring back their wandering Patients, that had gone aſtray from them, and all this without any noiſe, or the leaſt ſuſpition of being detected in what they went about.</p>
            <p>They agreed amongſt themſelves, whenever they ſhould be ſent for, to adviſe concerning a Patient, to bleed him at all adventures by one joynt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent; and if it ſo fell out, that it had been done beforehand by any one ſingly, and of himſelf, then they which came afterwards were to juſtifie the Action, by giving it an approbation.</p>
            <p>'Tis beyond beliefe how the project took effect, how it over-ran all <hi>Paris,</hi> and the parts adjoyning immediately, and like a train of Gunpowder blew up the poor dull Apothecaries with all their little pretences and ſhifts, before ever they were aware, ſo much as who hurt them, or from whence it was that the blow came; and not only ſo, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the cuſtom has been a means to keep them in a good Decorum ever ſince, who had otherwiſe been ſtill as they were wont to be, before they had that trick put upon them, moſt intolerably inſolent and impatient of all controule.</p>
            <p>For ſome of the Ring-leaders being perſons of known abilities, and they beginning the dance, and the reſt generally following their example; The people all (like a Herd of Deer at a ſudden noiſe) were ſurpriſed with admiration, brought to ſtand at a Gaze, and could not tell well what to think of it, they had natural Logick enough to infer, that if lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>And albeit they could formerly have been pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well content to have truſted an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> with the giving them a gliſter, or a purge, or ſomething to ſweat withal, and ſo after an enterance made with ſomeone or more of theſe, had ſuffered themſelves oft-times to be wheadled in further, then ever they intended at the firſt; yet believe me this ſame ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of blood ſeemed to be a buſineſs of ſuch high concernment, that they all began to be clearly of opinion it was not to be committed hand over head, to the management of every Raſh and Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Undertaker.</p>
            <p>There are ſome little things in nature, that prove oft-times the occaſion of very conſiderable effects; and what may be ſmall in it ſelf, may yet be great in its production: A little ſparke may be the original of a mighty fire; A little armour rightly diſpoſed of, may do a great deal of good ſervice, and the <hi>Rudder</hi> of a Ship (to take one inſtance more) though for bulk &amp; ſubſtance it be but ſmall, yet of how forcible

            <p>And ſo to ſpeak the down right truth of the matter: the piece of artifice wee have been mentioning; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlight, and diſpicable, it may ſeem to thoſe, who have neither leiſure; nor it may be Judgment, to conceive of it as they ought: 'Tis realy one of the moſt ſly and politick, and the moſt ſubſervient to the Phyſitians intereſt in its full latitude that was ever yet deviſed by the wit of man, as will appear to all ſuch as ſhall but take notice of theſe gradations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all an opinion of the neceſſity of frequent Phlebotomie, paſſing for currant amongſt the people, That brings in Phyſitians of courſe, to debate of the weightineſs of the affair, and it be but meerly for this reaſon; The aſtoniſhing horror and amazement humane nature in caſe of this remedy above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is more eſpecially affected withal.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107560:62"/>
ſcare, to the end that men might take the better warning, about the too haſty ſhedding of it: And the impreſſion left upon their thoughts, by that mean, comes no whit ſhort of its intended deſignation: There being ſcarcely any one thing, falling within the compaſs of a humane capacity, of a more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable aſpect; or that ſtrikes with a greater terror, then this doth. Divers there are indeed (though that he be to be looked upon as no part of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations) who can be well enough pleaſed at the rehearſal of diſmal ſtories, ſuch as are Wars, Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres and Murders; ſo long as they are acted at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, and kept far enough out of their ſight: but he muſt be a Monſter and not a Man, who can be the ſpectator of ſuch real Tragedies, and yet not feel ſomething of a remorſe the mean while ariſing within his breaſt.</p>
            <p>The eye of man, as it virtually includes all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſes: So is it a faculty which more nearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart, then any of the reſt beſides; Witneſs that Sympathizing quality, diſcovering it ſelf in moſt men; who though they can afford to be cruel enough, both in their revenge, and corrections, ſo long as they keep to the dealing of dry blows and no more, but when once they come to exceed thoſe bounds, perceive their anger to grow cool again, in an inſtant; of Lyons become Lambs, and have all their outrage converted into pity. And if the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation holds generally true when extended unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 'tis much more ſo when applied unto our ſelves, it being uſual for the <hi>charity</hi> of moſt to act then ſtrongeſt of all, what time it comes to be brought the neareſt home. And albeit there are many, out of an affectation to be thought ſtout-hearted, care not much (in this vapouring age) for owning any ſuch tenderneſs within themſelves, yet ſuch a thing

really there is. And there are but few (if any) in the world (let the Climate they were born in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be where it will) but muſt have ſo much of the temper of the <hi>Welchman</hi> in them, as to be more then ordinarily tranſported at the ſight of their own blood.</p>
            <p>And though it be moſt undeniably true, that there is ſcarce any one thing, about which Phyſitians are commonly called to conſult, but what at one time or other, (if happening to be miſapprehended) may prove of as dangerous conſequence to the life of man, as this of Phlebotomy, that is neither here nor there; ſo long as it appears not with the ſame dreadful ſhape to the view of the parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>There is a thing called <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> which is to be made uſe of in caſe it ſhall be found effectual to do the buſineſs; when divers that are much better, and more convincing in their nature, are to be ſet aſide; &amp; therefore Phyſitians in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; thought good to tranſcribe the copy they found ſet them by the Carpenters; which is to drive that nail, not which ſtands the faireſt in their way, or which they have the greateſt mind to, aboue all the reſt, but that which they perceive upon many little eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays made, the moſt inclinable to enter; ſo that if the letting patients ſee their own blood, carries ſo much of terror along with it, above all other Remedies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; who ſhould be entertained when a matter of that conſequence comes to be debated about; but thoſe who are ſuppoſed the moſt knowing in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; And who they are, if mens perverſeneſs will not, their own fears quickly will inform them. And then as for the ſecond; that follows on cloſely and unavoidably upon the conceſſion of the former; not only becauſe it is an eaſy thing to hold a Poſſeſſion,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107560:63"/>
where 'tis once obtained, but by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant aſſiſtances that are afforded by the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principle; for, and if ſo be it be to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as dangerous, to acquieſce in the opinion of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate perſons, in the important matter of Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, at one time, it will be ſo at another; and then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not have them finaly excluded, the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſhall evermore be pretended neceſſary, by ſome madheaded Phyſitian or other, &amp; it be but on purpoſe to amuſe the Patient, and fill his head with jealouſies, and croſs the Empericks &amp; Quack-Salvers, in their little deſignes. Elſe what could ever be the reaſon why ſo many ancient, and in a manner bloodleſs people, ſhould have their veins pierced with ſo much eagerneſs upon every ſlight &amp; trivial pretence; as we uſually ſee they are? whence ſhould it come to paſs? that ſo many in the very loweſt declination of their diſtemper, when the whole maſs has been depaupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſpoiled? ſo many of weak and windy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, ſuch as have ſcarce heat enough within them, ſo much as to digeſt a potched egge, or a little chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en broath, ſhould yet have their languiſhing bodies ranſancked and ſearched into, for that blood and ſpirits, which alaſs they have not to ſpare, and there were ten times more then what there is? and all this by the preſcriptions, and at the command of ſuch as can quote you a Greek, or a Lattin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and need be, and derive you a miſapplyed text from the ſage writings, of either <hi>Gallen,</hi> or <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Either this muſt be the reaſon we have been but now alleaging; or which is a great deal worſe, none at all; unleſs we will take this for one; that proud and ſelf conceited men, have hereby an opportunity put into their hands, of gratifieing their own ambitious (not to ſay Phantaſtical) humours; as being conſttuted by that means, the ſole Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors

            <p>But then over and above the two foregoing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, there is yet a third of very great concernment, in point of intereſt to the whole communitie of Phyſitians; and that alſo ariſing from the before mentioned Unlimited principle, which is not to be paſſed over in ſilence, it is ſo very remarkable, and that is the divers acceptation, the doing of the ſame thing, is wont to meet withal whilſt conſidered as proceeding from different perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fancy, and the meer force of imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My meaning is that what is allowable in one ſhould be made culpable in another: and as 'tis reported of the pillar of the Cloud which came behind the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Camp; That it gave Light and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their party, but was an occaſion of confuſion and diſorder to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which followed after: ſo may it truely be affirmed of this politick fetch ſo much in requeſt of late amongſt ſome, that there is not any one, nay all the other witty and wily ways of contrivance put together, that could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been thought on, from the beginning of time to this day, that could ever have ſtood them in ſo much ſtead, nor yet given a more mortal blow to the wounding of their adverſaries, and weakening of

            <p>And thus have I endeavoured, to ſhew upon theſe ſeveral accounts, how ſerviceable a device this unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited bleeding of ſick people, is apt to prove to the Common-wealth of Phyſitians in general, &amp; could the matter have reſted here, and might it have been but permitted for as many of the profeſſion to have diſſented from this way, as had had a mind to it, and to have uſed their own liberty as they ſaw occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it might for ought I know have been never a whit prejudicial to the Common-wealth of men nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but have paſſed for a queſtion not very eaſy to be reſolved, whether the entire body of the Nation, upon the whole of the matter, would haue been a ſaver, or loſer thereby: becauſe that albeit it can in no wiſe be denied, but that divers particular members, may have already, &amp; do daily receive a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble detriment upon that ſcore. 'Tis a matter of no ſmall importance however to be freed from thoſe ſwarms of ſeducing Empericks, that would have been every where up &amp; down, buzzing the peoples heads to their exceeding much greater inconvenience, had this expedient never been found out. True it is there are too too many of them at preſent, and ſo no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion there will always be in ſpight of all the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, that can poſſibly be invented, or honeſt &amp; induſtrious Care that can any ways be uſed to the contrary; but for ought I know there might have been ten times more then there are, and ſure I am, they would have been much more pernicious, becauſe much bolder in their attempts, were it not for ſo witty (though I muſt needs ſay withal overpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) a piece of ſubtilty to give check to their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances. And therefore though we neither ought

            <p>But matters, as to the preſent conſtitution of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, are ſo much altered, and the Scene ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhifted, and changed, from what it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that what through the prevalency of a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical cuſtom, on the one hand, and the Pride and Ambition of ſome few Phyſitians on the other (who by their good Wills would have none live by their profeſſions beſides themſelves) The Controverſie now lies not ſo much between Phyſitians and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, or Phyſitians and any other ſort of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks beſides: as between one Phyſitian and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>I have not forgot my ſelf; what I affirmed e're while, how that the notion amongſt them took almoſt with the ſame haſty ſpeed that it was at firſt propounded.

            <p>There are divers grounds might be ſhewn, for the probability of ſuch an expectation as this, ſome whereof have been a little hinted at, in the former part of this diſcourſe. But that which ſhall be made choice of now in the cloſe of all (ſetting all others aſide) ſhall be taken from no other Topick, then the nature of the thing it ſelf, which if but throughly underſtood, and duly attended to, as it ought to be, will ſtand in little need of any farther enforcements to perſwade to a ſteady beliefe thereof: which to the end it may the more effectually be done, let us a little take notice of the ſtructure, and conſtitution of mans body. I name only the body, becauſe that notwithſtanding the ſoul be to be reckoned as a part of the Man, as well as the body, and that the moſt noble one of the two; yet that being for ſubſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, and ſo not in the leaſt liable to alteration of it ſelf, belongs not at all to our enquiry, but the body only which is the Organ thereof and Subject to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107560:67"/>
ſo frequent changes and alterations does.</p>
            <p>Now Philoſophers, and Phyſitians both; who have been at a great deal of pains to ſearch into the Nature and Original thereof, tell us, and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, that this Body of ours is at firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of the Seed of the Parents, and the Mothers Bloud; how that there being a perfect mixture, and joyning together of the two firſt within the Womb; and from thence the more noble parts having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their delineation, the bloud of the Mother is at length derived to them, which gives Being to the reſt, and augmentation to the whole; and to this latter it is that the <hi>Embryo</hi> owes its farther growth, &amp; accompliſhment till it becomes born into the world.</p>
            <p>After which time the Infant is ſtill ſupported by a continual acceſſion of bloud, as it was formerly; with this only difference; that whereas before it had it from the Mother <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> ready prepared to its hand, it now receives it under the form of nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is it ſelf put to the trouble of ſome farther alterations to bring it to that paſs, as being fitted with Organs and Faculties of its own, ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to that end; which being an opinion not only founded upon reaſon, but apparent even to common ſenſe, and Anatomical obſervation. The truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſince firſt taken up, has never been ſo much as ſcrupled at, or entertained with the leaſt heſitancy, (as there was no reaſon wherefore it ſhould) but paſſed for currant, and unqueſtionable Doctrine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this very day. And this brief account, though it might have been enough to have ſatisfied an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive man in very many things, yet as to all it was not; becauſe ſubſtances being but unactive of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could not be judged capable of the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obſerved to be in them, without ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added qualities to make them ſo: and therefore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107560:68"/>
'twas no more than was neceſſary to fetch one ſtep more, and ſearch out what they were; which having done, they fixed upon theſe two as previous to the reſt, to wit, the natural heat, and radical moiſture; and thereupon builded their concluſions, and from thence deduced their inferences; and the reaſon of this, their proceeding was not altogether without probability: for taking notice of the actual warmth they found to be in moſt living Creatures, and a principle of life to lye concealed in Vegetables; even in the very dead of winter, which came afterwards actually to exert and ſhew forth it ſelf at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring: they were brought to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to conclude upon a certain, innate heat, to be contained in every Particle of the Body of Man, (which they ſay firſt lives the life of a Plant and Beaſt, before it comes to be advanced to the perfection of a reaſonable Creature, and for ever after to retain the ſame qualities and affections incident to them both) and this to be always founded in a radical moiſture, which it lives and preys upon continually; and which in the concluſion, when that comes to be waſted and ſpent, dies together with it for company. Theſe two qualities they ſuppoſed never long to continue in the ſelf ſame plight and condition; but however to be much more exuberant and vigorous in the beginning, than in the latter end of the life of man, but in the middle to ſeem to ſtand at a ſtay, as being ſet at an equal diſtance between either of the extreams; ſo that diſtinguiſhing his years into theſe ſet-periods of time, Childhood or Youth, middle Age, and old Age; there were ſcarce any conſiderable changes incident to humane Bodies which they were not able to ſalve by virtue of this Hypotheſis; and which might not ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reducible to the blending together of theſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107560:68"/>
two qualities diverſly conſidered, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal occaſion thereof.</p>
            <p>Was the Party but now in his blooming years, freſh, and lively, vigorous, and active; as apt to burniſh in bigth, as to encreaſe in ſtature; 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conſtitutive principles, out of which he was at firſt made, were as yet near their Original, which being fabricated out of the pureſt Bloud, and moſt refined Spirits in Natures choiceſt Laboratory, had not as yet fully attained to the utmoſt of their force; but were ſtill in a capacity of exerting their activity more and more, according as the Nutritive Facultie ſhould be diſpoſed to make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Did the ſame Party ſtand at a ſtay; 'twas becauſe this innate heat had arrived to the utmoſt of its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, beyond which it could not paſs, and was able to do no more than keep up thoſe parts in ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it had already under its juriſdiction: and that the moiſture with which it was in conjunction, had arrived to its vertical point alſo. But then, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the winter of our years, was there an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal decay upon the parts of the whole Man? were the Sinews ſtiff, the Senſes dull, the Muſcles dry and ſapleſs; and did every other Inſtrument and Organ of the Body in proportion unto theſe begin to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the execution of the office, for which nature had appointed them? Why there could be no other expected, when the heat and moiſture, that ſhould give vigour, and preſervation to every particular member, had been ſo far waſted and ſpent; and an anſwer taken from that general Topick was looked upon by all as ſatisfactory enough in theſe, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other the like caſes.</p>

And ſo indeed it does in every one of the caſes before put: but becauſe but remotely in the two former, I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed that in the laſt of the three eſtates, which was plainly enough implied in every one of them. For if old age be the immediate harbinger to death, &amp; middle age the forerunner of that; then whatever thruſts forward youth towards a ſtate of middle age; and which yet again haſtens on middle age ſo as to cauſe it to approach to the conditon of old age ſooner than otherwiſe it would, may truly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be ſaid to be the procurer of death to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: and ſo by conſequence, whenever <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> ſhall be made uſe of; unleſs it be over-ballanced with the conſideration of a greater evil, which can be no other than an apprehenſion of the ſame thing upon ſome other account to threaten us at a nearer diſtance: it ought to be looked upon as ſuch; and to have a natural ſource and tendency to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>The force of all, which deductions before ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107560:71"/>
depends ſolely and intirely upon the making out of theſe two following Propoſitions. Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the depriving of the Body of any determinate quantity of bloud whatever, is a never-failing means of ſhortning mans life. And Secondly, that all thoſe ſeveral Ages, into which mans life is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided, are either ſhorter or longer in proportion to the time of his continuance here in this world.</p>
            <p>The latter of which is a <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> as reaſonable to be granted; as that all the parts of the ſame thing collectively taken, ſhould be neither greater nor leſſer than the whole which ariſeth out of them; and that whenever the whole comes to be ſhrunk into a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Volumn than before, the parts ſhould be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abate of their demenſions in a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto. And that whatever it be that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a contraction in the one, ſhould be deemed to have an influence in producing a like effect upon the other at the ſame time, unto each of which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions the more ready aſſent ought to be yielded, becauſe that albeit the whole, and the parts may be called by ſeveral Appellations; yet are they in truth and reality but one and the ſelf-ſame thing. To bring, all which, a little nearer home by a more full and thorough application, It may not be amiſs to caſt our eyes backwards, and obſerve; that in thoſe firſt and primitive times, when Men lived longer upon the Earth, they had each of them their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Youth, middle age, and old age as well as we; but they were much more long and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than now they are. And the parties who had their Lives meaſured by them, were neceſſitated upon that account to make ſo much the longer pauſe before ever they ſtepped over from one eſtate to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Whereas upon the cutting ſhort of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life in general; Theſe ſeveral Periods were
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107560:71"/>
reduced to a much narrower compaſs: and men as they become ſooner ripe, ſo were they the ſooner rotten. And if we ſhall put all this together, 'twill be no <hi>Parodox</hi> to affirm, that whatever ſhall be the cauſe of ſubſtracting from the number of mens years, if derivable from their firſt Principles, ought to be looked upon as the forwarder of them in their whole paſſage between the Cradle and the Grave; but if accidentally befalling them after their Conception, or Birth, then to be judged of, as having the ſame efficacy upon their Lives for the remaining part, as then behind.</p>
            <p>But then as for the former, though it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually true with this, yet is it not altogether ſo perſpicuous in every reſpect, that may deſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for the Proof of that Particular. I ſay in every reſpect, there being two reaſons to be render'd above all others that may ſeem to infer a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for the abbreviating Mens Lives upon the taking away of Bloud univerſally, and in all caſes. The one whereof, though it may haply lye plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the underſtanding of every man; and that at the very firſt Propoſal; yet the other does not, but requires ſomething more of deliberation, and heedful attendance thereto, to make it appear to be ſo.</p>
            <p>That which is ſo very plain and obvious, is taken from the enfeebling and impoveriſhing the whole Maſs, which is obſerved to enſue upon the loſing of Bloud in any wiſe: it being held for a Rule, that the Bloud of ſuch Creatures as receive their growth and nouriſhment thereby, ought to be accounted of as ſo much the more pure and ſprightly, by how much it ſtands placed nearer its Original; but to become, leſs &amp; leſs ſuch in a proportionable manner, according to its greater or leſs departure therefrom.

            <p>The other, from the interruption given thereby, to the act of nouriſhing the Body, which in its regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and due <hi>Oeconomy</hi> ought always to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being the only poſſible means for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heat and moiſture thereof, which are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more liable to decay, and which according to the Principles of the Ancients, are held to be the two main Supporters of humane Life, as we likewiſe have ſuppoſed; but the way and manner by which this comes to be brought about, being of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſomewhat more remote, and likewiſe more intricate to be conceived of. I ſhall for that reaſon take the Liberty of ſteering ſo much the larger a compaſs in order to the explication of it.</p>
            <p>As for example, if the Parents be both health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and their Bloud ſound, then the moſt refined part thereof which is ſeparated from the reſt, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited firſt of all in the Seminal Veſſels, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Womb, for the Production of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Infant, cannot poſſibly miſs of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite conſtitution when coming actually to be made that, which Originally it was deſigned for; and if hapning to meet with ſuch a ſupply of nouriſhment as is every way convenient for it, firſt and laſt; and a concurrence of ſuch other circumſtances as are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107560:72"/>
required over and above thereunto, there is little doubt to be made but that it will have a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proportionable to the exactneſs of its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the ſucceſsfulneſs it has been attended withal in and through its whole courſe; that is to ſay, that that Party to whom ſuch a Body belongs, and ſuch other additional advantages have together fallen in with it, as have hitherto been ſuppoſed, ſhall have a Life produced even to the extremity of old Age.</p>
            <p>Whereas let the Conſtitutive Principles be never ſo well prepared; if the nutriment the Body is to be fed withall, be defective, as to the doing its part; or be the Nutriment never ſo proper; if yet ſome other conditions material to be performed, happen to be omitted, or circumſtances miſapplied, or any external violence to be offered to it; a failure in any one, or more of theſe points, renders all hopes that might have been conceived upon any, or all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther former accounts taken together, utterly void on the other hand, ſhould all other deſirable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have fallen out; and the Seed of the Parents barely to have been faulty, that one deficiency had been enough to have proved a hinderance to all the reſt, and the ſame Perſon, who might otherwiſe have lived long and happily, and enjoyed his health with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any interruption for many years together; is for that only reaſon put quite and clean beſide his Biaſs; and either cut off ſuddenly, or caſt into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition (it may be) beyond all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recovery. Multitudes of Inſtances might be reckonded up for the making good either of theſe Allegations; but that I am neither left to the liberty of giving my ſelf that Scope, (nor ſhould deſire to take it if I were) as being under the choice, as well as obligation of keeping to that one particular incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107560:73"/>
that is occaſioned almoſt in all places, by too immoderate <hi>Phlebotomie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proſecute which matter a little further; and yet withall to bottom our diſcourſe upon no other foundation than what we have been laying hitherto; or rather which indeed has been laid ready to our hands by the obſervations of our Progenitors, in caſe of the good diſpoſition and natural healthfulneſs of the Parents: The Principles derived from them, (being as is to be ſuppoſed) well-furniſhed with a Supply of natural warmth and moiſture; and they again kept in repair by a continual acceſſion of the ſame qualities afforded by the nouriſhment, and influenced by as conſtant an additional heat, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at firſt formation of the Infant in the Mothers Heart, as afterwards in its own, upon the removal of the after-Birth, and breaking off of the Umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Veſſels. The Body upon theſe conſiderations cannot chuſe but be looked upon as a Manſion-Houſe exceeding proper for the Soul to reſide in; and it be but becauſe the ſeveral actions neceſſary to the being and ſupport of humane life, are ſo readily performed there, over what they would have been in an Organ that had been otherwiſe diſpoſed; that is to ſay deſtitute of the qualifications before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by us; to inſtance in particulars. Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and concoction, (I mean not that of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack only, but thoſe more excellent and refined ones which ſucceed it) and ſo nutrition and augmentation are all effected and brought to paſs by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heat and moiſture; and then the nature of Temperament in general; as alſo of the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> that are contained under it, depend very much upon the combination of theſe two qualities one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as Health preſuppoſeth a dueneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, ſo is it, its ſelf, for the moſt part preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a condition unto long life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:107560:73"/>On the contrary, let the Parents happen to be crazie to ſome certain degree (to keep cloſe to our former Suppoſition) and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proceeds from them will be apt to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the Infirmities of their Nature.

            <p>So that notwithſtanding to be healthfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended be a matter of very high importance, and to be adjudged deſervedly as one of the firſt and main ſteps towards the attainment of Long Life, yet it is not all that is required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but as we come into the World one way, and go out again divers, ſo it is poſſible for the beſt Conſtitution that is to miſs of its Ends upon ſeveral accidental accounts (as have been ſhewn before) and miſcarry as undoubtedly as if it were inclined thereto from a Principle within it ſelf.

            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:107560:74"/>Suppoſe we a Perſon of the moſt exact and well framed Temperament of Body that was ever yet produced, and ſuch a one to have been attended on with an Affluence of all other deſirable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatever, there both muſt and will be a perpetual waſting and falling away of the ſeveral parts thereof. Such a mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are we always ſubject unto (even the very beſt of us) from this common State of our Mortality: which loſs is evermore to be repaired and made up again in true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by as conſtant a ſupply of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſumed unto that purpoſe; which Aliment could never be in any Capacity of producing ſuch an Effect, were it not for the Agreement the ſeveral Parts of it have with thoſe of the Body, to which they are to be united; and that not only in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principle of firſt matter; which is one and the ſame to all Bodies in general, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of thoſe two neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo often times before mentioned of Heat and Moiſture. For it is upon the account of that additional and ſuper-added Moiſture that is conveyed unto it by the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Radical is maintained and kept up, which is the ſame for kind with it. And the Primogenial Heat again is as neceſſarily upheld after the ſelf ſame way and manner,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107560:75"/>
according to what has been ſo often repeated heretofore.</p>
            <p>For whether this Aliment ſo aſſumed be to be taken from Bruit Creatures, ſuch as is the Fleſh of Birds, or Beaſts, or Fiſhes; or whether it be to be derived from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, ſuch as have their Riſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Bowels of the Earth. There are both this innate heat and radical moiſture ſtill to be found in the one as well as the other, and they are both evermore carefully preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Nature, under all thoſe preivous Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Alterations the Aliment ſucceſſively paſſes through; till ſuch time as the laſt Act of Nutrition comes to be performed, and the Nouriſhment to be converted into, and made one with the Subſtance of the Body it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all as for that Concoction, that is laboured within the ſtomack, which was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:107560:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>And then again in like manner in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or elſewhere, wherever the Second Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction comes to be performed, and the work of Sanguification wrought, the ſame care is again taken for the Preſervation of them both, as there was before in the Stomack. For ſo we find them in an Eminent Manner to be contained there, and that from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our very ſences themſelves; that the Blood is always warm ſo long as Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains within the Body; the Senſe of Feeling is ſufficient to inform us, and that it is moiſt as well as hot, is over and above made clear to us by the diſcerning of the Sight.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the third and laſt place, when that great and Subſtantial Exchange comes to be made, there is not the leſt doubt but that the ſame Qualities are withheld ſtill. It being very improbable that Nature ſhould preſerve them thus charily all this while, to part with them at a Seaſon when they were likely to be of the greateſt uſefulneſs of all to her: and if we enquire into the Nature of this Cambium the immediate matter (ſay ſome) out of which the Reſtauration of the Body is to be made, we ſhall always obſerve it held forth and expreſſed by ſuch Names and Appellations as do plainly enough inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the ſame things unto us.</p>
            <p>And thus by this means are we arrived to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107560:76"/>
an eaſy way of expounding what is meant by that ſo perpetual waſting of the radical moiſture in the Body of Man, (ſo much talked of) and the repairing it again by an Additional Supply that was with the ſame Conſtancie afforded it; as likewiſe to a clear Underſtanding of the great Prejudice that is done to humane Bodies by deprieving them of the Matter out of which this Supplement is only to be made. 'Tis the Humidity of the Aliment received, that makes amends for the Loſs ſuſtained upon the other Account; and put but a ſtop to that, and the firſt Stock waſts amain; as we ſee evidently in a little bodily Sickneſs, (where for want of this wonted Supply of Nouriſhment, Nature not being then at leaſure to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as being called upon to a far more neceſſary work of fighting with the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) how ſtrangely will the Members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come emaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That Perſon who has a ſtanding Revenue and other Additional Helps, amounting to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an equal value with that, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying of his neceſſary Charge, may yet haply be put upon ſuch Expences as ſhall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107560:76"/>
exceed them both together, and ſo be left una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably liable to a declining in his Eſtate. But now if this Superadded Income happen totally to be Suſpended, then that waſting which was but ſlow, and as it were inſenſible, though ſure enough before, will now become quick and manifeſt; becauſe the one main means that gave check to its Progreſs is ſuppoſed to be taken away.</p>
            <p>Which very ſame thing is yet further illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that comon Inſtance given of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lamp, which from the time of its firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, to that of its final exſtinguiſhment, may well be ſaid to have a continual Tendency and Motion to its laſt End. But then if other ſupplimental Oyl of a much more groſs and impure Subſtance, ſuch as is indeed through the greatneſs of its Alay, unable to gender any Flame of its ſelf at all, ſhall happen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to be poured in, as the other is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be drawn off, though it can never maintain a burning to perpetuity, yet will it however by Contributing ſomething of an oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subſtance to be joyned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107560:77"/>
this wonted Contribution, though but for a while, the pure Oyl will moſt undoubtedly blaze out the faſter for lack thereof, and there ought to be a proportianoble abatement made upon the Account of the whole durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the Interruption that has been given by that Occaſional Intermiſſion let it happen to have fallen out when ere it will.</p>
            <p>There is a certain Stock of Radical Moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to be obſerved within the Body of every man, which defuſes it ſelf thoroughout each minute particle thereof, and without which 'tis impoſſible for any due Temperament long to be preſerved; or for the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be held in a State of Conjunction one with another: This Moiſture is ſuppoſed to be perpetually ſubject to decay, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a double account; <hi>Firſt</hi> as being prey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d alſo; but the Blood of Man is either the Immediate Matter, or at leaſt wiſe the Matter but once removed, out of which the Parts ſo decaying, are all to be framed a new, and the Heat and Moiſture which we have proved to be the inſeperable Concomitants of the Blood, are the ſame for kind, though not for Purity, with the Innate and Radical, that are Seated in the ſeveral
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107560:77"/>
Parts of the Body. And 'tis only from the Addition of them, as we have been ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and in a manner enforced ſo very long to inſiſt upon the Proof of, becauſe a Point ſo exceeding neceſſary to be thorowly underſtood that the Primogenial are upheld. And therefore when ever it ſo falls out, that any ſtop ſhall be put to the Continuation of the Act of Nutrition (as tis very improbable but that there ſhould be ſome, when ere the Blood out of which this Aid is only to be afforded, comes, though but in Part, to be Subtracted and taken away) thoſe Parts of the Body, which both might and ought to have been recruted thereby, will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be deprived for ſome time, at leaſtwiſe, of ſuch a Proportion of Heat and Moiſture as had been realy communicated unto them, had this hinderance never been; becauſe, as goes the Subſtance, ſo in like manner goes the Accident; they live and die, riſe and fall together: and when ever the one is withheld the other of Courſe will unavoidably be kept back alſo; and though it ſhould happly be but for a time, that very Conceſſion alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our purpoſe; becauſe, according to the Inſtances alledged, the two Original Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities before mentioned, muſt, for lack of ſuch wonted Acceſſions, be left under a neceſſity of ſo much the greater waſting and decay;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107560:78"/>
and as a conſequent of that their final Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, be ſo much the nearer its Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Forces, when united into one, as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be the ſtronger, ſo are they upon that Account the better inabled to withſtand any foreign Violence that ſhall at any time be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt them; and not only ſo, but to hold out ſo much the longer againſt their own natural Principles, inclining them to a Diſſolution. And therefore if thoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which from time to time have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly relieved (if not intended) by an Additional Supplie of others of like Virtues with themſelves, come once to fail of the Supporte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if any ſhall be ſo perverſe, as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to maintain, that they can diſcern little reaſon, wherefore to conclude a Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the act of Nutrition, becauſe ſome few ounces of Blood have been drained from the whole Maſs; the abatement of ſo ſmall a Quantity being very inconſiderable, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the total ſum, perchance not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting, upon a due Eſtimate, in the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> Ounces thereof, to the proportion of above one, to one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

            <p>And ſhould they proceed further to urge, as an enforcement of the Belief of this their Opinion, the different Quantities of Blood, and extream latitude, as to that one particular, that is to be diſcerned amongſt ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as extending, according to the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome, who pretend to be curious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that enquiry, to upwards of a <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>forty</hi> Ounces; And ſo upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hold it but reaſonable to inferr, that what ever Quantity ſhall be ſuppoſed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the juſt ſtandard of ſuch a Proportion, as ought to ſuffice for the competent Support of Mens Bodies, and a convenient tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the humours thereof from one Part to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, deſerves to be looked upon under no other Notion, than as a timely Proviſion, laid up in Store by Nature, againſt all ſuch accidental loſſes of the ſame, as, by ſome Caſualities or other, might happen for the future to fall out.</p>

That Blood that ſhall be adjudged conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the repair and maintainance of thoſe larger parts, ought to be exhibited in ſomewhat a more plentiful and free man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than to thoſe others that are leſs, and then what becomes of all thoſe Redundances and Superfluities that according to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are ſo much relied on?</p>
            <p>Beſides, humane Bodies are known to differ as well in point of Temperament, as they do in bigth and tallneſs: upon which account there are incommunicable Degrees of Heat and Cold, aſcribed by the Learned to either Sex.

What hinders but that the ſeveral individuals, comprehended under ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, may in a due meaſure and in ſome
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107560:80"/>
leſs Proportion be removed from one another likewiſe, and then the as different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that unadvoidably fall in with, and are appendant to the ſuppoſal of theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Qualities, that is to ſay, as conſidered in a more remiſs or intenſe Degree, are neither hard to conceive, nor yet difficult to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. Becauſe there is nothing either more or leſs to be found in them, than what is occaſioned by Principles apt enough to produce ſuch Effects by way of Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality. And ſo according to the Rules of common Diſcourſe, and ordinary Reaſoning, what can be more neceſſarily concluded, than that all ſuch as are of a Blith and Spritely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhould require of Courſe a great deal more of Blood, and Spirits for the ſupporting it, than others which are dull, and lazy, and Phlegmatick, for the maintainance of theirs; in regard they are put to a much greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof every moment of their Lives than the others are. It faring with the one as with the Earth in <hi>Summer.</hi> At what time let the Clouds gather together never ſo faſt, and the Water deſcend upon it, in almoſt never ſo great abundance, 'tis forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with returned back again in Vapour and Exhalation; and unleſs it may for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy have its wants ſupplied, with freſh and repeated Showers, will unadvoidably in

a very little while become ſcorched and burnt up.</p>
            <p>But with the others as with the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the depth and dead of <hi>Winter,</hi> when there neither is, nor can be the ſame avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of its moiſture, becauſe, that heat, which ſhould alone work its removal, is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abated, over what it was wont to be at the other Seaſon of the Year, all things are not the ſame to all men; and if that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ſeem overſtrange to any, it will be leſs ſo, if we do but conſider, that all men are not the ſame neither to themſelves, but vary and change Conditions almoſt as often as the <hi>Moon</hi> does Shapes, to day appearing in one Humour, and to morrow in another; and as Rivers are called by the ſame Names, by way of <hi>Analogy</hi> only, when the Waters out of which they are conſtituted are hourly freſh and new, ſo may the ſame thing in ſome qualified Senſe be verified of mens Bodies too.</p>
            <p>So that to reſume our former Debate, there is no great Queſtion to be made, but that as every Body is fitted with particular Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Organs, ſuch as may be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for its uſe, and compoſed of ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as may bare a Proportion to the whole; ſo likewiſe, with ſuch Supplies of Blood and Nouriſhment, as are every way agreeable to

its Temper. And the <hi>Sanguine</hi> and the <hi>Cholerick,</hi> the <hi>Melancholick</hi> and the <hi>Flegmatick,</hi> have each of them ſuch allowances as ſuit beſt with their ſeveral Conſtitutions; and then if the Quantities of Blood that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be in each of them be not alike, ſo (if the matter were well enquired into) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance neither is there Temperament; and to the Diſſimilitude of the one, may very well be aſcribed the Inequality of the other. And then upon either or both theſe Accounts, taken jointly or ſeverally (as the matter may ſeem to require) there may be grounds ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſhown for the producing a Reaſon, for whatever common Experience informs us of as touching the preſent enquiry; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flying to meer Poſſibilities, Contig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ties, things which indeed may, but perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will fall out, of which more anon: But ſuppoſe they ſhould both fail and be rejected as unſatisfactory, and that nothing of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect proof could be made out from either of them, that is to ſay, that neither the Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of mens Bodies, nor yet the Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of their Tempers ought to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of as any Cauſe at all, for the furniſhing them with ſuch various Supplies of Blood as we uſually find they have; which yet to me appeares plain and reaſonable enough; and ſo 'tis like it may do to many others beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:107560:82"/>
I do not ſee however, upon what Imaginary grounds, or colourable pretence, this laying up Proviſions againſt future Caſualities, can poſſible be made uſe of as an Argument of any Force at all to evince it; that being neither conſiſtent with the uſual Methods of Nature in other like Caſes, not yet with thoſe commonly received Notions that are vulgarly delivered concerning her; ſuch as are acting Neceſſarily and Perfectly; her intending but one thing at a time, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in vain.</p>
            <p>Whereas according to this Hypotheſis, ſhe would be taken up about the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Matters purely contingent, as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Will of a meer voluntary Agent; and that ofttimes, ſuch a one as is determined in his Reſolutions, not by the Dictates of right Reaſon as he ought, but it may be by chance or Fancy, or ſomething worſe than either.</p>
            <p>And can any be ſo vain as to think, that ſo perfect an Agent ſhould ever buſy her ſelf in doing things at all adventures; as when She makes ſuch ſolemn Preparations for humane Bodies in general in all Ages paſt, that were to be made uſe of but in ours, or in times not long preceeding them, or but in ſome parts of the World only; and thoſe ſo very inconſiderable in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon

of the whole; for as for ſuch wounds and effuſion of Blood, as are occaſioned by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Tumults and publick Calamities of War; thoſe though too too frequent, are yet nothing at all, if compared with thoſe preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated ones, which happen in time of Peace, and beſides they likewiſe depend upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples altogether as uncertain.</p>
            <p>Much leſs can ſhe be ſuppoſed to act, in a Contradiction to her own purpoſes, at the ſame time, as ſhe muſt unavoidably do, in caſe this Method were to be admitted; her common intendment being believed, and that with reaſon enough, to be the Welfare and Preſervation of humane Bodies in the groſs, and yet this would be the ready way to ruin and deſtroy them; for nothing elſe can be the true meaning of this hoarding up of ſuch Superfluities of Blood, as the Abetters of this Opinion muſt neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which let be in what Quantity it will, if more than is at preſent ſufficient, cannot well be imagined but by its rankneſs and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcenty, to breed ſomething of anoyance to thoſe Bodies, it ſhall be beſtowed upon; there being commonly as many Miſchiefs fall out, ariſing from the Exceſſes, as the Deficiencies of things, in almoſt all Caſes that can be inſtanced in; but however moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in this, as might be made appear evi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dently

               </gap> the direct Courſe, Nature Steers in the Proviſions ſhe is wont to make about Matters of this kind, is ſuch as may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with her Deſignations as ſhe is a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Agent, and whatever reaches not up to that one Standard of being univerſal, falls as much Short of being Natural: and that may ſerve as a Direction to Judge by, what ought to be accounted of, as Natural, and what not. The whole World as conſidered in its univerſal Extent, is the adequate Object of Natures Care, and the Preſervation, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, is chiefly and in the firſt place intended by her, as is atteſted among other Experiments, more eſpecially by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one, ſo much taken notice of by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers; to wit, her great Solicitouſneſs about the recording a Vanity, which, rather than it ſhall be permitted, what ever particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings happen to be near hand, where ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is attempted; they are all to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd in to give their attendance, upon that one common Cauſe; and if need require, put upon it, to ſuffer in its Reſcue.</p>
            <p>But the World, as taken in that Senſe, is
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107560:83"/>
too complicated a thing, not to call for a more particular Regard, made up of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of Creatures contained in it; as they again of Individuals comprehended under them: and 'tis the good of thoſe divers Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Nature, in the Second place, is wont to be concerned for: and below that Degree of Univerſality, never vouchſafes to Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend: 'tis true indeed, Univerſals are all founded in Particulars, and can have no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, not ſo much as that which is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but by their means; and that common Influence beſtowed upon the World in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, could never reach the affect it was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, did it not firſt light in a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner upon them; but that being not intended at all for their Sakes, under the Strict Formality of their being Singular; but upon the Account of that one common Agreement, in which they all meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center; what is one way applied, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be looked upon as otherwiſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to wit, for the Benefit and Advantage of the whole Community, without any reſpect at all had, to this or that individual Perſon or thing; and that it is, to which way ſoever we caſt our Eyes upon the works of the whole Creation; there may be, and are, from each Degree amongſt them, Pregnant Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces afforded us; let us take a view of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

Bodies, Vegetables, and bruit Creatures, as they ſtand divided into their ſeveral Ranks and Orders, and they will be found to have one common Nature, in which they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, and upon the account of which, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals belonging to each of them, are at an exact Harmony and Agreement one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. From thence it is, that they all of them partake of the ſame outward Form and Portraicture, ſo that it is an eaſy matter at the very firſt appearance to diſtinguiſh one kind from another, and to refer each of them in particular to their own proper Claſs: from thence it is, that their whole Structure, Make and Compoſition, when ever ſearched into, admitts of ſo true a Proportion, and that the Actions and Operations proceeding from their Inward Principles, come ſo Univerſally to agree; how elſe could it ever be poſſible for the Trees of the ſame kind to bud, bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and bring forth their Fruits together, and all after the ſame likeneſs, and ſimilitude, were it not for this univerſal Concourſe of Nature; and how elſe could they be Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to keep Time, and Pace, and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo exactly in every thing they do, but that there is a ſecret and common Influence imparted unto each of them; and the like may be ſaid of each and every particular thing, that can be pitched upon in the whole
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107560:84"/>
Creation; 'tis but reducing it to its own Species, and then it will be found to agree with all other particulars of that kind, beſides it ſelf in its Shape, Tendency and Operations. And 'tis the Preſervation of that Conſent; and the maintainance of that common Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Nature alwayes aimes at in what ſhe propounds to her ſelf; and ſo that may but be kept up, no matter what becomes of the ſeveral Individuals contributing thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they may all periſh and moulder away ſucceſſively, as we ſee they do; and yet the other, for all that be upheld to perpetuity.</p>
            <p>And look what may be affirmed of other ſorts of Creatures up and down in the World, the ſame doubtleſs holds proportionably true in Mankind as well as the reſt. And ſo all Perſons that partake of the ſame common Principles, will not fail to ſhare in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the ſame common Effects; the Faculties of their Souls, and the Affections of their Bodies will be univerſally the ſame, and the ſeveral Parts and Members which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the making up of the Outward Man, will be ſure to have all the ſame Habitudes and mutual Reſpects one towards another: and wherever this Order ceaſes to be found, ſuch Productions are to be accounted of, no longer Natural, but Monſtrous. The <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician,</hi> having once gained the Dimenſions
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107560:85"/>
of <hi>Herculus</hi> his Foot, was at no loſs at all to find out the Complement of his whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; becauſe of the Natural ſymmetry of Parts that was to be ſuppoſed in them, even from the greateſt to the leaſt: ſo that if he know but how to calculate truely, there was no poſſible danger of being miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in raiſing any falſe Concluſions.</p>
            <p>But if an exact Harmony be to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in matters of leſs Moment, then why not in ſo material a thing, as that a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Blood ſhould be allowed to every individual Perſon; and if nothing can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural but what implies a Univerſality, to wit, one common Conſent and Agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Individuals belonging to the ſame kind; and if there be no greater Reaſon for an Exceſs of Blood to be provided for all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies in General, than a Deficiency, as in Truth there is none, then the meaneſt Skill in <hi>Logick</hi> that is, will teach us to infer a Mediocrity; and what may moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſuite with each Mans particular Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, State and Diſpoſition: for an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they muſt of neceſſity concur in; and it being once granted, that there was no more than what was ſufficient, before ſuch Act of <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> it follows by a direct and clear Conſequence, that there muſt be leſs, ſo ſoon as ever that comes to be performed; and ſo

muſt needs continue to be, till ſuch time that loſs ſhall ſome way or other be recruited; which before it can be done, how many and great Inconveniences, may be apt upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Occaſions to happen out, I leave to each Mans particular Judgement to determine; and that ſerves fully enough to evince what has been ſo long contended for; to wit, that the taking away any determinate Quantity of Blood whatever, muſt unavoidably infer ſome Prejudice to be done to the Party ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it; ſome very few Caſes excepted; becauſe, he has it not now in the exact Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity allotted him by Nature, which is ſeldom, or never out in the meaſures ſhe takes, and as ſhe rarely failes in the ſhaping a Hand, or a Foot, ſo as to make it either too big, or too little, for the Body to which it belongs; ſo no doubt is ſhe as little to ſeek in the apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other matters of an equal Concernment with them, when ever left to be diſpoſed of by her.

            <p>For, what elſe is Nature, but the directive Power of Almighty God in his Government of the World, which therefore may be ſaid to act regularly, becauſe rationally; but in all rational purpoſes, matters of Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are to yield and give way to thoſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, the chiefeſt Good, in caſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petion, and where both cannot be attained at the ſame time, is evermore to be preferred; and the greateſt evil as conſtantly to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there muſt one be ſubmitted to; but if we ſhall diligently compare theſe two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nouriſhing the Body, and Circulation of the Blood one with another, we ſhall find upon due Examination had, the latter to be much the more neceſſary of the two, and conſequently the other to be ſuſpended for ſome time, when ever they happen to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent together, which will be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as often as <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> ſhall be made uſe of: becauſe a convenient Quantity, and no more, as has been ſufficiently proved, being
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107560:86"/>
to be allowed to every man in that Eſtate Nature has aſſigned him, when ever that Proportion comes to be abated of, ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to uſe her utmoſt endeavours, for the reproducing it with what poſſible Speed ſhe can, and then for her to augment and waſt it at the ſame time, to part with as great a Quantity thereof, about the repaires of the Body, as ſhe was wont formerly, and yet forthwith to make an amends for this other accidental Loſs, that is ſuppoſed to happen over and above, eſpecially when the other might very well be looked upon as a task ſufficient (in Perſons already paſt their beſt, and now in a waining Condition, to be ſure it is) is a matter ſomewhat difficult to comprehend.</p>
            <p>At other times, and upon other Occaſions not altogether unlike to this, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt has been between this very Act of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and a Good, confeſſedly greater than it ſelf, that it has been reſpited for a while, appears evidently enough in the Inſtance of Sickneſs before obſerved; where the Life of Man is ſuppoſed to be brought in Jeopardy, but that the Life of man is no leſs concerned, upon a Stoppage put to the Circulation of the Blood, is every whit as clear, for what matter of greater Importance to the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Suſtentation of Humane Life, can
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107560:87"/>
there poſſibly be aſſigned, than is the free Motion and Tranſportation of the Blood and Spirits from one part of the Body to the other: 'tis equivalent to the very Action of breathing it ſelf, which all agree upon to be a thing of exceeding great moment; nay in ſome Senſe to be eſteemed of before it: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſible for Life to be ſupported without the one, as we ſee it is in all Children before their Births, and in ſome Divers, beyond the <hi>Seas,</hi> if the Teſtimony of Travellers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that point, be any thing to be heeded, but never in any wiſe without the other; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that at what time ſoever the Heart and Arteries forbear to beat, the Body is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, from that very moment, to forbear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer to live, but even to expire and die away together with their Motion.</p>
            <p>A further Illuſtration of the truth of the ſame matter, diſcovers it ſelf to our almoſt every Dayes Experience, were we but at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to give heed thereto as we ought; in each common Diarrhea, or Looſeneſs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in which the Strength failes, and the Fleſh abates immediately, upon the breaking out of that Diſtemper, which ſurely can be for no other reaſon but this, the Nouriſhment now becoming ſlippery, and not making a ſtay long enough either in the Stomack or Bowels, ſo as to be able to impart of its alible
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107560:87"/>
Juice to the whole maſs of Blood as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Blood thereupon forbears ſending any further Supplies to the ſeveral Parts of the Body, till ſuch time as the wonted order comes again to be obſerved; not that the Blood can ever be ſuppoſed to be endued with a Faculty of Diſcerning between good and evil, or made to be any way capable of the foreſight of an Inconvenience to enſue upon the parting with its own Stock, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good Security taken for having more laid in the room of it; But what though it ſhould not? Nature takes care of all beings alike, and beſtowes Inſtincts and Directions where higher Faculties are wanting, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral good and uſeful purpoſes; and then 'tis all one upon the matter, as if it ſelf were; upon whoſe account it is, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Lillies</hi> of the Field, though they neither Weave nor Spin, come to be decked as Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, and arrayed in as goodly a Sort as any of thoſe Creatures that have Wit and Contrivance allowed them for the procuring of their own Apparrel; In alluſion to which Oeconomy and over-ruling Power of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are we accuſtomed to ſay, in common Diſcourſe, upon our taking Cold at any time, after the leaving off a Garment, or being more thinly clad than uſual, that the parts ſo deprieved of their wonted Covering ſtill
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107560:88"/>
looked for, and expected a Continuance of what they had had before; whereas in ſtrict propriety of Speech, to expect and look for, are Acts too high and noble to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſuch inferiour Inſtruments, as are the Limbs and Out-parts of the Body. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Nature is ſuppoſed to bear ſo great a Hand and Sway over them, ſo as to furniſh them with Diſpoſitions, Habitudes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, in a word to have the Guidance of them in many reſpects, much after the ſame manner that an Arrow is directed to the Mark, or a <hi>Ship</hi> Steered towards the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: ſuch Expreſſions are aptly enough ſuited to the Nature of the things they are deſigned for, and apprehended by ſuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe or have them without any Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all.</p>

The Graſs of the Field increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily at almoſt every ſeaſon of the Year, and the Bodys of Vegitables and Living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, till ſuch time they arrive at their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect growth, are inceſſantly paſſing from a leſs Eſtate unto a greater, and yet who the moſt ſharp ſighted amongſt you, can pretend to an Infallibility of Judging the Senſible Alterations wrought either in the one or the other; and the very ſame Proportion holds in the Determination of moſt things that is obſervable in their Increaſe; 'tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed indeed, that after ſome Pauſe made, and Competenty of time taken, to make a compariſon between the things themſelves, 'tis very poſſible to make a due Eſtimate of what may have happened, but that is not ſo much the Queſtion in debate; 'tis the ſhortneſs of time, and the ſmalneſs of the Change wrought in it, which alone creates the Difficulty; and ſo again, there are many things which as to common Appearance have not their Affects at preſent, and which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

act at a very great Diſtance of time in the producing them, which yet are ſo far from diſerving to be ſlighted, upon the ſcore of the inſenſibleneſs of their approach; that on the contrary, they may ſeem rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſo much the greater Portion of our care to be taken, in the better providing and cautioning our ſelves againſt them: the Venome of ſome Beaſts, how ſlowly, and as it were with deliberation does it ſteal, and inſinuate it ſelf into the Bodies of ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as have at any time been wounded by them; till at laſt, it comes to take a full Poſſeſſion of the whole Maſs of Blood, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits, and brake forth to open Acts of Violence: and yet all the while it hath layn thus dormant, may truely be ſaid to have as great an Aptitude to deſtroy, as any the moſt deadly Draught of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> or <hi>Ratsbane</hi>: and the neglect of ſome inconſiderable Breach, when it ſhould have been Repaired; how does it in time, occaſion Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the whole Building.</p>
            <p>Herein lies the great Fallacy, which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple People are wont to put upon themſelves; they live a Life of Senſe, rather than Reaſon, or indeed, Fancy rather than Senſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they don't take notice of any preſent Alterations, that may have happened; are the more inclinable to think, that therefore
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107560:90"/>
there have been none at all; and becauſe they believe, there have been none for the preſent; are ready to conclude, that therefore there wil be none for time to come; and all this proceeds from no other grounds, than want of Judgement, and Foreſight; and ſo being unable, to determine their own Thoughts, by any Solidity of Argument, they are able to make out themſelves; are the ſooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon, by Cuſtom and Example, to do as others would have them; and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer themſelves, to be gulled and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Lives and Healths, only to gratify the humour of the next impertinent Talker, that either comes in their way, or they ſend for to adviſe withal; who, ſo he can but enjoy the delicious Sweets, of having things done after his own way; cares not (it may be) what Miſchiefs betides thoſe Perſons, upon whoſe Bodies the Experiment comes to be made trial of; which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I could wiſh every one that ſhall have Occaſion at any time to be concerned therein, would a little ſeriouſly conſider of.</p>
            <p>I did ſay before, that in caſe of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſome great danger, nigh or afar off; which yet could be no other, than that of Death it ſelf, or ſome painful, or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Diſeaſe, that might be the <hi>Harbinger</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:107560:90"/>
thereto; this was a way, that both might, and ought to be ſubmitted unto; as upon the Compariſon between two evils, the leſs is alwayes to be choſen, becauſe in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Senſe, it ought to be conceived of, under the Notion of a good: and ſo may this alſo, though in it ſelf, it be no other than a direct means, to abreviate the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of mens Dayes, and abridge the Period of their Lives, by Natures Bounty appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; as has been manifeſted at large.</p>
            <p>And though divers are of Opinion, that many after Bleeding, have been much more lively, and vigorous; as alſo far more fat and corpulent, than ever they were before; which may ſeem, to be an Argument of force, to render Invalid, what has hitherto been contended for: let it be but taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that all Opinions, that have the good hap to be credited, have not alwayes Truth on their ſide; and if it were ſo, there would not be ſo many vulgar Miſtakes, as uſually we find there are; and though it ſhould fall out, for ſome interval of time, to be as is pretended; yet that would evince but little, it being obſervable, for ſome lucid Interval to happen, even in the moſt cloudy Dayes, and ſome little Lightning (as they call it) that may be taken notice of, before
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107560:91"/>
the approach of Death it ſelf; which as it can be no ſure mark, to judge the State of the Sick Party by; ſo neither is it ſo much to be attended to, how Patients find themſelves for a little Space after they have been let Blood; as what the conſtant Tenour and Condition of their Health, in its full latitude, from that time forward, is commonly taken to be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ram</hi> may give ground, but it is with no other purpoſe, than to make head again with ſo much the greater Fury. And Bodily paines, as we find by daily Experience, upon the taking of ſome Medicines, have appeared to be prety well appeaſed; which yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, have broken out again, more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ever. The Sprigs that are pared from off the Body of the Tree, at ſome Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year, if but pricked into the Earth, will make a ſhew to bud and bloſſome, as fairly to the Eye, if not fairer, than thoſe Boughs that have been let alone; but every one is able to give a gueſs, at the different e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the one is like to have from the other; who has but Reaſon to conſider, from whence it is, that the cauſe of this their Flouriſhing proceedeth: what is deferred, is not for that reaſon, to be looked upon, as quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; and an account may be ballanc'd by ſums brought in as well at the Rere, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107560:91"/>
the Beginning: and further, as touching that ſubſequent Fatneſs, which appears to ſome, to have been occaſioned upon the ſcore of <hi>Phlebotomy</hi>: 'tis to be noted, that there is a puffing, and ſwelling up of the Body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much different from a ſolid, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Nutriment; and though it ſhould realy prove to be ſuch as is ſuppoſed, there is no Queſtion at all to be made, but that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtrict Examination of the Matter, a Cauſe might very well have been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the Rules and Principles of Phyſick, wherefore to have warranted, a juſt taking away of Blood in ſuch a Caſe as that was; which has conſtantly been alledged of by us. And therefore nothing can ever be inferred, from what has hitherto been allayed, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Oppoſition againſt any ſuch manner of Proceedings, but what tends much rather to the juſt Vindication of them: it being the raſh, heady, and precipitate manner of doing the thing, that we have been endeavouring all this while to expoſe, not Blood letting in General, but letting Blood without a Cauſe, and without taking time to conſider, whether it were fitting to be done or not.</p>
            <p>'Tis neither Abſurdity, nor Contradiction, to condemn the uſe of the ſame Remedies in ſome, and approve of them in others, becauſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107560:92"/>
the moſt general Rules that are, are by no means to paſs unlimited; and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when different, ſtand evermore in need of as different a manner of Application. So that what is hurtful in one caſe, may be profitable in another; as we find Opium and ſtrong Waters, to be of a ſingular uſe, when applied ſeaſonably, and with care; and yet the one is known, to be no other than a rank Poyſon, is conſidered in its own Nature; and the other the worſt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to the digeſting Faculty of the Stomack: and ſo though the lopping off of a Limb, from the Body of a man, be a moſt pernicious thing, and tends apparently to the bane and ruine of that Party, upon whom ſuch Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty ſhall be exerciſed; no one ever doubted it. Yet, when a Part ſhall become morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, and ſeizſed on by a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> then 'tis ſo far from being accounted ſo; that the diſmembring the man, is one of the higheſt Acts of Charity, that can poſſibly be ſhewn him; becauſe the greatneſs of the Danger, legitimates the deſperateneſs of the Cure: and indeed, unleſs it be in caſe of Apparent danger, a hazardous Medicine, ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be put in practice, leſt the Miſchiefs that acrue thereby, ſhould prove greater than the Advantage. There is a Rule of Proportion evermore to be obſerved in ſuch
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107560:92"/>
things: and 'tis not the leaſt part of the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> Office, to ſhew himſelf well skil'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and I ſee no reaſon, but that a <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon,</hi> may as well cut a man for the Stone, when he has never an one in his Bladder; or when he is ſent to dreſs a cut Finger, or heal a broken Shin, whip off Peoples Arms, or Legs, without further Deliberation: as a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> in many Caſes, that might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (I don't ſay, in all) be dabling with their Blood: the latter being as probable a way, for the doing of their Buſineſs, as the former, though ('tis to be confeſſed) not altogether ſo courſe, and paineful; as 'tis the ſame thing in ſome Senſe; whether one be ſmothered to death between Down Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or tortured upon the Wrack; 'tis but a being done to death, either way. And yet there are too many in the World, who are as brisk and flippant at it, as if it were a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pure Indifferency in it ſelf, and left to their ſole Power, to inſtitute how far forth it might be conveniently made uſe of, that is to ſay, that it might be lawful only for them to have recourſe thereto; ſo oft as the freak took them on the Head, or they had a Mind to have their own turnes ſerved by it.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Sir,</hi> having thus liberally para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſed upon the Preſumptions of my own
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107560:93"/>
moddling. I am in the next place to render an account, what the Opinions of others may have been upon the very ſame Caſe; which when I have faithfully given in, and made ſome brief Inquiries thereupon, it muſt be left to the Deciſion of ſuch as are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to paſs Sentence upon the Criminate; and declare at whoſe Door eſpecially, the ill Management of the affair ought to be laid; for that there was an Errour committed by ſome body, is not in the leaſt to be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled at: that being a Conſequence, plainly enough deducible from the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us both; and want of Diſcretion, is a term of the ſmalleſt Denomination, it can poſſibly be reduced to; becauſe upon a full hearing of the matter, as what had been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred before his coming; examination of of the Pulſe, Urine, and ſuch other like Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, neceſſary to be known; we both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned our Opinions freely, and without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitancy, that we ſaw no reaſon at all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make doubt of her Recovery: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the Event falling out quite contrary, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the immediate change of her Medicines, the Fault (I ſay) muſt be rather his, than mine; becauſe altered by his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome of them, againſt my likeing; ſo that, if there were ſo good hopes, of her Recovery before his coming, to meddle with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107560:93"/>
her: 'tis ſtrongly to be preſumed, ſhe might have continued in the ſame probable way ſtill, had he but kept away; and this, I take to be, a fair and a honeſt Plea, in order to my own Acquittal; let others, clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they can: I know but one thing, poſſible to be objected againſt it; which has I confeſs been urged by ſome, in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly way, who have been pleaſed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves, in the Controverſy: That it is a Quality, not at all to be diſliked of, in a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> to be making the beſt of another Mans Practice; neither do I ſay, it is; only I muſt crave leave, to ſtart a new Query: Whence it ſhould come to paſs, that he, whoſe Life was never at any time remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for either the leaſt ray of Grace, or good Nature, ſhould become thus tranſcendently charitable, all upon the puſh; ſo as to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to remove a Thorn, out of another mans Finger, and place it in his own? I ſhould think an Action of that Nature, to have proceeded much rather from Incogitancy, and want of Foreſight; (either of which are unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blemiſhes in ſo great a <hi>Phyſitian</hi>) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, when he perceived it begin to prick, and feſter, he was ſo very induſtrous, to have reſtored it back again; but then 'twas a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too late, I thank him: And though it might have been ſeaſonable enough for his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107560:94"/>
purpoſe, was never a whit for mine; and therefore, I am not at all ingaged, to give my aſſent to it: he, who abſolves at one time, can never condemn at another, for the ſame thing, though he has never ſo great a mind to do it, without running himſelf upon a Contradiction. Poor <hi>Dr. Willis</hi> could not, he knew it well enough, when it ſuited with his own Intereſt; elſe he had never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Liberty he did, in playing upon him; though with ſhame enough, conſidering what a Friend he had been to him, he knows where and when, and ſo do others too: and that may be ſufficient, to ſtop the mouth of one, that is not utterly forſaken of all modeſt Principles; but if it ſhould not, and that he ſhould ſtill believe himſelf, to have the Freedom indulged him, of ſaying and unſaying what ever he judges convenient for his own Deſigns, purely, becauſe he has to do with a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> who has his dwelling in the Country. I could put him in mind of a true Story, by which it might be made to appear, that there has been a time before now, when he and I have been of different Opinions, and that when the truth happened to be of my ſide too; and if it were ſo then, why not as well now; but that I am upon my own Juſtification; and 'tis a Paſſage ſo full of Conviction, ſo pertinent to the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107560:94"/>
and ſo exactly fitted to the taking down of a proud Stomack; I ſhould be aſhamed to mention it. It happened ſome Years ſince, that he was ſent into <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> to viſit a Gentleman of a good Family, who lay ſick there; and ſuch a repute had he gained, from <hi>Willis</hi> his Commendations, that as full a Belief, was reſigned up to his unerring Judgement (as they thought) as ſome are wont to allow in Spirituals, to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the moſt Ghoſtly Father; nor was he leſs willing to aſſume, than they to be impoſed upon; inſomuch, that after a very ſhort ſumming up of the Evidence, and there upon perceiving his Caſe to be wholly deſperate, he bids them neither to flatter, nor deceive themſelves with a vain Expectation of what could never be; for that 'twas as impoſſible for him, to eſcape the fatal ſtroke of approaching Death, as for one upon whom the Plague Tokens had already broke forth; and that what he had foretold them, would as undoubtedly come to paſs, as the ſetting of the Sun that night, or the riſing of it the next morning, or in words to that effect. And as if this had not been, to have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ridiculous enough, with the ſame falſe confidence he returns home (and as I have been credibly informed) makes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit of the ſame things, in one of the Courts
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107560:95"/>
of Judicature in <hi>Weſtminiſter</hi> Hall; though the chief grounds he had for his ſo doing, to the beſt of my Remembrance, was taken from the ſpitting up of ſome ſmall Quantity of Blood, I imagine that might be a Pleurity of the Lungs too: and for ought I know, make ſomething the more on my ſide; for being ſo ſhamefully Wide of the Mark then, as will appear anon; 'tis not unlike, but that the Remembrance of ſo good a Token upon that occaſion, might make him ſomewhat the more poſitive, in preſaging this Lady her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery now. There are a ſort of men in the World, that when ever they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of an Errour on the one hand; think they can never make any tolerable amends for it, but by diametrically croſſing over to the other Extream. If any ſhall ask me, how I came to be ſo well acquainted with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? I have only this Anſwer to return them; That the Gentleman his Father and Mother being both my Patients, living at a great Diſtance from their Son, and very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the news they had received of his ſad and deplorable Condition, ordered me to make a Journey over to ſee him, and to bring them back word how the caſe ſtood with him; whether when I came, I found him much in the ſame Condition he had obſerved my Patient to be at <hi>Richmond,</hi> that is to ſay,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107560:95"/>
likely to do very well again; and ſo I inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at my return from him; who were glad with all their Hearts, to find they had been ſo happily cheated in their Expectations, as the Gentleman himſelf was (you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe) who is ſince that time, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well recovered, as that he may in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability live to ſee many wiſer, honeſter, and more healthful men than his Doctor, go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: and ſo might this Lady too, for ought I know, had ſhe been ſo fortunate, as to fall into the hands of one, who had either underſtood her Diſtemper better, and ſo known what to have given her, or could have been content at leaſt wiſe, to have let her alone with thoſe who did, but this by way of Parentheſis only.

            <p>I have but one Particular more, amongſt all theſe, to bring my Exceptions againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; which is, that of the Lynſeed Oyl, and that would be too late to offer now; but that they were likewiſe made before his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, for a Gentlewoman having moved for it, as a Medicine of ſingular uſe, and now a

Dayes grown into great requeſt, amongſt the Phyſitians of the Town; I made bold to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it then, as unlikely to prove beneficial to her, becauſe, admitting it to have been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to ſuch as were of ſtronger Stomacks, and more able Conſtitutions, ſuch as might be ſuppoſed, upon thoſe Accounts, the better fitted for induring a nauſeous draught; it could not otherwiſe chooſe, but be a little too naſty, and fulſome for a nice and delicate Lady, eſpecially at ſuch a time, when ſhe had been brought to ſo low an Ebb, as ſcarſely to be able to taſt the moſt pleaſant Cordial Drinks, without vomiting them up again, but two to one is too great Odds to be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Modeſty, and the <hi>Dr.</hi> his Opinion jumping ſo exactly with hers, I conceived my ſelf overcome by a Majority of Votes, and thereupon ſubmitted to the Ruggedneſs of the Medicament, though with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy of Mind, as to ſome other Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formerly mentioned.</p>

            <p>Whether this conceit be his own or not, is foreign to my enquiry, and but the ſame thing to him neither, becauſe if it be not his own, he thereby diſcovers the wretchedneſs of his Judgement in eſpouſing it, as not having wit enough to diſcern where to pilfer with the greateſt ſafety, in collecting matter, for his little Treatiſe: if it be the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fancy, for lighting on no better; however, I for my part have no reaſon, but to ſuppoſe it to be his, becauſe he is ſo willing to have it thought ſo, and therefore, I ſhall crave leave to demand of him, after what other way and manner, he would have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them, or any other Creature elſe, to feed themſelves (ſome very few on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) then by hanging down of their heads, though not for the ſimple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alleadged by him, to wit, that the Blood might by that means, ſo much the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs into their heads; but becauſe their Eyes, which were their Inſtruments of ſeeing,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107560:105"/>
were placed there, which ſurely is ſomewhat more than his were, when he treated upon that Argument, he would never elſe have blundered ſo egregiouſly at his firſt ſetting out if he had.</p>
            <p>And that may paſs very well for one final Cauſe, and another ſomwhat like to that may be, becauſe their Mouthes, which are their Inſtruments of Eating, are placed ſomewhat thereabouts to: And there being a neceſſity for the Nouriſhment firſt to be taken in at the Mouth, before it can come at the Neck or Stomack, to be diſperſed up and down the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for the Suſtentation of each Member: 'Tis pretty clear, that all Creatures almoſt, that are debarred from feeding on Fleſh, will be conſtrained, either to reach it from the Surface of the Earth, or fiſh for it in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe they muſt ſeek for it ſome where or other, where it is to be found; and then if they cannot bring their Food to their Mouths, muſt be glad to bend their Mouths and their Necks too, whether they be long or ſhort, down to their Food, unleſs they can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be famiſhed to death for want of it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the reaſon thereof can never poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be that alledged by him here, upon other far different Accounts, becauſe if he be well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered,

he teaches us elſe where, Pag. 133 (or if he had not, it would have been no very hard matter, to have informed our ſelves) that the motion of the Blood in 'its full latitude, depends originally upon the Arteries, and is driven by their pulſation even from firſt to laſt.

            <p>For ſeeing it is moſt certain, that the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of the Venal Blood, does not at all depend upon the Artraction of the Heart, but rather upon the Succeſſion and coming on of the Arterial blood; 'tis eaſy to apprehend
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107560:106"/>
how much the ſituation of the parts condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces either to the facilitating or retarding of that Motion; as in caſe of a Mans ſtanding upright upon his feet, the Blood tumbles down with a much freer Courſe, and more natural propenſity from the Jugular, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Vein deſcending into the Ventricles of the Heart, as we may ſee by a hand lifted up, the Veins art ſoon emptied, but in the ſame let down again, as ſoon ſwoln and full; whereas that which is beneath the Heart, and returnes by the Way of the hollow Vein aſcending, is wrought up with much greater Difficulty, as being againſt Nature, and only by the forceing on of the Arterial Blood, but when the Body lies ſtretched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Level, the Blood then is reconveyed from either part alike.</p>
            <p>By which words, it plainly enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that nothing with a long Neck, can ever be put in any great danger of having a Bloodleſs Head, any more than a body ſet upon a long pair of Legs (a witleſs one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome with a ſhort one may, eſpecially, whileſt they argue no better to the purpoſe about that Subject) becauſe if there were need of ſo ſtrong a Spring to jerk it up to the Head that ſtood perched upon the long Neck, by the very ſame reaſon, there would no leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce be required for the ſending it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107560:106"/>
up the lower Limbs of that Body which had the long Legs belonging to it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſome in railery are wont to ſet the Haires Head againſt the Gooſe Giblets, ſo may we upon very good grounds, oppoſe the long Legs to the long Neck, becauſe, there is the ſame reaſon for the one, that there is for the other, neither greater nor leſs; for as the Blood mounts the Head with Difficulty, ſo it ſlides down again with eaſe, and on the contrary, as it falls into the Feet of it's own accord, it muſt be forced back again to the Heart with ſo much the greater Labour, it will never arrive thither elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe conveyed back not at all by the atracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart, but by the forceing on of the Arterial Blood, <hi>Cum certiſſimum ſit San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis Venoſi refluxum non ab attractione Cordis ulla, ſed a propulſu Arterioſi Sanguinis provenire.</hi> And then if there be ſuch a neceſſity for the making the heart more compact for the ſake of the long Neck, why not as well upon the account of the long Legs, in regard the <hi>Arteria magna aſcendens &amp; deſcendens,</hi> both receive their Original from the ſame Stock, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtand in need of equal Aſſiſtance for the performance of the Offices unto which they have been each of them appointed? And as that Party, who is to travel a Hill juſt backward and forward, and no more, is at
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107560:107"/>
an Indifferency as to the whole of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he undertakes, whether he be to begin at the bottom or the top firſt. So 'tis all one, whether the Blood, when it be to leave the Heart <hi>caeteris Paribus,</hi> fall downwards into the Feet, or aſcend upwards inro the Head, Provided its Paſſage be looked upon as not compleated, till it return to the ſame part again; unleſs we will ſay, that he who commences his Journey at the bottom of the Hill, is conſtrained to encounter with the greateſt hardſhip of all at the firſt part of his way, which is to be recompenſed by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Alleviation at his coming down again, whereas he that takes the contrary Courſe, has only the advantage of the moſt pleaſant part of his Journey at his firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and the worſt at laſt; which amounts upon a true caſting up, to juſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be denied, but the Blood does paſs with a great deal more difficulty from the Heart to the Head, than from the ſame place to the capillary Arteries of the Feet, but then if it be conſidered, how ſteep the aſcent from the Feet to the Heart is back again, and contrarily, how natural the retreat from the Head is to the ſame Region of the Heart, after it has once gained the vertical Point; there will be no better way, of adjuſting the Calculation than by ſetting one againſt t'o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107560:107"/>
and then this ſeemingly learned Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe wil be reſolved into a Parcel of pureſelf-Contradiction, and the great Anatomiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to have written he knew not what, in the matters appertaining to his own Art. I have heard indeed of long billed Brids, that would be apt ſometimes to bewray their own Neſts; but never before, of any with long Necks, that unleſs they ſtooped oftentimes would be indanger of the Staggers.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Aſſertion is manifeſtly untrue in Practice; there is no ſuch thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that long necked Creatures ſhould be any more obliged to ſtoop down with their Heads and Necks, than others are; and thoſe that will but take notice, ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Swans, to ſwim along with as erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Necks, as either the <hi>Teale</hi> or the <hi>Dab-Chick</hi>; and if I miſtake not, to be diving with them as ſeldom, and tho a <hi>Horſe</hi> has a much longer Neck than a <hi>Bull,</hi> I don't ſee he carries his Head ere a whit the leſs ſtately for all that, but rather the contrary, and if he can but be allowed an able Rider to manage him, may be prevailed withal to hold it ſo from Morning till Night; which had the other Poſture been altogether ſo neceſſary as is pretended, would ſcarcely have been poſſible; beſides one would much wonder, that the great Horſe-Maſters, who have ſpent ſo
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107560:108"/>
much of their time, and hard ſtudy about ſuch niceties; ſhould none of them have been <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> enough to have underſtood ſo much before; and that the <hi>Grooms</hi> and <hi>Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> who have evermore profeſſed ſuch great kindneſs to <hi>Horſes,</hi> ſhould be ſuch wicked Knaves, as to delight in tormenting them thus cruelly, when they needed not, by cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Racks and Mangers to be ſet at ſuch an unreaſonable Height, and forceing them to do Penance in a manner for every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Hay they eat. And yet the greateſt wonder of all is ſtill behind, whence it ſhould come to paſs, that the <hi>Horſes</hi> that are kept at home, and have all this Injury done them, ſhould look ſo much fatter and fairer, and be ſo much fitter for Service, then thoſe that are turned to graſs all the Year about, and permitted to feed themſelves after their own way with their Heads hanging down, and their Blood by that means, freely taking that Courſe which Nature had appointed it. But to be ſerious, though they ſhould hold down their Heads longer than others, to make the utmoſt conceſſion Imaginable, that could never do neither; And unleſs they were ſuppoſed to keep them in that Poſition for a Conſtancy, there muſt be ſome wiſer reaſon ſought out for, then what is taken from the more eaſy conveyance of the Blood thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107560:108"/>
becauſe otherwiſe their poor Heads would be in a Bloodleſs Condition; however, there needs no other Argument to prove the Conſequence, than what ſhall be taken from the ſame Author his own words in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of the ſame learned Treatiſe, for if we look forward to the 156. Page. and ſo on, we are informed that a Quantity of Blood equal to the whole Maſs, paſſes through the Ventricles of every Mans Heart, at leſt ſix times in an Hour; and how that the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is likewiſe to be obſerved in all other Creatures. <hi>Atque ita ſe habet in omnibus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malibus,</hi> &amp;c. So that if one half of the Blood, or but neer ſo much, be to be diſpoſed of by the upper Branch of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> as there is no queſtion to be made, but that it is; if theſe long Necked Creatures he mentions, ſhould chance to forget themſelves never ſo little, and forbear holding down their Heads but one Minute of an hour; what an unequal Diſtribution thereof, muſt neceſſarily enſue upon it, and how would all the faculties of the ſuperiour Region of the Body be at a loſs for want of Spirits to act withal, by reaſon of the Head its being in ſo great a meaſure disfurniſhed of them, according to this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>? And yet we ſee they do forbear for a great deal <hi>longer time,</hi> and that frequently too, without any the leaſt ſhew of Prejudice
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107560:109"/>
or Inconvenience to them at all; which is a manifeſt Indication of the Author his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſtaken, in the Doctrine he delivers, as he is indeed in almoſt every thing he any where treats about; inſomuch, that ſetting aſide the <hi>Dele totum</hi> at the Begining, which he is pleaſed to place amongſt the <hi>Erratas,</hi> (though others, full as knowing as himſelf, are of opinion they deſerve much better, and to be reputed of as the onely piece of wholſom Advice, that is to be found in the whole Book) there are ſcarce two words coming together, that may not upon very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be found fault withal; but what is that to me, if it ſhould be ſo; who am only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to look to my ſelf, and make good my own Station? 'Tis no ſuch delightfull Recreation to me to be buſying my ſelf about other mens matters, and calling them to an account for what they have done; could I have been permited to have enjoyed my own quiet, and lived free from Moleſtation at home, I ſhould have been ſparing enough of giving them the leaſt Diſturbance in any of their Fooleries, let them have been never ſo many, or never ſo egregious. And now I have been put upon it contrary to mine own Inclinations; ſo little deſirous am I of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after advantages of that kind, that I am herrtily ſorry for the Occaſion offered me of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107560:109"/>
ſaying ſo much as I have; tho in the greateſt plenty of argument. As I have been all along hitherto upon the defenſive part, ſo I deſire to hold on ſtill. And if I can but ward off my Adverſaries Blow, and hinder him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the Miſchif he deſigns, ſhall never be at all ſolicitous about the following of my own, to the incommoding of him though I had it never ſo much in my power to do ſo; becauſe 'tis the clearing up of my own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as it falls in with the General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſo often intimated; and not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of his that I have a reſpect unto; and if that might have been effected by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Courſe; as there would have been little need of caſting Perſonal reflections upon any man, ſo ſhould it never have been offered at by me. 'Tis true, I could have deciphered ſome Body plainly enough to be underſtood, who has been exceeding fortunate at ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up with a borowed ingenuity, when he has had but a very inconſiderable Stock to have made a Beginning withall of his own, made vaſt improvements of the precarious <hi>comendations</hi> beſtowed on him by ſome great ones who have been charitably diſpoſed,<note n="*" rend="inter">

And though I am pretty well aſſured, there is not any thing can be more taking with the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, than to be ſhewed a Maſter Wit in his own conceit, turning Maſter Fool at laſt, in the Opinion of all others beſides himſelf: and that Multitudes of ſimple People, who have ſuffered themſelves to be deluded, by the falſe Appearances, and idle Pretences of the ſame Perſon's imaginary clerkſhip, could like it well enough to be rectified in their Judgements, by receiving ſome better Information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; yet for me he is like to ſtand in the ſame fair Opinion with them he alwayes did; not only becauſe it looks ſo unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, and makes ſo harſh a Diſcord, to be ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Ill one can of a Perſon, from whom one has ſometimes heard Ill, but becauſe of the Advantage that is given againſt the Truth thereby: to ſuch whoſe Aſſent is more truely valuable: by ſideing with it ſo unſeaſonably. Recriminations we all know to be none of the beſt means of defending a Cauſe by, ſo far indeed from gaining the party who makes uſe of them, any acquittal from the Fault he ſtands charged with, that they rather make one, where there was none before; at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, bring ſuch an one under a ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107560:110"/>
of being thought guilty, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have paſſed for Innocent. But yet as Commendations, violently extorted from a mans own Mouth, when wrongfully accuſed, are wont, amongſt equal Judges, to meet with ſomewhat a more favourable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then to be looked upon under the ſtrict Formality of ſelf praiſing; ſo on the other hand, it may well be hoped, that they who have deſired to live in Peace, and could not obtain it: when they come to be injuriouſly dealt withall, and hardly ſpoken againſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe, may be allowed the Previledge of making their Apology after the beſt (not to ſay only) manner they can; and then if they do now and then reflect upon their Adverſaries Infirmities, when it could not be otherwiſe avoided (provided it be done with Truth and Soberneſs, not ſo much out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and by way of Retaliation; as in order to the Invalidating the malicious Suggeſtions they find have been whiſpered againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or for the prevention of publick Wrongs and Inconveniences, that in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, without ſome ſuch Courſe taken, might have been offered to others) deſerve ſomething of a conivance, at leaſtwiſe, if not to be held abſolutely excuſed; as for my own part, it cannot be denied, but that I have now and then let fall ſome ſharpiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

againſt a Perſon of Eminency e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his own profeſſion; for if no Body had been intended thereby, it had been a pouring out wotds to no purpoſe, and an aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at Random; but then I conſidered with my ſelf, before I did ſo, how he came by it firſt of all, and what excellent good uſes, he has made of it ever ſince, and does dayly; what ſort of People his cheif admirers are and have been, and how they likewiſe came to be ſo, and by what meanes and artifices they have been continued in their Belief: and the thorough Apprehenſion of theſe things, made me I confeſs, ſomewhat the more bold, than otherwiſe I ſhould have been.</p>
            <p>I abhor the thoughts of deſigning any thing of prejudice either to a good Man, or a good Mans Friend; and as I am not under any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſaying all the ill I can of ſuch as are neither, ſo am I not wholly to keek ſilence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a juſt Provocation offred. There may very well be a diſtinction made between the Man and his Baſeneſs, and a Charity preſerved for the one, and yet none at all for the other.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107560:111"/>
And yet that ought to be no hinderance to me in the aſſerting of my own Juſt Rights; Or treating about other Particular Matters in time and place convenient. Becauſe theſe are things implying nothing at all of contrariety but oft time, a great deal of Agreement with, and ſometimes Subordination to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And 'tis not impoſſible but that an Example may be ſingle and multiplied at the ſame time, only by a different manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending it. So that what's Acted by one Man, may be approved of by one hundred; and the others wanted but an Opportunity for the doing of the ſame things. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could wiſh with all my heart, as it has been the drift of what I have propounded to my ſelf from firſt to laſt, that when ever the Deſcription of any Mans actions or Demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhall have occurred in any former Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of mine, including any thing of ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in them; as 'tis impoſſible but that if an ill thing be Acted, it muſt be Acted by ſome body, it may however be underſtood in an abſtracted ſenſe; and by the help of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect ſtil reduced to ſome ſuch Order of Men whoſe either Folly or Naughtineſs may beſt Intitle them to ſuch a Charracter; and that will ſave me the trouble of heaping together multitudes of Examples for the Confirmation of what I have been all this while endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107560:112"/>
to make good. Only one Inſtance more of my one knowledge, ſince the acting of what has been ſo largely related, comes in ſo patly to my purpoſe, that it muſt and will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will or no, be a little taken notice of. Il'e ſumme it up in a word or two, and then conclude.</p>
            <p>A moſt Ingenious, and learned Gentleman (and if ſuch can be impoſed upon, what are we to believe of others) and one that I have had ſeveral times under my hands upon the account of the ſelf ſame ſort of Diſtemper, was taken ſuddenly ill of a <hi>Flatulency</hi> in his <hi>Hypocondria</hi> and <hi>Bowels</hi>; the Illneſs was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſubdued, as it had been oft-times before and that with much the ſame kinds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; and all the Aſſurances given ſo far forth as humane foreſight would extend to, of a Speedy Recovery, without the leaſt grounds or fear of any poſſible Danger. And yet upon the arrival of a <hi>London Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> blooded he muſt needs be, nothing would ſerve his turn without it, which before he could obtain, he was forced to beg and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat hard for: I am aſhamed to ſay how long time together, &amp; rather than have none at all, he would be contented with a very little Quantity, ſome two Ounces, or thereabouts; and leaſt he ſhould miſs of that ſmal Pittance too, was glad to take it away with his own hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:107560:112"/>Many ſilly reaſons were pretended upon the ſcore of the <hi>Scurvey, Jaundice,</hi> and <hi>Sharpneſs of Humours,</hi> and the like; but the Principle, and the only true one, never ſo much as mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all. To wit that no other, after that had been done, might be capable of putting in for a ſhare of the Cure beſides himſelf: all little and inferior Remedies, being as it were loſt, and ſwallowed up in the great one; and being once able to ſay, he had fetched Blood of his Patient, away he went immediately with a great deal of Complacency and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

I confeſs, the graveſt and wiſeſt Perſons are the beſt qualified for the performance of ſuch an Office. But if they out of prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſiderations, beſt known to themſelves, ſhall think good not to be ſeen therein, rather, than to have it wholly omitted; I for my part ſee no reaſon to the contrary, but why it may be done by others.</p>
