            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We cannot without unſpeakable grief and ſorrow call to mind, nor without horror expreſſe, That Our deare and Royall Father King <hi>CHARLES</hi> of ever bleſſed memory, hath beene moſt barbarouſly and moſt cruelly Murthered, by the hands of bloody Traytors and Rebells within Our Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> with procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and circumſtances ſo prodigious, that the particulars induce rather amazement than expreſſion. And although Wee have hitherto ſeemed ſilent in a matter ſo highly concerning Us, as not publiquely to expreſſe to the People of <hi>England</hi> Our griefe of heart and high deteſtation of that heynous fact: Yet being now ſafely arived in a ſmall part of Our owne Dominions, at the Iſland of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> Wee have thought fit rather from hence, where Our Kingly Authority takes place, than from any Forraigne Countrey, where Wee have beene hitherto neceſſitated to reſide, publiquely to Declare; That out of a bitter ſenſe and indignation of thoſe horrid proceedings againſt Our dear Father, We are, according to the Laws of Nature and Juſtice, firmly reſolved, by the aſſiſtance of Almighty God, though We periſh alone in the enterpize, to bee a ſevere Avenger of His Innocent blood, which was ſo barbarouſly ſpilt, and which calls ſo lowd to Heaven for Vengeance. And We ſhall therin by all waies and meanes poſſible, endeavor to purſue &amp; bring to their due puniſhment thoſe bloody Traytors who were either Actors or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of that unparalel'd and inhumane Murther. And ſince it hath pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe, as by ſuch an untimely Martyrdome, to deprive Us of ſo good a Father, and <hi>England</hi> of ſo gracious a King; We do further Declare, That by His Death the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> with all Priviledges, Rights, and Preheminences, belonging thereunto, is by a cleare and undoubted Right of Succeſſion juſtly and lineally deſcended upon Us, as next and immediate Heyre and Succeſſor thereunto, without any Condition or Limitation, without any Intermiſſion or Claim, without any Ceremony or Solemnity whatſoever; And that by vertue thereof We are now in Right lawfully ſeized of the ſaid Crown; and ought by the Laws of God and of that Nation to enjoy a Royall power there, as well in Church as Common wealth, to Governe the People of that Kingdome according to the antient and known Lawes, to maintain them in Peace and Juſtice, and to protect and defend them from the oppreſſion of any uſurped power whatſoever. And the people of that Nation, by the like Lawes owe unto Us, and ought reciprocally to pay duty and obedience unto Us, as unto their Liege Lord and Soveraigne. This Royall Right of Ours is groundred upon ſo cleare a Title; is ſetled by ſuch fundamentall Lawes, confirmed by ſo many Oathes of Allegiance in all Ages, is ſupported by ſuch a long continued Succeſſion in Our Royall Progenitors, and by ſuch a conſtant ſubmiſſion of all the people, that the ſame can admit of no diſpute, no act of Our Predeceſſors can debarre Us of it, no Power on Earth can juſtly take it from Us; and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Lawes of that Nation, to oppoſe Us either in the Claim or Exerciſe thereof, is a Treaſon of the higheſt degree. And although the bloody contrivers of Our Fathers Murther (out of a pernitious hatred to all Monarchies) have by force, as much as in them lies, Diſinherited Us of Our Princely Right thereunto, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and proſcribed Us, ſeized all Our Revenues, prohibited all entercourſe and ſupplies to bee ſent to Us, and have by violence impoſed upon the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a new Yoake of popular Tyranny, to the utter ſubverſion, not only of Our Juſt Rights, but of their Lawes and Liberties. Yet We do profeſſe that We can not perſwade Our ſelfe, that the Body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation hath ſo farre degenerated from their antient Loyalty and Vertue, as to conſent to theſe horrid proceedings againſt Us, or to approve the caſting off that Kingly Government, under which they and their Fore-fathers have happily flourished ſo many Ages paſt, to the envy of all their Neighbour Nations. How can that once happy Nation of <hi>England</hi> deſpaire of bleſſed daies under a Royall Scepter, and vainely hope for them under the Iron-rod of an inſolent Multitude? No, Wee cannot looke upon theſe ſad and diſmall Changes, as the Deſires or Intentions of the better part of Our Subjects of that Kingdome; but rather as the Deſignes and Contrivances of thoſe wicked Murtherers of Our Father, whoſe Ambitions are endleſſ, whoſe Avarice is unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, and whoſe Guilt hath made them deſperate. And therefore out of a confidence Wee have of the Loyalty and good Affections of many of Our Subjects of that Nation; And as well for their encouragement who ſtill perſiſt in their Naturall Allegiance and Obedience to Us, as for the ſecurity of ſuch as ſhall yet returne to their Duties and Loyalties; Wee have thought fit hereby further to Declare, That Wee are graciouſly pleaſed to receive all perſons of Our Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> (other then ſuch who Voted or Acted in that bloody Murther of Our deare Father) into Our Royall Grace, Mercy, and Protection, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>g and eſteeming them all as Our good and loving Subjects, whom upon Acceſſe to Our Kingly Authority, We ſhall hold Our ſelf bound according to the Law of God, the known Lawes of that Nation, and the Duty of Our Kingly Office, to protect, maintain, and preſerve in wealth, peace and happineſſe. And for a cleare evidence of Our good intentions towards them, Wee ſhall be contented freely to pardon, or otherwiſe by Act to declare, or hold indempnified, all perſons within Our ſaid Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> (except before excepted) for any matter whatſoever relating to the late unhappy Wars and Diſtractions. And We ſhall (according to the example of Our deare Father) be ready upon the eſtabliſhment of Our Royall Throne, to make ſuch further Conceſſions, for the ſatisfaction &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Our good Subjects in generall, &amp; of all Intereſts in particular, as ſhall be adjudged moſt to conduce to the Peace and Happineſſe of that Kingdom. And We doe further declare, That Wee ſhall give Our utmoſt aſſiſtance to reſtore Parliaments to their antient Dignity and Honour, and ſhall preserve their juſt Priviledges, and joyne to repaire all thoſe Injuries and Affronts, which have beene done to the Members of that High Court. And becauſe all waies of gaining a mutuall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, betwixt Us and Our good Subjects, are at preſent obſtructed, by the uſurped force and power now prevalent in that Kingdome, Wee are therfore reſolved to make uſe of ſuch expedients as ſhall bee neceſſary for the ſuppreſſion of that Tyrannicall and unjuſt Power now exerciſed over them; And for bringing to their due puniſhment, thoſe bloody Murtherers of Our deare Father; For ſhaking off the heavy Burthens and Taxes they now groane under; And for reſtoring Our juſt Rights, and the antient Liberties and Freedome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; Not doubting but Wee ſhall find all Our good Subjects ready to concurre, and to aſſiſt Us in Our juſt and pious Undertakings for thoſe ends. And in the meane time, Wee require and command all Our ſaid Subjects, according to their duty to God, their Allegiance to Us, their ſeverall Oathes and Proteſtations, and the love and affection they beare to the Peace of their Native Country, that they doe not betray their Lawfull King, nor the glorious Liberties and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> into a perpetuall ſlavery, by acknowledgment or voluntary ſubmiſſion to any new formes or models of Government; under the name or mask of a <hi>Free State,</hi> nor under any other title or pretence whatſoever.</p>
