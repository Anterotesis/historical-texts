         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>Liberty being that which in all times hath been, but eſpecially now is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the aime and deſire of all men. Common reaſon ſhews that Kings leſſe then any ſhould endure captivity; yet <hi>I</hi> call God to witneſſe with what patience I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a tedious reſtraint, which ſo long as I had any hopes that this ſort of my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering might conduce to the peace of theſe three Kingdomes, or the hindring of more effuſion of blood, I did willingly undergoe, but now finding by two certaine proofes, that this my continued patience would not onely turne to my perſonall ruine, but likewiſe be of much more prejudice then furtherance to the publique good, I thought I was bound as well by naturall as politicall obligations to feeke my ſafety by retyring my ſelf for ſome time from publique view both of my friends and enemies, and I appeale to all indifferent men to judge, if I have not cauſe to free my ſelfe from the hands of thoſe, who change their principles with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and who are not aſhamed openly to intend the deſtruction of the Nobility, by taking away their negative voyce, and with whom the levellers doctrine is rather countenanced then puniſhed; and as for their intentions to my perſon, their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and putting more ſtrict guards upon me, with the diſcharging moſt of all the ſervants of mine, who formerly they admitted to wait upon me, doe ſufficiently declare: nor would I have this my retirement miſ-interpreted, for I ſhall earneſtly and unceſſantly endeavour the ſettleing of a ſafe and well-grounded peace, where ever I am or ſhall be, and that (as much as may be) without the effuſion of more Chriſtian blood, for which how many times have I preſt to be heard, and yet no care given to me; and can any reaſonable man thinke (according to the ordinary courſe of affaires, there can be a ſettled peace without it, or that God will bleſſe thoſe that refuſe to heare their own King, ſurely no? I muſt further adde that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what concernes my ſelfe) unleſſe all other chiefe intereſts have not onely a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but likewiſe juſt ſatisfaction given to them (to wit, the Presbyterians, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents Army, thoſe who have adhered to me, and even the Scots) I ſay there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (I ſpeake not of miracles, it being in my opinion a ſinfull preſumption in ſuch caſes to expect or truſt to them) be a ſafe and laſting peace: now as I cannot deny but that my perſonall ſecurity is the urgent cauſe of this my retirement, ſo I take God to witneſſe the publicke peace is no leſſe before mine eyes, and I can finde no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37623:17"/>
better way to expreſſe this my profeſſion (I know not what a wiſer man may doe,) then by deſiring and urging that all chiefe intereſts may be heard, to the end each may have juſt ſatisfaction; as for example, the Army, (for the reſt, though neceſſary, yet I ſuppoſe are not difficult to conſent) ought (in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to enjoy the liberty of their conſciences, and have an act of oblivion or indempnity (which ſhould extend to the reſt of all my ſubjects) and that all their arrears ſhould be ſpeedily and duely paid, which I will undertake to do, ſo I may be heard, and that I be not hindred from uſing ſuch lawfull and honeſt means as I ſhall chooſe: To conclude, let me be heard with freedome, honour, and ſafety, and I ſhall inſtantly breake through this cloud of retirement, and ſhall ſhew my ſelfe to be <hi>pater patriae.</hi>

               <p>At this Common-councel, Mr Alderman <hi>Fowk,</hi> and Mr. Alderman <hi>Gibs,</hi> by the directions of the Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> did make a large Relation of the great Tumult, Inſurrection and mutiny, which happened in this City on the laſt Lords day, and on Munday laſt, by many evill diſpoſed perſons, which firſt began on the Lords day in the afternoon in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> where they ſeized the Colours of one of the Trained Bands of the ſaid County, who were there imployed for the ſuppreſſing of ſuch perſons as did profane the Lords day; and being diſperſed by ſome of the Generalls forces, did gather together within the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties thereof, and in a Riotous manner did break open divers houſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of Arms and Ammunition, and took away Arms, Plate, Money and other things, and did ſeize upon the Drums of the Trained-Bands of this City, which were beating to raiſe their Companies, and armed themſelves, and beat up Drums, and put themſelves in a warlike poſture, and ſeized upon the Gates, Chaines, and Watches of this City, and then marched to the Lord Majors houſe, &amp; there aſſaulted the Lord Major, Sheriffes, Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the ſame; and did ſhoot into the Lord Majors houſe, beat backe his Guards, killed one of them, wounded divers others, and ſeized, and took away a piece of Ordnance from thence, with which they did afterwards ſlay and wound divers perſons, and committed many other Outrages: All which matters being largely debated, and many particulars inſiſted upon, both for the Diſcovery and Puniſhment of the ſaid miſdemeanours and outrages; and alſo for the preventing of the like for time to come, It was at the laſt concluded and agreed by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-councell as followeth:</p>
               <p>Firſt, this Common-Councell doth generally conceive that this City was in great danger, by reaſon of the ſaid Outrages and Miſdemeanours, and that if the ſame had not ſo timely beene prevented and ſtayed, the whole City would have been expoſed to the fury and rage of the ſaid Malefactors, and this Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth Declare, That the ſame Miſdemeanor and Outrage was a horrid and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable act, tending to the deſtruction of the City, and that they do diſavow the ſame, and with an utter deteſtation do Declare their diſlike thereof. And this Common-councell doe appoint the Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> to make the ſame known to the Honourable Houſes of Parliament, and alſo to make an humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt unto them, That an Order may be iſſued forth from them to the ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this City and the places adjacent, that they may be directed to give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Thanks to Almighty God, the Author of this great and wonderfull delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from that imminent danger wherein this City and parts adjacent were invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And further, the ſaid Committee are appointed by this Court, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Honourable Houſes of Parliament, for the obtaining of a ſpeciall Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer &amp; Terminer,</hi> for the trying and puniſhing of the Malefactors that had a hand in this deteſtable action, according to the known Laws of this Land. And this Court with thankfull hearts do acknowledge the inſtruments under God, by which they obtained this Deliverance, to be by the Forces raiſed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Parliament, under the command of his Excellency the Lord Generall <hi>Fairfax;</hi> and to manifeſt the ſame, this Common-councell do alſo Order, That
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37623:18"/>
the ſaid Committee of the <hi>Militia,</hi> in the Name of the City, as a thing agreed upon by an unanimous conſent, ſhall return their hearty Thanks to his Excellency, for his ſpeedy and ſeaſonable Ayd, afforded unto the City in this their great ſtraight and danger. And this Court with a general conſent, do well approve of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the ſaid Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> for the raiſing of the Forces of the City, and in their procuring of the ſaid ayd and help from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in this Extremity, and what elſe they have done for the appeaſing and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing of the ſaid Tumul s. And this Court do give Thanks to the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the <hi>Militia,</hi> for their care and pains by them taken upon this ſad occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And they doe appoint Mr. Alderman <hi>Fowk</hi> to declare the ſame their Thanks to ſuch of the ſaid Committee as are not of this Court. And this Court doth alſo with all thankfulneſſe acknowledge the pains and care of the Right Honourable the Lord Major, and the Right Worſhipfull the Sheriffes of this City therein. And this Court doe generally declare, That it is the duty of every Citizen of this City, by himſelfe and all that doe belong unto him, or is under his command, to be ready upon all occaſions to be ayding and aſſiſting unto the Lord Major, and the reſt of the Magiſtrates of this City, for the ſuppreſſing of all tumults and diſorders within the ſame. And the ſeverall perſons now preſent at this Common councel, by the holding up of their hands have promiſed, That for the time to come they will uſe their utmoſt endeavour, and be ready upon all occaſions to doe the ſame. <hi>MICHEL</hi>
