         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR:</hi> If I haue a (hart which is the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of loue) it must vndoubtedly be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
full of you, or empty of all goodnes:
You taught me once how to goe, by your
strength, and gaue me so sufficient a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from your fauour, that I might very well neglect
those threatning gusts which spake any losse vnto mee.
This, when my memory forsakes it must forsake the world,
for whilst it is, it is but a Cabinet to keepe your vertues
in me: And hence it comes I am bold to present vnto you
this oblation of my Pen, which when you haue read, if
you please to burne, they shall draw nearer to the nature
of a Sacrifice: for I doe not present them to you as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
(your owne sleightest conceits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>lye millions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
beyond them) but as messengers, to tell you that the
Author, wheresoeuer hee liues, doth dearely loue you.
There be some of them that concerne Honour and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
passages, betwixt noble aduersaries: I know you
will imbrace and alow them, and though your selfe in
your particular haue done much better, yet he that shall
walke in the path I haue limited, shall without doubt not
erre in any gentlemanly course of well doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4675:3"/>
The motiues which vrged me to this, was the cruelty
of those ignorant angry ones that loue to vent their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in foule words, and spend their execution with the
coldest action, whereas indeed true vertue should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for vertue, and like <hi>Alexanders</hi> dogges, with a
noble dispisingnesse, not looke on the smaller beasts, but
with an ouerflow of courage, ceaze vpon Lyons and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants.
The matter being then so familiar both to your
knowledge and experience, no man can correct me with
better authoritie, or aproue me with a iudgement which
shall better please mee. These <hi>EP<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but as imperfect offers of those larger essayes and tastes
I meane to pursue in another Treatise seconding this: in
which I intend (God being pleased) to omit the nature
of no Epistle needfull, with a discourse of Combats, and
the presidents both of our owne and other nations, euen
from the first vse of the English Rapier to these times.
In all which mine ambition shall be that you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when you looke on the booke to remember mee, who
will euer liue to obay you.</p>

Curiosity and my forme of writing, hauing euer
beene at a perpetuall dissention, but since all mens
vvritings haue a predestinate end, of good or euill,
hanging vpon them, I must hazard amongst the
multitude, and though the subiect I write of hath ben
handled by many, and many of a great deale more
merit, yet I haue runne so farre from the lisping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of ill imbrodred speech, or from the rude
plainnesse of too much dulnesse, that when my booke
shall be paraleld with others, it will speake sufficiently
to get it selfe a free passage, nothing being in it I
hope vnworthy, nothing that may not very vvell
authorize imitation. Neither doe I ascribe to my selfe
the grounds of euery inuention, for there be many
due to such excellencies as no man can controle, no
man equall: nor is mine intent here to end, for it is
but the beginning of a much better worke, as my

new courses, since your owne example comforts you to
continue, and that it is to me most certaine, that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steny

from a Gentlewoman whose Parents being dead,
is left to the tuition of friends, and they
onely are aduerse and opposite to

               <p>IN such a state (Gentlemen) you haue placed me, as I
can neither write nor be silent; for how can I be silent
since you haue left m√©e nothing but my solitary words to
testifie my misery, and how should I write, who neither
can resolue what to write, nor to whom to write? What
to write it is hard for me to say, as what I may not write,
so little hope haue I of any successe, and so much hath no
iniury b√©ene left vndone to me wards. To whom to write
where may I learne, since yet I wot not how to intitle
you; shall I call you my Soueraignes, set downe your
lawes that I may doe you homage? shall I fall lower, and
name you my Kinsemen, shew mee your bloods in your
loue? but shall I name my selfe the Mistresse of my selfe?
alas, no; I am your prisoner: But whatsoeuer I be, or
whatsoeuer you be, O all you beholders of these dolefull
lines, this doe I signifie vnto you, and signifie it with a
heart that shall euer remaine in that opinion, the good or
euill you doe to him I loue, I will euer impute it as ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way done to mine owne person; he is a Gentleman,
and worthy to be my husband, and so is he my husband,
by me worthily chosen. Bel√©eue it, bel√©eue it, eyther you
shall be murderers by killing me, or if you let me liue, the
killers of him shall smart as murderers: for what doe
you thinke I can thinke; am I so childith, as not to s√©e
wherein you touch him you wound mee? can his shame
be without my reproach? no, nor shall be, since nothing
he hath done that I will not anow. Is this the comfort
you bring me, to make me fuller of shame then sorrow?
Would you doe this if it were not with full intention to
<pb facs="tcp:4675:18"/>
preuent my power with slaughter? and so doe I pray you,
it is high time for m√©e to be weary of my life too long led,
since you are weary of me before you haue power in me.
I say againe, I say it instnitely vnto you, I will not liue
without him, if it be not to reuenge him; eyther doe iustly

Therefore to conclude, in wronging him you wrong
me, neither conceive with your selues that your iniuries
aspyze to the life of a stranger, but euen to the life of your

               <p>YOur loue (my best respected friend) is so actiue in my
bosome, that euery occasion of salutation stirres in
my braine matter enough for my Pen to worke vpon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that though the barrainesse of the time, and the
dulnesse of the place in which I liue, deny to loade my
Paper with any nouel seriousnesse, yet my respect to you,
and wishes euer to be preserued in your best memory,
(of which I am ambitious to giue the longest instance)
shal amplifie my thoughts, and send them vnto you, suted
in so true an affection that you shall take delight to reade
the volumne of my friendship, which I know your owne
noble nature wil instruct you both to imbrace and cherish<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
as well for the zeale of the ground from whence it springs,
as loue to that fruite which shall fill your bosome with
contentment. Our seperation is a continuall sickenesse,
and without this Paper-sp√©ech would be most iniurably
mortall, meditation being so great an enemy to the breath,
that it would quickly bring life to his last consumption:

I will giue so much loued entertainement, that were
they able to returne their owne messages, you should
without suspect know that nothing is more glorious then
a true friends accomplements. Make my minde happy to
behold what mine eyes cannot, I meane your selfe in your
Letters, for they are the liueliest Characters of that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
which we adore with most earnestnesse, and though
the words be blacke, yet is their sound so cl√©ere and misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
that they staine the brightnesse which containes them,
&amp; make the eare couet no noyse but their repetition. Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
is the mother of ielousie, and too much to fortefie
knowledge is to br√©ede suspicion in knowing: therefore
briefly, loue me still, for I will loue you euer, and when
any malice of an enuious spirit shall insinuate betwixt
vs, remember my vertue and my vowe, which is euer
to liue faithfull.</p>

that feare of mistaking, then by silence or neglect, s√©e you
runne into an errour vnauoydable, I will boldly giue you
mine opinion, and afterward referre your owne will to
your owne iudgement: first, for your abandoning the
study of the Lawes, in my conceit you fortake a friend of
your blood to enioy the familiaritie of a stranger, or in a
worse sence, cut off a true f√©elling member, to haue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
