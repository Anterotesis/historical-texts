         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR:</hi> If I haue a (hart which is the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of loue) it must vndoubtedly be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
full of you, or empty of all goodnes:
You taught me once how to goe, by your
strength, and gaue me so sufficient a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from your fauour, that I might very well neglect
those threatning gusts which spake any losse vnto mee.
This, when my memory forsakes it must forsake the world,
for whilst it is, it is but a Cabinet to keepe your vertues
in me: And hence it comes I am bold to present vnto you
this oblation of my Pen, which when you haue read, if
you please to burne, they shall draw nearer to the nature
of a Sacrifice: for I doe not present them to you as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
(your owne sleightest conceits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lye millions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
beyond them) but as messengers, to tell you that the
Author, wheresoeuer hee liues, doth dearely loue you.
There be some of them that concerne Honour and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
passages, betwixt noble aduersaries: I know you
will imbrace and alow them, and though your selfe in
your particular haue done much better, yet he that shall
walke in the path I haue limited, shall without doubt not
erre in any gentlemanly course of well doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4675:3"/>
The motiues which vrged me to this, was the cruelty
of those ignorant angry ones that loue to vent their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in foule words, and spend their execution with the
coldest action, whereas indeed true vertue should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for vertue, and like <hi>Alexanders</hi> dogges, with a
noble dispisingnesse, not looke on the smaller beasts, but
with an ouerflow of courage, ceaze vpon Lyons and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants.
The matter being then so familiar both to your
knowledge and experience, no man can correct me with
better authoritie, or aproue me with a iudgement which
shall better please mee. These <hi>EP<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but as imperfect offers of those larger essayes and tastes
I meane to pursue in another Treatise seconding this: in
which I intend (God being pleased) to omit the nature
of no Epistle needfull, with a discourse of Combats, and
the presidents both of our owne and other nations, euen
from the first vse of the English Rapier to these times.
In all which mine ambition shall be that you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when you looke on the booke to remember mee, who
will euer liue to obay you.</p>

Curiosity and my forme of writing, hauing euer
beene at a perpetuall dissention, but since all mens
vvritings haue a predestinate end, of good or euill,
hanging vpon them, I must hazard amongst the
multitude, and though the subiect I write of hath ben
handled by many, and many of a great deale more
merit, yet I haue runne so farre from the lisping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of ill imbrodred speech, or from the rude
plainnesse of too much dulnesse, that when my booke
shall be paraleld with others, it will speake sufficiently
to get it selfe a free passage, nothing being in it I
hope vnworthy, nothing that may not very vvell
authorize imitation. Neither doe I ascribe to my selfe
the grounds of euery inuention, for there be many
due to such excellencies as no man can controle, no
man equall: nor is mine intent here to end, for it is
but the beginning of a much better worke, as my

generally to preuent all those things which might
encumber your happinesse, why should you now séeke
new courses, since your owne example comforts you to
continue, and that it is to me most certaine, that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steny

then wisedome and goodnesse? Why should you depriue
your selfe of gouernment, for feare of loosing your gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

shall be murderers by killing me, or if you let me liue, the

you thinke I can thinke; am I so childith, as not to sée

be without my reproach? no, nor shall be, since nothing
he hath done that I will not anow. Is this the comfort

Would you doe this if it were not with full intention to

it is high time for mée to be weary of my life too long led,

truest experience: knowledge is the end of our creation,

               <p>THE neerenesse in blood betwixt vs in true descent,
I néed not discouer, since I doe assure my selfe of your

long time since, I may well comemorate, for the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

from vertue is soone forgotten. Speaking of vs,
I meane our Ancestors, who in all true friendship conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whereby there were at one time liuing fiue Knights
of your name, and in like manner at that instant, at one
time, there were also fiue Knights of my House and
Name. But to boast of the glory of mine Ancestors, who
being honourable, dyed honourably; serued the Kings of
this Realme both in the warres, in the Court, and in the
Country, might séeme to procéede of childery. But to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

aduancement, and yet onely bereaued of that degrée
wherein mine Ancestors haue béene possessed this foure
hundred yéeres in dessent, may séeme to procéede of iust
sorrow: which to make greater, I daily sée those vnder my
rancke, whom neither vertue nor riches are acquainted
with, precéede me in honourable titles, finding that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
from strangers, which the vnion of blood miserably
neglecteth. But I will no more vrge th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that feare of mistaking, then by silence or neglect, sée you
runne into an errour vnauoydable, I will boldly giue you
mine opinion, and afterward referre your owne will to
your owne iudgement: first, for your abandoning the
study of the Lawes, in my conceit you fortake a friend of

the gaining of knowledge? What better accommodation

and the good of all Kingdomes? A profession as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

honour not bounded in any strait circumference, but so
largely left to the vtmust lists of eminence, that it walkes
one rancke before the greatest nobilitie, hauing no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
