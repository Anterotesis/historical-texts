            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The conflicts betwixt truth and error or not of yesterday, but as early as the morning of time, when he who is a liar from the beginning assaulted with a horrid calumny the truth and faithfulnes of God, and having by a lie mad a breach in our first parents integrity, by inducing them to believe it, instilld his poison into our nature, <hi>a love of darknes rather then light.</hi> The eye of the understanding (like natures bodily organ when its cristalin humor is vitiat) cannot see and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impression of its object, (truth

Hence all the rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed pleadings for, &amp; discoveries of truth, begets in most men (by a wofull <hi>antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristasis)</hi> nothing but renewed contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; spurnings against it, While (as the suns vigorus influence upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of this dull earth) by its irradiations it attracts, and condenses thick foggs, dark clouds of peruerse disputings the more to obscure it self. Yet a holy seed there is and hath been in all generations, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light and of the day, whose work; and honourable badge it is to contend and be valiant for the truth; who under the conduct of <hi>Michael</hi> that great prince who stands up for his people (truths sincere lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb facs="tcp:104445:3"/>

So that the warr which John saw in heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> was not then only begun, but a new battel and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of that old warr proclaimd in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise betwixt the seed of the woman and the serpent. All men are inrolled in one of these two armies, imbarques in one of these interests according as they are regenerat, or unregenerat, as they have the seed of God in them or not; &amp; discovries of truth have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects accordingly, either of more intense love, or violent hatred, as the sun shining upon the flowers &amp; dunghil, draws equally forth a sweet &amp; stinking savour.

Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth and holines suffred contradiction of sinners against himself, he oft silenced enemies reasonings, not their malice, and the most admirable actings of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionat condescending love to men, <hi>the giving of himself to death for them,</hi> was intertained with the most viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hellish eruptions of their wrath against him, in murthring him. The rulers opposed this great <hi>ruler of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> the learned scribes and rabbies with all their literal knowledge of Moses and the Prophets, could not yea would not see and acknowledge this <hi>great Prophet,</hi> the covenanted people would not receive this great <hi>messenger of the Covenant;</hi> and they who boasted to be <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> rejected this <hi>promised seed,</hi> could not see him when among them, but hated him, whom <hi>Abraham saw a far off,</hi> and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the discovery.

            <p>The angry cloud wherwith God hath now of a considerable time covered the daughter of Zion in our land, challenges in this as much as in any thing else, our <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nfull observation,</hi> &amp; <hi>simpathizing compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> that men have taken the boldnes, with perverse disputings to infest her true sons and children, to assault her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius ordinances and priviledges, and with a barefac'd impudence to indeavour the removal of the <hi>ancient land marks</hi> which our fathers have set, nay which the great God hath established.

impeacement. Who ever saw this house of God in our married land, in its pristine glory &amp; integrity, can but mourn over the present desolation. These gates once called <hi>praise,</hi> have now <hi>desolation</hi> set upon their threshold. These walls once called <hi>salvation,</hi> are laid in dust <hi>&amp; rubbish.</hi> The joyfull sound and voice of the turtle (echoed with the singing of birds, and vigorus heart motions towards the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bridgroom) are turned into the harsh sound of enemies roarings, and direfull threats, crying raze it raze it to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. To see <hi>Bethel</hi> turned <hi>Bethaven,</hi> and men, yea pretended builders, lifting up axes not upon the thick trees to advance the building of the house, but upon the carved work, to destroy it, may make ane impression of sorrow upon any heart, but that of adamant. Israel wept at the sad newes of Gods refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to go with them unto the promised land, but especialy when they were brought back from the very borders of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan for their disobedience and unbelief, &amp; doomed to return and die in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, spending the remainder of their
<pb facs="tcp:104445:6"/>
dayes and yeares in vanity and trouble. 'Tis long since the glorious cloud is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn to the threshold of our sanctuary, and the darke, not the auspicius light some side, turned unto us, yet who are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory, who are found crying out a penitent <hi>[Ichabod]</hi> over its departing. The building was so far advanced, that we were ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What means the heat of this great anger, and where will it issue? Afire is kindled in his anger, afire of angry Jealousie, but shall it burn for ever, is there none to make up the breach and stand in the gap.</p>

How deeply we have drunk of the whoors cup; and what a deluge of monstruous wickedness, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwelmd us since this idol of jealousiewas set up, ought rather to be weept over then written.

And, which is strange, this monstruous <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> of <hi>Erastian Prelacy</hi> like a <hi>Medusa</hi> hath charmd the generation into ane ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing stupidity, yea the most unto an ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, though it hath oftner then once faln before Gods Ark, and its head and hands have been cutt off upon the thres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the sanctuary, a convincing proof that it is not a God.

For this late Pamphleter, who hath drest up minc't-meat of soom old fragmens to please childish Pallats, I suppose few or none who have pierc't into the bowels of our present controversies, have judged him so considerable, as to deserve a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal encounter, there being nothing which he or any of our late Scriblers hath offered, but what is already sufficiently answered. So that these litle toying mean Dialogues, were like to passe along as securely in their own want of worth, as <hi>Bessus in the Comedy.</hi> Yet in one point or two I cannot but commend him, first that the substance of this book answers its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>the differences of the time,</hi> these 3 points being indeed the chief <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> of our present differences, in which had he satisfyed all the Presbyterian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arguments he had done much to cut the sinnews of their cause. But how far are we at a losse in this Expectation, when the book is lookt over, not one of these great questions <hi>fairly stated,</hi> scarce one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Presbyterians so much as fairly proposed, but enfeebled by silly disguises, and the answers to them such poor and

ridiculous evasions, as if he had intended in this discovry of the weaknes of his cause to proselyt his Readers into Presbyterians, if they were not such before, in stead of weakning that party by this new assault; the great point of <hi>Erastianism</hi> not so much as once toucht: And so notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all his defence of the Diocesian Bishop, the Erastian Bishop Lying opene to all the weapons, &amp; wounds of such as have impugned those principles.

            <p>Reader, for the design of this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, I have this to say, that although I have as litle as many men coveted such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, yet have been perswaded to be thus publick upon this occasion, that having casually met with this Pamphlet, after it had for a considerable time travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up and down, I judged it expedient to employ upon it some solitary houres, wherein I was taken offfrom other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both to prevent languishing, and to satisfy the desire of a friend, whom I highly esteem; as likewayes to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some simpler and lesse discerning readers, who seem'd to be taken with this piece; which essay after a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable times lurking coming into the hands of some welwishers to our Zion. I did at last yield to their importunity in reference to the publication. Whatever entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this may meet with, and how keen soever the darts of malicious reproach may prove which are levelled at me, <hi>Hic mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Aheneus esto,</hi> I have this shield, that
<pb facs="tcp:104445:10"/>
I can say it before the heart searcher, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heart condemning, that as I intended herein a vindication of Truth and duty, and according to my measure and capacity to give this testimony for it, to the strengthning of a poor afflicted remnant contending for the same, so in writing these sheets, I had an eye upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights for his help and presence, and dare not deny but that this was found in some good measure accordingly. And in the perusal of what is here offered unto publick view (which was not at first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly my intention) I would have thee looking after these with other emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>First, thou may discover what a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable cause wee now contend for, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Crown dignity and Royal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Jesus Christ, his glorious supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over his own house, in appointing its officers, lawes, ordinantes; for the true frame of his tabernacle according to the pattern shewed upon the mount, for that Government of his house delivered in his perfect and glorious testament, sealed with his blood, for fealty &amp; loyalty
<pb facs="tcp:104445:11"/>
to this King of Kings, in keeping his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant into which this nation and Church so solemnly entered; for the walls and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of this City of God in opposition to antichristian underminers and invaders thereof, for these solemn Assemblies of his saints upon the ancient grounds and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Reformation (so much now aspersed by devouring tongues) the ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherof in our Zion ought to engage to sorrow, and a lamenting after our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Lord, now hiding himself from us. Enemies have often invaded him upon his his throne of grace, and professed friends have not sincerely aproach'd unto it.</p>
            <p>Next, As to our adversaries pleading against us in this quarrel, thou mayest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover first, that they are snar'd, as by the works of their hands, so by the Words of their lips, and fall before the rebound of their our Arguments; this mans pleadings against us, especially upon the point of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, levelling so clearly against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that such who impartially read him upon his point may straight entertain this reflection, <hi>It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks,</hi> and that its easy to pull this
<pb facs="tcp:104445:11"/>
Egyptians spear out of his hand and kill him with his own spear. Secondly, thou may see, what monstrous issues they are driven unto in the defence of their cause, what a chain of contradictions &amp; absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they have twisted to wind themselves out of their inextricable <hi>Labirinth,</hi> that they hatch cockatric eggs; obstinat main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of one absurdity begets a hundred; so true is that saying &amp; prophecy, <hi>evil men shall waxe worse &amp; worse deceiving, &amp; being deceived.</hi> How palpably have they wrested the holy Scriptures to shift the convictions thereof, and make some shift of answer? How laxe and absurd are their new principles in <hi>point of Oaths,</hi> resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their strength into the Magistrates arbitriment and Lawes; besides other odd posterns which they have opened to escape allobligations thereby, if their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be not indispensably necessary, which with them is in a great measure determined by the Law. What a monstrous <hi>Chaos</hi> of more then Infidel-barbarity and confusion shall this world become, if these mens faith-banishing principles be once admitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thirdly, to evince, that our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
<pb facs="tcp:104445:12"/>
puppets and new pleaders are Babe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> true brood and builders, thou mayest see, how sweetly they joyn with the Papists in their glosses upon these Scirptures, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against them. Whenc it is evident, even to a <hi>demonstrative certainty,</hi> that the cause of <hi>popry and prelacy,</hi> are of ane <hi>inseparable affinity,</hi> and stand or fall together. If this mans glosses whereby he shifts off our Scripture Arguments, striking at the <hi>Bishops mitre,</hi> be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the <hi>popes triple crown</hi> is equally shielded against the weapons of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. Our learn'd Protestant divines in confuting the popish evasions do so mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge their dispute, as if they were directly pleading against this <hi>Informer</hi> in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>our Prelacy.</hi> And who heares his glossings, pleadings and answers, would imagine that by some <hi>Metempsuchosis,</hi> Bellarmine or Eccius were now acting the <hi>Informer</hi> to proselyt the Presbyterians to our Prelacy or a papacy rather. Besides, 'tis clear he embarques, with the Papists in his endeavour to bring in antiquity and the Churches practice, as the infallible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Scripture in the Episcopall debate, consequently in all debats in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology.
<pb facs="tcp:104445:12"/>
Nay we must measure the Temple and the Altar, mould our Arguments in this point of truth by <hi>Scripture stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;</hi> but for the utter court of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> wee leave it out, for its given to the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Its many soul principles and practices will not be gotten within the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture verge. This man in his Scripture pleadings is very sparing, for a few pages measure will do it. But for Antiquity ware he mets us out large and full, to the great part of all the book; and in this he deals honestly giving the <hi>courser stuff</hi> the <hi>larger yard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, thou may see these men disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered beyond all their hiding pretences of love, peace and unity; their large spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious charity (extended to the dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Metropolitans pallace) hath fine entertaining rooms for <hi>Papists, Quakers, Arminians,</hi> &amp;c. but the poor <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> will scarce get such a room in it as Bishop Bonners colehouse wherein he lodged the martyrs; they cry out one Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers as refusing all <hi>Christian fellowship with them in worship:</hi> but when shall we see them <hi>open their pulpits</hi> to our Ministers, after they have banish'd

them from their own flocks? They vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> all our differences unto meere <hi>punctilioes;</hi> yet they contend about them <hi>tanquam pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> and had rather all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians were harassed and persecuted, even to a consuming desolation, then one <hi>fringe of their Garments,</hi> (As Bishop Lighton call'd the points debated) were cut off and let go. They declame zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously in their pulpits and Pamphlets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>sanguinary Principles.</hi> How can these cruell men, say they, <hi>looke up to the God of love?</hi> But now after they have drunk pretty largely for many years of <hi>Presbyterian blood,</hi> and are gaping for more as fast as the bloody whore of Rome who in a great measure influences them, these devout <hi>Burrio's,</hi> can wipe their mouths, and pretend they have <hi>peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> with them. Mistery Babylon! Mystery Prelacy! What ane abysse of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is here.</p>
            <p>In the third place, thou may see, that the cause wee contend for, as it hath the first and <hi>pure Scripture Antiquity,</hi> so the next ensuing Antiquity also, and the patrociny of the purer ages, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciously

Harmonious consent of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches and divines;</hi> So that our present Testimony is the same with that of the <hi>witnesses against the beast,</hi> and our adversaries stand arranged under <hi>Antichrists banner,</hi> in the whole series at least &amp; complex <hi>farrago</hi> of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>A Diocesian Erastian Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, underprop't by blood and Perjury, headed by a civill papacy, embracing in its bosome all foul errours,</hi> is a hideous Monster, a bowing wall, a tottering sence, and lookes in face and feature so unlike to Christs bride, held out and pourtrayed in Scripture, and once gloriously shining in this land, that no disciple of Christ no friend of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> can mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the one for the other; So that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries charge of <hi>novell heterodoxy</hi> is a new minted calumny, <hi>a frighting buk bear</hi> and <hi>scar-cnow.</hi> fit to fright children in knowledge, to be the derision of the knowing, and for nothing else.</p>

Wee endeavoured not, while Gods candle shin'd upon our tabernacle, to get our case discovered and search'd, our hearts sprinkled from an evill Conscience, therefore most of us are given up to Conscience - Wasting sins. We have not drawn with joy, from our <hi>wells of salvation,</hi> while they were open and running in a plenty of powerfull &amp; pure ordinances; now God hath suffered Philistines to <hi>stop these Wells;</hi> and while wee endeavour to dig them again, such are the counter endeavours of this man and his fellowes by their pleading and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, that they are called <hi>Ezek</hi> and <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> strife and contention.

            <p>If any desiderat a more particular <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the Testimonies of the Fathers and some other Authors cited by the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> there are several grounds which may take off this exception. First, since,
<pb facs="tcp:104445:17"/>
upon both sides it is professedly agreed at the scripture is the only judge in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nding (as also the fathers themselves and all sound Christians) have professed to subscribe ane absolute appeal to this judge in matters of religion (whatever deviations from this rule and profession, this man and his fellowes are guilty of in their arguings and pleadings, especially in this point) matters, I say, standing thus in this debate among professed Protestants, who are disputing from scripture, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a critical scanning of, or litigiouscon test about the sense ofevery humanewriter, they must in their principles acknowledge to be but a digladiation de <hi>lana cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ina,</hi> a spending of money for that which is not bread. When any disputant hath with much critical travel among the fathers, brought home their suffrage to his cause, or by the same diligence taken it out of an adversaryes hand as it were with his sword and this bow, what is all the victory? a humane testimony brought to fortify a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth</hi> (which was before strong and impregnable in its own light and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:104445:18"/>
and a testimony apt to a wired<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> by a subtiler Critick to a different or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary sense. Next, the scriptures decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this debat, being (as it is hoped) convincingly made appear, and the chief testimonies of fathers for our cause vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated against this adversary, no rational or ingenuous reader will judge it expedient, after the scripture decision is made appear and the testimonies of eminent fathers also, and the adversaryes contrary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane testimonyes, as to the main, dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to pursue every stragling citation. Thirdly, 'tis evinced that as upon the one hand all his testimonyes upon the point of Prelacy, though admitted, do but am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ount to demonstrat the <hi>factum,</hi> which is not the question, and not all the <hi>Ius,</hi> which only is, so upon the other hand they are as far short of reaching any patrociny to the present <hi>Diocesian Erastian Prelat</hi> as the Pigmees arme is to fetch down Ulysses helmet. Now what superfluous wast of time were it to insist in scanning of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes adduced to prove that which is not the question? the disputant hath but a mean labour in trying whether his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes
<pb facs="tcp:104445:18"/>
conclusion is deducd according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rules, and followes on the premises, when the conclusion it self is a long da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes journey out of the lists and ranges of the question, and not the <hi>negatum</hi> or the principle which the adversary undertakes to prove. If any man will from this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> testimonyes draw out our <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Erastian Prelat,</hi> in the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the power now exercised by him, he may give a defie to all the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> to match him in chymical extractions, and may have the chief chair for invention. All the fathers cited by this disputant are as ambiguous as the Delphick Oracles in our debate. <hi>In fine,</hi> this piece is chiefly addressed to the plain simple searcher for truth, to furnish him with stones from mount Zions brook (with plain scripture Arguments) to encounter and overcome our Philistine braggards: not to charge his unskilful weake shoulders and armes with Sauls unwieldy armour. How tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and uselesse to the unlearn'd, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the sense of humane writers is, when the inquiry and debate is about a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, wherein the conscience must

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> not my pains to prove, it being obvious to the meanest reflection. If any shall yet except upon the want of a full examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some Commentators upon scripture, whom the <hi>Informer</hi> appeales unto, 'tis answered, that if the sense of controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed texts be evinced from parallels, and the scope and contexture, and the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes argument repelled, the humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony or sense of some Interpreters must vail to this in the judgment of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; and besides, neither the suffrage of Commentators is wanting to our sense of these scriptures we plead, nor can this mans glosses be reconciled to the sense of sound Protestants. Which wee suppose the reader will find aboundantly clear in the Perusal. The learn'd do know that wee might muster up as many commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors suffrages to patronise our sense of text controverted, as would <hi>spatio conficere immensum aequor.</hi> The truth is, that with some, wee will need an Apology, in that, this piece is swelled to such a bulk upon this ground, &amp; that so much of it is taken up in presenting and scanning the sense of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
<pb facs="tcp:104445:19"/>
besides, the many testimonyes of reformed Churches and divines for Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>erian Government which wee have presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a short view in the last Chapter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first Dialogue, do, consequently give sentence for us, as to the sense of the texts scanned in this controversy, and more then counterballance any whom this man appealls unto.</p>
            <p>Some, 'tis probable, may think strange, that the <hi>Informer</hi> hath so far got the start of this <hi>corrector,</hi> and travelled so long before this appeared; but such may be quickly satisfyed as to this <hi>punctilio</hi> of a <hi>time-ceremony,</hi> when they are made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that as this piece was a long time abroad ere ever I did see it, so after some sight of it, it was a considerabletime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had the least intention of imparting my thoughts of it, &amp; after I had this imparted them much more time did interveen before my intention did fully correspond with the presse motions, &amp; accesse where it could be had. But however, the knowing reader will not so much value <hi>who</hi> replyed, or <hi>when;</hi> as <hi>what</hi> and <hi>how. Satcito si sat bene,</hi> is a sound proverb: although (if this
<pb facs="tcp:104445:20"/>
matter did deserve any more Apology) it might be truly averred that the substance of this reply, all to a very little was written in the moneths of June and July in the Year 1681. since which time these sheets were much lurking and out of my hands. And but little opportunity offered for boring them through exactly after the writing thereof. Yet upon some renewed desires, as to the publication I did again hastily look them over amidst many avocations, dividing the whole into Chapters for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods sake, with suitable inscriptions containing the summ &amp; series of the chief points treated of; having also accesse to peruse some Authors which were not by me at first writing, some inlargements were made which have much encreased it to this bulk, and 'tis probable may make it prove rugged in several places, and not so intelligible to the plainunlearned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for whom at first writing it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, if not only, intended; yet for his advantage the Citations of Authors are all Englished, and some times rendered only in English, and often upon repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some few of the Authors words, the
<pb facs="tcp:104445:20"/>
sentence is broken off &amp; the rest present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our own language: which if it seem strange to any other; as the ground assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned will, I hope, satisfy, so a view of the Authors will be my vindication as to the truth of the testimonyes themselves.</p>
            <p>Upon the point <hi>of Separation</hi> (which is a difficult and comprehensive question) I have not undertaken any large scrutiny into its nature and degrees, nor to scann the severall incident cases and subordinat questions, which the full discussing of that great point would require; desiring only to maintain the antithesis of the <hi>Informers</hi> principle and fundamentall Topick in the third Dialogue, and in so far only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into this point as to vindicat this practice of presbyterian Ministers and professours their owning and following their respective duties, from his imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a sinfull and Schismatick separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore have not directly spoken to these cases, viz. what may be said for, or against Conformists Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial mission? What difference is in this our case betwixt a <hi>fix'd or stated,</hi> and <hi>ane occasional hearing.</hi> In what cases it
<pb facs="tcp:104445:21"/>
might be abstracted from a formall ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> ing of Curats as Ministers of this Church? Whether a protestation at first hearing might be a sufficient <hi>salvo</hi> to free the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic from that complyance which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the narratives and declared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Acts which do enjoyn it? And upon the affirmative solution of this case, what might be the nature, extent and circumstances of such a protestation? Whither the diverse cases and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of severall places of our land, will import such a difference as to sin or duty in this point, as there might be a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of practice and union keeped ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon? These and several such like cases I have not taken upon me formally to state and clear (whatever light about them may follow upon what is here asserted) not finding it necessary in order to the scope of this defence, as the question with this <hi>Informer</hi> is stated and limited, norbeing desirous to render this reply of too great a bulk, or to be forward and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming in difficult points. If the learned and Judicious desiderat here many things both as to matter and manner, as I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:104445:21"/>
not, they will, let not the Presbyterian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ause and interest fall under the worse Character with them; this being but ane essay upon these great questions offered by a very mean person of that number, and not their joynt - polities and form'd thoughts; addressed also mainly to the plain and unlearned readers. Yet for its scope and substance, I doubt not, but it will be found such as is able to speake with the Enemy in the gate, and succsesfully to undergoe their assaults, if any such be made upon't. One thing is indeed to be regrated, wherof I could not but acquaint the reader in this place, that Because of many difficulties which the overseer of the first part, in Answer to the first Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, at the presse, did labour under, Both in respect of the Copy and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes, there are some considerable Tipographical errours which have creept into it, and several Latine and Greeck words misrepresented; of which errors, such as do considerably marr the sense are noted among the <hi>Errata.</hi> The other parts t'is hoped will not be so bad, &amp; create the Reader such difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104445:22"/>
I shall also here acquaint the Reader that I have seen a manuscript entituled <hi>Positions relating to publick worship maintained by Presbyterians In former times, and contradicted by the practice of many in these dayes,</hi> driving the same design with this <hi>Informer</hi> in his third Di. alogue, and upon the same grounds, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof I had written a considerable time since a full <hi>Examen,</hi> but cannot here present it: both, because that <hi>pasquil</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and especially, because it is for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance fullyanswered in this reply. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor upon these general acknowledged grounds of the <hi>obligation, lying upon all Church-members to attend the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the unlawfulnesse of separating from publick worship for the sins of Ministers or fellow-worshippers; the condemning of the Brounists in</hi> England <hi>by the old Non-conformists there, because of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Separation, though themselves did separat in part: their acknowledging of the lawfulnesse of Episcopal ordination for substance, &amp;c.</hi> drawes out a strange and remote conclusion against Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb facs="tcp:104445:22"/>
Ministers of this Church, their officiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their present case &amp; circumstances, and peoples adhering to them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Ministry. The absurdity of which inference, and what a <hi>sand-rope connexion</hi> it is, needs not any renewed discovery here, which were but <hi>Actum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.</hi> The impertinent and groundlesse suppositions upon which this inference is founded, and the confused shufling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of thatwhich in this question is to be distinguished, being aboundantly above evinced, and also the apparent inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency of this way and Method of Arguing: since from all these grounds a destroying conclusion may be drawn out against this pasquiller, in reference to the owning of Presbyterian Ministers in their Ministry: since the ordinances administred by them are really ordinances of Christ, their mission and ordination warrantable, the worship not corrupted by their supposed scandals, and consequently they are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty who disown their Ministry, or plead for it; or else to evite the deadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound of his own weapons and Arguing,
<pb facs="tcp:104445:23"/>
he must state the question of new, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict and limit to the particular state and circumstances of this Church; but then he must confesse his arguing upon these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall positions, to be but beating of the air and poor childish babling. It were not unpleasant to trace the many grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions incident to this way of arguing and apparent to men of an ordinary reach who have read this paper. First, [atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ordinances] add [receiving them from Conformists] are all one and identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with them, yea tyed with adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine chains; yet in the case of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ministers, these two are as far sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, as east &amp; West. Secondly nothing but a substantial corruption of ordinances admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred by Conformists can warrand a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from them, &amp; this principle sayes the Author hath strong Scripture grounds to warrand it, But take this principle over to Presbyterian Ministers, and then it loses all its vertue, and he will find grounds of separating from them, were ordinances never so pure, and this is no strange
<pb facs="tcp:104445:23"/>
thing, the sharpest sighted eye cannot see it self. Thirdly, a man can never be reconciled to himself, who confesses the Episcopal ordination lawful, and yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owns Conformists. But once turn the Tables, and the game runs crosse; a man may acknowledge the Presbyterian Ministers have a lawfull ordination, and never crosse that principle; though he totally disown them. There are also several grosse inadvertencies, besides these that are common with his fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes in this way of arguing, which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Author of that Pasquil. Such as, his cutting the sinews and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the fundation of his arguing, in <hi>granting all to be true which Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists charge prelatists with,</hi> id est, <hi>that they are Schismaticks &amp;c.</hi> So in the second position. Yet holding, that this position viz. <hi>That ordinances are not polluted by their Scandalls,</hi> will inferr a conclusion of hearing them <hi>hic &amp; nunc;</hi> Wheras this very ground of <hi>Schisme</hi> is that upon which he mainly ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads for disowning Presbyterian Ministers,
<pb facs="tcp:104445:24"/>
his confounding in the matter of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius his supposed censure by the ancient Church our acknowledgment of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> and of the <hi>Ius.</hi> His denying in answer to the objection anent the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that any act under a General head of duty, considered Physically or material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may become <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and in its present circumstances sinful <hi>exaccidente,</hi> yet walking all along upon this very ground, in condemning the preaching of Presbyterian Ministers and peoples hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: In calling (in answer to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objection) <hi>the Prelatick party the Church of Scotland as now constitute;</hi> Yet in the premised concession acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them <hi>Schismaticks</hi> from this Church: Thus stealing back a principle to make shift of answer, which he hath already given away to his adversary in this debate. In granting to the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>that this frame of prelacy is worse then the former, and gives more to the Magistrate then Gods Word allowes,</hi> yet calling this establishment of it, <hi>the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of Authority</hi> &amp; the commands of
<pb facs="tcp:104445:24"/>
submission thereunto <hi>lawful commands.</hi> These &amp; many such like absurdities are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to any that have read that chattered Pasquil: which might be made further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly appear if wee could dilate upon it and present the pasquil it self. But this litle toutch may abundantly discover its vanity and insufficiency in the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and that the cause, which our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats puppets are pleading for, is so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat and tottering that it needs many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of its adversaryes and beg'd sup. positions to under-prop it withal, &amp; yet so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotten is this fabrick and bowing wall, that it must notwithstanding fall to the ground.</p>

                  <p>That the Prelat, now established in this Church, is both Diocesian and Erastian, cleared. The Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is engaged to defend both. A twofold State of the Question propounded accordingly. Some Arguments from Scripture against the Diocesian Prelat, as a pretended Church-officer. Such as, 1. Perverting the Scriptural term, <hi>Episcopus,</hi> commune to all Pastors; in appropriating it to a Prelat. 2. Making it relate to Pastors, which hath the flock for its immediat object. 3. Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; nulling the Authority allowed unto Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, which is demonstrat at large. 4. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching Christs Kingly office, as Head of his Church, and the perfection of his Word, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding ane Officer upon the Church, of a different moold from those described and allowed by him.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE state</hi> of the <hi>first Question</hi> in the first Conference is, <hi>whither the Episcopacie now established by Law in</hi> Scotland, <hi>be warranted or condemned by the Word of God.</hi> For clearing this, it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, what that Prelacie is, which is now existent, and which this Author pretends is consonant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Antiquitie. As to matter of fact, it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable. 1. That the Parliament 1662. did expresly raze Presbyterian government, in all its preexistent Courts, Judicatories and Privileges, declaring it voide and expired. 2. They did Redintegrat the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104445:39"/>
[to their Episcopal function, presidencie in the Church, power of ordination and censures, and all Church discipline to be performed by them, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>(only)</hi> and of such of the Clergie <hi>(only)</hi> as they shall find, (they themselves being judges) of knowne Loyaltie and prudence.] And they redintegrat them to all the pretended Privileges possessed be them in Anno 1637. What time their power was at the greatest height. Since, of themselves they framed the Book of Canons, which doth establish their sole power and dominion over all Church Judicatories, razing classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Presbyteries and Parochial Sessions, and drew up the Liturgie and Book of Ordination without the least shaddow of advice from this Church; Threatning even excommunication against the opposers of that course. 3. It is also evident, that all this Power and Authoritie of our Prelats, is fountained in, derived from, and referable unto the Supremacie; As is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Act restoring Prelacie, after the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Supremacie, as his Majesties Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners in the exercise of his Ecclesiastick Government, and, in the administration of all their pretended spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Authoritie, as accountable to him, their Head and supreme <hi>Legislator</hi> in all Church matters. Hence, it is evident, that this Author is obliged (if he would answer his undertaking in pleading for the present Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie) not only to evince the warrantablenes of the <hi>Diocesian Bishop</hi> in all his pretended spiritual power over Church Judicatories; But likewaves of the <hi>Erastian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> deriving all his Authoritie from the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat.</p>
               <p>Wee shall then (befor wee come to examine his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Head) offer, I. Some Arguments against our Diocesian Prelat, as a pretended Church-officer, and shall shew his office to be contrare to Scripture. 2. As ane Erastian Prelat deryving all his spiritual power from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104445:40"/>
the Magistrat. I. As a pretended Church officer, the Diocesian Bishop is contrare to Scripture, in many res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In narrowing and restricting the Scripture term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ane office and officer, distinct from, and Superior to, a Presbyter or Pastor. For since the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in Scripture appropriats this term to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and consequentlie the work and office therin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, Tit. 1: 5, 7. Act. 20: 28. 1 Pet. 5: 2. 3. Sure it must be ane anti-Scriptural and Sacrilegius robbing of Presbyters of their right and due designation, to make this proper and peculiar to a Diocesian Bishop onlie, as the Characteristick of his office. Episcopal men themselves (and this Author particularely) doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this term to be in Scripture applyed to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Let them then shew a reason why they have made it peculiar to a Prelat as distinct from Presbyters; Or, let them shew where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denots such ane officer as they have shappen out (viz.) A dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesian Prelat having sole power of ordination and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over a wholl diocess, with a negative voice and a sole decisive suffrage in the Church Judicatories thereof. Should they appropriat the term <hi>Pastor,</hi> or <hi>Minister,</hi> to a diocesian Prelat onlie? Who would not call this ane Anti-scriptural usurpation of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters due? And why also, shall it not be thought such ane usurpation when they appropriat the term <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> to such a pretended distinct officer: Since this term is as much given to Presbyters in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the terme of <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Minister.</hi> Judicious Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin hath some remarkable passages to this purpose in his Comentaries. On Tit 1: 7. Having observed that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters are all one, He calls the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating of the name, <hi>Bishop,</hi> to the Prelat, a profane boldnes and ane abrogating of the holy Ghosts language <hi>Abrogato Spiritus Sansti sermone usus hominum arbitrio indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi>

He col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the identitie of the name &amp; office of Bishop &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter, from the elders being called Bishops, And having observed the same on Philip. 1. And that after, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me [Bishop] became peculiare to one. He adds, <hi>id tamen ex hominum consuetudine natum est, Scripturae autoritate minime nititur.</hi> Telling us that under this pretext of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the name to one, ane unlawful dominion was brought in. But of this againe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The office hereby designed, doth alwayes relate <hi>to the Flock,</hi> and hath them for its <hi>immediat object and Correlat,</hi> as much as the word Pastor. The Bishops of Ephesus were made by the holy Ghost <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> over the flock of God whom they were to feed. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas our supposed Diocesian Episcopus, or Bishop, His office and inscection relates immediatly to the <hi>wholl Pastores</hi> of his diocess, who are alse much, his flock and the object of his oversight, care, direction, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and censure, as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or layetie. Peter, bids the <hi>Episcopountes</hi> feed the flock &amp; act the Bishops over them; But our diocesian Prelat, pretends to feed and rule the Pastores themselves. The Scripture Bishop is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli Pastor</hi> but the Diocesian Prelat is <hi>Pastor Pastorum, Presbiter Presbiterorum,</hi> And therfor is ane Antiscriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monster.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Diocesian Prelat usurpes and takes from Presbiters that authoritie allowed them of God in his Word. For both power of ordination and jurisdiction is soly and properlie in the Diocesian Prelat according to Episcopal men, and likewise according to our Lawes, As we saw above in the act anent Prelacy. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto the Prelat is a Superior ordinar Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer above Presbyters, he is sole as to ordination, may

Presbyters exercise all their Acts of the power of order in a dependance upon him, he only is the proper Pastor of the diocess (as shall be afterward cleared) Presbiters are but his substitutes and helpers. They are likwayes Subject to him as their <hi>proper Sole judge and censurer</hi> by Ecclesiastick censures of suspension, deposition, excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the decisive power in Church judicatories is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie his. For the most unanimous Acts and conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the diocesian Synod falls unders his cognisance, to be ratified or Cassat at his pleasure. He is the <hi>Sine quo non,</hi> and hath a <hi>Negative voice</hi> in the judicatories: the law allowing his Presbiters only to give him <hi>advice,</hi> Nay and not that either, unles he judge them of <hi>known layaltie and prudence.</hi> Now, in all these, he usurps over Presbiters authoritie allowed them of God. For I. Wee find the Scripture atributes the power of <hi>order</hi> &amp; <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> equalie to all Presbiters, who have <hi>both keys</hi> of doctrine &amp; discipline given them immediatlie by Christ.

the commands relating to peoples <hi>Subjection &amp; obedience</hi> to Church Rulers in the exercise of their power, their is not the least hint of disparitie among these Rulers. 1 Thess. 5: 12. People are commanded to obey them that labour among them, and are over them in the Lord, and to esteem them highly. And Hebr. 13: 17. They are commanded to obey them who have the rule over them and watch for their Soules: but nothing of a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial degrie of obedience to this supposed highest &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent watch man is heard of in these or any such like precepts. And no wonder, for thes simple Gospel times knew no Bishops who watched not over Soules, and laboured in the word and doctrine. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Peter commands Christians to obey civil Rulers: He distinguishs the King as Supeream, and Governours sent by him, that a Chief subjection may be yeelded to the one, and a subordinat to the other. But nothing of this is heard of, in enjoining peoples subjection to Ministers. Ane honour must be allowed by Timothey (by the people of God consequentlie) to elders that rule weil, yea and a double honor, but <gap reason="foreign">

Now by the same reason, upon which Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doe rationaly build this conclusion, it must be granted, that the enjoyning obedience to all Pastores promiscuusly and without any Note of distinction, will inferr their equal office and authoritie.

                  <hi>Nixt,</hi> The Prelats monopolizing thus in himself, the <hi>decisive suffrage</hi> of Judicatories, is cross many wayes to Scripture.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104445:43"/>
and authoritative concurrence of ordinary Ministers and Elders in Government: As is evinced in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Scriptures, wherin it is convinceingly clear, that Paul, though ane Apostle of all the Churches, indewed with extraordinarie unconfined inspection over the same, and Pastor thereof, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miracolous-gifts, &amp; being the Master Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Spiritual Father, who by the Gospel had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten both Pastores and flocks of many Churches, Yet would neither excommunicat the incestuous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian alone, but put it upon the Church Officers as their duty to doe it by a judicial, decisive, joynt suffrage: Nor yet did he exclud the presbyters in ordaining even ane Evangilist, but took in their judicial and presbyterial concurrence. And in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. In that meeting or Counsel at Jerusalem, where was a wholl Colledge or Presbitery of Apostles, and mett about ane <hi>Act</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of a high Nature, wherein was put forth both <hi>Adegmatick, critick &amp; diatactick</hi> authority or power, in relation to the clearing of that great pointe of truth, anent the abrogation of the Mosaicall ceremonies, and censuring the opposers of Paul and Barnabas herin, who had disturbed the Churches and belied the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Doctrine: And accordingly in order to the restoring and establishing truth and order in these disturbed Churches: The ordinary Ministers or elders concurr with the Apostles in every step: viz, In the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; disquisition, the authoritative decision, the drawing forth of the sentence and decree, the sending out of the decreeing and censuring Epistle, the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seing of the decrie upon the Churches to observe and keep the same &amp;c. 2. This cutts the throate of that juridical forensical joynt decision of Church Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which the Scriptur doth so clearly hold forth. Where is the <gap reason="foreign">

This power of the Prelats cuts of from Ministers one half of their authoritie and commission receaved in their ordination. They are made therein (as is clear in Scripture, &amp; our adversaries grant it) Rulers, Governours, Overseers, Pastors &amp; Stewards in the Church; Have both the Shepherds bagg &amp; staff, the key of doctrine and the key of discipline intrusted to them. By what warrand then must they give up all their power in government &amp; their decisive suffrage in Church Judicatories, unto the domineering Prelat, and as to spiritual power in Church Judicarories, become meer Ciphers? They watch and rule as they that must give account of all their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to Christ. Peter exhorts the Elders suteablie to exercise their Episcopal Authority over the flock, that they may get the Crown from the chief Shepherd. Stewards (of God especially) must be faithful, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy well all their Talents receaved from the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that they may get his approbation and reward as faithful Servants. The Elders of Ephesus were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by Paul to take heed to themselves, and to all the flock over which they were made Bishops by the Holy Ghost, to feed and rule the Church which God hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104445:44"/>
purchased with his blood. Now all thes exhortations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Ministers, are to no purpose, if they have no inherent <hi>immediat Rule, essentially included in their office,</hi> And to be exercised accordingly, but must only preach as <hi>a Diocesian Prelats Deputes,</hi> and be in the exercise of their ruling governing power, absolutly subject to him and at his disposal. <hi>Finally,</hi> This usurped authoritie in the <hi>Prelat</hi> sets him above the reach of <hi>all censure by Church Indicatories;</hi> So that though Ministers are absolutly and at his beck, censurable by, and subject to him, both as to their doctrine, conversation and discipline (and every one of them thus censurable and jointly) yet <hi>this hie Pop,</hi> who judges <hi>All,</hi> will be judged <hi>by none</hi> himself, Either as to his Doctrine, Life or Government. Some have said of the Prince, that though <hi>major singulis,</hi> yet he is <hi>minor universis,</hi> less then the whole body of the people, though greater then every one aparte. But the Prelat exercises a greater principalitie in Church Judicatories, &amp; is therein <hi>major universis,</hi> greater then the whole meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that thogh he can stop the Votes and Censures of the whole Synod, yet they cannot either by suffrage or censure in the least put a check to him, in any of His most wicked Acts or Antichristian Exorbitances. Now, how contrary this is to Scriptur, any may judge. The Prophets after their prophesying must be <hi>judged by the rest,</hi> as to their doctrine, 1 Cor. 14: 29, Ergo, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> much more as to their conversation &amp; government, are lyable to be judged, and consequentlie censured if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it: For he were a great Critick, that would distinguish these, so as those who have power to judge, have no power to censure or pass sentence upon their judging: And this is founded upon a general compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive ground, viz. <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets</hi> (that is the gifts and exercises of the Ministery in all Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers without exception) <hi>are subject to the Prophets,</hi> viz. to their disquisition, and censure in any peece of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104445:44"/>
work or official Acts. Now unles our Prelats would deny themselves to be Prophets and Ministers, or the Presbyters to be Prophets, they must acknowledge this subjection to their censure enjoyned in the Scripture premised, and consequently, that their exeeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the same, is an anti-scriptural usurpation. I remember, while a writting, that proposing once this Argument to ane Episcopal Clergie man, I enquired to what Church Judicatorie in Scotland was <hi>Mr Sharp</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as to either his life or doctrine? He answered that he was <hi>subject to a general Counsell,</hi> and this was very apposit and consequenter to their principles: So that our <hi>Prelats</hi> (at least the two Arch-) are in no fear, but of a general Council if the Court froune not. In our Act of Parliament touching the mould of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod, the <hi>Primat</hi> is the <hi>essential President, &amp; sine quo non,</hi> and so is sure enough, from being censured there; so are the rest of the Prelats as to all their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, according to our Lawes. But what think these <hi>exleges Episcopi,</hi> or <hi>hie Court Prelats,</hi> of such a humble Bishop as the Apostle Paul, who had hands laid upon him, and was authoritativelie sent out by that Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Prophets and teachers at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Act. 13. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Barnabas, (about ane eminent Gospel-Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and was by the same Church and Presbytery sent (together with Barnabas and certain other commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Churches) to that Synod at Jerusalem, Act. 15. Why did not Paul make use of his Negative voice and command them all silence in this debate? How comes it, that his hie Bishop subjects himself to the authoritative blessing and mission of some pettie Prophets and teachers. Ane amazeing looking glass, this is, (no doubt) to our <hi>aspyreing Prelats.</hi>

For according to our Prelatical Clergie, and according to the Lawes, the Prelat hath <hi>a distinct Work</hi> from that of a Presbiter (viz.) to govern a diocess, he hath the <hi>Actus primus</hi> of a State ruler, to sitt in Council or Parliament.

Now, if non of all these points of his superioritie can be found in Scripture, this Officer patched up thereof, must either be unwarrantable, or, Christ the Churches head and lawgiver, his Lawes and rules in point of Church Government, and in relation to the duties, gifts, ordination, and work of Church Officers, are not <hi>full and perfect,</hi> but mank and defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as to such ane eminent Church Officer.

Eph. 4: 11, 12. Rom. 12. 7, 8.

Now, let any of commune Reason or ingenuity judge, what ane office that must be, which putts a Minister intrusted with the Lords great commission to preach the Gospel, under pretence of advancement to a higher Sphere in the Ministery, to lay by this work which is the noblest and highest of the Ministerial Authoritie, wherin the Apostles themselves mainely laboured and gloried, as the most noble meane of the conversion of Sonles: and consequentlie of the glorie of Christ the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin; Nay, to lay by this noble work under pretence of new burdene of Government.

The Diocesian Prelat debases and tramples upon this noble work, in that be makes it in all the Pastores of the Dioces, to depend upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposal, and the authoritie thereof to be deryved from him as the sole proper Pastor of all the Diocess, whose deputs the preachers are in this work, although himself is obleiged to feed no flock. 3 He maks these high and noble Acts <hi>of the power of order, [preaching</hi> and <hi>administration of Sacraments]</hi> a lower and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat work and office, to the work and office of <hi>ruleing only,</hi> which is his <hi>Characteristick</hi> whereby he holds himself Superior to all the preachers of the Diocess? whereas the Scriptur doeth (as we heard) appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the highest honour to the <hi>labourer</hi> in <hi>the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> as the nobler employment and office, above the Ruler only.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In this the Diocesian Prelats office is contrare unto, and reprobat by the Scriptur, in that by <hi>Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal, Antiscriptural,</hi> new invented, <hi>Degrees and orders.</hi> It diversities and cutts asunder what God hes made one and the same, I mean the <hi>Pastoral Office,</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104445:47"/>
other offices mentioned in Scripture, as that of Prophets, Evangelists, Deacons; non of which offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces admites of <hi>Subordinat Spheeres and degrees,</hi> but all the persons that are Intrusted with these offices, are of the same degree and authority therin by the Word of God. No Evangelist, Prophet, or Apostle is found of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior office or order to other Apostles, Evangelists, &amp;c. Whence comes this diversity then in the Pastoral office, that one Pastor must have a Lordly Dominion over some hundreds of his fellowes? If it be said, that the Episcopal office succeeds that of the Apostles or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists? besides that wee shall disprove this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and shew that these offices taken <hi>formaliter</hi> as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of the Pastor, are expyred, as sound Divines doe almost universally grant; I answer that most, if not all Prelatists ancient and modern, doe hold the Diocesian Prelat to be no officer <hi>Specifially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> from the Presbyter or Pastor, but only <hi>gradually distinct,</hi> as being a Pastor with a more amply extended authority for order of Government. <hi>Mr Burnet,</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vindication of the present Prelacie, 4t. Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, pag. 310, 311. tells us, that he is not clear anent the notion (as he calls it) of the distinct offices of Bishop and Presbyter and akonowledges the Presbyter to be of the <hi>hiest office</hi> in the Church, telling us that the Prelat is but a different degree in the same office. Although in this he and the rest doe speak most inconsequently, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ingredients of the Prelatical function, being such, as doe certanly amount to make up a <hi>new species</hi> of ane office, such as a different work, consecration or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, the <hi>actus primus</hi> of a State Ruler, different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications (by consequence) above and beyond these of a Presbyter. The diversitie of these distinguishes the Scripture offices of Apostles, Evangelists, &amp;c. which Paul setts in several Classes, as, first, and second. 1 Cor. 12: 28. Mr Burnet his reason is the same with that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104445:48"/>
of others herine (viz) the Pastors authority to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the word &amp; Sacraments which are the highest acts of the power of order. He tells us [that since the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental actions are the highest of sacred performances: he cannot but acknowlege that such as are impowered for them, must be of the <hi>hiest office,</hi> in the Church] now I say, since they will needs have the Diocesian Bishop to be only a different degree of the Presbyterat or Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral office, they cannot with any shaddow of reason make him Successor to the Evangelists or Apostles in their formal office, which they will not dare to affirm to be only a different degree of the Presbyterat or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores office, and will affirme it to have been specifically distinct from the same. The Ancients and Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men held that the Pastor in his ordination receaved the same <hi>Power of Government</hi> that the Prelat hath, but that <hi>the Prelat is the [primus Presbyter,]</hi> who hath the raines of <hi>all the exercise,</hi> in his hand. But how cross is this to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that any Church officer hath a power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which he cannot exercise? To whomsoever God hath given the <hi>power,</hi> he hath certainlie <hi>commanded the exercise of it;</hi> and particularly Pastores or Presbyters are (as we have heard) enixely commanded to exercise all their Pastoral authority and power, as they shall answer to their great Master. Besyds, if the Pastoral office, or its official power of order and jurisdiction, may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably thus divided and cutt out in Shreeds and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and divyded among different recipients, then it were lawful to divyde preaching and administration of the Sacraments, so as one Presbyter (notwithstanding of his authority and mission, in relation to both word and Sacraments, receaved in his ordination) might have <hi>preaching only</hi> allowed to him, but no administration of Sacraments: Another might be allowed to administer Sacraments, <hi>but not to preach.</hi> One Presbyter upon the pretence of order or union
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104445:48"/>
(pretences are never wanting to humane inventions) might be sett a part and authorised to Baptise all the Children in a wholl Province, doing nothing else of the Pastoral Office, And this power by the same autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might be taken from all the Pastoures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Sure all would acknowledge this to be a most wicked divyding and diversifieing what God the conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And such is this Prelatical divyding of the Pastoral charge in relation to order and jurisdiction, or the keys of Doctrine &amp; Government? the power wherof, the Pastor receaves intirely in his ordination, as well as the Authority of administrating Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In this the Diocesian Bishop is contrare to Scripture. In that his Office is in many respects cross to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gospel-Church Government, and is ane Office which the man that exercises, cannot but in so farr cease to be a Gospel Church-ruler, Which I prove thus. 1. Since all authority in the Diocess, as to either the Word or Disciplin, is deryved from the Bishop, as its proper fountaine and subject, this power of the Bishop is properlie and of its own nature, not a Gospel Ministery, But <hi>a dominion and principalitie,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to Church Officers of what ever sorte, whose authority is not <hi>a despotick, nomothetick,</hi> or <hi>architectonick power,</hi> but a Ministerial Stewardship only. Matth. 20: v, 25, 26. 2 Cor. 1: 24. 1 Cor. 4: D. 1 Pet. 5: 2, 3. 3 Epist. John. 9. The work of all Church Officers, is called <hi>a Ministery,</hi> Pastours, Doctores, yea Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Evangelists were appointed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the worke of the Ministery, Ephes. 4: 12. 2 Cor. 4: v. 5. Paul calls himself a fellow servant with Epaphras, Collos. 17. with Tichicus Collos. 4: 7. And calls Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters his fellow-souldiers and fellow-labores Philip. 4. 3.-2. 25-Rom. 16: 3.-2. The Bishops power inverts Christs rule, as to the <hi>gradation in point of censures and appealls,</hi> which is from one one to more, from the lesser
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104445:49"/>
number to the greater, from the Presbytery to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as from the Presbytery at Antioch, to the Synod at Jerusalem: Not to any one Apostle, Pop, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat; Whereas the last appeal and reference in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesian Mould, is <hi>to the Bishop.</hi> Our Lords rule is this in relation to the removeing of Scandales. First, tell the offending Brother Alone, then take two or three more, then if he be farder contumacious, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> the greater embodied court or Judicatorie, who have the official power of binding or lowseing. He bidds not toll it, <hi>uni,</hi> to one, but <hi>unitati,</hi> a multitud gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into one, for so the Greek word doth necessarly Import, whereas in the Diocesian sea, the gradation is from many to one Prelat, whose sole prerogative this highest censure, is. And with Prelatists the rule runns thus, tell two, or three, lastlie and finallie one Lord-Bishop: Which is point blank contrare to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rule. 3. The Diocesion Bishops power, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Pastoral pretended duties, <hi>as Diocesian Bishop</hi> are such as <hi>falls within he compass of no command,</hi> and which it is impossible to performe according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rules, which I prove thus. 1. The Prelat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their principles is the <hi>proper Pastor of the whole Diocess,</hi> for he being peculiarly <hi>Bishop of it,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat in order to his Episcopal inspection over the same (for to the participation of his power &amp; office, denoted by this term [Bishop of Edinburgh] &amp;c. He admitts non in the diocess, it being the characteristick of his Superioritie over Presbyters) &amp; withall, it including the wholl Ecclesiastick Authority both of order and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with in the Diocess; It followes of necessity that he is the sole and proper Pastor thereof according to this mould of Government. Now it being so, let it be considered. 1. That the trew Scripture etimon of <hi>Episcopus</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> imports all the Pastorall duties of feeding and ruling, and layes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104445:49"/>
the person under this relation and cloathed with this Office, to perform all these duties accordingly to these to whom he stands in that relation. 2 That its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the Bishop can feed, Rule, Oversee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Pastoral duties unto, and watch for the souls of all that large flock, in which, some hundereds of painful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pastores will find their hands full of work. So that the Bishop assumes a charge, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he can dischag or perform. 3. The Scripture allowes no <hi>Derivation</hi> or <hi>Deputation</hi> of the Pastores work and Office to which he is called of God, unto other subserviant Officers. Because God intrusts no man with any peece of Stewardship in his Family, but what he must both oversie and execut immediatly by himself, and is likewayes disposed and enabled to manage and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. God still conjoyneing the Office, gifts, and call together, for every peece of his work: Which the man that is intrusted with; and called unto, must himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly waite upon and attend Rom. 12. 7. and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust it to others for him. <hi>Hence</hi> 4. By clear conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it followes, that the Diocesian Bishopes work <hi>qua talis,</hi> is such, as he can neither mannage nor hath warrand from the great Shepherd to exercise or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. In the 4t. Place, the present Diocesian Bishop is a Person who is authorised to sitt in Parliament, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and other civil Judicatories, as a <hi>constituent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> therof: For they are restored to <hi>their places in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; civil pretended dignities,</hi> which places they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But so it is that all <hi>civill dominion,</hi> &amp; Magistraticall Rule, is expresly prohibit to <hi>Church Rulers,</hi> so that the Church Officer who is installed in these Offices, falls from Heaven to Earth. The Princes of the Gentiles exercise Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, and they that are great exercise autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie upon them, but it shall not be so among you. Matth. 20: 25, 26. This charge our Lord gave to his

Apostles and their Successors Pastores or Bishops, who are here forbidden all civill rule or Magistracy, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherof is properly a <hi>Dominion,</hi> and thus distinct <hi>toto coelo</hi> from the nature of Ecclesiastick Offices which is a Ministerial service or stewardship only. All our divines impugne from this text the popes civil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and the <hi>amphibius</hi> civily ruleing or dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prelat falls under the lash thereof.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Diocesian Bishops Office debases extraoadinarie Offices, in confounding them with the ordinary. That Timothy and Titus power layes no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Prelacy, cleared at large. The deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Prelacie from them, loaded with gross absurdites.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="8">VIII. THe Diocesian Bishops Office, is in this contrare unto the word, in that <hi>It debases the Apostolical and Euangelistick Offices, and confounds the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie &amp; extraordinarie functions &amp; administrations,</hi> which Scripture, Reason, &amp; all sound Divines doe diversifie &amp; distinguish. The Prelats Advocats, <hi>&amp; this new informer particularly,</hi> pleads for and derives the Episcopal prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence from <hi>the office and inspection of the Apstles and Euangelists,</hi> whom they affirme to have been properly &amp; formally <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the sense they take the Diocesian Bishop, and that the formal power and offices, which they exercised are to be <hi>continued still</hi> in the Church. That <hi>Timothy</hi> was formally constitut <hi>Bishop of Ephesus, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus of Crete, Iames of Ierusalem.</hi> And that the Prelats of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>is the same,</hi> and properly Succeeds them, and is as it were, <hi>A continuation</hi> of their office in a formal sense. Timothy's authority is is one maine ground which the Episcopal men at the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> also do plead to legittimat the Prelats office. This being clear, I say, this pretended Mould of the Diocesian Bishops Office and Authority, is lyable to the charge &amp; censure of debasing these holy extraordinarie functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and confounding them with the ordinary, which I prove, thus. 1. All sound protestant Divines do har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniously assert the extraordinary nature of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104445:51"/>
office as such, and likewayes of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, reckening the Apostles, Prophets, and Euangelists as the extraordinary New Testament Officers, whose proper formal Office, <hi>died with them, and admits of no succession:</hi> for thus they ordinarily defyne <hi>the Apostles,</hi> that they were Christs <hi>immediatly called and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily gifted universal Ambassadours, sent out, to lay every where the foundation of the Gospel Church, and to plant the Gospel government therein:</hi> Particularly <hi>Polanus</hi> in his <hi>Syntagma</hi> reckens up these as their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expired prerogatives (to which we will find this Informer in parte give assent.) 1. Their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat institution by Christ. 2. Their immediat mission to teach, (Paul had his from heaven.) 3. Their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal legation to found and plant Churches throw the world. 2 Cor. 11: 28.—4. Its visible badge, (viz.) the conferring of the Spirit by the laying on of hands. 5. Their extraordinary authority beyond any of their Successors, as being set over the whole Church &amp;c. Hence all the ingredients of their formal Office, as such, must needs be expired, And no Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer can be said to succeed them therein. Their <hi>Call</hi> was immediat, sure, non can succeed them in that. <hi>Their special</hi> or <hi>proper work,</hi> was to plant Churches and the Gospel-government in them, and set up their Officers, of all which Churches they were Ministers <hi>in actu exercits,</hi> sure no Church Officer could succeed them in this. Their <hi>Qualifications</hi> as such Ambassadours, were correspondent to this great work, (viz.) their gifts of miracles, gifts of tongues, Prophesie, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in Doctrin; Sure now can pretend to succeed them in this. <hi>Nixt,</hi> for the Euangelists, their Office was equally extraordinary, it consisting in <hi>a planetary motion,</hi> from place to place, to water where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles planted, to bring reports of the Churches state to the Apostles, and commissions from the Apostles to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104445:51"/>
them. Their various motions, <hi>pro re nata,</hi> upon &amp; down, even after these Epistles (wherein they are supposed to have receaved their Episcopal charge) were written to them; and the Scriptures absolut silence as to their ever returning to these Churches againe, besides the Apostle Pauls shewing expresly in these Epistles, <hi>their occasional transient employment</hi> in this places, and express <hi>recalling</hi> of them therefrom, to the further prosecution of their extraordinary employment, and in these very Epistles identifying the Office of the Bishop and Elder: All these clear grounds, I say, do evidently demonstrat that the <hi>work and office of Timothy and Titus</hi> as Euangelists, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and cannot be pretended unto by any ordinary Church Officer, it being an appendix as it were of the Apostolick charge, and supposing its exercise and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and the Churches then - infant state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Now, to make these high and extraordinary fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ordinary, and thus confound the two together, must be a very gross usurpation. 2. Hence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the Episcopal function (as above described in the quality, and mould of the Diocesian Bishop) will never be found in these extraordinary functions, either <hi>formaliter, or eminenter,</hi> and consequently it must be a gross belying of the Spirit of God, to pretend this in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of this usurped Office. First, The Episcopal Office will not be found in that of the Apostles or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelists <hi>formaliter.</hi> For these were <hi>universal unfixed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> set over no particular Church or Diocess: But were <hi>pro re nata</hi> to officiat to the whole Church as being (the Apostles especially) Officers thereof <hi>in actu exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito.

For it were strange if Timothy who was ordained by a Presbytrye wherein Paul himself was present, should notwithstanding usurpe prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over a Presbytery though inferior to ane Apostle. And that whereas Presbyters did concurr <hi>pari passu</hi> with a whole Presbytery of Apostles in every peece of a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Act and decree, yet that ane Euangelist inferior to any of the Apostles, should take Episcopal preheminence over a Presbytery. 2. The Apostles planted no such <hi>ordinary Officers</hi> in the Church, as had that <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> therefore the Episcopal Power was not transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them in the Church: And by further conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is not included in their Office <hi>eminenter.</hi> For it is evident, that in the first plantation of the Churches they fixed Presbyters, or Pastors, as their immediat Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor's in the Ministerial power, and likewise in their last farewel's into Churches, they committed unto these Pastors the ordinary power of government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least hint of <hi>a Super-institution</hi> of any officer of <hi>a higher order.</hi> Act. 20: 28, 29. Compared with 25. 1 Pet. 5: 2, 3. with 2 Pet. 1: 14—3. It was in respect of Paules ordinary Ministerial power, and in that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, that he had hands laid upon him by that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tety at Antioch, and was sent out with other commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners to that Synod at Jerusalem by them, which looked like a humble submission <hi>pro tanto,</hi> unto them, and is far from the Episcopal preheminence: since the Prelats dissoune all Subjection to the Prophes in greater or lesser assemblies. 4. The Prelats authority is this,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104445:52"/>
he is upon the mater the only proper Pastor of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, whose Episcopal inspection reaches Pastores and flocks both, as is above cleared. He is the fountaine from whom the power of order and Jurisdiction in the wholl Diocess, is deryved, and the exercise of both depends upon his Lordly disposal. Now, this is contrare both to the Apostles and Evangelists their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary power, contrare to <hi>its very nature in universum,</hi> their office being a declarative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive <hi>Ministerie</hi> onlie: And <hi>Dominion or Lordship</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discharged to all Apostles, and all Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers whatsoever.</p>

The Episcopal government is in this contrare unto the word; In that it cutts off Congte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations from all interest and right, in <hi>Calling there Pastor.</hi> For in this government, the Ministers mission, Call, Ordination, and Relation to such a people, over whom he is to officiat, flowes all from the Prelat. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall eldership have not the Least interestin it. Hence this power of calling Pastores was ranversed by our Parliament when prelacie was set up, and the old popish Custome of patronages was restored. The Prelat sends a man to the poor people as their Minister,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104445:53"/>
whom possibly they never sawe in the face. Now, this is contrare both to Scriptur and reason, contrare, to the practice of the apostolick Church. For 1. Even the deacons <hi>were looked out, and chosen by the people.</hi> Act. 6. 3. That the Apostles might ordaine and lay their hands upon them, and install them in their office with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick blessing: And if the people were to have so great ane Interest in choosing these men (though even the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who had infallible knouledge of qualifications, were present to ordaine them) that this trust of disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seing their Almes or charitie, might be committed to non but upon <hi>their consent &amp; choyce.</hi> Ergo, a fortiori, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have a far greater Interest as to their Consent and choyce of the man, To whom they are to Intrust their Soules conduct unto another world, which is of infinit more worth then all the Earthes treasures, And while the are no such infalible discerners of fitt persons to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat, as the Apostles were. If the Apostles would not set apart men for this meanest employment, without the Peoples-Consent <hi>&amp; looking them out,</hi> How absurd is it, that the highest ordinary officer [the Pastor] should be sent to officiat in that eminent office with out ther knowledge or Consent.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Wee find the chooseing and sending out of Church officers <hi>in this hie ministeriall employment,</hi> To have been upon the peoples consent and choyce: for Act. 14. The Elders or Ministers who were ordained <gap reason="foreign">

Nixt, If the Apostles would not ordaine the <hi>Deacons,</hi> but after this manner, much lesse Ministers unto such a weighty employment, since in ther faithfullnes the people are (as is said) infinitly more concerned. Besydes, the very Intimation, and litte, of the men out of whom a Successor to the Apostleshipe in the place of Judas, was by God immediatly to be chosen, was with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Consent, Therfor much more ought this to be in the ordination and admission of ane ordinary officer whose call is mediat and ordinarie. 3. The Scripture doeth clearly hold forth <hi>a congregational Church &amp; juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eldership, representing that Church.</hi> Which (besyes many other reasons add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Church,</hi> that is, throw all particular Churches Act. 14. 23. With Tit. I. 5. For if the Church is found to have had both ruleing and teaching Elders, Rom. 12. 8. 1. Cor 12. 28. 1. Tim. 5. 17. And upon the other hand, if these lesser Societies are called [Churches] It certanly followes that they had <hi>ane eldership &amp; rule in them.</hi> If ane eldership, and rulers, be allowed to rule and represent the Congregation in matters Ecclesiasticall, then by necessary consequence it followes, that the Call of the Pastor and Chieff elder
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104445:54"/>
and his choice, as most suteable to their condition, must fall within the compasse ofther Spiritual authority.</p>
               <p>Finally, the denying of this unto Congregations, &amp; the Episcopal arbitrarie obtruding of Ministers upon them without their call and consent, is in two great points, contrare unto divine Reason. 1. Unto that <hi>spiritual and near relation,</hi> which is betwixt a Minister and his flock, (which we will find this pamphleter after plead) which is certainly marriage like and very straite. And there being many <hi>peculiarduties,</hi> which they owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him beside others Ministers, all flowing from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, particularly a special reverence, obedience, and subjection; These must certanely suppose a voluntarie consent and call, and cannot be bottomed upon the meer will and pleasure of another, which cannot make up this relation 2, This denying of the peoples right to call their Pastor, is contrare unto that <hi>Iudgment of discretion, that spiritual discerning, and trying of the Spirits,</hi> which is allowed, yea &amp; enjoyned to the people of God; If in any thing a spiritual discerning must take place, surely in this especially, to whom a people doe intrust their soules direction and guidance; If in any thing a Christian must Act in Faith, and not give up his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion to ane implicit conduct, and thus become a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of men, sure it must be, in a mater ofso great weight as this is? If Christs sheep have this for their Character, that they knowe the voice of the trew She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd from the voice of the <hi>hyreling and stranger,</hi> from whom they will flie, Joh. 10: 4, 5. Sure their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and consent must interveen, in order to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of, and subjecton to their <hi>Shepherd?</hi> If they must not belive every Spirit, buttry the Spirits, sure this caution and tryal must be especially allowed <hi>in this case,</hi> that they admitt not a false Prophet instead of a trew? So then the Episcopal Government, is in this,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104445:55"/>
as in other pointes, chargeable with antichristian and anti-scriptural tyrannie over Christs flockes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Episcopal Government is in this contrare unto the Word of God (viz.) In denying, and cutting off from his administration, and the totall laying asyde of a singularely usefull Church officer appointed by Christ in his House (viz) <hi>the ruleing elder.</hi> That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which denies and layes aside, any of the great Master of the vine yeard, his servants and officers whom he hath authorized and appointed, must needs be highly derogatorie to his glory and contrare to his word; But such is Prelacie. The Prelats are like that sloathfull wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked servant who smites and beats away there fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants, while they eat and drink with the drunken. That Prelats disoun and exclude this officer, is evident both from their principles and practise. They all deny the divine warrand of this Church officer: And where Prelacy is established, he is excluded from Presbyteries and Synodes, and upon the mater also, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: For they deny and exclude all decisive suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage there, and take away all Authority of congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional elderships, as we seen. Now that this ruleing elder, distinct from both the preaching Presbyter, and Deacon, Is appointed by God, our Divines have made good from severall Scriptur grounds. Such as 1. From Rom. 12: 6, 7. Where among severall other Church officers which the Apostle doth enumerat, there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or he that ruleth. Here is ane ordinary Ruler, distinct from all other Rulers, and Church officers, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies <hi>Rule</hi> and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative power. Againe, he is ranked among <hi>ordinarie Officers,</hi> and so must needs be ane ordinary standing officer, yet stands distinguished from other ordinary officers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing both a <hi>distinct name</hi> from all the rest, likewayes a <hi>distinct worke,</hi> as being diversified from the <hi>teacher, the exhorter, and the giver.</hi> And moreover, a peculiar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104445:55"/>
as have likewise all the rest. So that from the circumstances of this place, the divine right of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, is clearly demonstrate. Nixt, That passage is pertinently improven for this purpose, 1 Cor. 12: 28. Where we read of <hi>helps, Governments,</hi> under distinct pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphes, clearly pointing out ordinary Governing Church officers, distinct from the elders that preach, and the Deacon, and all other Church Governoures whatsoever. They cannot be Governoures in the General, for what doth this among a particula enumeration of officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These are distinct from <hi>helps,</hi> distinct from the teaching elder, for he is already mentioned in this same vers. So here is a Rule, and Government, distinct from all governoures either civil or ecclesiastick, except this ruleing elder, yet set by God in the Church under the new Testament. But <hi>the third</hi> and most pregnant passage from which our divines doe demonstrat the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of this Church officer is that of the 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim. 5: 17. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and Doctrine. Here is a ruleing Church officer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the preaching elder: For here is a general, <hi>elders,</hi> Nixt, we have two distinct branches of these elders (viz) the <hi>ruleing elder,</hi> and the elder that both rules and <hi>laboures in the word and Doctrine,</hi> in the word as the <hi>Pastor,</hi> In the Doctrine as the <hi>teacher.</hi> Again they are diversified in two distinct participles and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, [ruling] is made the marke and characterick of the one (viz) Ruling only: <hi>And</hi> [both Ruleing and teaching] is made the marke of the other, whereby they are distinguished in <hi>their nature and office.</hi> But in the 3d. place, the forementioned distinction eminently appears in the discretive [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>especially]</hi> which is set betwixt these two kynds of elders, intimating that as there were some of these ruling elders who did labour in the <hi>word and Doctrin,</hi> so there were others who did
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104445:56"/>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> and not labour in the Word: Both were worthy of double honour, but <hi>especially</hi> the labourer in the word, over and above this ruling. And to this purpose it is well observed, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>especially,</hi> is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the new Testament made use of to distinguish one thing from another. As when it is said Gal. 6: 10. Let us doe good to all men, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>expecially,</hi> to these of the houshold of faith, hereby distinguishing soom that were of the houshold of faith, and some that were not. In which sense it is also used Phil. 4: 22. and 1 Tim. 5: 8, <hi>This precept,</hi> saith <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And trewly from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their were grave and good men chosen and approved, who did together with Pastores, by commune Councell &amp; authority admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Church Government, and were in some sort, censors for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of manners, which oustome Ambrose compleans to have worme out of use, by the negligence, or rather the pryde of teachers while they covet to rule alone.</hi> The pregnancy of this Scripture tramples into the dust the pitiful evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones of all the Prelatists in denying the divine right of this officer: Some of which we shall here take noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of, and the confutation of the same, offered by our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines upon this point. Some, by <hi>Ruleing well</hi> will have <hi>living well,</hi> to be understood: But the Apostle is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the office of <hi>ruling</hi> in a <hi>Church officer,</hi> ruling over others, not of ruling over a mans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

honour, double maintinance, due to living well, as here it is allowed to [ruling well] And this will say that the Minister that preaches not, is worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour for living well, which will make very harsh sense. Some understand this ruleing elder, of the [Deacon,] but the Deacon is no where called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or elder, his work being to help, to distribut, not to rule. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Rom. 12, 8 Some would being in under this [Ruler,] The <hi>ancient Superannuat Bishop;</hi> But this gloss will in honour preferr unto him, the diligent preaching Minister, which will wound their cause to death. Some, by the [Ruler] will have such understood as did administer Sacraments, but preached not: But Paul knew non of these <hi>non preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>seldom-preaching</hi> Ministers, far less would he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them a double honoure, who rather deserved the contrary. Paul will have all Ministers <hi>apt to teach,</hi> and able to convince. Some by the [ruling elder,] would have <hi>Inferior Magistrats</hi> understood, who were appointed for ending civil Striffes; but the Apostle is here prescrybing rules to <hi>Church office bearers,</hi> not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile rulers, and teaching Timothy how to cary in the Church. Againe, they had then no Christian civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, as all doe grant, and for their going to Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to compose their civil differences, Paul himself dissallowes it 1 Cor 6. Some againe will have the <hi>labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the word &amp; doctrine</hi> to be nothing else but ane expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>rulcing well;</hi> but this inadvertant gloss will set asyde <hi>My Lord Bishop as no good ruler.</hi> Againe, as is said, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>believing</hi> Others yet, by [labouring in the word and doctrine] will have a higher degree of labouring <hi>as to diligence,</hi> understood, yet so as both branches speak of labouring in the word and doctrin; But (as the <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Professoures</hi> doe well answer) this will allow double honour to the less-labouring or lazie elder, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves rather a double rebuke, the Lord requiring the the utmost faithful diligence, of all labourers in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyarde. Besides that this gloss justles out, and makes Superfluous, that clause of the verse viz <hi>in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which according to this exposition, should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been totally omitted, or added unto both the branches of this sentence. Some, to escape the dint of this text, invent yet another Shift [all Sort of Rulers; whither civil, ecclesiastick, or domestical, are worthy of double honour; so they sense the first branch, and say they, this General proposition the Apostle might premise to enforce the honour he enjoyns to the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the word, &amp;c.] But the context fully rejects this gloss, since the Apostle speaks not generally of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but of <hi>elders that rule well,</hi> and of such elders and rulers <hi>to all which</hi> he allowes double honour. So that this gloss will mak pitiful work, both in allowing the Churches <hi>honorarium,</hi> double honour, or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maintinance, to domestick Rulers; and likewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes will allow more honourable maintinance to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters then Magistrats. Some woulde, by the <hi>labourer in word and Doctrine,</hi> as distinct from the <hi>ruling elder,</hi> take in transient visiting Presbyters, distinct from fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preaches; but where will they shew us any such who were not Evangelists? Wee find that meer ordinary Presbyters, were ordained for several cities and places as there peculiar charges, whom they were fixedly to feed, Act. 14: 23. Tit. 1: 5. Act. 20: 28. But where find they such Presbyters as had no fixed charge. Neither can Evangelists be meaned (as Dr Burnet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104445:57"/>
would gladely shift it in his first Dialogues) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle all along speaking of ordinary preaching Presbyters. These, and several such like exceptions, the evidence of this text hath long since refuted; So that we may conclude solidely from what is said the divine right of this Church officer, and by consequence the horride Sacriledge and usurpation of Prelacie, in robbing Christs Church of the same: And likewise the Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish confusion, which this Antichristian Hierarchie hath introduced into our Church: both in divyding and maiming the Pastoral office, in bringing in offices which the <hi>Great Shepherd</hi> hath not allowed, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding and thursting our offices and officers which the hath ordained; upon which grounds, and upon all the preceeding, wee hope we may now safely conclude the <hi>Diocesian Prelat,</hi> existing among us, to be <hi>a plant which the father never planted,</hi> and consequently as a <hi>poisonus weed, to be rooted up.</hi>

               <p>In the 2d. Place, This Erastian prelatick mould of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment brings in many grosse encroachments upon the <hi>liberties</hi> of the gospell Church. As 1.

This mould will make the Civil Magistrat <hi>the proper immediat subject of the Keys,</hi> and Impartes all Church government to One, who, as such, is not so much as <hi>a Church member,</hi> and impowers him to give out this supposed fountaine power to no Church members, or to here enemies at his pleasure, As his Majesty gives to persons Civil the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of excomunication?

Finally, This will inferr, that Children, Heathens, yea women, may be chieff Church officers and heads of the Church too, since they may possesse the Crown of these Kingdoms, to which this Headship and Supremacy is annexed.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the Scriptur Land-markes, set to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Civil and Ecclesiastick Powers, which is cleared in several points. It is lyable to great absurdities.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the 4th place: This Erastian Government presumes to impeach <hi>the primitive Apostolick Church, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat constitution and faithfulness of Administration in relation to Government,</hi> and makes here to have had but a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive maimed constitution and authority thereanent, while the exercise of the civil power in her, was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Which charges a gross deficiency upon Christs prescriptions in relation to her Lawes and Officers: Which are found in Scripture, very full, and suited to her state and condition <hi>in all times</hi> until all the Elect be made up, and here warfare is accomplished; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, it impeaches Christs saithfulness and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as Mediatour, whose proper work this holy consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Erastian Prelacy takes away all the <hi>Scripture Landmarks and Limits,</hi> which are fixed therien by God, to distinguish the <hi>Civil and Ecclesiastick Powers and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and makes them every way the same, in all things wherein Scripture and Reason do distinguish them, both as to their <hi>Nature and Acts,</hi> and likewayes as to their <hi>Causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to their <hi>Nature,</hi> this Erastian Government doth confound them. 1. In that it makes the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> the Political and Ecclesiastical Societies, <hi>one and the same,</hi> which are formally distinct.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104445:62"/>
It being a visible profession that make a Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and outward habitation and subjection to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power, that makes a Subject; Which may be where there is no profession, and consequently no Church-membership. For in this mould, the Kings Government Civil, is Church Government, for it is <hi>his Government as King,</hi> in which capacity this Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick Supremacy is his prerogative, and his <hi>Ecclesiastick Government</hi> is also <hi>Civil Government,</hi> for it is his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the <hi>Supream Civil Magistrat:</hi> And thus the Church, respected by his government, is the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>&amp; vice versa.</hi> 2. This confounds the <hi>Officers</hi> of Church and State, which the Scriptur doth aboundantly distinguish. For, as is said, The Church had all her Officers of Christs appointment, when no Magistrat was a Member thereof; and on the other hand, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths had all their civil Rulers, before they became Churches; But in this Erastian Prelacy, this order is confounded, The chief Officers of this Church are the Magistrats Commissioners to Church and State; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Church Officers are given by Christ as Mediatour to his Church as a Church, 1 Cor. 12: Ver. 28.—3. <hi>The actings</hi> of civil and Ecclesiastick authority are thus confounded, Spiritual church Rulers <hi>Act onely in Spiritual matters</hi> by Gods appointment, and civil Rulers there immediat proper Acts <hi>are only in matters Civil.</hi> But here Church Officers <hi>are Parliament Commissioners,</hi> and civil Rulers in the high commission <hi>do excommunicat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe in the 2. place: This Erastian Prelacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds these two powers in their <hi>causes,</hi> which are wholly diverse. 1. The efficient cause is diverse, <hi>God as Creator,</hi> is Author of Magistracy, Rom. 13. But <hi>Christ as Mediatour</hi> appoints Church Government, Matt. 28: 18. But here, the Magistrat <hi>qua talis,</hi> is a suprem Church Ruler? And thus is supposed to have his power <hi>from Christ as Mediator and Head of his Church:</hi> Which is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104445:62"/>
ane opinion fully confuted by those who havewritten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Erastus,</hi> particularly <hi>Mr Gillespie</hi> in the <hi>Aarons Rod.</hi> 2. They differ in the <hi>material</hi> cause, the matter on which the two powers do act, are diverse: Ecclesiastick power doth act in the exercise of the <hi>Keys,</hi> the administration of the Word and Sacraments, having this for its proper <hi>Object and matter.</hi> The civil power consists in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and secular Sword; the one reaches the inward, the othere the outward man. But in this Erastian Prelacye, the, <hi>Sword and Keys,</hi> are made one, promiscuously u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and put into the same hands. 3. The two powers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their <hi>formal cause:</hi> the civil power is put forth in <hi>political punishments,</hi> the Ecclesiastick in <hi>spiritual censures.</hi> But here, the same power is the first <hi>Radix</hi> and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Spirituall Censures, and Civil punishments, and gives them their formal essence and being, as such. Finalie. The proper immediat <hi>end</hi> of Civil power is the <hi>Temporal, External, political peace</hi> of the commonwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2. 3. But the <hi>proper end</hi> ofEcclesiastick power, <hi>Is the Churches Spiriual good and edification</hi> as such, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. and 13. 10. But here, the Magistrat <hi>quatalis,</hi> being the Churches head, these ends are Confounded. These and several such like arguments are made use of by our writers against <hi>Erastus,</hi> which doe fully evince the unlawfulnes of this Erastian prelacie.

               <p>TO come now to examine what this new Dialogist, hath produced in defence of the present prelacie established amongst us, And to examine his ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to our plea against it; We shall not stand upon the trifling debate about the personal good qualities of some that have been prelats, with which Hee prefaces this Dialogue, it being altogether extrinsick to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion anent the lawfulnes of the <hi>office it self,</hi> And would be no argument in our case against him, as this man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge, else Hee must give up the cause, upon his concession of the Unquestionable eminent pietie, and integritie, of many burning and Shining lights, who have been the Lords Constant witnesses against prelacie.

In making this the State of the Question [what Bishopes were in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church] wheras the true State of our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, is, <hi>whither the prelat now existent in this Church, be a Scripture Bishop and consonant therunto, Or, ane officer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Christ in his house, Yea or not.</hi> And not whither there have been Bishops, or such as we now have, in the ancient Church. The Question is not of the mater of <hi>fact,</hi> but of the <hi>right,</hi> yea and <hi>the divine right</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent prelats in relation to their power. 2. In stating the difference betwixt the Bishop he pleads for, and the Pastor, Hee Smoothes it over in this general, [whither there have been such Bishopes, as have had <hi>a Superioritie over ordinarie Ministers]</hi> but doth not explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne what that <hi>Superioritie</hi> is which he pleads for, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of order or jurisdiction, or both; whither specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or graduall; Whither a Superiority of meer presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, or of principality; The [Episcopus preses, and princeps] sharing in this general name. Dolus latet in generalibus: Since there have been various Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>de facto,</hi> He should have particularized that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority which He undertaks to defend. 3.

The present prelat existent in Scotland, having such a dominion over Church Judicatories, and lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in Civils, as is above exprest, and derving all his power from the Magistrat in Ecclesiastick, as well as in Civil rule, He should have Stated his Question thus distinctly, and then fenced for <hi>his great Diana.</hi> But the man probably found this a taske which be durst not undertake: which appears immediatly after, in his decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the debate anent the Bishopes Civil rule, telling us, [That he will make it none of his worke to debate with us, their acting in Civil affairs, Sometimes] But 1. Since he undertaks the patrocinie and defence of Episcopacie now established among us, And in his preface professes it his designe to prove it lawfull, and therby to take off one of our arguments for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from Conformists, And it being likewayes Certaine that the present prelats are Civil rulers. He must either undertake this debate, or acknowledge them <hi>unlawfull pro tanto</hi> at least?

In Undertaking only tos plead for their <hi>acting Sometimes,</hi> which (as I said) i far from the point and matter of fact, which he must defend. 3. In confessing at the foot of the page [That Church men should not <hi>needlesslie, or of Choice,</hi> intangle themselves in these incumberances] wherin he palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie contradicts himself as to his Scope. For doe not our prelats of <hi>most free choice and deliberatly</hi> assume State Imployments? Or are their shoulders burdened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their will with these State honoures? Besydes, He cites 2. Tim. 2. 4. In acknowledging this intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement in wordly affaires, to be unlawfull in Church men; The text sayes, no man that warreth entangleth himself in affaires of this life. Now, if this text dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge universally, and absolutly, a Ministers intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in wordly affaires, How comes he to <hi>foist</hi> in his <hi>limitation</hi> of <hi>[needlesly, or of Choice]</hi> where is this <hi>limitation</hi> in the <hi>text?</hi> If all intanglements or in cumberances, as such, be unlawfull, as is here expressly asserted, as being inconsistant with the <hi>nature and importance</hi> of the Ministers Spirituall function, which requires the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test abstractednes from all worldly things, and the mans constant <hi>waiting upon, and giving himself wholly unto</hi> the things of God; Then surely whither he intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle himself by choice, or not, it is still <hi>ane intanglement,</hi> and consequently sinful; his acting deliberatly is butane agravation. Againe, since He maks ane intanglement <hi>Of choice, to be a needles intanglement,</hi> and consequently sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, He must needs acknowledge that such is the present prelatick medling, which, as is said, He cannot deny to be most deliberat and of choice. But nixt, If He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our prelats State-actings unlawfull? Then 1. Why doth He not <hi>interminis</hi> acknowledge so much, and not lisp it half out? 2. Why doth He alleadge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104445:65"/>
from Scripture precedents to prove it warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? But Let us hear his Scripture arguments wherby He would prove this State acting lawfull. His first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is [That the jewish <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> made up of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinty elders, Moses assistants in Civill government, did consist partly of priests] where 1. Wee see He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines his point, and overstretches himself in his pretended proofe, for the <hi>These</hi> he undertaks to prove, is, [That Church men may act in State matters, though not <hi>of Choice,</hi> and so that it be <hi>Sometimes only]</hi> which he cannot but distinguish from a <hi>Constant official med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> if he speak sense. And to prove this, He brings ane instance of priests under the old Testament-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, their being <hi>constituent members of a civil court?</hi> Now, how doe these quadrat? Were not these priests to act <hi>deliberatly and of Choice?</hi> If this prove any thing at all it will prove that Ministers (as being such members) may deliberatly and of choyce involve themselves in Civill affairs, which this man holds to be discharged 2. Tim. 2. 4. And so this Reason, because proving too much, and beyond his assertion, proves just nothing. 2. As we cleared above, the difference betuixt the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Ecclesiastick <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and that those Sevinty, mentioned in the 11. Numbr. who were chosen for the government of the Commonwealth, are distinct from those mentioned Exod. 24. Who were Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and not Civil officers; So it is more then this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former hath offered proof of, that there were priests in that Civil Court, since as is said, the Two Sanhedrins Civil and Ecclesiastick, did consist of distinct members, and there was not one Sanhedrin only, as this man seems to suppose. But 3. Though the concurrence of some preists in that Civill Court, were granted, Our writers have abundantly cleared the inconsequence of any argument drawn from that instance as to this point, In that though the Civil and Ecclesiastick
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104445:66"/>
Sanhedrin, were distinct originaly, Yet the judiciall Civil law being given immediatly by God to the jewes, as well as the Moral and Ceremonial, the priests by consequence, under that dispensation, had a most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary interest as to its <hi>interpretation &amp; decision</hi> in many cases, for the law was to be sought at their mouth. The difference of which condition of the <hi>jewish,</hi> from that of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church (Spread over the world, and in Countreys where are different moulds of Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and lawes, and which are not tyed to that judicial law) doth cast the ballances and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his argument. As for that of deutr. 17. Wee have seen how it holds out a Twofold <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> which had distinct <hi>members, acts, and objects.</hi> In a word, if his argument from this instance were good (upon his supposition that priests were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in that Court) it would prove that Christians could not have a lawful civil Supreme Judicatorie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Ministers were constituent members thereof? And that Ministers were essentially &amp; necessarly <hi>ex natura of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii</hi> (as these priests) constituent members of civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories? which is more then he dare assert, and the absurdity thereof is above cleared. His 2d. Ground is drawn from [the examples and instances of Eli the Priest who judged Israel fourty years, and of Samuel the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who, though lent to the Lord from his birth, yet went in circuit yearly judging the people] But 1. The force of this reason leaning upon ane <hi>example</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Church officers under the old dispensation, and the <hi>gratis supposed imitablenes</hi> thereof, it is (like the other argument) very unsound and lax. He will not dare to averr that every deduction <hi>a facto ad jus,</hi> is sound; All scripture examples, are for our <hi>improvement,</hi> but not for our <hi>imitation.</hi> Even good and laudable Acts of the Saints, are of this nature, many of them. Some were heroical, as Elias bringing fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104445:66"/>
which the Lord discharged James and John to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitat. Phinehas his Act, he will say with his Master the surveyer, was of this nature. Some Acts did flow from ane extraordinarie emergent of Providence, and a call flowing therefrom, as Abrahams attempt to offer his Son, Israels borrowing from the Egyptians and not paying. Some Acts had their issue from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient and occasional junctur, procuring a necessity pro tunc, as Pauls preaching <hi>gratis,</hi> and working with his hands. Some acts were to confirme a special extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary call, So our Lords fourty dayes fast, and that of Moses his tipe. Now, to conclud from the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed instances, the lawfulness of these Acts (viz) Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Children, borrowing and not paying, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <hi>quadrantum</hi> &amp;c, This Informer will grant to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor and childish Sophristrie, yet such is his reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here. 2. Divines doe tell us that these examples only are imitable, whose ground and scope are of a <hi>moral nature,</hi> which the persons did, as saints or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: such are all examples of morall standing duties enjoyned in the commands. They tell us. 3. That there are two Rules necessarly to be observed (and which this Informer must of necessity grant) as to a conclusion, ab <hi>exemplo ad factum,</hi> or <hi>a facto ad jus,</hi> which cutts the sinnews of his argument here. 1. No <hi>example</hi> which crosses <hi>a morall precept</hi> can ground a Rule, for this would make the Rule crosse it self. And to bring this neer the point in hand, I will shew, that <hi>this Informer</hi> fights against himself, and must needs admitt this answer, from the very mould of his argument: For he thinks to imforce the Instance from Samuel his civill actings, by telling us that <hi>he was lent to the Lord from his mothers womb:</hi> Which will say, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his pleading, That a man though singularly devoted to God in the sacred Ministry, yet may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly and of choice become a civil judge, yea
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104445:67"/>
a supreme civil judge; and then I would know, how he will reconcile this with the great gospel precept 2 Tim. 2: 4. Which himself pleads as discharging deliberat medling in civil affairs, because the sacred Ministery is a warfare, or a dedication of the Minister to the service of Christ? And what will he say if one shall argue thus, if a Minister, though dedicat to the Lord from his mothers womb, may notwithstanding become a civil judge, then the Ministry its being a warrfare under Christ, cannot hinder a mans medling by choice in civill affaires, which notwithstanding he denyes: So that either he must disown this Instance, or his sense of that Gospell precept. But of this againe. 2. No <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of Acts done from ane <hi>extraordinary calling &amp; gifts,</hi> are to be imitated by such as have <hi>neither the one, nor the other.</hi> Wee will find our <hi>Informer</hi> afterward grant this in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Apostles, &amp; that there are many things depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon special emergents that are not imitable in them. And if he should deny this Rule, as he will contradict himself, so he will not evite a great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience from the fact of Phinehas, from <hi>Ehud,</hi> &amp;c. Incase some person of a boistrous heart, and unruly hand, should plead these instances to offer violence unto him. Be side, if this rule be not admitted, he will brangle the boundarie and limits of <hi>different ordinary callings,</hi> (and relations by consequence) which the God of order hath fixed. The examples of <hi>Magistratical</hi> or <hi>Ministeriall duties,</hi> obliges not <hi>privat persons</hi> to ane imitation; The Apostolick Acts of working Miracles, giving the Spirit by laying one of hands, universal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed preaching (he will grant) are not imitable (as neither the peculiar duties of Relations among privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, doe obleige every one) because these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts and callings are now gone: And so say I of these examples of Eli, and Samuel, who are by all sound divines ranked among <hi>the judges</hi> whose call and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104445:67"/>
is acknowledged to have been <hi>extraordinary;</hi> God keeping at that time the regal rights in his own hand., befor he set up any fixt ordinary Rulers and Kings, and creating, &amp; calling extraordinarly, his owne deputies in the Government, sometimes out of one tribe, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes out of another, whose authority died with themselves and admitted of no succession. Wherefore <hi>Gideon</hi> told the people that God was their King, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that office when offered; and the peoples guilt in wearing of this holy immediat Government of God himself, and desiring a King, is aggravated from this, That they had rejected God who was their King. So that his argument from these <hi>extraordinary</hi> instances, is wholly inconcludent; it being from ane <hi>extraordinary,</hi> to ane <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling,</hi> from ane extraordinary <hi>factum,</hi> to ane ordinary <hi>jus;</hi> which is consequence we will find himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward disown. And if he straine these instances, they will prove too much, (viz.) That Ministers may be <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>supreme civil judges;</hi> which I believe he will not adventure to plead for, since what ever thanks he may merite for this from the Pope, yet Royalists will allow him none.</p>
               <p>If, in a matter so plain and evident, it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to adduc testimonies of writers and commentators (as this informer doth to no purpose) how harmonious would their consent appear unto this truth. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Annot: in their preface upon the book of judges, will tell him that <hi>the judges were not ordinary Magistrats, but extraordinarly called of God in times of great extremity &amp;c.</hi> And in their preface on the first book of Samuel, they shew, that it containes rhe History <hi>of the two last judges, Eli, and Samuel,</hi> and of Saul the first King of Israel. And upon that place, Chap. 7: 15, 16. Anent Samuels judging of Israel, notwithstanding of his being lent to the Lord from his birth, 1 Chap. 28. They will Inform this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer [thatas thiswas the jurisdictionof a judge, whichGod called him unto all the time of saul,—so, <hi>he was quo</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104445:68"/>
                  <hi>bound by his Mothers vow,</hi> Chap. 1. Whereby he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the service of the sanctuary, to continue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence there, both because God had forsaken it for the sins of the Priests, and also, <hi>because the Lord himselfhad ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him off from that levitical service, and called him to another imployment, namely, to be a holy Prophet and a judge over his people,</hi> which places he could not discharge, if he had been confined to a settled place.] The du ch. Annot: in the argument of the book of judges, describe them [to be such persons, not (who administred <hi>the ordinary function of judges</hi> among the people, as the Word is other where taken, but) whom God now and then as the state of Israel required, sometimes out of on tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, sometimes out of another, <hi>extraordinarly raised, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and with his Spirit of wisdome and couradge endewed &amp;c.</hi> In the argument, of the first book of Samuel, they shew that therin is described the Government <hi>of Samuel as judge over Israel &amp;c]</hi> So that until our Informer shall instruct the Prelats extraordinary call from God, and also their extraordinary enduements for civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, these instances of Eli and Samuel, will not [in the Judgment of these divines] afford them the least shaddow of warrand for there civil offices. So this man may be ashamed that he ever mentioned such an argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> That Hee is in the breers of a contradiction here, is (as is hinted) evident, in that to prove that Church men should not ofChoice medle inCivil affaires, he gives this reason, <hi>for, no man that warreth intangleth himself with the affaires of this life.</hi> 2. Tim. 2. 4. Now, if this <hi>[for]</hi> or illative here, signifie any thing, and be not nonsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, this He must be supposed to hold, that, this text forbids Church men all deliberat medling in Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. But will He dare to say that Samuel and Eli their judging of Israel was not <hi>deliberat</hi> and of <hi>Choice,</hi> Ergo, It was sinfull by this rule; Yet he ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104445:68"/>
for its imitablenes as lawfull; though a deliberat involving themselves in Civil government, yea a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme rule; and thus holds it not cross to this gospell precept. So that to escape this <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Charybdis,</hi> He hath no imaginable refuge but one; (viz.) To assert with us, their extraordinarie Calling for what they did, and that singular old Testament-dispensation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they stood. But then He must quit his plea for prelats civil Imployments from this Instance, and confesse it to be inconcludent.</p>
               <p>But for the new Testament times, he tells us. <hi>How much Bishops were employed in Civill affairs, when Emperours became Christian, as Smectymnuus confesses.</hi> But 1. Since he pretends Scripture Instances under the old Testament, his new Testament Instance is very <hi>apochryphal and heterogeneus</hi> therunto, being of Bishops medling three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered years, after the Canon of the Scripture was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <hi>Humano Capiti cervicem pingere equinam.</hi> But his new Testament precept 2. Tim. 2. 4. Chased away the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Bishops medling in civill affaires, Three or four Hundred years forward. Nixt, I would know whither our <hi>Informer</hi> holds these Bishops medling in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs, to be lawfull or unlawfull? Iflawfull, and consisting with their Calling (which He would seem to insinuat in telling us, that <hi>Saravia defends at large,</hi> (even simply and absolutly) <hi>Church mens medling in state affaires)</hi> Why then doth he tell us in the nixt page <hi>That the fathers compleaned of this as aburden?</hi> Sure they were very froward to fret under a peece of lawfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.

And what will <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> acknowledgment of the <hi>factum</hi> import, to infert <hi>His,</hi> or <hi>Our</hi> acknowledgment of the <hi>jus.</hi> He tells us likwayes, <hi>That ancient Councells [upon the ground mentioned,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>of a Ministers sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full intanglement] discharged them to follow Militarie imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>

And from hence I infer, two things against him. 1. He setts these <hi>Councils</hi> by the eares with his <hi>Scriptur instances.</hi> For since they condemne these formentioned civil employments upon that ground, 2 Tim. 2: 4. As a sinful intanglement in a Church officer 3 he must either say, that they condemned these old-Testament Instances of the Priests, of Samuel and Eli, as sinful: Or else acknowledge, that they held them (with us) to be extraordinary, and no regular precedents. 2. It will hence follow, that these Councils doe condemne <hi>Saravia,</hi> who (he tells us) <hi>doth at some length defind Church mens acting in State assaires.</hi> And <hi>Saravia</hi> condemnes and disputs against these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; and then, it will be a pussing problem to him, to which of them he will adhere in this contest; since he holds, with these councels, upon that ground, 2 Tim. 2: v. 4. the unlawfulness of Ministers deliberat invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves in civil affaires, it seems be quites there great <hi>Advocat Saravia,</hi> and all his pleading upon this point; For he tells us of no <hi>limitation</hi> in <hi>Saravia</hi> his pleading for Ministers meddling in State affaires. As for what followes in this page, he obscures and shifts the point here inquestion, in saying, <hi>That it is hard to call it simply unlawful, and in every case, to medle in these things.</hi> We know there is a lawful <hi>Concional</hi> medling, &amp; also in way of <hi>Ministerial advice,</hi> unto the Magistrat in order to the satisfaction of his conscience, the Ministerial direction whereof is the Pastours work, at whose mouth Gods
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104445:69"/>
mynd must be sought, and likewayes by way of <hi>ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial testimonie</hi> against what is sinful in state Rulers, which is all that our principles do own as to Ministers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing in state affaires in our late times; but he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish this, from <hi>accnstant official medling as a civil Iudge, and constituent Member in civil Indicatories,</hi> is very blinde; And as stupid that man were, who could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish this from the privat <hi>domestick care</hi> mentioned, 1 Tim. 5: 8. Which is a part of that <hi>Eiconomie</hi> founded uonp the Law of nature, and competent to a Minister as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Family, who is to govern and <hi>rule his house</hi> under that notion. Yet we must here tell him, that Gods allowing the Minister his <hi>honorarium,</hi> or <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> is for this very end, that he may not by any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretch of the domestick case, be taken off from his holy imployment.</p>
               <p>Here, we shall offer to this <hi>Informers</hi> grave judgment, the Reasons of the <hi>Assembly</hi> 1638. <hi>Sess</hi> 25. against the civil Offices of Ministers. [1. Christs notable example Luk. 12: 14. Refusing to deal in a civil cause; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are his Ambassadours sent by him, as he was by the Father, Joh. 20: 21. Joh. 8. He would not sentence that woman who deserved death. 2. Civil Rule is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to Apostles, Matth. 20: v. 25, 26. not only Supreme which is competent to Princes, but subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat also: Citing that passage of <hi>Bernard to Eugenius, Lib</hi> 2. <hi>Apostolis interdicitur dominatus, ergo, tu tihi usurpare aude, aut dominans, Apostolatum aut Apostolicus, dominatum Dominion is discharged to Apostles, Go thou therefore and dare to usurp to thy self, whither the Apostleship, if holding a civil dominion, or being Apostolick a civil dominion.</hi> Where theyrefute the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Episcopal &amp; Popish evasion as to <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. 3. That Ministers having given up their names to this holy warfare, they ought not to be involved in things of this life, as the law denyes this to souldiers. C. d. Lib: 2. Tit 13, So the Apostolick law, 2 Tim. 2: 04.

This work tobe heavier then that any man can be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it alone 2 Cor. 2: 16. Hence Ministers are called watchmen, labourers, souldiers, fishers, &amp;c. 4. The Apostles, for all their extraordinarie gifts, were not fit for serving tables and preaching the word both, Act 6. although these were both <hi>ecclesiastick functiones;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore farr lesse can any Minister now assume both eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick and civil offices. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 1. <hi>(cited by Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianin Decreto dist:</hi> 89<hi>—Cap. Singula.)</hi> proves that two ecclesiastick offices are not to be committed to one, from that place of the Apostle Rom. 12: 6: 7. As it is unbeseeming that in mans bodie, one member should Act the part of another. The 6th. of the Canons cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apostolick, appoints that the Bishop or Presbyter assuming civil places, be deposed (which will make fearfull Mass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Cyprian. lib: 1, Epist. 9. sayes, that long before, It was appointed in a Councel of Bishopes, that none appoint in his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one of the Clergie, a Tutor or Curator, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do singuli divino sacerdotio honorati, non nisi altari &amp; sacrificiis, precibus &amp; orationi vacare debent. Since every one honoured with the divine priesthood, ought not to attend but to the Altar and Sacrifices, to prayer and preaching, for its written, no man that warrs &amp;c. Clemens</hi> the 1. (whom many make Bishop of Rome, and out of whose writings, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ecclesiastick history after the Actes of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, they affirme, must be made up) in the Epistle to James the brother of the Lord, whom they make a Bishop, hath these words, <hi>neque judicem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aut cognitorem secularium negotiorum, te ordinare vult Christus, ne praefoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus presentibus hominum curis, non possis verbo Dei vacare, &amp; secundum veritatis regulam, secernere bonos a malis. impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis tibi crimen est, neglectis verbi Dei studiis, sollicitudines suscipere seculares.</hi> That is, <hi>neither will Christ ordaine thee a judge and arbiter of civill affaires, lest being involved in the</hi>

For this were to mix together things which cannot be mixed, that is, to confound Civill maters with Sacred.</hi> See severall others cited by the assembly, and recorded in the <hi>Historiamotuum,</hi> pag. 283, 284. Where there is ane Answer to the objection drawen from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins</hi> practise, and from that of 1. Cor. 6. 4.</p>
               <p>The informer comes nixt (page 5.) to his defence of the <hi>Episcopall office it self,</hi> But still goes on in the mist of confused generalls, never condescending upon the nature, power, and extent of the diocesian Bishopes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it is now established by law. However, let us remember that our present prelat is, according to our law [Ane ordinary Church officer, assuming the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of some Hundereds of Congregations, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized in him, and conveyed according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur, unto the Ministers therof; Having sole power in ordination, and jurisdiction, and a negative voice in Church judicatories, &amp; whose proper worke is <hi>Ruleing only,</hi> not feeding by doctrine] This is the Bishop which all his pleading must be commensurat unto, else He but beats the Air. 1. The <hi>Doubter</hi> alleages [The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfullnes of the Episcopall office for want of ane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse warrand for it in the word] To which He answers <hi>[By granting that this will prove it to be not simply necessare, but not unlawfall, since it may be lawfull and expedient as falling under some generall; as the command of decencie and order, will warr and a Moderator and Clerke, although this be no where commanded.

He grosly mistaks the Import of these relatives, <hi>a command,</hi> and the <hi>necessitie</hi> of a thing flowing therefrom, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricting it to ane <hi>expresse warrand</hi> or command: there being many things necessarie, <hi>necessitate precepti,</hi> which have no expresse warrand or command. Divines doe tell us, that Scripture commands are either <hi>immediat,</hi> or <hi>mediat;</hi> the immediat, are either <hi>explicit,</hi> or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse terms, enjoyning a thing: as [honour thy father and thy mother] or <hi>implicit,</hi> holding out, either that which is comprehended in the command, as suetable midses leading to the dueties enjoyned, or deduced by consequence from what is expressed; As Ministers preaching is deduced by consequence from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thereanent which the Apostles got<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>: the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the command pointing out this to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall duetie of Church officers. Againe 2. There are <hi>divine commands</hi> which are <hi>mediat,</hi> comming mediatly from God, but immediatly from men, by a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the generall divine principle, and ane application therof to particulares: which they illustrat by that passage where Paul sayes, <hi>to the rest speak I, not the Lord,</hi> applying Gods generall command anent divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, to the Corinthians particular case. There are likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se [mediat accidental commands,] deduced from Gods generall Rule, upon rare transient occasiones, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating to such a determination: So the abstaining from blood and thinges strangled, was enjoyned (Act. 15.) to the gentiles, and as necessarie upon the ground of Charitie when the use grew scandalus, although the law hereanent was abrogat, as being originallie Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall. Hence we may Inferr, that this Informer in denying <hi>the necessitie</hi> of what is commanded only <hi>under some generall head,</hi> Cutts of from the Categorie of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104445:71"/>
things necessarie, all the duties in the decalogue, which are subserviant to the duties <hi>expressly named:</hi> and thus destroyes the Spirituality and extent of the law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all divines; yea Cuts off all necessarie Scripture consequences, and duties founded therupon: as Ministers preaching the gospell, administring the Seales, Infant baptism, womens receaving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Christian Sabbath &amp;c. But (to come neerer him) in the Nixt place, I suppose this man will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, That there are many things sufficiently discharged, and consequently unlawfull by Scripture rule, because theyare not commanded either mediatly or immediatly, and that all ordinances of worship, Sacraments, and the substantialls of government also, doe require <hi>clear divine commands and institutions,</hi> by the acknowledgement of all protestant divines; So that the not commanding of any part or supposed ingredient therof, is a sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, discovering the thing superadded to be sinfull. Not that which seems good unto thee, shalt thoudoe to the Lord thy God but what He hath commanded, thou shalt add nothing thereunto, nor diminish from it. adde thou not to his words lest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. In vaine they doe worship me teaching for doctrines the commandements of men. See, deut. 4. 2. prov: 30. 6. rev: 22. 18. deut: 12. 32. Isay. 29: 13. These Scriptures do clearly fortifie this principle: Otherwayes if he deny this, He will open a door to all popish supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea &amp; deny the very definition of it assigned by all sound divines, in calling it, <hi>ane opposite extrem (in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess) to true religion, adding to Gods worship beyonde what is commanded.</hi> Our Lord reprehended the pharisees their washing of hands befor dinner (a decent ceremonie in it self) as simply unlawfull, when they made it a point of Religion, Because it was <hi>beyond the command.</hi> That text Isay. 29: 13. In vaine they worhsip me, teaching for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104445:72"/>
doctrinés the commandements of men] is applyed in this case unto them. Our answer to the Papists demand [Where finde we their bastardSacraments, and other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiones discharged] is, That they are discharged as sinfull in Gods worship, because not commanded: Should they rejoyne with this man, that this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve them to be not simpy necessarie, but not unlawfull, upon the ground which He alleages, let him conjectur what his answer would be, and correct himself. For the substantials of government, He cannot but grant that they fall under the same consideration; It being most certain, and universally acknowleged, that the Scripture layes down rules as to the excercise of both Keyes of Order and jurisdiction, the officers and censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the Church. Nay, himself asserts page. 118. <hi>That the substantials of government and policie of the Church are utterly necessarie and unalterable.</hi> Now it being thus, the Question is [whither the diocesian Bishop, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal government, be among those things which must either have a clear Scripture institution or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, or else is to be rejected as sinfull and unlawfull] That the diocesian Bishop is such, I prove it thus: the Bishop which He pleads for, is supposed by him to be a Church officer distinct from, and Superior to a Pastour or presbyter, haveing a distinct worke, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and qualifications; Therfore, say I, Hee must either have clear warrand or institution in the word, or Hee is unlawfull. The consequence leans upon these clear Scripture grounds. 1. This officer cannot but fall in among <hi>the substantials of government,</hi> wherin the Scripture is full and perfect (as himself acknowleges) So as to make even the man of God, perfect: It is full in setting down all administrations relating so the Key of order, as prayer and thanksgiveing, 1. Tim. 2. 1, 2. 1. Cor. 14. 14, 15. Singing of Psalmes, preaching of the word, publick reading of it, and Cathechiseing,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104445:72"/>
falls within the compasse of Christs commands and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, Collos. 3. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 15, 16. Ephes. 5. 19. 2. Cor. 3. 14. Matth. 28. 19, 20. 2. Tim. 4. 2. Hebr. 6. 1, 2. So doth the administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, Matth. 28. 18, 19. 1. Cor. 11. 23. And as these administrations of <hi>the Key of Order,</hi> so all the administrations relating <hi>to the Key of jurisdiction or discipline,</hi> falls under Christs clear institutions. Such as Ordination. Tit. 1. 5. 1. Tim. 4. 14. <hi>The dogmatick power,</hi> as to Ministeriall judgeing of doctrine. Act. 15. <hi>The critick power,</hi> as to the publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and purging out of the Scandalous, and receaving of the penitent. Matth. 18. 15, 16. 1. Thess. 5. 14. Compared with Matth. 16. 19. John. 20. 21. So <hi>the diatactick power,</hi> in relation to Ritualls and and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumstances, is clearly asserted and rules laid downe anent its exercise 1 Cor. 14. And as the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, ordinances, and acts of Church government, So the <hi>administratores, officers, yea and Courtes</hi> falls under clear Scripture warrands and institutiones. Pastoures, Doctores, Elders, Deacons, their severall works, the greater and lesser Church judicatories, have their clear warrand, 1. Tim. 4. 14. Matth. 18. 17. Act. 15. 1. Cor. 12. 28. Ephes. 4. Now let this <hi>Informer</hi> shew me a reasone of this distinctnes, If not to point out all the substantialls of government? and if it be lawfull to add any <hi>new officers, or administrations, or ordinances, to these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly warranted?</hi> He dare not say but is unlawfull; therfore say I, upon the same ground, that hee shall acknowledge this to be unlawfull, this eminent officer, the Bishop or Arch-Bishop, must either produce his warrand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, among the forementioned Rules, or he must be holden unlawfull. 2. The Scripture coming this length in the forementioned condescendencie in point of Church government, as to Ordinances, Officers, Lawes, Censures, Courtes &amp;c, it must needs amount
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104445:73"/>
to determin <hi>Some species of government,</hi> and presbitery, and Episcopacie, being of contrary moulds, it must needs appointe and authorize the One, and discharge the other. For all Church offices and officers have a positive institution. 1. Cor. 12. 28. <hi>God hath sett &amp;c.</hi> Ephes. 4. 11. <hi>God hath given &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 12. 6, 7. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>not given</hi> is not <hi>a gift of grace.</hi> And surely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand [not to add to the word] includes a command not to add new spirituall officers, who must have a new work &amp;c. And the Bishops authority must either be comprehended among the rules anent these officers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umerat, and the exercise of their power, or he is an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Christ exercising ane external <hi>visible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> over his Church visible, and all Church officers, and their administrations, being <hi>in his name and authoritis</hi> as is above cleared, <hi>every Church officers mission and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> must be found in his word, other w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Surely not, and so the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104445:73"/>
case is here. <hi>Finallie.</hi> The ground and reasone which he builds this shifting evasion upon [viz. That many things are not otherwayes commanded, then under some generall: as that all things be done decently or to edification, instancing in the moderator and Clerk of a meeting of Ministers] is very poor: For since the authority which God gave Paul was <hi>to edification,</hi> &amp; all ordinances which have the most clear institution, must be thus qualified, and to this end, that which is not <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes commanded then under this generall,</hi> must needs be the <hi>alterable circumstances only,</hi> commone to Civill and Sacred actions, and such as supposes the thing it self, cloathed with these circumstances, to be <hi>[that which is to be done,]</hi> and by consequence falling <hi>Hactenus</hi> under the Compasse of a <hi>command</hi> or <hi>institution;</hi> for it is these only which are left to the regulation of Christian prudence, according to the generall rules of the word. But, as we have above cleared, such ane eminent Church officer as the Bishop is supposed to be, or any Church officer, can be no such circumstance, but is such a substantiall point of government as requires a clear and positive warrand, or else must be holden unlawfull; and this he must acknowledge or contradict himself, for He da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not say but that Church officers are other wayes commanded then under this generall, and himself alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the prelats divine institution: &amp; so He can be none of these things which hath only this generall warrand. Besides, I would know, if He will say that this officer, the prelat, must be sett up and Act with decencie and order; surely He will not deny this: If then the prelat himself is but a peece of [decentie, and order] (as being only commanded under that notion, and a species under that generall) then he sayes that [order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie] must be managed &amp; cloathed with [order and decencie] which will be very hard to reconceale to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se; or He must say, that the prelat must act with disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104445:74"/>
and confusion, or (to evit these rockes) that the prelat must be warranted under another notion then that of a circumstance of meer order, and so must have a particular warrand. His instance of the Moderator and Clerk is very foolish, the Clerk not being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarly [a Church officer] and the Moderator [no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Church officer] from the rest of the members, and so is utterly Impertinent to this pointe and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, anent <hi>a Church officer distinct from and Superior to a presbiter,</hi> whither he ought to have a particular Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re warrand. Besides that the same divine warrand that a judiciall procedor by disquisition, votes, and suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge hath, and is exemplified in that Synod Act. 15. (this being the necessary frame of judicatories, as such, and consequently of all Church judicatories) the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator hath the same foundation of his office; but He will never let us see a shaddow of this for the prelat. Now to shew what good Harmonie this Informer keeps in this point with some chieff men of his way (&amp; others also) let us hear what they hold, <hi>Institutum Apostolorum de regimine Ecclesiastico—&amp; ea gubernationis ratio quae aetate Apostolorum fuit &amp;c.—The Apostles appointment as to Church government, and that way and method of government which was in their time, is perpetuall, and can no more be changed then the priesthood of Aaron could, saith Saravia con tra bezam Whitaker controv.</hi> 4. <hi>Quest:</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Tells us, That the Church must not be governed-vt humano ingenio arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit, as pleases mens fancie, sed ut Christo Ecclesiae domino so lique principi placet, But as it pleases Christ her only head and Lord.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Informer undertakes to answer the Arguments of Presbyterians against Episcopacy. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to our Argumets from Matth. 20: 25, 26. and Petr. 5: 3. Examined at large. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine strength and nerves of our reasoning upon these Texts, which he dare not medle with.

               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>doubter</hi> in the nixt place [alleages Prelacy to the forbidden, and therefore unlawful: bringing for proof Matth. 20: 25, 26, 27, 28. And the Argument from this text, he makes his poor doubter slenderly and curtly to represent thus, <hi>That Christ forbids any of his disciples to he greater then another.</hi> This passage with its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Luk. 22: 25. Is much scanned betwixt the Papists and us, in relation to the <hi>popes Dominion,</hi> and as it striks
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104445:75"/>
clearly against Prelacy, so Papists and Prelats doe as clearly joyne issue in their answers. In both passages it is apparent, that upon occasion of a sinfull and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous emulation àmong the Disciples, which of them should be greatest, our Lord did sharpely reprehend them, dischargeing them expresly the Lordly grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Earthly Rulers or Princes, and to exercise Lordsnipe or Dominion over one another, commending instead thereof, and in opposition thereto, a <hi>humble Ministerial service,</hi> and spiritual diligence in their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual stewardship or Ministery, pressing both, from his own exemplary humility in his converse with them. Now, our Argument against Prelacy is very strong from this text, and hath these <hi>Nerves.</hi> 1. The Lord most expresly discharges Superiority and inferiority among officers <hi>of the same kinde:</hi> Non are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then another in their office; no Apostle above another, but a compleat parity in their <hi>official power</hi> is here holden out; <hi>ergo,</hi> by necessary consequence, he commands a parity among Pastoures, and discharges superior and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior <hi>degrees</hi> among them. 2. Whatever priority of order among officers of different kindes, be allowed, yet he discharges <hi>Dominion</hi> or <hi>principalitie</hi> in any of them, <hi>all masterly power,</hi> such as is allowed in civil Government; there being but <hi>one Master</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi> over the Church, and all Ministers being Brethren. This is clear, in that he mentions the civil Lordshipe of Rulers who are called <hi>benefactors</hi> in exemplyfiing what he discharges them, and likewayes in opposition therunto, commends a <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ministerial service,</hi> not a sort of warrantable Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as that parallel 1 Pet. 5: 3. Makes it evident; So that he gives two deadly blowes here to the Diocesian Lord Prelat. 1. In that he makes himself a <hi>higher order and degree</hi> of the Pastorall office, whereas the Lord dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges this among officers of the <hi>same kinde.</hi> 2. In Lording it over his brethren (other Pastoures) both
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104445:75"/>
in a pretended spiritual capacitie, arrogating to himself a sole power in ordination and jurisdiction, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly power and principality over Church judicatories, (as is cleared above) and likewayes in his assumeing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arthly Lordship, place and grandoure, of civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, which is here expresly discharged. This being premised, let us hear what this new Advocat sayes to this Text. 1. He tels us that [It is a great mistake to think, that all superiority among Church men is here forbidden, which he fortifies 1. With this Reason, that the twelve, though equall among themselves, yet were superior to the seventy Disciples who were also sent to preach, &amp; this He proves, because Matthias who was chosen to succeed Judas in the Apostleship, was one of them.] Ans. 1. It is here convincingly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that this man shiftes, but dare not grapple with this Scripture, and the argument drawn from it, while he shuffles in this glosse and mistake (which is his own, not oures) viz, <hi>that all superioritie is here dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged among Church men,</hi> as our inference or medium á<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst prelacie from this text, as is evident from what is said. We grant with all sound divines, that among Church men or Church officers, there are superior and inferior degrees. First Apostles, secondarly Prophets &amp;c. But we say, that hereby superiority among these of the <hi>same degree</hi> is forbidden, and likwayes <hi>principalitie and lordship</hi> in any of them of whatever order or degree, over another. So that we are not concerned to enquire, whither the Apostles were Superior to the seventy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or whither they were sent to preach, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as some doe judge) intrusted with a transient mission to prepare our Lords access to those places whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was to come, with out any formall Ministeral mission above ordinarie Disciples. Only I must say, his proofe of this Superiority of the Twelve above the Seventie, is very odd (viz.) <hi>Matthias was chosen ane Apostle, though one of the Sevintie.</hi> Now, to give Scripture
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104445:76"/>
light and proofe of this topick, both branches of this assertion must be proved from Scripture, not only that Matthias was chosen in Judas roome, but also and mainely, <hi>that he was one of the Seventie,</hi> wherof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is utterly silent: and instead of Scripture proof of this, wee must take <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> their <hi>Said so,</hi> which maks up a <hi>heterogenious</hi> proofe, like the feet and toes made of iron and clay. 2. He tells us, <hi>That ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not inequality, is here discharged.</hi> This ane old shift of <hi>Bellarm:</hi> and the Papists, we say that both ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the root and principle of this desire, and the thing it self which was the <hi>object</hi> of this <hi>ambitious desire</hi> (viz.) Dominion, Principality, and Lordship one over another, is here forbidden: <hi>Subordinata non pugnant,</hi> 'tis strang sottishnes in this man to imagin, that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, the inward principle of this unlawful primacie or inequalitie, should be forbidden onely, and not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie or primacie it self, the outward act and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this ambition. <hi>Bellarm:</hi> answer to our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes argument against the popes Supremacie from the text, is, <hi>that dominion is no: here discharged, but rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and that it is only such ane ambitious lust of overruling as is among the Kings of the Gentiles,</hi> that is forbidden. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> (de Pontif: Cap: 1.) Answers him, <hi>that this dominion it self, not the ambitious affectation only, is discharged. Bernard</hi> writing to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> &amp; expounding this passage, &amp; that of 1. Pet. 5. Understands them both as striking against do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and enjoyning a Ministeriall care in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therunto, <hi>Dominion</hi> (saith hee) <hi>is discharged and Ministery is enjoyned,</hi> So at length he concludes after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things to this purpose. <hi>Thus Bernard clearly teaches</hi> (saith <hi>Whittak:</hi> de Pontif: Quest: 1.) <hi>that humilitie is not required in dominion</hi> (as our Informer distinguishes with <hi>Bellarm:) but dominion it self is discharged. But Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min admitts to play the Lords if they be modest and humble in their dominion. Christus de re ipsa &amp;c.</hi> (saith <hi>Iunius,</hi> de pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif: lib: 1.) <hi>Christ said of the thing it self, they exercise dominion</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:104445:76"/>
                  <hi>but he spake not of the maner, they exercise dominion after this or that maner; they exercise dominion, saith he, but not so yee that is, yee shall not exercise dominion: it is a plaine denyal of the thing proposed.</hi> So we see his shift here as to prelacie, is the same with that of the Papists in defending the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie. But his Reason of this his glosse must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, [viz.] <hi>Because otherwayes, our Lords argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his own example</hi> v. 28. <hi>Would not suite his purpose, since he was in power and authoritie above the Twelve. Ans.</hi> (Not to stay here to tell him, that this defence and gloss will equally serve the popes turne, and bear the blow of this text off his head in Correspondance with <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Notion above touched) Our Lords scope in proposeing his own example, is to antidot their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pride, the root of their desire of this dominion, and powerfully to commend to them humility and low lines, as the most excellent remedy therof: And his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument runns <hi>a fortiori</hi> thus. If I your Lord and Master be as on that serves, and am such a pattern of selfdeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and humility among you, much more ought you to studie humility, and to guard against all usurped authority and dominion, over on another, who are fellow Disciples, and servants. So he reasoned Joh 13. If I your Lord &amp; master have washed your feet, you [viz, much more as being equalls] ought also to wash one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feet; so that which he imagines doth mak Christs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument not sute well, maksit the more forcible &amp; suite the better. 2. He here contradicts himself, while making the argument from Christs example, v. 28. to suite the discharge of ambition only, not of inequality (the terms in which he impertinently states the difference and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as to what is discharged and not discharged) for he grants there was to be no inequalitie among the Apostles; and when he thus limites his general answer [that <hi>all supeiroritie</hi> among Church men is not here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged] he grants that <hi>some superioritie</hi> (viz) among the Apostles themselves, was discharged, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104445:77"/>
discharged upon this motive <hi>Christs own example</hi> How then, I pray, will he make this argument from Christs example, who was in dominion and principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity above the Twelve, and their, and all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches monarch and head, suite his purpose of dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Inequality, Superioritie, or primacie among the Apostles? His reason he explaines, thus further, <hi>that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Christ onely to speak against ambition, or a sinful desire of superoritie, which was Diotrephes fault, the reason from his own example suites well who, though above all, yet was, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to all in humility.</hi> Ans. 1. Wee have heard that Christs argument suites best in the sense we have propounded, which is the sense of all sound divines. 2. If it was only a sinful desire of a superioritie in it self law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, such as he sayes Diotrephes had (how rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall after see) which our Lord dehorted from by his own example, then all our divines have mist the marke in pleading from this text against the object of this desire, not the sinful maner of desiring only, and the Papists gloss holds good against them, viz: that Christs example will plead only against ambition. 3. Our <hi>Informer</hi> yet againe falleth here into a twosold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. 1. He makes the Superiority, the object of this ambitious desire, to be in it selflawful, and their fault only to lie in the ambitious or sinful desire; yet in answer to the nixt obiection he grants, that Christ dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged <hi>dominium civile &amp; despoticum;</hi> Now, he must either say, that this was the object of their desire, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was sinful in the object, or else that our Lords discourse and exhortation was not to the purpose; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this <hi>domineum civile &amp; despoticum,</hi> is more then a meer superioritie. But 2. the superioritie here discharged was <hi>among the Apostles themselves,</hi> &amp; this was the object of their desire; the ambitions question and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate was, <hi>which of them should be greatest,</hi> and highest above all the rest? Now he grants that there was to be <hi>no supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:104445:77"/>
far less <hi>principality</hi> among them; How then can he say that Christ discharged only ane ambitious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of <hi>a superioritie in it self lawful;</hi> such as <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had, whom we will find him after assert to have ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoured to put himself into a lawful pre-existent office. Surely if there was to be no inequality among them, their desire of inequality was most <hi>sinful in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> upon that very ground. Againe, he grants that Christ speaks to the Twelve, and likwayes cannot deny, but clearly insinuates a concession with the text, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were striveing about <hi>inequality,</hi> which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges was <hi>unlawful in them,</hi> yet in the second answer, he will not have this discharged; which how inconsistent it is, let any judge. Beside, since. Christ spoke this to the twelve, among whom there was to be [no inequality in respect of power] as he sayes, &amp; consequently discharged this, since he is rebuking them for striving about a <hi>primacy,</hi> the highest degree of inequality in respect of power, how absurd &amp; nonsensical is his 2d answer, which denies [that Christ discharged inequality;] could Christ discharge them an inequality of the highest pitch, and yet not discharge inequality? Or could [all inequality in respect of power] be unlawful among them, and yet not be discharged when our Lord discharged [a primacy of power?] he will prove a strang critick if he distinguish these. He tells us <hi>lastly</hi> here <hi>that humility &amp; imparity can well consist.</hi> But can humility, &amp; a <hi>forbidden imparity</hi> consist? can humility in a Churchman, &amp; [Dominium civile and despoticum] consist? Both which he acknowledges were discharged to the Apostles here. So he insinuats that their desired imparity, was still lawful in it self, since it may be possessed even <hi>humbly,</hi> &amp; thus heaps up inconsistencies. He objects to himself <hi>That Christ in denying to them, the Dominion of the Princes of the gentiles, discharged all superiority among Church men. To which</hi> he answers <hi>That he onely discharges [Dominium civile, &amp; despoticum] a princely Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, such as they exercise: but the power of the Church is of another nature. Ans.</hi> 1. [Not to meedle with his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104445:78"/>
makeing <hi>Dominium civile,</hi> and <hi>despoticum, adequat ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> there being a <hi>Dominium politicum,</hi> ordinately contradistinguished from <hi>despoticum,</hi> which is also a <hi>Dominium civile)</hi> He grants here, that it was more then a simple desire of a lawful superiority, which the <hi>Apostles</hi> were tainted with, forgeting what he said immediatly before. <hi>Nixt,</hi> if Christ discharged this <hi>civil Lordly power</hi> to Churchmen, he discharged them to be <hi>Parliaments Lords,</hi> and to hold civil state offices, contrare to what he pleades from the instances of the Priests Numb. II. and from <hi>Eli</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuel;</hi> and so he must grant the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Church and its dispensation, to be in this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the old, since he acknowledges that <hi>Church power</hi> was here allowed the Apostles and their successors, and <hi>civill power</hi> discharged. Thus our <hi>Informer</hi> must grant, that Christ did here rid marches betwixt these things which he before confounded, and their Erastian Prelacy confounds. Again, this is the very shift of Bellarmin to save the popes supremacie: <hi>The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>In forbidding them, to rule as the Princes of the Gentiles, signified they were to rule, but not after that manner</hi> [viz.] Ecclesiastically; So he thinks it touches not the popes Ecclesiastick supremacy, and the <hi>Informer</hi> in this stryks hands with him. For if our Lord discharged only here <hi>that kind of Dominion</hi> as he sayes; But allowed a Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or dominion of another nature, surely for anything that is here discharged, ane Ecclesiastick pop or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch his mytrestands sure, and is never touched by any prohibition which the Disciples here got, against the sense and pleading of all Protestants. Moreover, will this <hi>Informer</hi> adventur to say that <hi>the popes primacy,</hi> or <hi>ecclesiastick Monarchy,</hi> even as abstracted from his civill Dominion, is not here discharged; And if it be [as all our divines assert it is] then our Lord understood another sort of abuse of power then invadeing a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium civile,</hi> even all despotick or Lordly power,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104445:78"/>
whither civill, or pretended ecclesiastick in Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Besids, if he discharged Lordly power, he discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which Peter discharged 1 Pet. 5. Even to Lord over Gods heritage. What? will he dare to say that it is only a <hi>civill Lordship</hi> which is there discharged &amp; not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ane ecclesiastick dominion, Which bath <hi>Gods herita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge or Church</hi> for its object: And if so, then the Prelats Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is expresly stricken against, since (as we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cleared) his power is a meer despotick Lordship or rule; For to be the proper object &amp; fountaine of all ecclesiástick authority in the Diocess, to have sole power in ordination &amp; jurisdiction; the sole decisive suffrage in Judicatories, is either <hi>a despotick Dominion and Lordship</hi> or it is nothing; and if the Churches power is <hi>of another nature then this</hi> civill Dominion, as this man tells us, of what nature is it? Only of another nature, because it touches <hi>spiritual objects;</hi> Then for any thing that is here forbidden, a papall ecclesiastick monarchy is never touched. Or is it of another nature because in it self <hi>Steward-like and Ministerial,</hi> not despotick or Princely, like that of the Magistrat (which is the sense of all sound divines, and must be his too, if he speak sense) then who sees not that the power of the Prince-or Lord-Prelat is most formally discharged? It being evidently of this nature. Yet againe, it is in this apparent that he shiftes and shuffles the question, and its terms here, anent the power of the Prelat and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer discharged in this text. For in saying in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Answer, that Christ discharges <hi>that kind Dominion of onely</hi> which civil Princes exercise, he must needes be supposed to contradistingush from this, <hi>ane ecclesiastick Dominion</hi> which is allowed, yet when he speaks of this he alters the terms, telling us [that the <hi>Churches power</hi> is of another nature] he should have said the Churches <hi>reserved Dominion,</hi> if he had spoken conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as that <hi>other kind</hi> of Dominion which he allowes,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104445:79"/>
and by the consequence of his discourse, holds that the Text will allow; In a word, that all sort of [Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion] whither pretended ecclesiastick, or civil, is here discharged to Church officers, and consequently his offering violence to the Text, is apparent from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text two wayes. 1. In that the strife among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, flowing from this desire of unlawful greatnes, and which drew forth this exhortation and prohibition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate, was not about a civill despotick rule; <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or onely,</hi> but anent a Lordship &amp; chief rule <hi>in the Church, and in matters ecclesiastick,</hi> under Christ as their head; So that though the Lord exemplified the greatnes which he discharged them, in that of earthly princes, (there being no other then existent and apparent) yet it was not this primarily, but <hi>ane ecclesiastick Lordship</hi> or domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which he strycks against; Since he is directing them both negatively and positively anent the nature, And exercise of their spiritual and ecclesiastick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Rule. 2. The positive parte of his injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction touching <hi>a Ministerial service,</hi> or <hi>humble Ministery,</hi> excludes all sort of dominion in what ever sense it can be taken, and not a civill dominion onely. Our <hi>Informer</hi> tells us, <hi>nixt. That sundrie interpreters, interpret Christs words, as discharging only Tyranny, such as earthly Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</hi> And in this he Informers us right; Onely he should have been so ingenuus as to tell us that they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters beyond our line, that is popish interpreters, for this is directly <hi>Bellarmins</hi> shift, to which, since he stands here upon the same ground with him, I shall return learned <hi>Whittakers</hi> interpretation and answer, which hitherto I believe hath passed current with all sound Protestants. <hi>Christ sets before them the example of the Kings of the Gentiles, not to the end they may flie ambition on'y</hi> (as this man shifts it) <hi>but to let them understand that they have nothing to doe with a kingly rule.—For</hi> (saith he) <hi>though the words translated [exercise dominion or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity]</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:104445:79"/>
                  <hi>which Matthew maks use of, doeth sometimes signifie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderat dominion, yet Luke Omitts the preposition in both these Words: But so it is that the simple verb, is attribut to these who obtaine power and dominion, not to these who insolently and tyrannically overerule; for all those who among the gentiles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained principality did not reigne tyrannically or unjustly, nay the Clemency of many such, and their justice is praised.</hi> Thus he, de pontif: Quest: 1. To which I may add, that our Lord speakes of such Princes as were called Benefacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or <hi>gracious Lords,</hi> a very unsuiteable designation for Tyrannes.</p>
               <p>How easie is it from the <hi>Informer</hi> reasoning here, and with his net to fish out a <hi>papacy.</hi> That which the Apostles here desired was in it self lawful, and the fault was onely in the ambitious desire, as it was with diotrephes who desired a lawful preexistent office: This he clearly asserts: I subsum: But that which they desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were striving about, was a primacie or papacie, Ergo that office is lawfull in it self. The pope will thank our <hi>Informer</hi> for this.</p>
               <p>The nixt text objected by <hi>the doubter,</hi> is that preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant passage 1 Pet. 5: 3. <hi>Be not Lords over Gods heritage.</hi> And from this he maks him mutter out this slender ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, [is not superiority among Church men there clearly forbidden.] Still we see our <hi>Informer</hi> keeps him under the covert of his own groundless supposition, that we doe from this and such like texts Impugne, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority among Church men,</hi> as he terms it, whereas wee allow (as he cannot but know) with all sound divines, and scripture it self, superiour and inferiour degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Church officers: And he cannot shew that any Presbyterian did ever draw forth from this text such ane insignificant notion as this against Prelacy; But hee beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make the knot easy, since himself must loose it. Our Argument from this text, is this, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here injoyneing Ministers their duty [both nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivil

and positively, he first dehorts from evills they are lyable unto, such as heart reluctancy at their laborius employment, covetusness and usurpation or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Dominion, whither over their fellowes, which <hi>Dietrephes</hi> affected, or over the people, by taking ane arbitrarie masterly imperious way with them, or a way of force and rigoure, as these reptehended Ezek. 34: 4. He nixt, positively exhortes them to lead or rule in a holy exemplarie, Shepherd-like Method, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the word of grace in their practise. Now [I say) from this genuine sense and scope of the place, wee argue against Prelacie, thus. 1. The Apostle exhorts these elders or Ministers as their [fellow-elder] suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seing them his immediat Successors in the <hi>highest Spheere of ane ordinarie Ministery,</hi> for he supposes them to have non higher over them now when he was shortly to put off his Tabernacle. 2. He enjoyns them <hi>to feed and take the oversight, or exercise Episcopal authoritie</hi> over the flock, as Paul did likewayes the Presbyters or elders of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, in his last farewel. (Act. 20.) a scrybing <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Episcopal authoritie</hi> to them, both as to jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ordination. 3. Yet he discharges any of them to Lord it over Gods heritage, commending instead thereof, ane exemplarie humble service or ministery, Hence wee inferr against the Diocesian Prelat. 1 That there is no higher officer then a Presbyter, left by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles as their ordinary Successor, since the Apostle as their follow Presbiter, exhorts themas the highest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary officers, and therfor the Prelat, pretending to be ane higher ordinary officer, is Apocriphal. 2. All Episcopali authority is in Presbyters, both as to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Jurisdiction, and they have both name and thing of a <hi>Scripture Bishop,</hi> and therefore the Prelat, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating this name solely to himself, &amp; all the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power of ordinationand Jurisdiction as his solely, and denying it to Presbyters, is ane Anti-scripturall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104445:80"/>
Monster: Since these Presbyters had this in a <hi>compleat parity</hi> 3. Non of these Elders must exercise <hi>a masterly power and dominion over the flocks,</hi> therefore the Lord Prelats imperious <hi>Lordly power</hi> is palpably condemned, which he exercises over <hi>both Pastores and flocks.</hi> Now, this being our argument from this text, let any man judge of this <hi>Informer</hi> ingenuity, while representing it in such a disguise, that he may seem able to grapple with it; Whereas we shall find that his answers to his Argument presented thus in its genuine strength, are like the conflict betwixt the giant and pigmee. But what sayes he to the Argument as in his own mould. 1. He answers <hi>That superiority among Churchmen is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</hi> By [Churchmen] if he understand in General, [Church officers] (though the terme be some what odd) we shall easily Admitt that this Text discharges not superior and inferior degrees among them, but this will nothing help his cause, as is evident. If he mean superiority among <hi>preaching Presbyters,</hi> or Elders, we have proved it to be here discharged, since the Apostle attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes episcopal Authority to these elders in common, and discharges Lordly preheminenc in any of them. Well, what is it that our <hi>Informer</hi> will admitt to be here discharged? <hi>domineering and Tyranny,</hi> saith he, <hi>which may be the fault of ane ordinary Minister towards his flocke.</hi> This is the old popish song made new again, to which I repon two things. 1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is parallel with that of Matth. 20. and Luk. 22. Where peter learned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, and (as is said) imports indeed <hi>Dominion</hi> but no <hi>Tyrannical domineering</hi> it being made use of by the <hi>seventy interpreters</hi> to express Dominion unquestionably lawful. 2. The positive parte of the precept refutes this gloss, he sayes not, <hi>Not Tyrannically domineering,</hi> but using Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion moderatly (which ought to have been the other alternative branch, if this mans gloss were true, and the Apostle had allowed a lawfull <hi>Lordshipe)</hi> but He adds for the other branch in expressing what is injoyned
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104445:81"/>
                  <hi>being examples to the slock.</hi> Injoyneing thus to feed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and a humble Ministery; And this is opposit to all Dominion and Lordship whatsoever, and doth not discriminat only one Dominion from another; which is also apparent in the alternative branche, and positive precept of the above mentioned paralel texts. Besides we might here tell him, That the Episcopal prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, being so many wayes cross to the Scripture rules in pointe of Government, may be truely called a most <hi>TyrannicalDomineereing.</hi> But the reasons of his gloss follows. He tells us; <hi>That this domineering and Tyranny may be the fault of ane ordinary Minister towards his flock, and that the Apostle is not here speaking of Church mens carriage towards one another, or of their equality or inequality among themselves, but of their behaviour towards the people, who are called the flock, or Gods heritage.</hi> Ans. This is a strange reason, and very hard to comprehend, only Tyrannical domineere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be understood <hi>because it relates only to the flock.</hi> Can there not be a Tyrannical domineering over the <hi>Clergy</hi> also? And because the Apostle forbids to Lord it over the flock, therefore he forbids not Dominion over the Clergy; The quit contrare conclusion will better follow: If the Apostle forbids them <hi>to Lord it over the flocks,</hi> who were subject to them as their spiritual gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, therefore, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> he much more forbids them to <hi>Lord it over their fellow Presbyters,</hi> who were their equalls in this Spiritual trust and Authority over the flocks; And if it be unlawful to play the Domineering Prelat over one poor flock, it must be much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to Act this Tyranny over some Hundreds of both pastores and flocks. So that Ministers, or (if he will) Churchmens carriage towards one another, must be here clearly pointed out by a very necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from the less to the greater, and the equality of Ministers in their spiritual Government and Rule, by he same topick strongly inferred from this place. It
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104445:81"/>
strange that the Apostle should discharge <hi>to Lord it over the flocks,</hi> and yer allow a Lordship over <hi>both Clergy and flocks.</hi> But another wonder is, how he comes to excludMinisters from that tittle of <hi>Gods heritage,</hi> which his party (from whom our <hi>Informer</hi> here proves a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratist) do often make peculiar unto [Church Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers] one would thinke that they should have a special Interest and share in that which grounds this deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; Are they not the Lords purchase, as well as the people Act. 20. Nay they are in a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner such, and Christs glorie; Are they not such as he will never cast off and alienat Psal. 94: 14. They are the starrs which Christ holds in his right hand; nay, as being singularly dedicat to him, they are singularly his: as the Levits had the Lord for their Inheritance in a speciall way; So they were singularly his, set aparte for him beyond all the rest of the tribes. And are not Ministers <hi>taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people for his Priests and Levits—</hi>And called therefore men of God, stewards of God, Ministers, Servants, Ambassadoures of Christ, because of their singular relation to him: And as this is a strong disswasive from Lording over the people, that they are <hi>Gods heritage,</hi> who therefore most not be the <hi>servants of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> So upon the ground of Ministers speciall interest in this denomination, the Apostles argument as to them, is the more forcible. Againe, since he so expresly forbids any of these Pastou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res <hi>to Lord it over Gods Heritage</hi> (enjoyning them a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exemplary Ministery) and far less to exercise a Lordly Rule over one another, he establishes by clear consequence (as I hinted) ane equality among them, in their <hi>pastoral official power</hi> and authority; Withall, the Apostle speaking to them indefinitely in this precept without the least <hi>exception and reserve</hi> as to any one of them: and making their <hi>episcopal inspection</hi> relate to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104445:82"/>
                  <hi>flock</hi> (as this man himself pleads) both these grounds hold out their equality among themselves, and inferrs a discharge of inequality. This <hi>Informers</hi> likewayes would remarke that the Spirit of God here commands <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to act the Bishopes,</hi> thus indentifying the Bishop and Prisbyter, but without <hi>Lording it over Gods heritage,</hi> the prohibition not to Lord it, is remarkably joyned with the command to Act the Bishop: And referring their office to the flock, he must confess the Apostle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no <hi>Bishops</hi> whose inspection was over <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours themselves.</hi> Thus we see hisanswer to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Prelacy from this Text is contrare unto the scope and sense of the Words, yea and inconsistent with it self.</p>

a parte but not the strength of our argument from these texts.

We draw forth these weapons. 1. The Apostle speaking to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, tells them that the holy ghost had made them [Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes over the flock,] shewing that the Scriptur Bishop set up by the holy ghost, is the Minister or elder who feeds and rules over the flock. 2. The Apostle gives them not only the <hi>Name</hi> of Bishop, but also <hi>the thing,</hi> commanding these elders or Ministers <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which takes in all the power of order and jurisdiction, and whatever the Diocesian Bishop may pretend unto. 3. (Which is very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) he gives this Charge so these elders befor Timot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy, who was now present with the Apostle, and after the first Epistle was written to him, for it was writtin when Paul was at <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and after this Paul have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Timothy</hi> with him came <hi>to Miletum,</hi> and gave the elders of Ephesus this charge. Finallie. This was Pauls <hi>last charge</hi> to them, for they were never to see his face more; So that we have here a pattern of the mould of the Gospel-Church in relation to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this great Apostle of the Gentiles left it, and consequentlie as all the rest left it; which is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceingly apparent by comparing this with the parallel 1 Pet. 5. compared with 2 Pet. 1: 14. Hence we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminat the Diocefian Prelat thus. 1. The Holy Ghosts Bishops were Ministers which he set up to feed and rule the flock immediatly. These, and these only, the Apostle and the Apostolick Church knew, therefore he dissownes the Prelat, who pretends to be set over some hundreds of Pastoures and flocks, and is bound to feed no flocke himself. 2. These who watch over the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104445:83"/>
flocks <hi>immediatly, and only,</hi> have all the <hi>Episcopal power,</hi> both the key of doctrine, and Government committed to them by the holy Ghost: Therefore the Diocesian Prelat, taking and arrogating to himself <hi>the sole power of ordination and jurisdiction,</hi> and leaving Presbyters noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the <hi>Doctrinal key,</hi> as his deputies, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self preaches to no flock, is ane Antiscriptural Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious robber. 3. The elders or Pastoures of Ephesus got all Episcopal authority as to order and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, committed to them by Paul as the Holy ghosts Bishops, &amp; the highest ordinarie officers of that Church, in the presence of <hi>Timothie,</hi> without the least hint of any interest that <hi>Timothie</hi> had in or over them, as their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shope or Overseer therein, or the least hint of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection anent their dutie to <hi>Timothie</hi> as in that Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and this after he had gotten <hi>all his directions in the</hi> 1. <hi>Epistle</hi> written to him. And therefore <hi>Timothie</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver set up as a Diocesian Prelat over that Church (as this <hi>Informer</hi> would perswade) and the inspection which he is supposed to have in that Epistle, was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional, transient, and extraordinarie, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guence layes no ground for Prelacie. <hi>Finallie, Paules directions</hi> here were <hi>his last and farewel directions,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Church was <hi>to continue thus governed</hi> by these elders or Bishops in common: and the Prelatists Plea [that the Apostles set up Presbyters at first, keeping the reyns of Government in their own hands, till towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the end of their life, and then sett up Prelats over these Presbyters] is here convict of falshood, since nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, nor Peter, the great Apostle of the Gentiles, or the great Apostle of the Circumcision, doe in the least hint any such <hi>Super-institution,</hi> but both of them in their last directions to the Churches, commit the wholl power both of order and jurisdiction, <hi>to the Pastou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the flocks, in common,</hi> as the only Bishops set up by the Holy Ghost.</p>

From 1 Tim. 1: 5,—7. The great Argument is not only from the promiscuouse use of the Name [Bishop] &amp; [Presbyter] but from the <hi>forme and mould</hi> of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les reasoning; which inferres not onely the identitie <hi>of names,</hi> but of <hi>the office also.</hi> For the Apostle shewing Titus how the elders are to be qualified, gives this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asone <hi>for a Bishop must he blameles.</hi> This [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or causal <hi>For]</hi> expressing the knot and connexion of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les argument or reason, doth clearly Import that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, expressed by both these words, is one and the same; for there is neither sound matter or forme, in such reasoning as this [Presbiters must be so and so qualified, because a Bishop, of a Superior order and degree must be so qualified] So that from hence it is evident that the [elder] is the [Bishop], <hi>&amp; vice versa,</hi> and that no higher Bishopes were by the Apostles constitut in the Churches. Here then, as in the preceeding text, we have not only Bishops and elders getting the same designation by the Holyghost (who knew best the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things themselves, and how to express himself thereanent) but likewayes the <hi>same qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, work, and office;</hi> and so the office is supposed to be every way one and the same. Now let us hear, what he sayes to the argument. [He grants that the two words oftentimes doe point out one and the same officer, but denyes that the officer meaned by these words, is never understood above the degree of ane ordinarie Minister. Or that the word [Presbiter, or elder] signifies only the Minister of a single Congregation, &amp; no more.] The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie and prevarication of which answer euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears. For 1. He grants that these two words <hi>Bishop and elder</hi> signifies one and the same officer, <hi>oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> supposeing that sometimes they express diverse officers, but where can he shew us that the word <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus</hi> signifies one officer, and <hi>Preshiter</hi> another, when the Spirit of God is pointing out therby the Churches
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104445:84"/>
standing Officers and Ministers, and not when either the one or the other is in a generall sense applyed to ane Apostle. 2. The state of the Question is [whither the scriptur <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> designe a higher ordinary officer then a Presbyter] And this <hi>Informer</hi> should have adverted, that the drift of the argument from the texts mentioned, is to prove the Apostles promiscuous use of these words in describing the office of the highest ordinary office bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Church. Moreover, the Diocesian [Episcopus] is ane ordinary officer, haveing the inspection over some handereds of flocks, and the sole power of jurisdiction and ordination in the diocesse, &amp; is by him held to be ane officer of Gods appointment, &amp; by this designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Bishop,</hi> as the Characteristick of his office, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from <hi>Pastoures</hi> or <hi>elders.</hi> Now, if presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians doe prove that wherever the word <hi>Bishop</hi> is used to point at ane ordinary standing officer in the Church, it imports <hi>a pastor or presbyter</hi> &amp; no higher officer, they sufficiently over throw the <hi>diocesian Episcopus</hi> or Bishop of his mould, as having no scripture warrand. And if he grant that in the forementioned Scriptures, &amp; other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages where the word <hi>Bishop</hi> is used to point at a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie standing Church officer, it signifieth no higher of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer then <hi>ane elder</hi> or <hi>ordinarie Minister,</hi> he grants enough against himself, &amp; all that the presbiterians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: for there from it followes necessarly that their <hi>diocesian Episcopus or Bishop</hi> contradistinct from, &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the preaching presbyter, is apochriphal &amp; antiscripturall: Since the preaching presbyter &amp; Bishop, are the same ordinarie highest officer in all the Holy Ghosts expressions theranent. 3. Whereas he denyes that we con prove [That the officer meaned by these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rds, is never understood of any above the degree of ane ordinary minister] Let him add this necessary limitation [when the words are applyed to designe ane ordinary standing officer (which he must admit, if he speak to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104445:84"/>
purpose) and the proofe is very easy] since the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Texts, and all the parallels where <hi>elder</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> is thus used, doe evince it. Again 4. Since this Informer with his followes have diversified the <hi>Bishop</hi> from the <hi>elder</hi> in the manner above exprest, we chall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as the affirmer, to shew in all the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the officer meaned by this Word <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> when pointing at ane ordinary standing officer in the Church, is to be understood of any above the degree of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Pastor</hi> of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; This lyes upon him to mak good, else if <hi>Episcopuss</hi> denotte only a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> sure the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of the <hi>Diocesian Prelat</hi> is lost. He fortifies his answer with two Reasons. 1. <hi>We find the name [elder] given to the Apostles themselves</hi> 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 5: 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>&amp; Epist.</hi> 3: 1. <hi>And if Apostles be called [elders] why not also [Bishops]. Ans:</hi> 1. The pointe debeateable is [whether the word [Bishop] and [elder] doe Import the same, officer, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a constant standing officer in the Church.] His Presbyterian <hi>doubter</hi> offers the forementioned Texts to prove this, and he answers, <hi>That one of these names are sometimes attribut to ane extraordinary officer whose formal office is ceased.</hi> Now how impertinent this is to the pointe and Queston let any judge? To prove that <hi>Episcopus</hi> or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, imports ane ordinary standing officer above [a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,] and that the Word <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> signify not the same ordinary officer, because sometimes the Word <hi>elder</hi> may be applyed to ane <hi>Apostle,</hi> is a consequence, as we use so say, <hi>a baculo ad angulum,</hi> and known to no logik. 2. We told him already that we prove enough against him when we prove that the <hi>Scripture-Episcopus,</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> is never found to Import any ordinary officer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and that the Office, Work, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, &amp; Duties of these officers, as ordinary stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers, are one and the same. 3. The Instance of the Apostles assumeing the name of <hi>elder,</hi> doth in this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104445:85"/>
further appear to be ane impertinent exception to the Argument adduced, in that the office of ane <hi>Apostle,</hi> is in Scripture both by a proper name, work, qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, call, &amp;c. diversified and distinguished from that of ane <hi>ordinary elder;</hi> so that though in a general sense the <hi>Apostles</hi> be called <hi>elders,</hi> their <hi>Specifick</hi> difference from the <hi>ordinary elder</hi> is apparent: But this <hi>Informer</hi> will never shew the least vestigies of the <hi>Diocesian Bishops</hi> distinction from the preaching <hi>elder</hi> or Presbyter in any of these res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects? And therefore his reason added here viz. <hi>The Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop may be called ane [elder] as well as ane Apostle, and yet be ane officer superior to him,</hi> is a begging of the Question, since he cannot shew that there is a higher ordinary officer then a <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> appointed in the Word, nor can he shew any designation, qualification, work, or ordination of his <hi>Diocesian Bishop,</hi> as distinguished from the <hi>Presbyter</hi> by the Prelatists; And therefore the Apostles being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led elders can no more ground a distinction betwixt the <hi>Bishop</hi> and the <hi>elder,</hi> then betwixt the <hi>Pastor</hi> and the <hi>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> whom he acknowledges to be one and the same, or betwixt the <hi>Minister</hi> and the <hi>elder.</hi> I suppose one should alledge the <hi>Pastor</hi> to be a higher officer then the <hi>preaching elder and Presbyter,</hi> notwithstanding that in Scripture their names, and qualifications are one, as of <hi>the Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and should ground his opinion on this <hi>Informers</hi> reason here, (viz.) [that though the two words are promiscuosly used often times of the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, yet the officer meaned by one of these may be somtimes understood of one above the degree of ane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Minister] what will he say to his own reason, pleading for this foolish distinction? Would he not say that the <hi>[Apostle]</hi> and <hi>[elder]</hi> are elsewhere clearly distinguished on Scripture, not the <hi>Pastour</hi> and the <hi>elder,</hi> which answer he must here bestow upon himself. Sure this man will not deny but that the various Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers both ordinary and extraordinary have their proper
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104445:85"/>
formall <hi>office</hi> is deciphered, and distinguished from other offices and officers, As Apostles, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Pastors: and particularly he will not deny that there is such ane ordinary Church officer as the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> distinguished by his proper designation from others, notwithstanding that the Apostles took this name in a general sense: So that from this it followes that if the <hi>Bishops</hi> proper designation, work, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, qualifications, as distinct from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> cannot be produced, he must be alwayes understood in that sense (viz.) ane ordinary Pastour and no more: And not as the <hi>Apostles</hi> when termed <hi>elders,</hi> whose distinct <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior office,</hi> and proportioned <hi>designation,</hi> is clearly extant in Scripture.</p>
               <p>His 2d. Reason and exception to the Argument is <hi>that with us the word [elder] signifies both the preaching, and ruling elder, and that he can, upon as good, and better ground say, that it signifies the [Bishop] &amp; the [Minister] both being elders, but of different dogrees</hi> Ans. 1.

Church. To answer this Argument, the <hi>Insormer</hi> hathgathered together several scrapes and some very odd and inconsistent notions. 1. He tells us <hi>that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose takes these Bishops, not to be the Bishops at Philippi, but certan Bishops present with Paul when he wrote, &amp; in whose name he writs to the Philippians, joyning them with himself.</hi> But this gloss, as it is cross to the current of exposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, so to common sense. Paul, who only was the Spirit of Gods penman, joyns here <hi>Timothie</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the inscription, as in severall other Epistles, and having taken to himself, and Timothie, the desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Servants of Christ,</hi> he doth nixt after this description of himself and Timothie, according to his usual Methode, describe these to whom he writes, (viz.) [to all the Saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the Bishops and Deacons] viz, <hi>there, at Philippi,</hi> not with Paul, they being ranked among these <hi>to whom he writes,</hi> who are contradistinguished from <hi>Paul and Timothy, the directors of the Epistle,</hi> and supposed to be with these <hi>saints at Philipp;</hi> Otherwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes there is no sense in the Text to read it thus, <hi>Paul and Timothius, to the saints at Philippi, with the Bishops with Paul.</hi> Had the Apostle joyned them with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he doth Timothy, in the inscription, they would have been mentioned in that branch of the verse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, and not cast after the adress, and the description of these to whom he writes. The Apostle in Gal. 1. After he hath described and asserted his Apostolick authoritie, he nixt adds, <hi>and all the brethren that are with me, to the Churches of Galatia.</hi> Thus he takes in many with himself in this inscription, before he describe these, to whom the Epistle is addressed. And should not these supposed eminent Bishops, have been after this manner joyned with him; Besids, will any say that the <hi>Deacons,</hi> joyned with these <hi>Bishops</hi> in the period of this verse, were not at Philippi, or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104445:87"/>
belonging to that Church, but with Paul? But they are mean men, and their credit needed not to be saved by such a conceit as this. All the fear of that <hi>Father</hi> was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He tells us nixt. <hi>That others think they were Bishops of theChurches about, conveened at Philippie, which Paul knowing of, salutes them with the Church: Since he first salutes [the Saints] as intending mainely to write to them; and then [the Bishops.]</hi> So wee see the Prelatists saile every point of the compasse, to save the credit of these <hi>Bishops.</hi> If <hi>Bishops</hi> cannot be gotten sett beside the chaire with Paul, when addressing the Epistle (this gloss standing clearely antipod to the Text) the nixt shift is, rather then these <hi>Bishops</hi> be degraded to <hi>meer Presbyters,</hi> to send for some other <hi>Bishops</hi> to Philippi at this tyme of Paules Writing, that this <hi>casual Mustere</hi> of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>of other Churches,</hi> may warde off the deadly blow which the cause will gett, by seating all these Bishops at Philippie, as officers of that Chuch; and to compass this designe, they must be but <hi>occasionally saluted</hi> here, and not as <hi>fixed members or officers</hi> the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof; upon the Apostles Information (comeing to late to his ears from our <hi>Informer</hi> and his fellows) that there were several <hi>Magnates</hi> there, besides the <hi>ordinary</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters at Philippi. But, which also odd, they must become so humble as to fall <hi>behind the Saints, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons mainely written to.</hi> Had our <hi>Informer</hi> left out this clause (which notwithstanding his answer did require) Our Prelats <hi>Parliaments order,</hi> Who are <hi>before,</hi> because <hi>behind</hi> the most, would have saved their reputation still. But many of the Ancients are more ingenuous. <hi>Thodoret</hi> confesses <hi>that Presbyters are here understood, because their could not be many Bishops in one-city,</hi> on Philip. 1. <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> on Philip. 1. Tells us, <hi>That we are not so</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:104445:88"/>
                  <hi>to understand it as if there were many Bishops in one citty, but that the Apostle calls the Presbyters, Bishops. Chrisost. ibid.</hi> acknowledges, <hi>That they were Presbyters who were called thus, because the names were then common and the Bishop, himself was called Deacon, and that the distinction of names came afterward.</hi> This conjecture is sib to that other shift to take off the strength of our argument. from Act. 20. <hi>viz.</hi> [That these Elders were not Church Officers of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus onely, but the Bishops of all Asia mett together at Ephesus, and sent for by Paul from thence] least if the <hi>Episcopal authority</hi> be found seated in these <hi>Elders of Ephesus,</hi> at Pauls last farewel, it breake the <hi>Diocesian Prelat</hi> all in peeces. But as it is well replyed that since Paul sent to Ephesus for the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> it is a groundless conjecture to call them any other Elders then <hi>of that Church to which he sent,</hi> and that there is no hint in the text of any <hi>other Elders</hi> there at that time So this fancie is as fond when applyed to this passage, and may receave the same reply. What shaddow of proof can be produced that therewere any other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers there at this time then the Bishops or Ministers of this Church? And what Logick, <hi>I</hi> pray, or sense is there in this inference, that because the Apostle first salutes, all <hi>the Saints</hi> or the <hi>Church collective in bulke,</hi> and then the <hi>Church Officers, Bishops and Deacons,</hi> or the Church representative in special, that therefore he salutes these Church Officers <hi>as casually there, and not as Officers of that Church.</hi> Beside, had the Apostle saluted them as casually present, they would have been salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>every Saint in Christ,</hi> Chap. 4: 21. rather then in the inscription. The <hi>English Annotations</hi> thus sense it [That by the <hi>Bishops and Deacons,</hi> we are to understand the whole Ministery at Philippi consisting of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to whom the government of the Church was committed, and Deacons, who not only had the care
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104445:88"/>
of the poor, but also assisted the Ministers in their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick function.]</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Informer</hi> hath a third <hi>Answer,</hi> wherein, <hi>He grants that these Bishops and Deacons were [Officers of this Church] and askes where were the ruling Elders] here, and if we say they are included in the word</hi> Bishop, <hi>then he tells us that upon better ground he can affirme, that Bishops here sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies both the superiour Bishop and the ordinary Minister,</hi> who may be called Bishop as well as <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ane <hi>[Apostle.] Answ.</hi> 1. Our Argument from this place and such like, beside the Scriptures silence as to the <hi>Diocesian Bishop,</hi> is, That the <hi>Scripture Bishop</hi> doth therein stand so described and qualified, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibe to understand him of any other officer then a <hi>meer Presbyter,</hi> which is most manifast here, It being impossible that a multiplicity of Bishopes could be at Philippi, as is universally acknowledged. And if he grant <hi>that these Bishops were officers, of that Church in Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> he must either say they were <hi>meer Preebyters,</hi> which is all wee seek, and the yeelding of his cause, or he must prove that either here or els where, the word <hi>Episcopus</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> designes the <hi>diocesian Bishop,</hi> and place a multiplicity of such Bishops here against the old <hi>Cannons,</hi> particularly that of <hi>Nice.</hi> But 2. As to what he sayes of the <hi>ruleing elders,</hi> it is utterly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and answered already. We proved the ruling <hi>elders office,</hi> as distinct from the <hi>preaching elder,</hi> by cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Scripture grounds, and did shew that the Scripture points out <hi>two sorts of elders,</hi> giving them both this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name of <hi>elder,</hi> &amp; then distinguishing them into <hi>such as rule,</hi> and <hi>such as labour in the word and doctrine:</hi> But this <hi>Informer</hi> will never prove that [Episcopus, or Bishop]. designes two sorts of Pastors a higher and a lower, or that there is any difference of degrees in the pastoral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: So that he cannot include here his Superior imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Bishop of whose office the Scripture is utterly silent.

                  </gap>o in a general figurative, sense or Catachre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is called the Philippians Apostle, or messenger. But how? viz. their <hi>messenger sent to Paul, who ministered to his wants.</hi> Phil. 2: 25. So 2 Cor. 8. v. 23. <hi>Titus</hi> and others are called the <hi>Apostles and messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Corinthianes</hi> viz (as it is there inumar) in that bussines of the collection for the Saincts at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, for which end they were sent to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. So the Spirit of God in Scripture, both in holding out the distince office of <hi>Apostle</hi> properly so called (for I hope our <hi>Informer</hi> will not upon this ground make <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of Apostles</hi> as he doth <hi>of Pastors)</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the very manner of these designations, and their circumstances, when atribut to such inferiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, doth state the distinction betwixt them and ane Apostle in his proper acception, clearly holding out that they had neither <hi>name</hi> nor <hi>thing</hi> of the <hi>apostolick office</hi> properly so called, but that <hi>Ministers</hi> are so impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly only called <hi>Bishops,</hi> He will never prove. But now what is his last shift? <hi>It maybe</hi> (saith he) <hi>their were no Bishops settled as yet at Philippie,</hi> &amp; so it may very well be. But our <hi>Informer</hi> here supposes two things in Question which he will prove <hi>ad calendas graecas</hi> 1. <hi>That their were Bishops, superiour in office &amp; degree to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, appointedby the Apostles.</hi> The first and second Answer tells us of Bishops (he means diocesian Bishops) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Paul when he wrot to Philippi—Or come from their diocesses (forsooth) and present acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally there: And haveing told us that the <hi>diocesian Bishops</hi> were among the rest of the <hi>Presbyters Bishops</hi> in his third answer, His last shift is, that they were not it may be, yet sett up at Philippy, But <hi>remark,</hi> that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104445:89"/>
as all these <hi>proteus like</hi> shifts and answers contradicts one another, So they all lean upon this Egyptian reed, <hi>that the Diocesian Bishop is ane officer divinely appointed, and then existant.</hi> Now, how impertinent dealing this is, let any judge. We prove from this and many such like texts, that the <hi>scripture Bishop</hi> is <hi>a meer presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> they in all there answers doe coyne glosses of these Texts, which doe suppose the <hi>Jus &amp; existence,</hi> of the diocesian prelat, which is the very <hi>quaesitum,</hi> &amp; the thing in Question. 2. He supposes that the Bishop over presbyters (the Chimaera of his own braine) though he was not <hi>settled at this tyme,</hi> yet was to be <hi>Settled after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at Philippi.</hi> But how proves he that the Apostle was to setle after ward such a prelat there? This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their shifts, that the Apostles first sett up <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> keeping still the government of the Churches in their oun hand, till at last towards their end they sett up <hi>prelats,</hi> committing the government to them. But how doth he or they prove this after-institution of the diocesian Bishop? we have already abundantly evinced the Contrary, both that the presbyters were the highest ordinary officers established by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, &amp; that without any such fancied reserve as this is, the wholl power both of order &amp; jurisdiction was committed to them, &amp; exercised by them, &amp; supposed by the Apostles to continow so in their last farewelles to the Churches: and therfor may conclude that the <hi>Bishops of Philippi were meer presbyters:</hi> and that Paul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, &amp; knew no other.</p>

To this our <hi>Informer</hi> answers. 1. <hi>That it is ill reasoning, that because such ane officer is not in such a particular place, or, enumeration, that therefor he is no where to be found in scripture, for how prove we that the Apostle intended in that place, a cempleat enumeration</hi> Ans: he is guilty of a palpable forgerie here, whillmaking his <hi>Doubter</hi> instance <hi>in this place only,</hi> as if we held, that there is here <hi>a full enumeration,</hi> wheras he cannot but know that presbyterians in this argument against prelats, as also protestants in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the papacie, doe, together with this passage, joyn the parallels. 1. Cor. 12: 28. Rom. 12: 16. In which places collated, there is found a compleat, enumeration of all Church officers ordinary, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and adiscoverie of their duties, and gifts who are ordinary officers, even of the very <hi>Deacon.</hi> Lykwayes, we take in with these Texts, the several descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ordinary officers, and particularly of <hi>the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop,</hi> &amp; his gifts and duties, found in any other places of the new Testamament. And since this <hi>Informer</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the Apostles, or rather the Spirit of God his intention of a <hi>full enumeration</hi> in these places Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104445:91"/>
(Such a full Catalogue of Church-officers being therein found) our argument from the Scriptures utter silence of the Diocesian prelat in all these places, stands firme by his own Confession, until he shall disprove this silence and prove the Contrary. 2. Wee might tell him also, that upon <hi>his own ground,</hi> even the Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of this Text as to the Prelat, will prove our point; for it being upon the one hand the Apostles scop to enumerat the <hi>most illustrous excellent gifts and offices</hi> given by Christ to the Church, for her grouth and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as his royal Mediatorie Donations upon his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention into heaven: and upon the other hand, the Apostle descending as low in his enumeration; as the <hi>Pastor,</hi> and <hi>teacher,</hi> whom this man holds to be <hi>officers inferiour to the Diocesian Prelat,</hi> Certainely upon both these grounds, he would have mentioned him in order to this scope, had such ane officer been allowed or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. And as for this Text, it is enough if we prove that the Apostle intended therein though not a compleat enumeration of all, yet of <hi>the most excellent</hi> functions and officers given by Christ to his Church, amongst which the <hi>Diocesian Bishops office hath the prime place</hi> in this mans Judgement. How then (I pray) can he be here ommitted, and ane inferior officer named, His 2d. Answer is. <hi>That Bishops are comprehended under [pastoures] and teachers Bishops being such though of a Superior degree to ordinary Pastoures.</hi> Ans. first that <hi>Scripture Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops</hi> are comprehended under the <hi>pastor</hi> and <hi>teacher,</hi> is certan, but that the <hi>Diocesian</hi> should be so, is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and by him <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> For. 1. he cannot shew that in these enumerations, the <hi>Superior officer</hi> gets the designation of the <hi>inferior,</hi> now he holds the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Prelat to be ane office and order Superiour to the Pastor. <hi>Nixt</hi> this were <hi>no proper enumeration,</hi> as he ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledges there is here, of distinct &amp; officers offices, if they had not all there proper <hi>distinct names and designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:104445:92"/>
And since Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors, are proper designations of distinct officers; and offices, why ought not <hi>the Diocesian Bishop</hi> to have had <hi>his proper epithet,</hi> and to have come in between the Evangelist, and the Pastor, for this was his proper Classe as the higher Church officer. Againe, This answer and shift is the same with that of the Papists to save the pope, for they answer our divines Argument from this Text, <hi>that he is included in the office of the Apostle.</hi> But as we tell them that according to there account and Character of him, he ought to have had a more peculiar designation, So we may say to this <hi>Informer</hi> here. Besides, may not <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches,</hi> and all the rabble of the popes locusts have this pretended for them, that they are included in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of these officers? Sure we may in Charity suppose that if a Papist were pleading thus, This man would tell him, that it were no defence to shape out officers of their own devising, &amp; then alledge they are included in some of these scripture designations, which answer suites his own case, Since he cannot make it appear that the Diocesian Bishop is appointed in Scripture, And we have proved his office to be contrary unto it. <hi>Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Hetels us <hi>[That if we will have here ane perfect enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of all Church officers, we must comprehend [ruleing elders, and deacons] in some of these words, and why may not he doe so with [Bishops.]</hi> Ans. 1. We need not, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our scope nor argument from this text, alledge either a full enumeration of all officers, or goe about to includ [elder] and [Deacon] <hi>under some of these words,</hi> It being, enough if wee con shew that the <hi>most eminent Church officers</hi> given for the Churches edification, are here enumerat, &amp; that the enumeration comes the length of ane officer <hi>inferior to the Prelat,</hi> in this mans esteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, down from ane Apostle; which renders our Argument from this Text impregnable. 2. If we should include the <hi>elder and Deacon,</hi> in one of these words, we should but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104445:92"/>
therein <hi>inferiour officers of divine appointment</hi> in the designation <hi>of Superior,</hi> which he will acknowledge to be no unusual thing in Scripture. But his including the <hi>Diocesian Bishop</hi> is both the including of <hi>a forged anti Scriptural officer</hi> of his own deviseing: and likewayes, if he includ him under the <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>teacher,</hi> ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding and comprehending of <hi>a Superiour officer</hi> under the designation of <hi>ane inferiour,</hi> both which differences doe cutt the sinnewes of Reason and answer.</p>

But the Bishop he must let us see the warrand for is the <hi>Diocesian Erastian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, haveing sole power in ordination and jurisdiction, bound to preach to no flock, and deriving all his power from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrat.</hi> Now, when he hath given us Scripture warrand for such ane ordinary Church-officer, as is of this mould under the new Testament, <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> Wee see he still walks in darknes as to the <hi>State of the Question,</hi> and dare not exhibit to us the mould of the present Bishop now existent, when he offers to produce Scripture warrands for him. His 1. Warrand is; <hi>that under the old Testament (setting aside the hie Priest who was a Typ of Christ) there was a subordination among the rest of the Priests, mention being made of chief Priests</hi> 2 <hi>King</hi> 19: 2. <hi>Ezr:</hi> 8: 29. <hi>&amp;c.

Cap. 3. pag. 8. to 38. As this (I say) is clear, so it is evident, that it is much more then a meer subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Courts or officers, which he most prove if he will conclude any thing to purpose against us, viz, The Prelats sole decisive power, and negative voice in judicatories, and their deryvation of all their authority from the Magistrat as his deputs, in their administration. Now, from the subordination of Courts, or officers, mentioned under the old dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to conclude [the lawfulness of a Prelat (a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Minister of the new Testament) his taking from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers all the power of Government, contrary to our Lords express command, his laying, aside the preaching Talent, and giving up all the ecclesiastick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which he pretendes unto, to one who is not, <hi>Qua talis,</hi> so much as a Church member] is a wide and wilde conclusion: yet that this is the conclusion which he must infer to prove his point, is beyond all Question.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Giveing, not granting to him that there was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old dispensation such a Hierarchy as he pleades for, and such a difference of degrees among Church officers, as he represents, how will he prove this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence [that the Government of the Church under the New Testament must be <hi>thus moulded,</hi> and have the same degrees of Ministers, as the Jewes had of Priests and Levits] this Connexion he supposes here, and offers afterward some smatterings in proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104445:94"/>
but with what success we shall see with in a little. Will he say that it is lawful to bring into the christian Church every point of the jewish policy? <hi>Bilson,</hi> ane English Bishop (even in pleading for Prelacie) will give him the lie if he say so, and shew him the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie betwixt their Church government and oures: <hi>Perp: Gov. Chap.</hi> 2. [for the tribe of Levi (saith he) was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subjected to the Government, of another tribe, nor without manifest confusion could it want all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherefore as all the rest, so this tribe also had its proper Magistrats, to wit, its, Pinces Elders, judges &amp;c.—He adds, that the Jewes Law contained in the books of Moses, comprehended the mould of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Government, and the Priests and Levits being most skilful in this knowledge, we need not wonder that they were placed in the same benches with the judges] (this we offer to our <hi>Informers</hi> observation, to snew how this Bishop Pulles his care in argueing from the Priests sitting in civill courts numb. 11, To Justifie our Prelats civill rule) but now to our purpose in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Church government, he adds further [that the offices of the Sanctuarie, and rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Sacrifices, from which all the other tribes except the Levites were restrained, were not of one kinde; So that it needs be no wonder that these degrees of the administrators were distinguished according to the diversitie of <hi>offices and services.</hi> But in the Church of Christ, the Word and Sacraments concredited to all Ministers without distinction, as they are of one kinde, neither admitts any difference of administration, or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration, so neither doe they require <hi>different degrees of Ministers]</hi> Thus he. Sure had our <hi>Informer</hi> listened unto this information of this Father of the Church (as he speaks) he would have spared this Argument as not worth the repeating. The Ministry of the Levites who served in the sojourneing Tabernacle, is compared to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104445:94"/>
warrfare Numb. 4. Because of the Militarie order which the Priests and Levits observed in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ministry. Where there was one common Temple, a common Ministry of the priesthood, a thousand administrators in every family (the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four families who served each their week in the Temple being called <hi>courses</hi> by Luke, &amp; <hi>stationes</hi> by the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> the term being borrowed from warrfare, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes <hi>(in Canonibus isagogicis)</hi> it is no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge thing if in this Ministry, and Priesthood, their were such degrees of administrators; but the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood being changed, there is made of necessity a change of the law, saith the Apostle Hebr. 7: 12. And the policie suitable to the state of that Church must by necessary consequence be changed also.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The antecedent of the Argument from that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, will be a harder taske then he imagines, and this <hi>Informer</hi> would be quite out if put to draw us the Image and lineaments of our present prelacie in the Jewish Church Government. For 1. We cleared above that the Ecclesiastick Sanhedrin was distinct from the civil, and that the priests had a distinct independent authority and ministery: But the prelats derive all their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual authority from the Magistrat. 2. He cannot shew that either the Highpriest, or any inferiour priests had the <hi>sole decisive Suffrage</hi> in their ecclesiastick Courts, or such a negative voice as the prelats exercise &amp; assumein their pretended Synods and presbyteries. The learned <hi>Iunius</hi> will informe our Informer <hi>(De Cler. Cap.</hi> 24 <hi>Not</hi> 13.) <hi>That, par consortium honoris &amp; potestatis fuit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sacerdotes, sed ordine impari, qua familiarum, qua tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris respectu. Penes concessum sacerdotum ex lege fuit ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria jurisdictio ecclesiastica</hi> That is, <hi>Among the priests there was a like participation of honour and power, though in a different order: partly in respect of families, and partly in respect of times, the ordinarie ecclesiastick jurisdiction belonged</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:104445:95"/>
                  <hi>to the assemblie of the priests according to the Law.</hi> Thus he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sure then it belonged not to the Highpriest alone, farr less to any inferiour priests, and therefore none of them all had our prelats negative voice in judicatories, or a sole decisive Suffrage, so that they were farr from our prelats principality as to directive and corrective po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And therefore though we should grant that his argument will hold as to our being oblidged by the policie of the Jewes, and to have the government of the Gospel Church this moulded, yet our present hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie is so different from it, that it will not help his cause in the least.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>doubter</hi> objects [that there ought not to be such a subordination under the new Testament.] To which he answers, <hi>[That the Old Testament-subordination being to maintaine order and unitie in the in the Church, there is the same reason for it under the new, and stronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Christian Church is of larger extent then the Iewish, and the danger of schismes, and the necessity of preventing them, the greater: And what better way for this then Gods way thus exemplary pointed out to us, although the New Testament gave no other ground, Gods own model being best for the Church.]</hi> I answ. 1. He must plead for much more then <hi>a meer subordination of Officers,</hi> if he speak to the point, as is clear from that is said. And his <hi>Doubter,</hi> (if he had dealt fairely) should have objected [that the New Testament Church ought not to have <hi>the same mould of government</hi> that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish had, and that there is a vast disparitie betwixt their prelatick Erastian Hierarchie, and the Jewish Church-Government] Both which grounds doe break the force of his argument. But it is good that our <hi>Informer</hi> hath the doubters arguments and objections of his own moulding. 2. Though he know reason of a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation under the Old Testament (he should have said <hi>of that particular mould of government which the Iewish Church had</hi> but his general one, to maintaine order and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104445:95"/>
union in Gods Church (he should have said <hi>in that Church, under that special dispensation,)</hi> yet we have showen him some Reasons of their particular policie which doe not reach us. And shall onely resume to him that we have neither. 1. Such a distinction of tribes. Nor 2. A common Temple, and common Ministry in one Temple for the universal, or for any National Church, as they. Nor 3. Have we such types and shaddowes, from which (as upon the former grounds) this mould of government did flow. Nor 4. Such various sanctuarie offices, and degrees, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of administrations, requiring (as Bishop Bilson hath told him) such varietie and different degrees of Administratores, the Word and Sacraments being concredited to all Ministers without distinction &amp;c. Besides, hath not the Apostle in the forementioned pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, Hebr. 7: 12. Given this <hi>Informer</hi> a sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why wee are not tyed to the same Policie, viz becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se that the <hi>Priosthood is changed,</hi> (i. e.) their particular frame of Church officers, &amp; that therefore there <hi>is made a change of the Law,</hi> that is, of the legal ordinance, both of worsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ip &amp; Government. 3. Darene say that Christs Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, may have every mould of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which may be in it self, or in respect of some circumstances, commendable, and subservient to these ends of order and union? Where is Christs faithfulness as a Sone over his own house, beyond that of Moses? Where are all the New Testament prescriptions in point of government, Officers, Lawes, Censures, if the Church thereof like <hi>a Tabula rasa</hi> may have any government introduced into it, which may be <hi>in its own time and place</hi> good, and Ministers framed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Old Testament dispensation?</p>
               <p n="4">4. How will our <hi>Informer</hi> extricat himself as to the Jewish High priest in maintaining this Answer to his doubter? Was not his office <hi>a special mean of order and</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104445:96"/>
                  <hi>unitie in that Church, and to prevent schisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s and divisions?</hi> And is there not the same reason that the Christian Church should be thus kept from that evil by a supream Highpriest or bishop? What better way for this, then Gods owne way? And what better pattern for modelling the New Testament-Church in point of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then this pattern? Surely the Pope will thank him for this. I know he sets aside (in contradiction to <hi>Saravia,</hi> as I shall shew) the Highpriest in his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a Type of Christ, the man forsaw that this would cast his argument in to ane intire Popish mould; but he is not so forseeing as to prevent his being snared by his own reason, &amp; caught in the brieres of contradictions. For 1. He dare not deny that this Officer was a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Mean</hi> of their <hi>order</hi> and <hi>union.</hi> Hence he must grant that his answer to the doubters objection is naught, and that Gods way of preserving order and union in the New Testament Church, is different from his way, and the means of preverving it under the Old, and that the <hi>Samenes</hi> of the <hi>end</hi> of Gods ordinances and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones under both dispensations, will not plead for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>the same institutiones.</hi> Was not order, union, and the edification of the Church, the great end of all the Mosaical Ceremonies and Pedagogie. Were not the Jewes for this great end of order and union to keep their solemne Feasts? To go up to Jesusalem solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and joynly three tymes in the year? To have one common Temple, one Altar, &amp;c. And must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Christian Church observe the same ordinances and institutions? 2. How will he prove that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Priests were not Types of Christ as well as the Highpriest? Dare he say that their praying for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their sacrificeing, were not typical of Christs intercession and sacrifice, as well as the praying and sacrificing of the High priest, though not in the same degree of eminencie? I grant that the Apostle (Heb. 5.)
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104445:96"/>
speaking of the authority and honour of Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, presentes the legal type thus; <hi>Every Hiepriest ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from among men, &amp;c.</hi> Yet if we shall consider that Hebr. 10. discoursing of the efficacie of Christs sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in opposition to the legal, he sayes in the 11, &amp; 12. Ver. <hi>And every Priest</hi> (simply, not evrie High-priest) <hi>standeth dayely ministering &amp; offering the Same sacrifices, which can never take away sin, but his man after he had offered one Sacrifice for sins, &amp;c.</hi> It will be evident that the inferiour priests were also Types of Christ. So that he should either have taken in the High priest into his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or excluded together with him, the inferiour priestes upon the same ground. For <hi>majus &amp; minus non variant speciem rei.</hi> If he say that he is not speaking of their Sacrifices, but of their Government, which was not typical. Answ. Why might he not then have taken in the High-priest upon this ground, since these are as well distinguishable in him, as in the inferiour Priests? So that he might have been excluded from having any thing to do with the Type in pointe of his government as well as they. And for his single eminencie, it drew along with it those degrees of inferiour priests and Levits, (in his principles) which are mentioned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that if the one must evanish as a Type, in the same manner must the other. 3. It will much puzele this <hi>Informer</hi> to prove, that the Highe priest in respect of his <hi>government</hi> was a Type of Christ; Sure he will find this denyed by his fellow brother in the cause, <hi>Tilen</hi> in his <hi>Parenes:</hi> (Cap. 2) <hi>in summo Sacerdote ceu pontifice, non typi so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum sed</hi>

He will of necessity introduce a pope into the Christian Church: Which will be convincingly clear, If we shal in the 4t. place consider, that our <hi>Informer</hi> in this argument hauing set aside the High priest, <hi>as onely typical,</hi> tells us of another single <hi>Chief and High priest under him,</hi> and tels us in answer to the premised objection, that this method of the Jewish government (with this Chief or high priest; distinct from the typical priest) <hi>is exemplarlie pointed out to Christians as Gods patterne for mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deling the gospel-Church government.</hi> So that without all shaddow of evasion his argument pleads for a chief pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch over the Christian Church, as being a parte of the Jewish policie oblidging us, and exemplarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us for our imitation. Moreover, I would know what he would say, If one should plead for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of all the judicial lawes of the Jewes upon his two grounds. 1. As not being typical. 2. As being Gods excellent means for order and union, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended exemplarly unto Christians to the same end, what better patern for modelling our government and lawes then this patern? Likewayes will he say that every peece of the Jewish antiquated pedagogie was properly typical: And that we are bound to reteane as of a moral perpetual nature whatsoever thing in their policie was not such. Surely there were many things depending upon the particular exigences, and state of that people, both as a Church under that old dispensation, and as a Commonwealth regular in its
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104445:97"/>
civil Lawes immediatly by God, which no found divines doe call Typical, and yet doe hold that they oblidge no Church or state under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
               <p>For a conclusion of this argument, I shall tell this <hi>Informer</hi> that he grossly mistaks these Scripture expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (at least in the judgment of some learned) anent the Chief Priests 2. King. 19: 2. &amp;c. When taking them to denot different <hi>ecclesiastick degrees</hi> among the priests in <hi>their spiritual function:</hi> these chiefness (to speak so) or principality among the priests, being meaned of a civil principality existent in that Tribe before the priesthood was therein established: and that they were called <hi>Chief-priests,</hi> or Elders of the priests, did flow from this that this Trybe (subject to the same Princes as at the first) was afterward <hi>set apart for the priesthood,</hi> for Aaron and his Soones were chosen to be priests Exod. 28. but the whole. Tribe was not assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto the priesthood before Numb. 1. Yet in the meane while the tribe of Levie (Exod. 6.) had the Heads of their families &amp; their Princes. The Scripture then speaking of the tribe of Levie <hi>as a Tribe simply,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes to it the same policie with the rest of the tribes, &amp; Princes of the several families by the right of primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitur: Thus both priests and Levits had their chiefe men and presidents. But <hi>as a Tribe separat to holy things,</hi> it had <hi>its peculiar policie.</hi> One was chief priest onely by Gods appointment, at whose hand all the rest of the priests were. 1 Chron. 24: 24. And at the hands of the priests were the interior Levites, in their several servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. David in distributing them in their several Temple offices, did not set the Princes over them as such, but onely having numbered them after the Heads of their families, and by their lotts or Courses, did assigne to them their service of the Temple, upon Gods command by the mouth of Gad and Nathan, the more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104445:98"/>
to facilitat this Sacerdotal tribe, their comeing unto, and returneing from the Temple. The Chief of the families then, are not upon this ground <hi>Princes or Chief</hi> as to the <hi>Holy Ministerie;</hi> for there was but one onely high priest, all the rest as well the heads, as the families themselves, were at the hand of the highpriest in the Ministery of the House of the Lord, 1 Chron. 24: 19. Where the Chief or head in matters sacred, had no more power then the wholl body. So was it in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of the Levits into their several classes by their Heads Chap. 23: 27, that they might beat the hands of the Sons of Aaron in the Temple Ministery. So that none of his citations doe amount to any proof of his fancied degrees and subordination among either the priests or Levits in <hi>their spiritual functions,</hi> or any other waye then in their civil capacitie as a Tribe; neither had the two high priests (mentioned Luc. 3.) The least warrand in Gods institution, but this is acknowledged to be a corruption in their Government then creept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other corruptions: and since he drawes his first instance of the Levits subordination from Exod 6. before that tribe was set apart at all to the Holy Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that passage at least, and (as I said, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some) its parallels also aftermentioned by him, doe speak of the Civil Government and subordi nation of the Levites in that capacitie; and that any of their Chief rulers are by the Greeks termed <hi>Episcopus,</hi> is a very poor argument to conclude their Ecclesiastick rule, it being notourly known that the best Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores put his designation upon Civil Governoures.</p>
               <p>This subordination among the Levites in Exod. 6: 15. is unquestionably civil upon the ground assigned. And numb. 3. It is evident that the heads and princes of Families are numbered. And accordingly the heads and Chief of the families, 1 Chron. 24. and in Neh: 11: 14. He that is set over the priests, <hi>is the son of one</hi>

               <p>Our <hi>Informer</hi> comes nixt to his <hi>New Testament proofes</hi> for Bishops and produces first, <hi>the superiority of the twel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Apostles above the seventy Disciples.</hi> Where 1. Wee see, He is still in the clouds of <hi>a general superiority,</hi> which is farr from the <hi>Prince-like Arbitrary, and Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian superioritie</hi> of the Diocesian Prelat now existent, and whom he undertakes to plead for, which this <hi>Informer</hi> (Had he intended to have informed right) should have condescended upon. Had the Apostles such a superioritie over the seventy Disciples? Were they subject to the Apostles as their Rectors and judges? Did the Apostles (as our Prelats) assume a Sole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive, conclusive suffrage, and a negative voice over Church Judicatories, notwithstanding of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and high prerogatives? Did we not see the contrary exemplified in that meeting of Apostles with ordinary Ministers, Act. 15? Had the seventy onely a derived precarius Ministry under the twelve Apostles, as their Vicars &amp; Substitutes in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration? Had they no Interest in the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment but upon the Apostles meer pleasure. As <hi>Curats</hi> are now in all these respects subject to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats? Had not the seventy their mission, their insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, immediatly from Christ as well as the Apostles themselves? Were they not consequently to exercise their Ministery upon this ground, without such a servil dependance upon the twelve as Prelats doe arrogat to themselves ane arbitrary principality over Ministers?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104445:99"/>
Were the twelve to <hi>rule only,</hi> and to committ the preaching worke to the seventy as their deputes, as our Prelats now doe? Or were they not rather to help forward the great harvest, and the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, together with the Apostles themselves? So that this <hi>Informer</hi> will never find the least shaddow of ane Episcopall superiority here. But 2. Granting that the Apostles were officers in <hi>asuperiour degree</hi> to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, which is the utmost Conclusion which he can draw from Scripture, how will this infer <hi>a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority</hi> among officers of the <hi>same degree.</hi> We grant the Apostles were superior to Evangelists, they againe to Pastoures, <hi>Ergo,</hi> one Pastour may be a diocesian Prelat over hunderds of other Pastours, is a consequence known to no logick. Christ appointed both extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and ordinarie officers in their severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as Apostles, Evangelists, Pastours: Ergo, he appointed different degrees of Pastours, hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion imaginable. 3. Tht basis of his argument lyes in this [that the Prelats are <hi>immediat successours</hi> of the Apostles in their degree of superiority to the seventy Disciples, and <hi>Pastours</hi> come after the seventy in their supposed subjection, and are not the <hi>Apostles immediat successours</hi> in the ordinary Ministery] but this, as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the quesitum or question, must be proved, not begged and supposed by him. We did already evince the contrary, viz, That the Pastour to whom is committed the Ministery of the Word and Sacraments, and both the keys, immediatly from the Apostles, are the highest ordinary officers, and the Apostles immediat successorus as to both order and Jurisdictione. But the <hi>doubter</hi> and I object furder [that the Apostles superioritie over the seventie, was extraordinary, personall, temporarie, and to cease with themselves.] In answer to this, <hi>He grants that in some things their priviledges were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104445:99"/>
                  <hi>and to cease with themselves, such as their immediat cas. ling, their sending to all nations their infallibility, gifts of tongues, or whatever was necessary for the first founding of the obristian Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>rch. but in other things wherein they were supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to other Ministers, their power was not extraordinary and temporarie, but still to be continued, such as ordination of Ministers, and governeing them by ecclesiastick authority; in which power the Bishops succeeds them, who are [the children in stead of the Fathers] as Augustin applies that of Psal.</hi> 45, v. 19. Ans. 1. Then it seems that with him the <hi>Episcopal office</hi> properly succeeds to that of <hi>the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and is a continuation of their power in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and jurisdiction over Pastours, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts his second answer to our Argument from Ephes. 4 viz [that Bishops in that place may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the the <hi>office of Pastours &amp; teachers]</hi> For here he makes their office the same with that of the Apostles as importing ane authority in ordination and Jurisdiction over Pastors and teachers, and so he should have said rather that it is comprehended under the <hi>Apostolick office</hi> 2. He yet againe contradicts himself in this answer whill granting [that whatsoever was necessary for the first planting of the Christian Church <hi>is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ceased with the Apostles]</hi> and yet making their <hi>power of ordination of Ministers,</hi> and in governing them, to be <hi>still necessary,</hi> he must understand it as performed and done by them, since therein he imagins the pattern of episcopall power to ly: For other wayes the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians doe hold and prove that ordination by the Presbytery, and Government by Presbyters collegiatly, is still continued and necessarie; This he will not allow, and so must understand it of the manner wherein the Apostles performed this at first. Now I say, their Apostolick power in ordination and Government as exercised by them at first, <hi>was necessarie for the first founding of the Church.</hi> For 1. Their power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104445:100"/>
was of <hi>equal limits and extent</hi> with their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to all nations<hi>—Goe disciple all nations,</hi> I hope he will grant was extraordinary, as being necessary for the first founding of the churches, <hi>Ergo,</hi> say I. so was their power in ordination and Government of Ministers, since it was of a like nature, and of the same extent; for to what ever nations they were sent together a Church therein, there they were to <hi>ordaine Ministers, &amp; governe them by ecclesiastick Discipline,</hi> which he makes to be <hi>the Bishops office.</hi> 2. Their sole power in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Government, here supposed, by him, did certainly presuppose the Christian Church <hi>in fieri,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were to be founders. First They were, as Christs immediat extraordinary Ambassadours, to convert and bring in Churches, then to plant officers, &amp; the Gospel Government in them; Now, who will say but this power was <hi>necessary for the first planting of the Churches,</hi> and so comes under the Character of these things which this man acknowledges to be expired: Surely where no other officers were to concurre, the Apostles of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity behooved to ordaine solely, and their Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Inspection over them did necessarly depend upon, and flow from, <hi>their Apostolick extraordinary mission and infalibilitie,</hi> So that this power in so fare as Episcopall like, was indispensibly <hi>needful for the first founding of the Churches</hi> and consequently must be expired by his own confession, the nature and exercise of this power sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseing, and requiring their peculiar mission, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and gifts of tongues, which are acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this man to be expired privileges, necessary ry onely at that time. Moreover, the Apostles power in ordination and government did include extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary miraculous rodes and censurs, &amp; a power in coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing the rebellious, thus Peter stroke Ananias and Sapphira dead for their lying which was a fearful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Censure, put forth by his Apostolick
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104445:100"/>
authoritie at that time, Paul stroke Elimas the sorcerer blind for withstanding the truth; besides, their power in ordination at that time, included their miraculous conferring of the Spirit by the Imposition of hands. 2 Tim. 1: 6 Act. 19: 1, 2, 6. Now, all these Apostolick priviledges (which this man must needs acknowledge <hi>upon his own ground</hi> to be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and extraordinarie) being necessarily included in, &amp; essential unto the Apostolick power, the nature and exercise thereof must be expired also. Wee shall offer here to the <hi>Informer</hi> a distinction of the learned <hi>Iunius,</hi> who in his answer to <hi>Bellarmins</hi> argument for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Episcopal singular power, from that word <hi>Shall I come to you with a rod,</hi> distinguishes the ordinary and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary rod, <hi>secundum illam, &amp;c.</hi> (de Concil. lib. 2. Cap. 16.)—that is, <hi>according to the commone or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rode.

In Churches already constitut, this Authority was not solely resident in <hi>Tymothy and Titus Falluntur, qui putant</hi> (saith Calvin, <hi>Instit:</hi> lib: 4. Cap. 3.) &amp;c. that is, <q>they are mistaken who judge either Timothy at Ephesus or Titus at crete to have exercised any impite or Dominion to dispose of things each at his own pleasure, they were set over the people (no word of their being set over Ministers) to go before them in good and wholsome Counsells in relation to the placeing of Ministers, not that they might doe as they pleased excluding others.</q> Since Paul himself neither imposed hands nor did excommunicat alone, and since (as I said above) a wholl colledge or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of Apostles acted nothing <hi>pro imperio,</hi> but in Churches constitut had elders going along with them in all that Sinodal procedour Act 15. Farrless would Timothy and Titus assume this episcopal preheminence, who were inferiour to any of the Apostles, therefore their power in this was not episcopall. 2. That autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which was intrusted to the elders and Ministers <hi>in commone,</hi> /was not intrusted to any <hi>one officer,</hi> such as Timothie; But so it is that after the Church of Ephesus was exedified and compleated in its organick being, and after Timothy had gotten his charge as to ordination and Jurisdiction in Ephesus, Paul committed <q>the wholl episcopal power to the elders (as is said) before</q> Timothies face in his last farewell, Act. 20. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he intrusted him with no episcopall preheminence in or over that Church when compleated in its organick being. 3. They whose power stands so circumstantiat
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104445:102"/>
as to ordination and jurisdiction over these Churches, that it excluds Episcopale preheminence, properly and formally such, their power in ordination and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, cannot be prelatical, nor ground ane argument for prelacie: but such is the power of Timothie and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. For 1. As Diocesian Bishops they ought to have been determinatly and designedly set and fixed there, as the officers of these Churches, but the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the text [I befought the to abide at Ephesus] and againe [I left thee at Crete, and to set in order things that are wanting] which words point at <hi>ane occasional transient, employment there,</hi> not a fixed instalement. 2. In these Epistles they are both Called back without the least intimation of their returneing. 3. If their power was Episcopall and ordinary, then in the apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and rules anent their Successours, their power and authority ought to have been described, <hi>and rules gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> touching the gifts, Call, ordination &amp;c. <hi>of the dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Bishop,</hi> but the Apostle prescribes no rules for any officer <hi>higher then a Pastour,</hi> &amp; supposes still that he is the highest ordinary officer, in all his directions as to Church government. 4.

He grantes he was ane Evangelist in a large sense or a preacher, but not in the strict sense, but what that <hi>strict sense</hi> is, in which he denyes Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ane Evangelist, he doth not clear, and so his strict sense is left without sense, and his distinction must flie with one wing. He knew that his assigneing ane explication of his strict sense, would have so palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly included Timothy, that his evasion would be presently shut up: therefore he left the other branch of his distinction, a meer mute under the clouds, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves us a distinction which stands upon one leg. 2.

Ephes. 4. Now that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy was such ane Evangelist, is already fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and by consequence that the objection stands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and unanswered by him. viz. <hi>That he was ane unfixed extraordinarie officer, and not to continue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any authority which he is supposed to have over this Church, layes no foundation of Prelacie.</hi> For he sayes nothing to this consequence, but admitts it upon the supposition that Timothy was ane Evangelist in a strict sense, and <hi>ane extraordinary officer. Cartwright</hi> answering the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> upon this place, takes it in the strict sense menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, telling the Jesuites that Paules calling Timothy once <hi>ane Evangelist,</hi> hath more pith in it then all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Pishop</hi> that others can give him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Informers</hi> reason of denying the special office of Evangelist to be here imported, viz <hi>That he might be as well called a Deacon, as being enjoyned to fulfull his Miuistery or Deaconship in the Greek,</hi> is very poor. For 1. It being clear that the Scripture holdes out such ane office as that of <hi>Evangelist,</hi> specifically distinct fromother offices. Ephes. 4. (as this man acknowledges) and it being equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this or any other <hi>office</hi> and relation hath a <hi>work and dutie proper andpeculiar therunto</hi> and likewayes that the office layes ane obligation upon the person who carryes it, to perform the duties thereof. And Finallie. Jt being evidently the Apostles Scope, from the consideration of the <hi>office,</hi> to exhort to the <hi>duties suitable thereunto,</hi> its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104445:105"/>
by its own light that Timothy is here stirred up to the duties of that peculiar station &amp; office which we have proved he sustained; &amp; thereforit cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of <hi>a general Ministery or service.</hi> Will any doubt what the sense of such phrases is, [do thework of a parent] [do the work of a Master] [do the work of a Pastour] who knowes what the office and relation of a parent, master, and Minister is, and that this phrase importes, this precept enjoynes the duties proper to such relations and offices. So the case is here, which none will doubt of but this <hi>Informer</hi> who starts needles doubts, when he cannot answer his presbyterian Doubter. 2. The Deacons office haveing in Scripture its limites drawn, the circumstances of the place where the word <hi>Diaconia</hi> stands, discovers when we are to take it in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall sense, and when this inferiour officer is pointed out. So it were absurd when Archippus is bidden fullfill his Ministery, or when the Apostle calls himself a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, to imagine that the proper formall office of <hi>Deacon</hi> is ascribed to the one or the other: But the <hi>service</hi> there meaned is ane <hi>Apostolicall</hi> and <hi>Pastorall</hi> service, not the service of Tables. Now, <hi>fulfill, or make full proofe of thy Ministery</hi> (as our Translatores doe weill render it, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deacon a peculiar Inglish terme according to the greek sound of the word to avoide confusion) is exige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ministery he is to fulfill, is his <hi>Evangelistick Ministery,</hi> the latter expounds the former, so that in the very phrase it self, the evangelistick office is asserted and the deaconship denyed. The phrafe of <hi>Evangelist,</hi> &amp; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>the workof ane Evangelist,</hi> determins his peculiar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; there being no other Evangelists in the scripture sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, but either those that wrote or published the gospell in that extraordinary way, and Timothy being clearly one of such, it must needs import the <hi>Evangelist</hi> in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar sense, and is distinct from the generall phrase of <hi>Ministery</hi> in the latter branch of the words, which stands limited and restricted by the first part as Isaid.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104445:106"/>
Again, since he includes in the generall terme <hi>[Episeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus]</hi> his diocesian Bishop, as distinct from a presbyter, in philip. 1. and Act. 20. Wee may with farr better eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce take in the peculiar evangelist here, the office proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, being both a scripture office, and likewayes so clearly applicable to the person to whom this precept is given, non of which he can say in his case. Moreover, I wonder whither he would admitt this his gloss, if this phrase were directed to a Pastour as it is here to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy [doe the worke of a Pastour, make full proofe of thy Ministery] would he think this a good argument or reason to deny him to be a Pastour, because the latter branch of the sentence expresses a deaconship?

(as he seems to insinuat by making this <hi>the proper worke of ane Evangelist)</hi> then surely he will not deny but this was <hi>Timothy's worke,</hi> and so he must be ane Evangelist in the strict sense, against what he first asserts. He acknowledges the ordinary Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists or preachers, were to preach and spread the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell within their Sphere, and so the strict Evangelist
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104445:107"/>
must be distinguished from them by <hi>unfixed preaching and spreading the Gospell:</hi> which (besides what is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) will bring a new inconvenienc upon our <hi>Informer</hi> and dash him against his principle of fixing Timothy Bishop of Ephesus. Yet againe, though Philip prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Gospell upon the dispersion and spread it unfixedly, yet he denyes him to be one of these extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Evangelists whose office was to cease: So that he doth (as to this) distinguish <hi>preaching and sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Gospell</hi> from the <hi>proper worke</hi> and characteristick of the <hi>Evangelist strictly taken</hi> Thus it is hard to know what he calls ane Evangelist or how he understands it: For neither will he admitt power in ordination and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to be ane ingredient in this office, and thus it is neither fixed nor unfixed preaching or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either, that with him will make up this office properly taken, if we consider the whole structure of his reasoning.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for what he sayes of <hi>philip, That it will not follow, he was ane extraordinary Evangelist, though termed ane Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, since he was a Deacon.</hi> I answer, that Philip was not ane Evangelist properly so called, is by him poorly and gratis asserted, and worse proved; Learned <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place tells us <q>That his Deaconship was a temporal and transient function, then expired, because otherwayes it had no been free to him to leave Jerusalem and go to cesaria; And that he is not here proposed as a voluntar deserter of his office, but as one who had a more excellent office intrusted to him, Which two grounds will put faire to prove that he was not a deacon still.</q> Then he adds <hi>[Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilistae meo judiciointer Apostolos &amp; doctores medii erant, munus enim obibant Apostolis proximum ut passim Evangelium prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicarent, nec praeficerentur certae Stationi—</hi>That is, <q>Evangelists were sett in the middle betwixt Apostles and Doctours, had ane office nixt to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104445:107"/>
and Doctours, had ane office nixt to that of the Apostles, that they might every where preach the gospell and were not fixed to any Station. He gives this reason of his description of the Evangelist, Because, <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 4.) the Apostle describing the order of the Church doth in such manner substitut them to Apostles, as he shews that they had a more inlarged office of teaching intrusted to them then to Pastours whose worke was tyed to certain places. Hence he concludes that Philips deaconship at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, was onely temporall. And for some time there exercised by him, and that he was afterby the Church assumed to be ane Evangelist.</q> In which words wee see. 1. He doth upon weightie grounds prove him to have been <hi>no Deacon</hi> at that time wherein he is called <hi>ane Evangelist.</hi> 2. That he was ane Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilist in the strict and proper sense as it is taken. Eph. 4.—3. That Evangelists are officers above ordinarie teachers or pastours, and in this distinct from them (in the judgement of this great divine) <hi>that they were fixed to no certan charge, as they,</hi> but as being nixt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had ane indefinit unfixed Ministery; all which is cross to this mans blunt confused discourse of this mater, and cutts the sinews of Timothy's supposed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastlie,</hi> Where he affirms <hi>that ordination and jurisdiction were no proper worke of ane Evangelist, but preaching and spreading the Gospell.</hi> 1. I urge him thus, if preaching and spreading the gospel was the characteristick of the Evangelist (He must mean it in a more extensive way then ordinary Pastours if he speak sense) then sure he cannot deny but that Timothy thus preached and spread the gospel as the Apostles Coajutor in many Churches, as is cleared above. Whence it followes by his own Confession. 1. That Timothy's office <hi>was extraordinary and is ceased,</hi> for he affirmes that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104445:108"/>
of ane Evangelist whom he calls extraordinary <hi>was to cease in the Church.</hi> 2. That he had <hi>no Episcopall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ordination and jurisdiction,</hi> He being ane Evangelist in a sense beyond any ordinary preacher, and upon the other hand ordination and jurisdiction by his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>not being his proper worke who is ane Evangilist.</hi> So that Pauls calling him ane Evangelist must lay him by from being a Prelat, and consequently all the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> pleading from his supposed power in ordination and jurisdiction in the 1. Epistle written to him, is frivolous and vaine. For in his sense he could not Act both the worke of <hi>evangelist and Prelat,</hi> these being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleading, inconsistent. But nixt, the wonder is, how this man comes to divide <hi>[preaching and spreading of the gospell]</hi> from <hi>[the power of ordination jurisdiction]</hi> since he cannot but acknowledge that the Apostles did both these, and affirms <hi>that their office was episcopal,</hi> as we heard above. And after he will tell us that Catalogues of Bishops are drawen from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and by <hi>Ierom,</hi> from <hi>marke</hi> the Evangelist who was Bishop of Alexandria. Then it seems <hi>this power in ordination</hi> (wherein, with him the Chief part of my Lord Bishops office lyes) was very well consistent with both the Apostles and Evangelists <hi>their unfixed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged preaching and spreading of the gospell;</hi> The Apostles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed preaching &amp; spreading of the gospell, sure he will not deny: nor can he deny to marke, the Evangelists offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the strictest sense he can imagine: so that both are with him compatible. Thus we see in withstanding the truth, hee is still in the briers of Contradictiones.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doubter</hi> excepts aganist his reason [That philip might be both a deacon and Evangilist] To which he ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers <hi>[That by the same Reason Timothie and Titus might be both Bishops and Evangelists]</hi> I answer 1.

yet the <hi>Informers</hi> answer and parallel, is naught. For 1. Philipes becoming ane Evangelist was ane advancement to a higher office, holding still ane inferiour, which is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter included in it, as he will grant, but making ane Evangelist a Bishop is a degrading of a high extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary superiour officer, to ane ordinary inferiour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ane Evangilist properly so called, his work was to preach and spread the gospel unfixedly, as a Bishop, his work he will say, was ordination and jurisdiction, which Two we heard him affirme to be incompatible.</p>
               <p>Besides, in separating the power of ordination and jurisdiction, from the Evangelistick office, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by <hi>Saravia,</hi> who in many places mantaines the contrary (degrad: cap. 1.—and Cap. 16. and cap. 23) And here I shall shew our <hi>Informer</hi> how he hath run cross to his great Master in his glosses upon several of these Texts under debate, that it may appear, what babel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like builders our prelates Advocates are.</p>

               <p>The <hi>doubter</hi> nixt excepts to better purpose <q>That they could not be Bishops, because they were not settled at these places, especially Timothy, had he been Bishop at Ephesus, he had been fixed to his charge, but he was left only there upon occasional imployment, and for a season, 1 Tim. 1: 3. To this he answers 1. That they were rare and singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons usefull for the Apostle at that time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder that they were called from their particular charge when the Churches good required it. Philip. 2: 19, 20 2 Cor. 8: 23. As with us a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister may be called from his charge for a season when the good of the Church else where requires it.</q> To which I rejoyne 1. This answer supposes the thing in Question (viz) [That Timothie and Titus were once fixed as Bishops in these Churches] But the ground of the exception is, That because their occasionall transient Imployment in these places, is so clear &amp; expresse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for they were never fixed to these Churches as their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge, but had it for their charge to water all the Churches which the Apostles planted, and attend their planetarie motion from Church to Church. So that they cannot be in their worke and duty paralleled to a Pastours transient Imployment from his particular char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge for the Churches greater good, whose <hi>fixed charge</hi> is supposed. But we have proved that Timothie and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus their ordinarie Imployment was this <hi>transient and unfixed Ministery:</hi> which is clearly holden out in scriptur
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104445:110"/>
both befor and after their officiating in these Churches. 2, It is also cleared above, that as the scripture is utterly silent of their return to these Churches againe, after Pauls recaling them from the same, and after their transient Imployment therein: So we have made it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes appear, that they did officiat thereafter in many other Churches, performing to them the same duties of Evangelists as in Ephesus and crete. And that in Ephesus, elders were called Bishops, and had the whole Episcopal charge before Timothie, committed to them in paules last farewell. In a word, it can never be made good that any who were fixed to particular charges, did so travell up and down as these Evangilists are proved to have done. Againe he t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lls us <q>That <hi>Gerard</hi> thinks they were first Evangelists, then made Bishops by Paul at Ephesus and Crete.</q> Ans. If he think so too, he must quite all his plea for their Episcopacie from these Epistles: for Paul calls Timothy <hi>to doe the worke of ane Evangelist</hi> here, and Titus worke was the same: And he must understand this in the strict sense (if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet <hi>Gerards</hi> exception to any purpose) which, according to him, secludes power in ordination and jurisdiction. So that a worke and office being enjoyned Timothy in this Epistle, which hath nothing to doe with ordination and iurisdiction, he was not yet made a Bishop, and if not yet, it will be hard to find out his commission and patent afterward in scripture, since he was in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual evangilistick Imployments, and sure if Paul ever designed him Bishop over Ephesus, he would not have called the elders of Ephesus, Bishopes, befor Timothy <q>in his last farewell.</q> We heard <hi>Saravia</hi> plead <q>that Paul intitles not Timothy an <hi>Evangelist [non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat</hi>

The Councel of Chaldecon judges it sacrilegious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade a Bishop to a Presbyter, such must he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this degrading to be, and therefore that being once Evangelists, of necessity they behoved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so.

the elders <hi>of the Church there,</hi> not imaginary elders or Bishops from other places. 2.

               </p>
               <p>But now comes his proofe of Timothie, and Titus, their Episcopacie from these Epistles. His first Reason in general, is <hi>That in these Epistles more fully then any where else in the new Testament, Paul gives direction to Timothie and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus how to carry in ordination and jurisdiction, which Two comprehends the Episcopall office. Ans.</hi> 1. With him there is a possibilitie, or <hi>may be,</hi> that forall these directions, Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus were evangelists still, <hi>and not yet Bishops;</hi> and so these directions might be given to them as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary officers, who, according to him, <hi>were to cease,</hi> and consequently though comprehensive of the Episcopal office, yet the office might cease with their persons as exercised in that manner, and the power of ordination
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104445:112"/>
and jurisdiction be deryved to different recipients, to be exercised in another maner, (viz) by presbyters in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 2. By what consequence will he infer ane Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall authority and inspection, from <hi>the Apostles prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing rules to them anent ordination and jurisdiction?</hi> May not all Ministers be herin directed, as well as Timothy and Titus? or will his giving directions to them in this poynt infer their sole and singular authority therein? Surely not at all in Churches constitute: and as for what they did in the frameing and constitution of Churches yet <hi>in fieri,</hi> as to their organick being, is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. 3. We did shew above that the prelats power, and their way as to ordination and jurisdiction, is <hi>in its very nature,</hi> different from that which either Apostle or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangilist exercised, as being a <hi>dominion</hi> and arbitrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, yea including in it <hi>a civil dominion,</hi> and derived from the civil Magistrat. None of which can be said of any authority which Timothy and Titus are here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have: In a word, as it is clear that the elders of Ephesus, at Paul's last farewell, were intrusted with the whole power of ordination, and jurisdiction, and as the Episcopi were commanded <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to feed and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le with out any respect to Timothy: which clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrats that he (and consequenly Titus) had no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal power of ordination and jurisdiction, over these Churches, established in their persons, by any prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here delivered; So it is as evident that the same prescriptions might be delivered to <hi>any Moderator of a Synod,</hi> or vnto a transiently visiting Minister, though even in relation to a province, which being necessarly to be understod <hi>Salvo jure Ecclesiae,</hi> would import no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall or sole authority, and thus the case is here.</p>
               <p>But what were these directions importing this power? He instances 1. <hi>[In the qualifications which they must require in such as were to be ordained-not suddenly to lay on hands, which respects ordination, next, the rules anent government, how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi>

These Apostolik directions in point of Government, are good &amp; excellent, but how doth he prove that the <hi>adres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of</hi> these directions, <hi>to Timothie,</hi> will infer his <hi>Sole</hi> and <hi>single authority</hi> in all these, so as to seclude Presbyters from their share therein? And if he prove not this, it will say nothing to evince ane <hi>Episcopal authority.</hi> What if such directions were adressed to a Moderator? would that infer his Authoritie over the Synod? Nay, since a Presbytry laid on hand's upon Timothy himself, Since the Presbyters of this Church of Ephesus, had the Episcopal power in Common, committed to them as the Holy Ghosts Bishops, Since the Corinth-Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery did excommunicat the incestuous, we may cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly infer, that these directions, though immediatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to Timothy, yet belonged to Presbyters of that and Other Churches, as well as him. 2. Supposing that this adress will give him a speciall Interest herein, yet how will the <hi>Informer</hi> prove that it respects Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy any other way, and in any other Capacity, then of <hi>ane Euangelist,</hi> which he sayes it might be, he yet was, and not a Bishop? He dissallowes not of <hi>Gerards</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who sayes, <hi>that he was not yet made Bishop;</hi> Now, if these Rules were to be observed by him, and this his supposed singular Authority exercised <hi>[as ane Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, whose office was to cease,]</hi> It will plead nothing for the Episcopal power. Surely upon our supposition, that he was a fellow-helper and assistant of Paul, in his Apostolik function, and had a transient occasional Imployment here, as is clearely held out in the Text, these rules are very suitable unto him in that capacity. Besids, these Directions are for instruction of <hi>every man of God,</hi> or Minister, in point of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 2.

               <p>In the 3d. place. As to these Directions themselves, particularly as to Timothies direction, as to laying on of hands, 'tis Answered, that <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in ordination, is found in Scripture <hi>a Presbyterial Acte</hi> competent to meer Presbyters, which (as I said) they exercised upon Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy himself, though Paul was present, 1 Tim 4: 14. 2 Tim. 1. 5. And therefor Timothy could have <hi>no single, or Episcopal authority therein</hi> in Churches Constitute So that the precept directs Presbyters as well as him in that point. Nay, this addressed direction mainly respected them, as the <hi>proper subject</hi> of this power, and the Presbytery received their lesson here <hi>(not to lay on hands suddenly)</hi> rather then Timothy. Nixt, As for <hi>his Authority and directions anent rebuking and Censures.</hi> I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sw.</hi> That neither can this be Timothy's sole preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for either it is meaned of <hi>a Privat rebuke,</hi> and this every Christian hath authority in: <q>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</q> Levit. 19: 17.

                  </gap>. 1: 13. 2; Sam. 12: 8. And besides, Institutions and reproofs of Church officers, will not prove a fixed Episcopal power. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets rebuked, but had no jurisdiction over Priests, nor Paul over Peter, though he reproved him. As for that which he particularly mentions about <hi>receiving ane accusation against ane Elder,</hi> It is answered. That this also belongs to the <hi>official juridical power of Elders,</hi> since Ruling &amp; Government attribute to them in Scripture, doth necessarily import ane authority to receive accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and correct delinquents by reproofs and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Matth. 8: 16. 17. There is ane accusation to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104445:113"/>
                  <hi>ecclesiae, to the Church,</hi> or the juridical Court, not to one Prelat, as is above cleared; and therefore the direction anent <hi>the receiving of the accusation,</hi> respects them who were <hi>to judge upon it,</hi> and not the Prelat. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with 1 Cor. 5: 4, 5. The Presbyters must <hi>meet together</hi> to rebuke the Incestuous <hi>there</hi> and they that are <hi>Spiritual</hi> must restore the delinquent, Gal. 6: 1. The Church officers, <hi>or Ministers</hi> of Thessalonica must <hi>note</hi> and <hi>admonish</hi> authoritatively the disobedient Brother, 2 Thess. 3: 14, 15. To which I may add, that as upon the one hand Timothy is forbidden <hi>to rebuke ane el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and positively enjoyned <hi>[doubly to honour them, when faithful]</hi> So, the <hi>receiving ane accusation,</hi> is no more then that which every privat Christian and Minister is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, even against the superiour, whither in state, or age, in relation to admonition, Counsel or Comfort accordingly. Levit. 19: 17. Gal. 6: 1, 2 Joh. 10, 11. None in whatever capacity are exeemed from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, not to receive accusations lightly. Hence the 4th. Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> (cited by <hi>Blond. Apol. Sect.</hi> 4) enacted <hi>That no Bishop should hear ane accusation without the Clergie, and that without their assent, the sentence should be voyd.</hi> where was <hi>the negative voyce</hi> here. <hi>Whittaker,</hi> thus answers the Popish pleading upon this text, and our <hi>Informers</hi> too (controv. 4. Quest. 1. Cap. 2.) <q>That Timothy is commanded not rashly to receive ane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, proves not that he had dominion over El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which according to the Apostles minde is to bring a crime to the Church, to bring the guilty into judgement, openly to reprove, which not only superiors may doe, but also equals and inferiors. In the Roman Republick, the Kings did not only judge the people, but also the Senators and <hi>patricii;</hi> and certainly it seems not that Timothy had such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus bishops heretofore, if any elder or Bishop had ane ill report, referred it to the eeclesiastick Senat or, Synod, and condemned him if he seemed worthy, by a publick judgement, that is, did either suspend, excommunicat, or remove him, the Bishop condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neing nocent elders or deacons, <hi>not by his authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> but with the judgment of the Church and clergie</q>—&amp; in case of appeals, even to the Metropolitan <hi>he could doe nothing without the Synod &amp; what they did was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> The same is the answer of <hi>Bucer de vt &amp; usu, Sacr.

               <p>The <hi>Informer</hi> tells us in the next place that <q>these directions concern after, ages and are of ordinary use: and therefore they cannot be extraordinary officers in these Acts—that in calling Timothy and Titus, extraordinary officers in these Acts, we lead the way to their errour, who call ordination and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, extraordinary.</q> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> As we have proved, that none of these directions will infer in Timothy ane Episcopal Power properly such, but that any power he had above Presbyters; was <hi>by his special Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listick Legation,</hi> so the concernment of after ages in these directions, and their being of <hi>constant use,</hi> is a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful argument to prove the continuanc of the power in that manner. Are not all the old Testament pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts anent the antiquated ceremonies, all the acts &amp; directions given to extraordinary officers, both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old and New Testament, <hi>of perpetual use in after ages?</hi> But are they therefore to be <hi>imitated</hi> and retained?

and joyned with with prayer, a constant stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dutie: and he will not say that this Apostolick precept is to be ex punged as useles. What? must we therefore retean anointing? would he not in this case distinguish betwixt that which is <hi>a constant dutie, and a temporarie concomitant</hi> and appendix. Acted not the Apostles extraordinarely in their very preaching, both as to its extent, its confirmation by miracles, their gifts of tongues, and are not the Acts of preaching and baptizing of constant use in the Church? Must not this <hi>Informer</hi> grant that these <hi>Apostolick Acts</hi> of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching and baptizing are perpetual, though the mould and <hi>maner</hi> is extraordinary and gone, in so far as their extraordinary Apostolick power interposed therein. Thus the Acts of ordination and jurisdiction are moral, but the <hi>modusrei,</hi> is extraordinary, in so farr as their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelistik authority, and special legation, interposed therein. He must either acquiesc in this, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this his argueing <hi>Sophistick</hi> and pueril, or he will contradict what he said before, anent the Apostles extraordinary Priviledges, which are gone with them, viz, infaillibilitie, their immediat call, sending to all nations, <hi>and what else was necessary for the first founding of the Church.</hi> Now, is not that which was thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, <hi>of perpetual use?</hi> Are we not built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apostles and Prophets? Are not the ordinances and Ministery receaved from them, of perpetuall use? And their most extraordinary Acts, if we mean it <hi>of improvement.</hi> Nay, did not the new-Testament Church receave the Law of God, and ordinances from the Jewes? Must we therefore Judaize? 2. How will he prove that the asserting, that any officer hath ane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary authority conversant about such ane Act, will give ground to say, that <hi>the Act it self, is extraordinary, or the ordinance touched by that Act, expyred?</hi> Will his asserting, that the Apostles exercised ane extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb facs="tcp:104445:115"/>
authority which is now ceased, in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfixedly, by ane immediat call, and confirming their doctrine with miracles, and strange tongues, give ground to conclude <hi>that the ordinances of preaching and baptizing are expired also?</hi> I trow he will not grant this. How then will our asserting, that Timothy and Titus put forth ane extraordinary Evangelistick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ordination, and jurisdiction infer, <hi>that the Acts of ordination and jurisdiction, or these ordinances themselves, are expired?</hi> can he not distinguish betwixt the <hi>power it self,</hi> and the <hi>different subject, and manner of its exercise,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or extraordinary? can he not see in Scripture <hi>ane extraordinary power</hi> derived, and cut out in a succession of <hi>different and ordinary channels, and diverslie exercised?</hi> Sayes he not that the Apostles had ane extraordinary power, of both ordination and jurisdiction, and both the keyes. But I trow he asserts that, there are different recipients, who bring down ane ordinary power by succession. Some (Prelats forsooth) have the key of Governmant, others (viz,) Presbyters, have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their work, but no rule properly. And sayes he not that the <hi>extensive authority,</hi> in which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles exercised their Ministry, is gone, and <hi>a limited ordinary Ministry</hi> derived from them. If the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mission of twelve Apostles, hath derived from it a Ministery and ecclesiastick authority spread throw all Church-officers in the world, who succeed them not into <hi>the same office,</hi> let this <hi>Informer</hi> shew me, why may not Timothies Evangelistick extraordinary power in ordination and jurisdiction, be deryved by, and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in a Presbytery, though the <hi>Evangelistick Office</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and (as such) not succeeded unto. The service, and worke of teaching, and governing to continue in all times, doth not render the Apostolick mission or commission, ordinarie, nor infer their being succeded <hi>in idem officium, &amp; eundem gradum,</hi> the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104445:115"/>
ordinary power being institut and settled in the hands of ordinary officers, by a new warrand and commission, according to the Scripture rules of ordination. The office of Moses was not rendered ordinary, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny works of Government exercised by him, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed to the Elders of Israel; and so the case is here. The Evangelists extraordinary office and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission (necessary, as that of the Apostles, for the first founding of the Churches, and watering and building them up in their organick being, &amp; for settling all their ordinary officers) is changed into the Presbytery their ordinary Collegiat power of ordination &amp; jurisdiction; which we find was in the Apostolick Churches exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and even in this of Ephesus.</p>
               <p>His 2d Reason to prove them Bishops, is, <hi>Because their commission at Ephesus &amp; Crete, was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t voyded upon the first settling of Ministers in those places, therefore their office was to be constant, since if meerly as Evangelists they were to settle a Church there, then they were to give place to the Presbytery when some Ministers were ordained: but they did not so:—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>itus needed not ordain Elders in every city, if some few ordained might ordain the rest.</hi> Ans. 1. <q>This is a poor argument, and hath no twist of a connexion [their commission at these places was not voyded upon the first settleing of Ministers,] ergo, [they were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary officers, but had a standing Episcopacie there] which is a meer rope of sand.</q> The Apostles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and commission was not voyded over all Churches when settled, Ergo, they had no extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, office, or commission, towards all these Churches. What consequence is here? So may it be said of these Vicarious Apostles, their commission to these or other Churches could not be voided or expired, though they were never so much settled, but they were <hi>prore nata</hi> to visite and water all the Churches, and bring Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick instructions to them, and reports from them anent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104445:116"/>
their case. We have proved that Timothie and Titus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised their extraordinary office, and commission, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards many other Churches, after their return from the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of Ephesus, &amp; Crete, so that their commission towards these or other Churches, could be no more voided whil the Apostles Imployed them therin, then their office. Besid, this <hi>Informer</hi> should advert, that Timothy is left <hi>To charge some that they teach no other doctrine</hi> which was a commission beyond the meer settling of Ministers, and supposing some already settled. 2. Will he say that Timothy and Titus were ordinary standing officers or Bishops, over these severall Churches, where they might reside some time, and have Imployment therin, even after they had officers of their own? did they not visite and water many other Churches, were they therefore their Bishops? if so he must quickly transport them to be Bishops of other Churches, after they were Bishops here: &amp; exalt them to metropolitan's as some of the ancients make them. 3. <hi>Their Evangelistik inspection,</hi> direction, and assistence, even after some ordinary officers were settled, could no more prejudge <hi>the ordinary power and authority of these officers,</hi> then the Apostles extraordinary inspection, and infallible universal directive power, could prejudge the Churches ordinary authority, in ordination and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. The Apostles power (which could not be voyded, nor expyre, whil they were alive) being <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative unto,</hi> but not <hi>privative of,</hi> the Churches ordinary power, so it is here. I would ask our <hi>Informer,</hi> was Pauls apostolick commission to Crete and Ephesus, voyded, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bishops were set up there? Nay, he will not say it. But did this Null the Episcopall power of Timothy and Titus, over these Churches? I trow not. Well, no more could Timothys extraordinary inspection make voyd the ordinary power of presbyters. 4. We told him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that how long soever Timothy and Titus were resident there, they were to doe nothing pro imperio,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104445:116"/>
and were not to lord it over the presbyters. 5. Although elders once ordained, have power to ordaine others, yet the <hi>bene esse,</hi> did call for the Inspection and direction of such highely gifted and extraordinary officers herein, as these were. And Moreover, in that Infant-state of the Church, Apostolick precepts and rules in reference to Church government, and the exercise of both the key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, were to be delivered by these extraordinary officers, &amp; consequently might call for, &amp; protract their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anc therein, even after ordinary officers were ordained. <hi>Infine.</hi> He cannot deny but that the Apostle recalled both Timothy and Titus from these places, to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prosecution of their employment in other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that their transient imployment therein is held out, after their return from Ephesus and Cret; as likwayes their occasionall employment in both these places, which will <hi>in so farr voyd their commission</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, as clearly to refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the supposed episcopal ordinary charge which he alledges they exercised. Next, from the Authores of <hi>jus divinum Minist: evangel:</hi> [con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding against the peoples power of ordination, upon Timothy and Titus being left at these places to ordaine elders] The <hi>Informer</hi> inferrs against them thus, <hi>why was Timothy or Titus left to ordaine elders, after some were ordained by Paul, If Ministers so ordained could ordaine the rest? and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some were ardained by Timothy and Titus, they were left still upon that imployment.</hi> I answer, his inference touches not these Reverend authors in the least. The ordaineing of elders in relation to the <hi>beue esse,</hi> even after some elders were there, and the furder directing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of these Churches in their members and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, did require ane Evangelistick inspection, though the <hi>ordinarie power of ordaineing,</hi> remained with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary elders and Church officers, as the scripture doth clearly hold out. Paul haveing after committed to the elders of this Church of Ephesus the whol power of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104445:117"/>
government. But the scripture gives not the least hint <hi>of the peoples power to ordaine,</hi> but attributs this still to Church officers as proper to them. So that this Inference stands good in the generall [though some were converted to Christianity there, yet they could not ordaine officers, but Church officers were sent upon that Imployment] ergo. <hi>Church officers must ordaine, and not the people:</hi> but the speciall inference will not hold, <hi>ergo, Biohops must only ordaine</hi> for the reasons already given, no more then from Paules ordaining the first elders, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>[ergo Paul, or ane Apostle only, must ordaine]</hi> which is a Consequence our <hi>Informer</hi> dare not admitt, else he will contradict himself. It is a good consequence [Paul, <hi>a Church officer,</hi> preached and baptized] ergo [none but Church officers must preach and baptize] but [ergo, none but <hi>ane Apostle</hi> must preach and baptize] is bad lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. So his inference is neither logicall nor theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical.</p>
               <p>His 3d. Reason to prove Timothy a Bishop, is taken from <hi>Pauls solemne Charge</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>to keep. what he had commanded him, till the appearing of Iesus Christ. That presbyterians</hi> (particularly, jus divinum Minist. pag. 74.) <hi>hold these Directions to be for all ages of the Church, making them paralleel with Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>anent Christs promised pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to the end and</hi> 1: <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 7, 21. <hi>Anent Pauls Charge to obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve these things.</hi> Whence he concludes <hi>that they were to have successors in their office, and were not extraordinary officers, since these divines say, page</hi> 160. <hi>[That Apostolick examples in things necessary for the good of the Church, and which cary a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall equiry and reason in them, have the force of a rule] and the Apostles setting Timothy and Titus, over these Churches, is ane example Apostolick for the good of the Church, and hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall reason and equitie in it. Ans.</hi> 1. Wee have made it appear that no directions given to Timothy will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to demonstrat any episcopall dominion over this Church, and that he had no sole or arbitrary power
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104445:117"/>
either in ordination or jurisdiction, &amp; consequently that the <hi>charge of</hi> [keeping that which was commanded him] will Import &amp; inferr no keeping of ane <hi>Episcopall charge.</hi> 2. Wee have also shewed what a bad consequence it is, to argue from the perpetual use of precepts or directions, given to extraordinary officers, in relation to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acts, towards <hi>the Churches imitating of these acts, and retaineing these expired functions,</hi> which is palpably a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequitur, as this man can not deny, else he will swallow horrid absurdities. Every thing which is for our <hi>constant use</hi> and Improvement, is not likwayes for <hi>our Imitation.</hi> Againe, 3. I would ask this <hi>Informer,</hi> if the Command 1. Tim. 6. 13. joyned with the promise Matth. 28. 20. Will not reach and include every peece of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik and evangelistik office? Sure he cannot deny this, and yet he acknowledges there were severall peeces of their work temporary and expyred. Will he dare to say that what the apostle commanded Timothy in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, was confined within Ephesus, or reached him only as oversieing that Church, and not in relation to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangilistick office throw all the Churches? and that the promise Matth. 28. did not reach the most extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Apostolick Acts; So that himself must distinguish (unless he be inconsistent with himself) betwixt what is moral, and extraordinary, in this command and charge, and accordingly reached by the promise. 4.

That Timothy is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to committ what he had heard to faithful men, which they understand of ordination of ministers, that there might be a perpetuall succession of teachers. And comparing it with the former citation, it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars that they hold these precepts to import the dery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ordinary power of teaching and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ordinary Ministers. And when the Anti-Ministeriall party object [that these are <hi>but examples,</hi> which doe not amount to make up <hi>a rule]</hi> they give. this answer [that Apostolick examples in things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Church, and which have a perpetuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and equity in them, have the force of a rule] now, this example is anent the committing of ane ordinary power of ordination, and jurisdiction, to faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and teachers, which quit justles out the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical power. For since they hold Timothy's singular

What a pitiful cause must that be which needs the support of such vaine shifts? In phil: 1. and Act. 20. Bishops (diocesian Bishops) must be set up among the presbyters.

He could give no answer but what would render him redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, in his running the Circlestick, and begging the Question. Besides Timothy was yet no Bishop, for he was advanced to this office when set over Ephesus in the <hi>Informers</hi> judgement: and he was now only (with him) a sort of unfixed preacher of the gospell, or ane Evangelist in his large sense. And <hi>Hooker</hi> sayes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists were presbyters of prime sufficiency assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Apostles to attend them. This resolver will have him to be no other wayes ane Evangelist,

then Philip, who, he supposes, was still a deacon when so termed. Thus it evidently appears that Timothy, according to him, and upon the sequel of that answer, receaved at the utmost but a meer presbyterat in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and then I wonder what needs a number of Bishops be mustered together for ordaining him? Might not Paul and the Inferiour presbyters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine such ane one? Thus we see he is still inconsistent what himself in all his shifts. But he hath a 3d.

of his ordination, which Paul gave) which he admitts the presbyters unto, <hi>if we will.</hi> Nay Sir, we will not; 'tis known your party are much in love with ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and we quite them unto you, where they want substance. Was it the Ceremonial part to lay on hands? Then I would propose to our Informer. 1. That since this was neither in order to the gifts, which Paul gave, nor any part of the sacred authority and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as a Church officer, which Paul only gave accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, what signified their laying on of handes at all? Was it only to signifie their consent? Where can he shew in all the scriptures, where laying on of hands is mentioned, that it Imports onely consent, and not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie? this Ceremonie, borrowed from the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, doth alwayes present a badge of ane Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative blessing, flowing from Prophets, Patriarchs and others, to which though there were many assenters, yet none of these assenters laid on hands. Next, since this Ceremonie was used by our Lord, towards his Apostles, and thereafter by them, and particularly in this work: &amp; withall, since it must needs Import here a solemne bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of, a setting apart unto God, and sending out into his vineyeard, the person thus ordained (not to debate whither this Ceremonie be of the essence of ordination, as some judge, yea or not) let our <hi>Informer</hi> shew me, why it may not, upon all these grounds be looked upon as a badge of Ministerial authority, and supposing this authority inherent in the presbyters. I would ask him, 3. Since Paul commended the whol official power of ordination &amp; jurisdiction, to the presbyters, Act. 20. &amp; Peter. 1. Epist. 5. Ch: Imputs ane <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or actuall exercise of Episcopall authority, <hi>to the elders,</hi> who were (as himself acknowledges) <hi>set over the flocks one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and so none of his imaginary <hi>Prelat elders?</hi> With what sense or reason, can he or anyelse say that they could not share in the <hi>substantials of ordination.</hi> many no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104445:121"/>
with the publick blessing at Timothies ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for I suppose it was done in the view and presen ce of the assembly, But did any of them lay on hands? Besyds, we might here tell him that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or presbytery, doth alwayes Import a juridicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Court, so the word is taken Luk. 22. 66. and Act. 22. 5. As likewayes the word [presbyter.] Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ane officer cloathed with authority, so that this Court of elders, must needs have ane interest in much more then the rituales of ordination.</p>
               <p>His Last Exception, is, <hi>That upon our supposition, That Timothy was ane extraordinary officer and Evangelist, he could not be ordained by ordinary inferiour officers or Ministers. Ans.</hi> 1. As some say of the Prince, that though Major Singulis, greater then every single person, yet he is, Minor uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis, lesse then the whol body, so it may be said, that though Timothy, as ane Evangelist, were superiour to any meer elder; yet ane eldership, the juridical Court, the Church representative, might be above him; if at least such a superiority was here necessary; else let him say, whither the Prophets at Antioch, were in Capacity to Impose hands upon Paul, and Barnabas, and send them out upon a gospel legation. Himself is bound to answer this, whither these Inferiour officers, in that act, were greater then he, yea or not, and how these ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary officers and teachers could authoritatively bless, and lay hands upon ane Apostle. And when he hath cleared this, he will easily exped our difficulty in this point. 2. Though it were granted, that a presbytery, consisting of <hi>meer ordinary officers,</hi> could not ordain ane Evangelist, yet I hope he will grant, that a presbytery, where <hi>such a one as paul was,</hi> might doe it, who as ane Apostle, might ordaine alone. If he say, what is then become of our <hi>presbyterial ordination,</hi> which we draw from this text? I answer, it is much confirmed, but not weakened by what is said, for if the Apostle
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104445:122"/>
Paul took along in this high Act [the ordination even of ane Evangelist] the authoritative concurrenc of a Presbytery, therefore much more doth this power of ordination belong to the Presbytery now, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ordinary Church officers or fellow Presbyters, when the office of Apostles and Evangelists is ceased. 3. If the ground and topick of our <hi>Informer's</hi> argument <hi>[They who ordaine must be greater then he who is ordained]</hi> were denied, he would be more puzeled to make it good, then he Imagines. Because 1. The blessing in ordination being only <hi>ministerial and instrumental</hi> by way of service but not by ane <hi>original primative authority</hi> (as a learned man distinguishes here) God and Christ alone ordaining thus, whose servants and Ministers, both the ordained and ordainers are. Ephes. 4: 11, 12. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Matth. 9: 37, 38. 2 Cor 4: 5. 1 Cor. 3: 5. 21, 22. Act. 13: 1, 6. The ordination will no more infer a superiority over the ordained, then peoples blessing of God will make them greater then Hee, Jacobes blessing of Pharaoh, will make him greater then Pharaoh, the peoples blessing of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, greater then Solomon. The Kings Acturney (saith he) who drawes the noble-man or officer of state, His patent and commission, is not greater then hee, But the King who is the original of temporall honour. So Ministers in this work doe only draw out the Kings patent and apply it, but Christ only is the <hi>original proper ordainer.</hi> As for that text, Hebr. 7: 7. He sayes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> is meaned of Christ himself who by Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck his type, blessed Abraham by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent authority and power. 2. Admitting that the ordainers, behoved to be greater then the ordained <hi>before the ordination is execut,</hi> yet it will not necessarly follow, that they must be still greater <hi>after the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is past</hi> &amp; finished, the very end of it being to conferr upon the ordained a <hi>like Ministery</hi> with that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104445:122"/>
have. Hee instances Matthias and Paul, who were inferiour to the Apostles, before they were called and ordained: But being called, they became equal with other Apostles in Apostolick power, dignity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, &amp;c.

Ans:</hi> This man, if he had been so ingenuous and seen in this debate, as he would appear, might have found all this, and much more then he hath offered, fully removed and answered by many Godly learned. But they must still tell over and over, their old baffled arguments, to which satisfying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers have bein often returned. But to the point, the weaknes of this proofe; is many wayes evident. 1. It is grounded upon a Misterious Metaphorick terme of <hi>Angel, and starrs;</hi> Revel: 1: 20. <hi>the mistery of the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starrs,</hi> so must the expression of <hi>Angel,</hi> be likwayes a part of this mistery.

                     </gap>heolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Symbolica non est argumentativa.</hi> Far less can this be rationally opposed unto so many pregnant clear scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as are produced for Presbyterian Government. Besides that, the word <hi>[Bishop]</hi> is no where in Johns wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, made use of; who calls himself a Presbyter, and never mentions superiority of one Presbyter over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but in condemneing <hi>Diotrephes.</hi> He calls Christ <hi>the word,</hi> and the Sabbath, <hi>the Lords day;</hi> these are expressions not found before in Scripture; Surely he should have made mention of a <hi>new office,</hi> as well as of a <hi>new phrase,</hi> had any such thing as <hi>a Bishop,</hi> been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by him. Besides, the Metaphorical terms of <hi>Starrs,</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> doe import the qualities of light, heavenlines of frame &amp;c: which are proper and suite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Ministers of the Gospel: and therefore they cannot ground the peculiar preheminence of a Bishop over many Ministers. 2. The great topick of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>[that one is named, though many are spoken to, and where many Presbyters are supposed to be, as at Ephesus, who threfore must needs be a Bishop.]</hi> but this ground will not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104445:123"/>
hold good. Because, 1. This is no more then what is suitable unto the stile of this book, which is by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick visional representations, to include many indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals as one singular: So all the individuals of the Church, both members and officers, are represented by one candlestick: and why not also all the Ministers, by one angel, which is a terme that of it self, and in this place, imports no jurisdiction properly, but is immediatly referred to the qualities of Ministers, above expressed. 2. This is also suitable to the stile of this book, <hi>as it is epistolar,</hi> the addresse may be to one, but it will give no Authority to that one, over the rest, no more then ane addresse from the King, to a speaker of the Parliament, will give to that person, jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and authority over them? Or then our Lords saying to Peter only expressly, not to the rest of his fellow disciples, I <hi>will give unto thee the keyes &amp;c.</hi> Will conclude that he was Prince or primat over the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and that they had not <hi>equal authority</hi> with him, in the use of the keyes.

So that whatever this <hi>Informer</hi> shall produce as the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteristick of this Angel, we find it applicable to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. 1. Is it the work of this Angel to preach and baptize? This Commission he will grant belongs to all Pastours. 2. Is it the power of ordination? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shewes us that this is Seated in a Presbytery. 1. Tim. 4: 14. with Act. 22: 5. Luk. 22: 66. Matth. 18: 17. Or, 3. Is it the ruling Governeing power? Surely all Ministers are such Angels, All that watch for the peoples soules have <hi>a joynt rule over them,</hi> Hebr. 13. 17. And therefor none can challenge it solely to himself.

               <p>But the <hi>Doubter</hi> objects what have been saying, viz,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104445:125"/>
                  <hi>That the Angel is to be taken collectively, and not for one single person, but for all the Ministers.</hi> To which (in a peece of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant folly) he Answers <hi>That he hath oft wondered at this reply, that it seems this Scripture pinches us sore, when we flie to such a shift—That Scultetus, a learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, affirms that the most learned interpreters understand the Angel thus, and that without offering violence to the Text, it cannot be otherwayes understood. Ans.</hi> 1. We hope is evident from what is said that the most native scriptural acception is to take the Angel collectively. To which we may adde, that although the Lord Jesus (the best interpreter of these Angels) doth expound the Seven candlsticks, to be the Seven Churches, yet in expounding the Seven Starrs, he losses the number of Seven, and calls them not the <hi>Seven Angels</hi> (as he should have done according to this mans meaning) but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly <hi>the Angels</hi> of the <hi>Seven Churches;</hi> from which it is convincingly apparent that though there were <hi>Seven Churches</hi> written unto, yet there were not <hi>Seven diocesian Bishops,</hi> according to the number of the Seven Angels: but that all the Ministers or Angels are thus collectively understood. And wheras this man professes (in the deept of his witt for sooth) to wonder at this answer and taks it to be a shift. He should wonder at Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin (Homil. 21. upon this booke,) who thus taks it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Angel of Thyatira, the <hi>proepositi ecclesiarum,</hi> the governoures of the Churches. He should wonder at <hi>Aretas,</hi> lib. 1. Cap: 1, 2, 9, 10. Wonder at <hi>Primasius</hi> in Apoc: C: 2. At <hi>Ambrosius, Anbertus,</hi> To: 1, 6 p: 1. <hi>Anselm, Pererius, Victorinus, Tirinus, Haymo, Beda, perkings, Fox,</hi> in his Meditationes upon the Revel. p: 7, 8, 9, 17. who cites also many Interpreters thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding him. Yea more, he wonders at King james and the Episcopal clergie in England, under and by whom, in the contents annexed to the Bibles of the last tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, the contents in the 2. chap: are represented

[what is to be written to the Angels, that is, <hi>to the Ministers</hi> of the Church of Ephesus, Smyrna &amp;c] Its pitie they had not this grave dictator to correct their mistake, and to present them with his new spectacles, to discover therewith, the Bishop in these Epistles. He should have wondered at <hi>Pilkington</hi> Bishop of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (in his exposition upon Hag: Chap. 1: v. 13.) who expoundes the Angel thus collectivly. See Gers. Buc. de Gub. Eccl. p. 1. 205, 393, 408, 419, 422, 433. Now, what pinched all these Authors to embrace this Silleptick exposition of the <hi>Angel?</hi> As for <hi>Scultetus,</hi> although a Protestant, yet he is a high Prelatist, and a partial witnes in this point, &amp; cannot conterballance these Authores mentioned.</p>
               <p>But next, what wil our <hi>Informer</hi> gain though it were yeelded that this Angel is ane individual or single person? Some learned men doe so take it, as <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who notwithstanding were far from thinking him a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. Because I. He may be the <hi>Angelus Preses,</hi> or the moderatour Angel, not the <hi>Angelus Princeps,</hi> or Lord Angel, yea, and the Preses and Moderator for the time, as a speaker in the Parliament. Ephesus had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny elders. (Act 20: 27. 1 Tim. 5: 17.) of equal authority, who were made Bishops, and they are spoken to in the plural, though the Angel is named in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 2. This Angel is said to have no jurisdiction and superiority over the rest of the Ministers. And we challeng our <hi>Informer</hi> to shew where this Angel is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto, with reference to Ministers, as subject unto him, which notwithstanding is his supposition, &amp; peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio principii, all along in this Argument. 3. The Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial, and Diocesian division of Churches, were long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this and not until 260. Years after Christ. 4. Nothing is required of this Angel, but that which is the common duty of all Ministers. Finally, Suppose it were granted to him, that a superiority were imported in nameing this

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He forgot one maine point of this argument from Antiquity; before it convince us, he must conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon <hi>the mould,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> of the Bishops which these Ancienas speakes of; he holds that the word <hi>[Bishop]</hi> is variously taken in Scripture, and why not also by the ancients?

But till then, I thinke our conviction must be suspended.</p>
               <p>That Presbyters have <hi>the key of Doctrine,</hi> he will not deny, That they have <hi>the power of ordination, and jurisdiction,</hi> and that key likewayes entrusted to them, hath been proved from Scripture. 1.

Or if he will say that they did not hold themselves concerned in the same rule, and the prohibition which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples here got. Surely he cannot deny this, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Certan that John discharhes the very <hi>protos</hi> or <hi>prostacy</hi> self for what reason will it: he invent wherefor a preeminence or primacy should be disgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Apostles, and allowed among the Seventy (who he thinks represents the Pastours) or any Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour order of Church officers? Besides, what was it which Peter discharged to these Bishops 1 Pet. 5. Was it not a preeminence, or masterly primacy, and to

be a protos? learned he not this prohibition of his Lord? and will it not be a Critical distinction to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish lordship from preeminence? Now the first we find universally discharged to Pastours, even over the flock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, as this man acknowledges, and therefore why this preeminence, is not likwise in it self and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply stricken against, will be Impossible to shew the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity. I must presume that the Apostle understood the sence of this prohibition of his Lord, much better then our <hi>Informer:</hi> and we see he applyes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Pastours and Bishops, that which was discharged to himself, and the rest of his fellow disciples. And, (as I said befor) if none of these scripture-Bishops were to lord it over the flock, farr less over their fellowes. So that to be a <hi>protos</hi> or <hi>Chief</hi> over them, was inhibit, as by the lord befor, so by the Apostle here, and consequently this lover of preeminence is simply condemned. The <hi>Inglish Annot:</hi> make the two places of Peter &amp; John, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel, &amp; the same evill to be discharged in both. So doe the <hi>dutch annot</hi> expressing that which diotrephes sought, in the Apostle Peters terms, <hi>of lording it over his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Now I hope he will not say, that when Peter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges Ministers <hi>to be lords over Gods Heritage,</hi> he discharged only ane <hi>ambitious affectation</hi> and Supposed <hi>a la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Surely then this Prohibition of the Apostle Iohn, where <hi>Diotrephes</hi> is supposed to be practising, what is by Peter discharged, can admit of no such evasion either; unless he would make these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to interfer together in this matter: for it were strange clashing of weapones, and contradiction of the tongues and pens of these Apostles, if Peter should discharge all Lording even over the flocks, in any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, and yet Iohn should allow unto a Pastour, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, and primacy, both over the flocks, and his fellow Ministers and labourers with him in the

                  </gap> I Suppose this man (if he will not renounce his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant profession) cannot but grant, that it is not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> as he call it, or <hi>human Testimonies,</hi> but <hi>the Scriptures of truth,</hi> which most <hi>judge in this debate.</hi> So that I hop I may suppose that he lookes upon his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitity as ane accessorie appendix onely to his Scripture arguments, and that the Scripture is not for him, but against him, I hope it is conuincingly apparent from that is said above; we must to the law and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in this and all other points of faith. Antiquity without the first Scripture antiquity, deserves not the name. <hi>Id adulterum quod posterius, id verum quod pri nium,</hi> said <hi>Tertullian.</hi> That is adulterat which is Last, and trere which is first. I am the way, the truth and

the Life, said Christ, but not <hi>I am Custome</hi> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, that <hi>Consuetudo sins veritate est vetusias erroris;</hi> Antiquity without truth, is but a mouldy error. Our Lord himself rejected this argument <hi>[it was said of old]</hi> and apposes unto it <hi>[but I say]</hi> Well may we then oppose the Scripture sayings to our <hi>Informer's</hi> [it was said of old] and by our Lords warrand, reject his pretences from Antiquity, to warrand any thing which the word condemnes: and for this we have good warrand of antiquity it self: for the fathers universaly doe hold that onelie the Scriptures must judge in points of faith. <hi>Sunt libri Dominici quorum authoritati utrique consentimus, utrique credimus</hi> (there being in them all things to be believed and practised) <hi>utrique servimus, ibi quaeramus ecclesiam, ibi discutiamus causam nostram,</hi> is great <hi>Augustins</hi> advice. <q>The books of the Lord are they to whose Authority we both consent, which we both beleive, To which we both submit, There let us seek the Church, There let us discusse our Cause.</q> Jerom on Chap. 23 of Matth. tells us <hi>quod de scripturis authoritatem non habet, eaedem facilitate contemnitur qua probatur.</hi> That which derives not its authority from Scripture, the contemneing of it is as ready as the proof is offered, and (on the 1.) Chap. of Hag <hi>Quae absque athoritate &amp; Testimoniis scripturarum quasi traditione Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolica sponte reperiunt atque confingunt, percutit Gladius</hi>
                  <hi>Dei</hi> 
                  <q>Such things as men of there own accord find out &amp; forge upon pretence of Apostolick tradition with out the authority and Testimonies of Scriptures, the sword of God strikes throw the same.</q> Besides this discovers the plea from Antiquity to be very Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this debate: Because the Question betwixt us is not <hi>defacto,</hi> but <hi>de jure,</hi> not what sort of Bishops have been as to matter of <hi>fact,</hi> introduced into the Church of old, or of late, but by what <hi>warrand</hi> and <hi>right</hi> they have possessed their places? We alledge and prove
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104445:134"/>
that the present Prelat now existent stands condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Christ, the great lawgiver, his rules in point of Church Government, set down in his Testament. Now, to answer this Charge with humane Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as to Custom or practise of the Church, (even granting that his Testimonies did prove the matter of <hi>fact,</hi> viz, That our present Prelat is exemplified in the ancient Bishops) what is it but to oppose, humane cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to Gods ordinance, The practise of men to Gods rule, and mens Testimonies who are liars, to the divine Oracles of the God of truth.</p>
               <p>This man thinkes it a Herculean argument, when he drawes his human Testimonies, as to prelacy neer the Apostles time (as if he had travelled to <hi>Hercules pillars)</hi> and wonders how we can suppose, that the Church could so soon alter the divine institutions. But <hi>I</hi> pray, how long was it after Gods Holy law was proclaimed from heaven, by his own terrible voice, that the wholl Church of Israel, together with Aaron himself, set up and worshiped the golden Calf, contrary unto the very express letter of the <hi>Second</hi> command? Now, suppose that idolatry several hundered years afterward had pleaded this Antiquity, or ancient Custome of the Church of Israel, (after frequently imitated, and which had its plausible pretexts of intention to worship God, for <hi>the seasi was proclaimed to Iehova,</hi> and to have a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe of his presence) Wil the <hi>Informer</hi> say, that this had been a good argument to warrand the breach of the <hi>Second command,</hi> though this Practise was but fourty dayes younger then the promulgation if self. So the case is here, Though he could shew us human clear Testimonies, nay more, even Scripture Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as to the <hi>factum,</hi> that the diocesian; yea, and Erastian Prelat, had been existent and set up in some Churches in the Apostles own time; yet if we can from our Lord, and his Apostles doctrine, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104445:134"/>
practise, prove this officer to be a plant not of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine plantation, and contrary to the divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, He must needs grant (that though esteemed gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) it ought to be Nehushtan, rejected and pluckt up by the roots. The Papists, who hold the Scriptures to be but a half-rule, made up by traditions, yet will not dare to own (professedly at least) any principle, or practise, condemned in the Word. suppose he could bring thousands of Testimonies from ancient writers, touching his Prelat he pleads for; they are but <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise o! truth it self, and expone they Scriptures, which cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome hath not known, for had it known them, it had not been.</hi> The <hi>Informer's</hi> Testimonies may induce to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there were Bishops in the Church; but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the office which these Bishops are supposed to hold, be of God, yea or not; this queston must be brought to a higher tribunall; and Gods Oracles must determine therein, before the Conscience can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as to the owning of such a Church officer: And if God dissowne him, I may be ane <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius contra orbem,</hi> in withstanding him, It being still certain that these human witnesses are <hi>testesfacti</hi> at most, but not <hi>judices veri &amp; recti,</hi> Attesters of <hi>matters of fact,</hi> but not <hi>judges of what is right</hi> and equal therein.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen, that though all our <hi>Informers</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from antiquity, were granted, his cause, profliga by Scripture weapons lyes grovelling in the dust. wheras he alleadges <hi>[Testimonies as to the existence of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats in the Christian Church, neer the Apostles times, or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with them, &amp; that Catalogues of a Succession of Prelats, down from Apostles and Evangilists, have been keept in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which he thinkes speakes convincingly for the Episcopacy</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:104445:135"/>
                  <hi>of Timothie, and Titus &amp;c.</hi> I <hi>Ans.</hi> Although this be the very Marrow and strength of all his argument from Antiquity, yet when tryed, it will be found many wayes defective, and unsound. For clearing whereof I shall offer some things, both to the Major, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtion of this argument, which will be found quite to breake the force of al his pretences this way. For thus the argument must run.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Diocesian Bishops, by the Testimonies of the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did exist in the primitive times, and Catalogues of them are drawn by these ancients, from Apostles, and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilists, then</hi> I <hi>must believe these Bishops to be of divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: but thus it is by the Testimony of the ancient fathers:</hi> Ergo, I <hi>must believe Diocesian Bishopes to be of divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being the argument in its genuine strength, this pitifull pleader offers not a jott in proofe of the major proposition, whose connexion he cannot but know, the we all deny. All that he offers is in proofe of the assumption, which is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nved, &amp; will be found very maimed. I. To the Major, I say, that it is of very dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to make that which men call <hi>antiquity,</hi> or <hi>[ancient custome,] the infallible rule, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, as to the nature and office, of Church officers, mentioned in Scriptur.</hi> Because 1. <hi>If mens practise</hi> must be the key and comment in this case, so as we must not contradict or counteract it, then why may not also human practise, and profession of succeding ages, determine as to every Scripture truth, and duty therein held out? 2. This were to set up a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rule, and tribunal, then the Scriptures, and to <hi>make our faith to stand in mans wisdome, not in Gods,</hi> and to make the Scriptures of <hi>a privat interpretation,</hi> as if the Prophecy had come <hi>by the will of man.</hi> For if I must believe no otherwayes anent the Scriptures relating
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104445:135"/>
to the offices of Timothy, and Titus, then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practise of supposed Bishops, their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores, and that they held no other offices, but such as these supposed successores are said to have had, then the Custome and practise of fallible men, becomes to me, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ratio a priori, and the chief ground, why I believe these Scriptures to have such a sense and no other; and so I give men a dominion over my faith, and my faith herein resolves ultimatly into a human practise, and Testimony of fallible men, which is a principle no protestant will allow.</p>
               <p>Next, as to the asumption of the argument, I would demand of this <hi>informer, how</hi> I <hi>must be infallibly assured anent this universal judgment and practise of the ancient Church, and of this true succession; and how he will instruct the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal harmonius judgement of all the ancient Fathers in this great point,</hi> (viz.) <q>[That such prelates as we have now, were the first recipients of the ordinary power of government, from the Apostles and Evangelists, as their only immediat &amp; ordinary successors.]</q> The topick of our <hi>Informers</hi> argument doth suppose the certanty of this mater of fact. But to clear this will be found a hard peece of work. Because 1. It is certan that many of the ancients wrote nothing; many of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are lost; many writings going under their name are counterfit, &amp; most especially to this debate. It were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly none of the hardest Tasks to discover some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings here cited; to be meer countersites. How shall I know, that the Testimonies of those who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, are not contradicted in this point, by such men of their times, who either have not written, or whose writings are perished? 2. There are many things, which the Ancients speak of as derived from the Apostles, and have had ane universal consent (as farr as the knowledge thereof hath come to us) which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be contrary to the word of God
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104445:136"/>
and the Apostolick doctrine; as, the error anent the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, [that the Saincts sie not his face till the last day.] the error of [free will,] which until <hi>Augustin</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it was universally receaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the [Millenary error,] anent Christs personall reigne upon the Earth a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years; called by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> [the doctrine of the holy prophets, and christian wisdome, which christians follow.] <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> holds them to be no christians that dissown this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is owned as <hi>ane Apostolick tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> So [childrens partaking of the Lords supper;] and [the necessity of baptisme] was by Augustin and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers owned as such a tradition (lib: 1. de pecc: mer.) <hi>Basil</hi> names four Apostolick traditions, signeing with the cross; praying to the east; anointeing with oyle; praying in the standing postur from Easter to whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyd. See the <hi>Appendix to jus divinum minise. Evan (prop.</hi> 2.) The <hi>informer</hi> and his fellowes, make a great bustle anent the condemneing of Aerius, for holding that Bishops and presbyters are all one. But <hi>Beza</hi> could have informed him, de grad: (346.) that Epiphanius (Haeres: 75) imputs to him, as great heresies, these Tenets, 1. That he held it unlawfull to offer and pray for the dead. 2. That he held that Saincts departed were not to be invocat. 3. That there were not fixed fast dayes to be keept. 4. That the jewish pascal was not to be observed, because ourpassover is already offered. Now, if our <hi>Informer</hi> condemne him for these also, we weed care the lesse for his condemning him in the point of prelacy. 3. It is certain, that the account of the first times imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the Apostles, is, as to mater of fact, very dark &amp; uncertain, &amp; consequently a very slippery rule. <hi>Hegesi pus</hi> (apud Euseb: lib: 3.

thereis almost nothing extant which is certain: hence (he saith) occasion was taken by men of bad dispositions to make hold to faine anything, whom even the Apostles times wanted not.</q> Not to insist upon the many things written and observed of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which may invalidat the credit of his history, and his many gross errors therein, and in other poynts, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by <hi>Scalliger</hi> and others. How fabulous is that history of Christes Epistle to <hi>Agbarus,</hi> rejected even by pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> in a Councel of Seventy Bishops at room. That which <hi>Philo</hi> the jew wrote of the <hi>Essae Ans,</hi> a Sect among the jewes, <hi>Eusebius</hi> affirms that he wrot it of <hi>Christian mmks,</hi> which <hi>Scalliger</hi> shewes to be false out of Philo himself <hi>(in elencho tribaeresii.)</hi> He proves peters crucifixion at Rome by a tomb proofe:—In the computation of times, <hi>Scalliger</hi> observes his gross errors. Nay, which is more considerable, he discovers gross ignorance of Scripture, in saying that the Cephas reprehended by Paul, was not the Apostle peter, but another of the number of the Seventy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Besyds, many things in his personall cariage and qualities, which may weaken the Credit of his History, as his presideing in the councel of Tyre against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and standing upon the Arrians side. <hi>Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> (in his Thesaurus temporum.

Moreover, Admitt his Testimony were abeve all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, yet that his history hath been corrupted by some ignorant impostor, is demonstrated from this by <hi>Didocl:</hi> (cap. 4. p. 119) [that he maks mention of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who was born ane hundred years therafter.]</p>
               <p>Lastly, As to the <hi>Catalogues of Bishopes,</hi> which our <hi>Informer,</hi> and his masters befor him, exhibit to us from the Apostolick times, he might have found them

Therefore we shall dismiss it with these observes. 1. That Tertullian, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and others, who make use of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Succession, against hereticks, designe only to shew a derivation of true doctrine from the Apostles against them, and that the Church had the <hi>Traduoes Apostolici Seminis,</hi> a derivation of the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but never meaned it of a Succession of <hi>men of the same office</hi> every way. <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, [Arise o truth and expone they Scriptures &amp;c.] <hi>Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Timothy and Titus &amp;c. had ane Episcopal authority, why? because their authority was not Evangelistick. Why so? because it was not to die with them, why that? Because it was ordinary and perpetually necessary. And how is that proved? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if the Apostles being alive, they behooved to instruct Timothy and Titus with Episcopal authority, much more being dead, this was necessary to the Churches. But when it is inquired, how this Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authority is proved, it is fairely assumed againe, as if it were granted, [that the Apostles made them Bishops of Ephesus and Crete.] So the last medium is still that which is in Question. Let him ponder also what <hi>Didocl:</hi> (p. 125. and 139<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) hath produced, anent the confusion and contradictions in this Alexandrian Succession. <hi>Tilen</hi> himself (de pontif: l. 1. c: 24. not: 1.) acknowledges that <hi>[De Alexandrinae Ecclesiae primordijs, nihil ex Scriptura, im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

them, for <hi>Mark</hi> was ane officer of a higher nature. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the <hi>Informer</hi> tells us, that <hi>Mark</hi> died before Peter and Paul; hence I infer against him, <hi>ergo, Ierom</hi> could not reckon <hi>Mark</hi> among these Bishops of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria: for <hi>Ierom</hi> drawes his proofes for the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters divin right of governing in Common, from Act. 20. phil. 1. 1.

               <p>And because this man tells us even <hi>ad nauseam</hi> of this passage, <hi>a Marko Evangilista.</hi> I will turn here the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons point upon him, and demand, Since <hi>Ierome</hi> make these Alexandrian Bishops from <hi>Mark,</hi> to have been sett up <hi>by Presbyters free election,</hi> how comes the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats he pleads for, to be <hi>Elected and set up at Court,</hi> while the poor Creatures, <hi>the Curats,</hi> over whom they are set, to play the little emperoures, have no more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest as to their choice and Election, then the silliest <hi>Monck</hi> in choosing the <hi>pope</hi> I add here, that this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his [that <hi>Ierom</hi> holds the Apostles to have supplied the Bishops rowme for a time, though no fixed ordinary Bishops, untill the Churches growth, and their necessary absence, did necessitat to set them up for preventing schism,] will Crosse what himself and Downam also doe plead, <hi>defens.</hi> l. 4. c. 5.

               </p>
               <p>But now the <hi>Informer</hi> will resolve the <hi>great doubt</hi> 
                  <q>against what he hath said, viz.</q> 
                  <q>That <hi>Ierome</hi> proves from Scriptur, Bishop and Presbyter to be all one and that schismes by Satans instinct, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve occasion to change the government from the Common Council of Presbyters, to another mould of setting up one over the rest, to whom the whole Care should belong &amp;c. To which he answers, that <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks of the power which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in his time had come unto beyond what the first Bishops had, viz. That at the first Presbyters had a hand in government, but after, <hi>omnis Ecclesiae cura ad unum de lata,</hi> that is, the wholl care was put upon the Bishop. But if we take <hi>Ierom</hi> to speak of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104445:144"/>
the first introduction of Bishops, then he must be understood as speaking of the Apostles own times.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Upon this ground the <hi>Informer</hi> must grant, that in <hi>Ieroms</hi> sense, Bishops who only in ordination, were superior to Presbyters, had a greater power then the Bishops first set up by the Apostles; which will clearly exclud his diocesian Prelats, who have sole power in ordination and jurisdiction, as no divine Bishops. And Next, it will follow that the ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opes set up <hi>a Marco,</hi> or after <hi>Mark,</hi> were meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, or Moderators; since they were less in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer then these Bishops, who onely in ordination, differed from Presbyters. So we see the rebound of this answer will strik his cause dead. And he must feel another rebound of his own blow, as to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of our leaving out what maks against us in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> words. For I ask why he lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es out here <hi>Ieroms</hi> scripture proofes, evincing that Bishops &amp; Presbyters are one <hi>jure divino?</hi> Why leaves he out <hi>Ieroms</hi> Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon all these scriptures (which runes along the through Apostolick age) viz. <hi>That the Bishops are more by Custom, then by any true dispensation from the Lord set over Presbyters?</hi> for although he after bringes in this as ane objection, yet it ought to have been set downe here, as the main conclusion of <hi>Ieromes</hi> arguing: and his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is very blunt without it. Again, how comes he thus to disguise what <hi>Ierome</hi> sayes of Presbyters gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neing <hi>[Communi Councilio],</hi> or by common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, as if it Imported no more, then haveing <hi>a hand in government,</hi> which he maks Compatible with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, wheras <hi>Ierom</hi> maks it distinct from, and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior unto, even the first human prostasy. Beside, their governeing, <hi>Communi Concilio,</hi> Imports par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, their joynt decisive suffrage in government; which he doth but meanly express by <hi>their governing in Common.</hi> 2. What a rediculous conceit is this <hi>That Ierom speaks of the power of Bishops in his time, beyond the</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:104445:145"/>
                  <hi>first Bishops Ierom</hi> speaking of Presbyters expressly, as contradistinct from Bishops, and of the Presbiters existent in the Apostolick Churches, while the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were alive, as himself just now explained i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, in saying [that the Apostles by their presenc and industry supplied the want of Bishops over these Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.] So that he compares not the Bishops in his time, with the first Bishops who came in by Custome, but these <hi>human Bishops</hi> who thus came in, with <hi>the first scripture Bishops.</hi> we know not wher to find this <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satil proteus</hi> in his answers here, and may truely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, that this Testimony pinches him and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> will he stand to this exposition of <hi>Ieroms</hi> words, which he here offers, viz, <q>[That the first Bishops admitted Presbyters to governe with them, and the after Bishops in <hi>Ieroms</hi> time, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned alone.]</q> Then he must grant, that the first and second Bishops, were of very different cutts; and so he breaks his Argument from the Catalogues, all in peeces; and must grant that the word <hi>episcopus,</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> is variously used by the ancients, And that our present Lord-prelats can receave no <hi>Pratrociny</hi> from Bishops of the first ages, wherein Presbyters governed by common Council, and had a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive sufferage in Government, whereas the Prelats now are beyond what their predecessors had come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, even in <hi>Ieroms</hi> time: For then except ordination, the Bishop did nothing, beyond what the Presbyter might doe, whereas our present Prelats are sole both in ordination and Jurisdiction, and assume a negative voice in Church Judicatories, Yea a decisive suffrage in Parliament: which he dare not say that any of these Bishops did ever pretend unto.</p>
               <p>Well, But if we shall say that <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks of the <q>first introduction of Bishops into the Church, then (he tells us) <hi>Ierom</hi> must understand it of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104445:145"/>
times.</q> What means he by the <hi>first introduction of Bishops?</hi> Can he give the least shaddow of reason for it, that <hi>Ierom</hi> speakes of any other introduction then that introduction of <hi>human custom,</hi> which he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes from <hi>the divine appointment</hi> of Presbyterian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? But how proves he [That <hi>Ierom</hi> maks Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes to have been introduced in the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles] (yet I must tell him by the way, that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing them <hi>in the times of the Apostles,</hi> is one thing, &amp; <hi>by the Apostles,</hi> is anotherthing. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> sought his primacy in Iohns time, but was disowned by him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So that if we can prove that what <hi>jerom</hi> cites for the parity of Bishops &amp; <hi>Presbyters</hi> jure divino, will conclud the point, these Bishops are in themselves, &amp; in jeroms judgement, condemned by the Apostles.) his 1. <hi>Reason</hi> is [That <hi>jerom</hi> makes the thing, which gave occasion to this Introducing of Bishops, to be <hi>the peoples say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iam of Paul and I of Apollo,</hi> and this was the Schism spoken of I Cor. I.] But this notion of <hi>Saravia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he might have found long since answered. <hi>Ieromes</hi> scop is evidently, to prove that by Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are all one, wich he clears by many Scripture Testimonyes, even to Iohns time; and therefore he could not be so brutish, as to make this Schism at Corinth, the occasion of the Change, so long before Johns Testimony, yea before Paules farewell Sermon to the Elders of Ephesus, from which he drawes another of his proofes. But he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of <hi>a human Custom</hi> comeing in <hi>Paulatim, postea,</hi> peece and peece and by degres, long after these times: and but <hi>alludes</hi> unto that Division I Cor. I. Expressing it <hi>in the Apostles words,</hi> not <hi>of their times;</hi> for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles never appointed this prelatik excrescent power of Bishops over Presbyters as a remedy of Schisme, among all their prescriptions of the Cure of this evill.

                  <hi>whietaker</hi> will tell him, <hi>that this remedie is worse then the disease.</hi> The mistery of iniquity was then working; the Apostles therefore would not lay a step under An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Christs foot, to get in to his Chair. Besides; these factions in religion were not at Corinth onlie. <hi>Iunius (de cler.</hi> Cap. 15. not 16.) will <hi>Informe</hi> him that <hi>[jerom</hi> asserts not, that it was said at Corinth, I am of Paul, &amp;c. <hi>But among the people, &amp;c. malum non Corinthi solum, &amp;c.</hi> It was a Publick evill—Paul himself prescrybed no such remedy (saith he) unto the Corinthians.—and afterward [Not. 17.] <q>Jerom saith, after it was said among the people, he saith not that this human Prostasia, began <hi>at that tyme, viz,</hi> of the schism, but <hi>after that time.</hi> Compare it with <hi>Wittaker,</hi> (de pont.

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:104445:146"/>
I beseech him what will this say to <hi>Ieromes</hi> scope, which is to prove Presbyters superiority to Deacons? for the <hi>deacons</hi> name was in a generall sense, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but both to Apostles, and to the Evangelist Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they, as himself pleads. Besides, what signifies <hi>Ieroms</hi> in ferenc from all his Citations, <hi>viz, [That Bishops had not their superiority over Presbiters, by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne appointment]</hi> If only a communitie of names, was his proofe from these texts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Informers</hi> 2 Reason, to prove that <hi>Ierom</hi> makes Bishops, to be introduced in the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, is [<q>That had the decree wich <hi>Ierome</hi> speaks of, been after the Apostles, it would have been extant in antiquity, where, and in what Council, it took place, but this is not found.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans Ierome</hi> by, <hi>toto orbe decretum,</hi> or <hi>prospiciente concilio,</hi> cannot mean any formal Council, either in the Apostles times, or afterward. But the meaning is, that when through the world, it was said among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I am of Paul, &amp;c. It was decreed among the people, or in, and among particular Churches, through the whole word, that is, <hi>distr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>butively,</hi> though all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world, not <hi>representatively,</hi> in any <hi>aecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Council</hi> of the whole world. <hi>Decreed through the whole word,</hi> is all one with, <hi>Decreed by the whole world,</hi> which is distributily to be taken. <hi>Ieroms</hi> words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this, for the Councils decree, representing the world, would be <hi>all at once;</hi> but <hi>Ierom</hi> sayes this Chance came not in <hi>Simul</hi> &amp; <hi>Semel,</hi> but <hi>paulatim ly degrees;</hi> And that the <hi>Prostasia</hi> came in <hi>by Custome,</hi> which points at <hi>a graduall comeing in.</hi> Besides, the Apostles changing the first mould of government, to prevent Scism, will say they made themselves wiser then the Lord.</p>
               <p>His 3 Reason is <hi>[That this will suppose the worlds universal defection, from the Apostolick Government, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainst which there is, no footstep of a Testimony.] Ans.</hi> we
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104445:147"/>
We have seen (as he cannot deny) as great, and more sudden changes of the divine institutions, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in Scripture; and that ane universall defection, hath been through the Christian world, from both the Apostolick Doctrine, and Government, he will not deny: and many Testimonies there might have been against this, though they have not come to our hands. He knowes how our divines answer such a Question of the Papists, as to the beginnings of their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their universall spread. Moreover, this mistery of Iniquity, and affectation of primacy, <hi>began in the Apostles owne time,</hi> and therefore we need not wonder that it spread shortly thereafter. <hi>Ierome</hi> tells us that this change was <hi>Paulatim,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and upon specious pretences of order and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and therefore it is no wonder that this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in its nature and dreadfull effects, was not seen at first.</p>
               <p>His 4t. Reason is <q>[That <hi>Ierom</hi> makes this change to have been <hi>for remedy of Schism,</hi> and it is absurd to say, that <hi>the Government of the Apostles was lyable to this evil</hi> But this inconvenience is salved, if we say, that the Apostles for preventing Schisme which parity breeds, set up Bishops over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.]</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. To begin at his last part, he eschews not this inconvenienc himself; for he makes the Apostles to have Governed the first Curches Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copaly, keeping the Episcopall reyns of Government stil in their owne hand (in <hi>Ieroms</hi> sense) till their absene and Schism procured that change which <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks of. So that, with him, the root of Schism was sown in that Church which they Governed Episcopally; the Presbyters with him, ab initio, yea first or last not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing a power of ordination, and jurisdiction; and he maks <hi>jerome</hi> to reflect upon the Apostles, as if they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:104445:147"/>
had bettered Christs appointment, as to Government: I pray him, how grew up the Corinth Scism while Paul acted the Bishop over that Church? as he and the rest of hisparty doe plead. The men of his way say that the Apostles keept the reyns of Government in their own hand, until they were about to die, before wich time there were schimes in their Churches. Did not the Apostles foresee this? and if the Apostolick Episcapacy was by lyable to schismes, much more that of their substituts. 2. It is too gross ane Inferenc to say that [<q>Because <hi>Ierome</hi> holdes that for preventing schismes which were at that time, the Government was changed, therefore <hi>Ierome</hi> charges it upon the</q> Apostles Government,] he may as well say, that a mans asserting Corruptions to be in the Church, will infer his imputing them to the ordinances. Was there nor discord among the disciples, under Christs own immediat Government? but did that reflect upon his Holy Government that this recorded? Did not Paul and Barnabas divid &amp; part asunder? but did Luke in relating this, Charge it upon the holy Apostolick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 3. The absurd <hi>[reflexion upon the Apostles Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment]</hi> which he speaks of, lyes upon his party, and these who first brought in, and now (after its evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are discovered) uphold this hierarchy, which is so crosse to the Apostolick parity. <hi>Ierom</hi> sayes [they brought in this imparity for remedy of schisme] but leaves the charge of [reflecting upon the Apostolick government] upon the Authores of this innovation, and upon its promoters still it mustly.</p>
               <p>His 5t. <hi>Reason</hi> is <q>That <hi>Ierom</hi> in his writtings deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves Episcopacy as high as from the Apostles, making Iames Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Titus of <hi>Crete,</hi> Mark of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons to be that which <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>levites</hi> were in the old Testament. Then he adds, that if we make him
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104445:148"/>
contradict himself, it must be with advantage to Bishops.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Wee have heard already, that it is past doubt with many godly learned, that the Fathers used the terme <hi>Bishop,</hi> in a various and general sense, and spoke of the Apostles, and of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary officers, after the mode and custome of their own times, wherein these offices and designations were prevalent. It is this <hi>Informer,</hi> who puts a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon <hi>Ierome,</hi> while he maks him assert Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy to be set up by the Apostles, upon occasion of the Corinth Schism, in contradiction to his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur proofes of the parity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> from the Apostles doctrine, and brings him in here as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Apostles, to have been formaly Bishops from the begining. Wheras our answer hath none of these inconveniences; and tho it were granted, that it is the true <hi>Ierome</hi> who asserts this of the Apostlés (which we put this <hi>Informer</hi> to prove) yet we accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modat this with his other doctrine, by what is said of the aequivocall sense of the word. <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Levits</hi> authority might, in <hi>Ieroms</hi> judgement, be as to Church government in general, derived in the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>w Testament, and also as to a distinction of Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers therein. But if he should alledge, that <hi>Ierom</hi> assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milats here, the one government and the other; he will mak him plead for a gospell Aaron and pope. In a word, <hi>Ieroms</hi> judgement, as to the divine right of Presbyterian parity, being so clear, and by him foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Apostles writings; ought to prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat any other general, or ambiguous expressions, anent Bishops; and as a rule, to expound the same, in the sense most suitable unto this his judgement: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy since the Fathers usage of speech, as to Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, is thus general and ambiguous as is said.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Doubter</hi> objects to purpose [That <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> letts the Bishops know that they have their power,

more by Custom, then by divine right] To this the <hi>Informer</hi> repones his recocted crambe againe viz, <hi>[Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> 
                  <q>speaks of the power which Bishops in his time were invested with, beyond the first Bishops—And that <hi>Ierom</hi> in that same Epistle expones [Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudo, or <hi>Custom]</hi> by [Apostolical tradition]—That if we understand him of <hi>Consuetudo,</hi> or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom after the Apostles, this will fastten upon him a contradiction. That he sayes of the first Bishops, who governed by commoune Council with the Presbyters; that they differed onely from them in ordination, but of these in his owne time, <hi>ad unum omnis cura delata,</hi> the wole charge was put upon one.]</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As for this conceit, of <hi>Ieromes</hi> distinguishing here onely <hi>[Bishops</hi> of his own time,] from [these of the Apostles time,] we have confuted it already, and shown its absurdity, and that it is most crosse to <hi>Ieroms</hi> scope and words, who proves a compleat parity among Ministers, and ane identity of Bishop, and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>thing, all alongst the Apostles times, and writings,</hi> even to Iohn, the surviver of all the Apostles, So that it is most absurd to fancy him to speak of <hi>Bishops in the Apostles timet.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> offers but a gross distortion of his words, for he sayes of the Bishop who differed only in ordination, from Presbyters: <hi>quid facit, what doth the Bishop</hi> except ordination &amp;c in the present time, but of these who have all the Care, he sayes <hi>Paulatim ad unum cura delata,</hi> the wholl care was put upon one, in the preterit time, pointing out these who came in upon that schism, which, with the <hi>Informer,</hi> was in the Apostles time: The objection tells him, that <hi>Ierom</hi> applyes the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops mould whom this man calls [first Bishops] to [his owne time] when he sayes what doth the Bishop, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ordination &amp;c: And haveing proved Bishopes and Presbyters to be all one, he sayes <hi>Sciant,</hi> that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104445:149"/>
is, <hi>let the present Bishops know,</hi> that they have their power more by Custom, then divine appointment. 2. As for <hi>Ieroms</hi> expounding <hi>Consuetudo</hi> or Custome, by <hi>Apostolick tradition,</hi> it receaves the same answer with what is said, as to his calling <hi>Apostles, Bishops.</hi> For with <hi>Ierome, Apostolick tradition,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick Custom</hi> are all one; as that instance clears anent the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>lent,</hi> which he calls <hi>Apostolica traditio,</hi> or <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick tradition,</hi> writing to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and yet writing against the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> he calls it <hi>Ecclesiae consuetudo,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hence he thus senses the words, That Bishops were brought into the Church, not by Christs express command, but by a Custom, introduced by the Apostles into the Church, and continued in their Successors.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This fine conceit maks <hi>Ierom</hi> reflect oddly upon the Apostles, as if they taught one thing, and practised another; for <hi>Ierome</hi> proves from their writings, that all along they make Bishops and Presbyters one, Now if they in practice set up Bishops distinct from Presbyters, what Harmony makes this? 2. He thus maks him reflect upon Christs express command, in relation to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as if it were altered; and opon his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Apostolick, in saying that it was the ground
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104445:149"/>
of schismes. How will this man guard against this, which he imputed to us before? 3. What will <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> or he make of these Three periods of time in <hi>Ieroms</hi> discourse, observed by learned <hi>Iunius</hi> and others, to clear his words. 1. Presbyters and Bishops all one and governing by Common Council all the Apostles time. 2. Scismes arising. 3. <hi>Paulatim</hi> and <hi>postea,</hi> in process of time, and by degrees, a new mould of government <hi>projected,</hi> and <hi>immutata ratio,</hi> the order changed, as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith to the same purpose. Now this glosse of his words, will make the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick government and practise, not only the rise of scismes, but <hi>to be Changed,</hi> for a change its sure <hi>Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om</hi> speaks of from the first order of government ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apostles; and making yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles practise in government <hi>to continue,</hi> the answer contradicts it self, as well as <hi>Ierome.</hi> As for the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce adduced, it cannot quadrat here in this place, when <hi>Ierom</hi> opposes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the <hi>Informer</hi> dismisses this discourse of <hi>Ierom</hi> with some remarkes. The 1 is <q>That he speaks at least of ane Apostolick right, as in many other his writings, in relation to prelacy.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> wee have proved that <hi>Ieroms</hi> words in these Tuo places mentioned (the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest account of his judgement in this mater, since he is disputing this point <hi>ex professo)</hi> doe evince the contrary. <hi>his</hi> 2. <hi>Remark</hi> is <q>That suppose he makes Bishops lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Apostles, yet he maks them needful to prevent Schism.</q>

               <argument>
                  <p>The difference betwixt our present Prelacy and the Ancient Episcopacy stated and evinced in 12. Instances. Hence all the <hi>Informers</hi> ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adings from Antiquity for our Prelats, is found a beating of the Aire and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough this <hi>Informer</hi> would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that our Prelacy is nothing discrepant from that of the ancient Bishops, yet there are many <hi>remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable differences</hi> betwixt the one and the other, which renders all his pretences from antiquity meer words and winde.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In general its clear from a great consent of the learned, that the Bishop who first came in after the Apostolick age was nothing but <hi>Episcopus preses</hi> or <hi>Moderator, and had no power of ordination and Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction above Presbyters.</hi> This Moderator fixedly set up <hi>durante vita,</hi> during life; And Indued with a higher honour upon this ground, is <hi>Beza's Episcopus humanus,</hi> or <hi>human Bishop,</hi> whom he distinguishes from <hi>the divine Bishop of Gods appointment. Ambrose</hi> in his time, acknowledges [on 1 Tim. 3.] [That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters had <hi>the same essentiall office and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.]</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:104445:151"/>
                  <hi>Dr Reynolds,</hi> in his conference with <hi>Hart,</hi> proves, that at first the Moderator or president among Ministers in their meetings, is he whom the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in after times called <hi>Bishop.</hi> So he holds that the Bishop at his first rise was only the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Presbytery. <hi>Blondel</hi> at large mantains the same, only he holds that the next in degree suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him when dead. Hence <hi>Musculus</hi> after he hath from the texts alledged by <hi>Jerome,</hi> proved <hi>that Bishop and Presbyter are all one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> adds <q>That thereafter Ambition begetting strifes about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencie, one was set up to be Moderator in a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed orb.</q> And least our <hi>Informer</hi> or any else al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, that prelacy therefore is necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Schisme. <q>This eminent light of the reformed Church adds.</q> 
                  <q>but whither that device of man profited the Church or no, the times after could better judge, and that the effects issueing upon it, dicovered, that it was not the Spirit of God his remedy to take away Schisme, but Satans project to destroy a faithfull Ministery. The same saith <hi>Sadael</hi> viz, that this difference betwixt Bishops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters which was introduced to remedie Schisme, opened a gap to ambition.</q> So <hi>Dr Whittaker</hi> haveing out of <hi>Jerome</hi> shewed [That faction occasioned the change of the Ancient Apostolick parity among Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,]—adds—<q>That many wise and godly men have judged the change and remedy more pernicious then the disease it self, which though at first it did not appear, yet experience after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it brought the Antichristian yoake upon the neck of the Church.</q> See the <hi>appendix</hi> to <hi>jus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divin. Minist. Evangel.</hi> In which Testimonies of these great men we may observe two things. 1. That they admitt the first Bishops to have been nothing else but fixed Moderators. 2: That even this much they doe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104445:151"/>
condemne as a deviation from the first appointment, and as that which gave a rise to the Antichristian Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Now the difference and disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this <hi>fixed Moderator,</hi> and our present <hi>diocesian era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian prelat,</hi> is so plaine and obvious, that nothing further needs be said to clear it. Therefore his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Catalogues and those early first Bishops who tooke place in the Church, is pitifully claudicant as to a conclusion of the ancient Churches approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Prelats.</p>
               <p>To clear it further, its evident (if we lay weight upon the Judgement of the ancient Bishopes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in point of Church Government) that 1, They held not their consecration or ordination to be distinct from that of Presbyters, <hi>Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri una &amp; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem est ordinatio.</hi> [That the Bishop and Presbyter have one and the same ordination,] we heard is <hi>Ambrose</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. No delegation of externall jurisdiction to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters was acknowledged by the ancients. As it is by our new hierachical pleaders.

               <p>The 36. of these Canons puts this censour upon the Bishop who neglects this duty, <hi>Si quis ordinatus Episcopus non suscipiat ministerium &amp; curam sibi commissam sit segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus &amp;c:</hi>

But how proves he the pope to be no true Bishop<hi>—propter praecipuum munus episcopi</hi> (saith he) <hi>quod in illo desideratur,</hi> 
                  <q>because of the Chief office of a Bishop whcih is wanting in him. And what</q> is that, <hi>olim episcopi Romani diligenter docebant ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am; &amp; nulli facti sunt episcopi nisi qui in hoc munere fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les erant. Olim hoc ad se pertinere, &amp; praecipuum suum munus esse putabant, ut populum sibi commissum docerent atque instituerent; adeo ut monstri simile esset, per Annos post Christum plusquam sexcentos, episcopum aliquem in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia esse, qui aut nollet, aut non posset populum docere.</hi> that is, <q>of old the Bishops of Rome diligently taught the Church, and none were made Bishopes who were not faithfull in this office; of old they lookt upon this as the Chief duety incumbent upon them to teach and instruct the people committed to them; so that fore more then six hundred Yeares
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104445:159"/>
after Christ, it would have been lookt upon as a monster, if any such Bishop were in the Church who either was not willing or able to teach the people.</q> He addes, <hi>That all the Apostolick Bishopes were such.</hi> And that the Apostle requires it in a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop that he be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>Not such a one who is diligent onely to provid, others to teach, and gives this authority to others, But who is himself sufficient to teach others.</q> This he proves because the Apostle is in that place shewing, <hi>how the Bishop most be indued and gifted befor he be chosen, and that therfore by [being apt to teach] we most understand a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal care and ability and not a deputed care, quis enim hoc praestare non posset?</hi> (saith he) <hi>who is he who may not perform this.</hi> This he further cleares from 2. tim. 2. 2. where the Apostle injoyns Timothy to commit what he had heard of him to faithfull men, <hi>qui essent</hi>

we doe appeal to his judicious commentes upon all the controverted places of the new Testament betwixt them and us; wherein all that we plead for, either as to the identity of Bishop and Presbyter, in <hi>name and thing,</hi> the Presbyteryes power in ordination and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the extraordinary Evangelistick Power of Timothy and Titus, the divine right of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling elder, the peoples right in the call of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the unlawfulness of Prelats sole power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over their brethren, the unwarrantablenes of Ministers state offices, &amp;c, is clearly asserted.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104445:161"/>
deny. When <hi>John Knox</hi> was desired by some to write to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and others about a certain difficulty, he answered <hi>that he came not here without all their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in what he had done, and that they might think him unconstant in writting for a resolution in that matter.</hi> Now <hi>John Knox</hi> look't upon Episcopocy as a limb of Antichrists Hierarchie, and as haveing <hi>aliquid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumune cum Anti Christo.</hi> Something in it common with Antichrist. So that what the <hi>Informer</hi> mentions of <hi>Measson, and Bish: Andrews</hi> their asserting of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and <hi>Beza's</hi> Episcopall Government at Geneva, and their preeminencie in ordination and jurisdiction, is a gross calumny. The eminent parts of these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous divines might make their judgement have great influence in determining others, but that either <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> did ever incroach upon the decisive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of their fellow Presbyters, or acted any thing <hi>pro imperio</hi> or solely, is a calumny which any who ever read their lives can sufficiently disprove. Their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures and practise as well as their writings was for mantaineing the due right of Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against enemies of all sortes. In the life of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaceus Caracciolus,</hi> It is reported, That Calvin being consulted by him in a case of conscience requireing secrecy (in a great measure) would give him no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminat answer (tho a ruleing elder in that Church) without consulting his Brethren. As for that which the <hi>Informer</hi> cites out of Calvines <hi>Inflit.</hi> [l. 4. c. 4. Sect. 2.] where [He acknowledges that <hi>Jerom</hi> teaches that the proestos is ane ancient institution, and that he repeats what <hi>Jerome</hi> sayes, a <hi>Marco</hi> &amp;c.] Its a pitiful proofe to conclud therupon that Calvin acknowledges diocesian Prelats as Ancient as <hi>Mark.</hi> For Calvine knew well that <hi>Jerome</hi> speaks but of the proestos first set up, and the <hi>Informer</hi> hath not proved that either <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Jerom</hi> gave their approbation to the setting of him up.

And for what he adds [That Calvin sayes <hi>ne ex equalitate ut fieri solet dissidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That is, But that the name of the office which God gave in common to all should be transferred to one only, robbing the rest thereof, is injurious and absurd. More over to pervert thus the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the holy ghost, that the same words should sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie another thing then he pleased is too profane boldnes.</hi> Thus Calvin puts this censure upon our <hi>Informer,</hi> in making the name <hi>[Bishop]</hi> signifie any more then <hi>[a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.]</hi> And upon Act. 20. 28. <hi>De voce Episcopi hic no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum, omnes Ephesinos Presbyteros sic vocari indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unde colligimus Secundum Scripturae usum nihil a Presbyteris differre Episcopos.</hi> That is, <hi>Concerning the name of Bishop, we must observe this, that all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Ephesus are so called indifferently, hence we conclud that according to the scripture language, Bishops doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differ from Presbyters.</hi> Now let any judge if Calvine make not the <hi>Name and thing</hi> of the scripture Bishop proper to every Minister of a parish, and if he jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Diocesian Bishop, thus differenced from the parish Minister, to be a warrantable office which he holds to be so crosse to Scripture. So that in the passage which this man hath above cited, he would have all Bishops contending for and reteaning the true scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture function, for none else he can call <hi>eximium mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or ane excellent gift. So that those of these places will help our <hi>Informer.</hi> The Context and tenour of that 4 chapter obliedgeth as to think that this is really the meaning, that whatever titles these Ancients used, yet they designed not thereby to wrong that Presbyteriall Government grounded upon Scripture, which, <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> is there defending.</p>
               <p>And moreover, even straniing that place [Chap. 5. par. 11.] to the out most advantage, it will <hi>Inferr</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, that Bishops, and Parishpriests in those

               <p>As for his citation from Sect: 13. it were very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to think that Calvine by [the heirarchy which the Fathers commend as handed down from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles] should understand the prelatick hierarchy which this man pleads for. Since 1. Many Fathers, as <hi>Ierome,</hi> never saw such a hierarchy set up, but by [Bishops] understand either the <gap reason="foreign">

How could Calvin commend a hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie (such as the <hi>Informer</hi> pleads for) or so much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it as handed doun from the Apostles, who shews from their Doctrine that they owned no Bishop higher then a Presbyter, as is clear from what is said.

               <p>So that nothing can be hence Inferred, but that Church consistories were not then without order, and that one did praeside among them; for <hi>Calvine</hi> sayeth on the 7. verse, <hi>porro locus hic abunde docet nullum esse Presbyteri &amp; Episcopi discrimen.</hi> And he who praesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here was <hi>Titus,</hi> whose Episcopacy we have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly disproved.</p>

Had not Paul, Barnabas, &amp; Titus ane extraordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority &amp; commission? for he sayes, <hi>tunc,</hi> or <hi>at that time</hi> wherein these offices did exist; but will any think that Calvin could mean, a Diocesian Prelats ordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which; immediatly befor he was disputing against from the text?

               <p>Although in that Epistle there is no express <hi>advice to remove Episcopacy,</hi> what then? there is no express advice for removing severall other Corruptions.

As for the difference <hi>[betwixt the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and popish Episcopacy]</hi> I think there is indeed a great difference, &amp; we have proved our present hierarchy to be as much different from it, and soom what more if its erastian mould be taken in as the <hi>Informer</hi> must.</p>

For what he adds of <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Durel</hi> who assert <hi>[That Presbytery was settled at Geneva, because another Bishop could not be gotten after the popish was away, and that it was settled not out of a dislike to the hierarchie, but because they were in ane equality and stood so, being bent on reforming the doctrine]</hi> I <hi>Answer.</hi> His Authores in this assertion stand upon a very slippery and sandie fundation. What? Were there no able men to be Bishop after the popish Bishop was gone? and had they not leasure sufficient to doe this after the doctrine was reformed? Why lived they so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a beloved hierarchy? and (which is yet more strange) why Imployed they their pens and their pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes so much for Presbyterian government, and not rather for the hierarchy? why were both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> so active in that which <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> did here in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to prelacy?

               <p>As his acting, so his writing for Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment accordingly, was not to prescribe <hi>his owne,</hi> (which <hi>Beza</hi> disclaimes,) but <hi>Gods example.</hi> How will the <hi>Informer</hi> prove, that <hi>Beza's</hi> denying his prescribing of <hi>their example of Church Government at Geneua,</hi> meerly as such, will infer his not commending <hi>a divine frame of Church Government?</hi> This was not to prescribe <hi>his example</hi> simpliciter. And how will he prove that <hi>Beza</hi> looked upon a Government which he held to be <hi>[the egg from which Anti Christ sprung]</hi> as <hi>Dei beneficentia,</hi> or Gods <hi>beneficence,</hi> He makes him a very gross ignoramus, for what man of the meanest capacity would say so? And if <hi>Beza</hi> held the first Episcopacie or proestos to be a recess from the divine institution, he certainly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it <hi>[in so far.]</hi> And the diocesian Prelat he holds to be <hi>Satanicall.</hi> Therefore when he seems to condemne <hi>the desowning of all order of Bishops,</hi> he must understand it of a condemning <hi>scripture order,</hi> &amp; the beautiful subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination among Church officers, or that divine order that is among them. But here again I must needs take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in this passage of <hi>Beza</hi> in his dispute with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia,</hi> the <hi>Informer</hi> hath sned off that which wounds his cause to death, for the words following doe discover another ground of this distinction of Bishops from Presbyters (viz Beza and Jeroms <hi>humane Custome)</hi> then what the <hi>Informer</hi> would persuade.

               <p>As for the passages of <hi>Beza's</hi> letters to Bishop <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift, and Grindal,</hi> which the <hi>Informer</hi> after cites, (pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>6.) I say 1. That certainly <hi>Beza's</hi> principles so largely expressed from Scripture anent Church Government, and the contrariety of the episcopus humanus or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bishop, (far more the Diocesian Satanical Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop,) to the divine rule in his principles, will neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarly infer, that in this great mans Judgement none of these Prelats had <hi>qua tales</hi> or <hi>as such,</hi> a lawfull spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall authority from God, 2. It is as certaine that all <hi>Beza's</hi> pleading and arguments strikes against the diocesian Prelat or Arch prelat as in that capacity, and against <hi>this office and policy in it self,</hi> abstracting from its union unto the pope, so that he could own no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that way committed to them of God. 3. It followes, that since he judged the episcopall hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy unlawfull, he held the <hi>first parity unalterable,</hi> since he pleades for it upon morall perpetuall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounds and institutions. And by these his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Scripture grounds, when ex professo handling this point and theologically, we are more to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of his Judgement then by <hi>Missives.</hi> Wherein the circumstances of time, and severall exigences, might engadge to some insinuations in point of a civill deference, and respect. But however that be, we are to look unto <hi>intentio and natura operis</hi> in his writings, or the <hi>native designe thereof,</hi> rather then critically to scanne or straine every <hi>practical conformity or disconformity</hi> therunto. And the <hi>Informers</hi> answer to what we offer anent <hi>the assertions of Bishop Mortoune, Bilson, Iewel, who write for the parity of Bishop and Presbyters by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>

                  <hi>right</hi> viz, <hi>[That they held the Episcopall office themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves]</hi> charging them thus with <hi>a practical breach of their principles,</hi> most make him retract this argument, as signifing any thing against us, Since the retortion thereof is so manifest; and therefore nothing he hath said will impeach <hi>Calvine and Beza's</hi> impugning of Episcopacy, whose impugnations of it will stand to all generations.</p>
               <p>Moreover in this citation of that <hi>epist.</hi> to <hi>Bishop Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> the <hi>Informer</hi> hath sued off the half of the sentence viz, <hi>quod tu igitur coram istam quorundam</hi>

               <p>For what he adds (p. 87.) It may be easily, and without prejudice to our cause granted, that <hi>God by his providence had made him a Iudge.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> will not owne such ane Atheisticall principle, as to deny that the Bishops civil government in England, or pretended Ecclesiastick, is not the object of divine providence,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104445:168"/>
or be so brutish as to conclude Gods approbation of usurping Tyrannes, from his permissive providence in reference to their tyranny or usurpation, else he will for ever destroy his loyalty and fealty, either to the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Lordbishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That passage of <hi>Calvins</hi> letter to <hi>Cardinal Sadolet,</hi> after citedby him (p. 88.) though admitted, is a poor proof <hi>that he held Church Government to be alterable.</hi> Certainly Calvin held the scripture - parity to be the most ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>Vetustissimae Ecclesiae,</hi> or of the most ancient Church, for such no doubt he held the <hi>Apostolick Church</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>Beside, wee must tell him that this passage upon search is not found, and as it is here expressed is very insignificant; since by <hi>Vetus Ecclesia,</hi> he may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Church after the Apostles time, which early began to Corrupt the Government.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Salmasius his retracting his opinion as to Church Government,</hi> it will no more Impeach the truth it self which he asserts, then any other mans defection will weaken the sound Doctrine which he once held. Would the <hi>Informer</hi> take this argument from the Papists if they should plead from the retractiones of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and from their writing for popery, that <hi>the protestant Doctrine were not sound?</hi> would he not say that their first practise, or writings for truth, will stand good and witnesse against them in their defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Though it may be a question whither that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction be reall or not which <hi>Durel</hi> mentions, and the <hi>Informer</hi> out of him. (p. 89.) Especially this being another of our <hi>Informers</hi> mute citations which he keeps (as he doth the state of the questions in these Dialogues) under the Clouds, pointing us to no page in that Answer of <hi>Salmasius to Milton.</hi> We will not here stand to shew how that <hi>Salmasius</hi> eyes were blinded with <hi>Court-gifts</hi> and pensions, having recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104445:168"/>
no small summe from King Charles the second for his encouragement to that worke, and several learned divines who best knew him, think his literature more Considerable then his divinity was solid.</p>
               <p>As for that place of <hi>Salmasius</hi> in his <hi>Walo. Mess.</hi> (c. 4. p. 253.) cited page 90. the Intire sentence is <hi>Epistolae illae</hi> viz; (quae Ignatii dicuntur) <hi>natae &amp; suppositae videntur circa initium aut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium secundi saeculi, quo tempore primus singularis Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopatus supra Presbyteratum Introductus fuit.</hi> Whatever time this was, it appears by what followes that place in <hi>Salmasius,</hi> that about this time Church power began exceedingly to be Corrupted, and Bishops exalted almost to ane equality with Christ; and men began to plead a <hi>jus divinum</hi> for them; for <hi>Ignatius, (In Epistola ad Trallenses) asserts, Episcopum venerandum esse sicut Christum quemadmodum Apostoli praeceperunt, that the Bishops must be had in veneration as Christ, as the Apostles have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> and he cites the Apostles words, but such as do no where occurr in our Bibles.</p>
               <p>And certanly if there be no more truth in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation anent his retraction, mentioned by that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, then their is soliditie in that ground of it which he alledges, it is not worth the noticing. For <hi>the confusions in England</hi> cannot with any shew of Reason be charged upon Presbyteriall Government, which was never yet settled there. And this <hi>Informer</hi> dare not deny the blest effects of truth and unity &amp; godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which it hath had in this land, as is acknowledged by Churches abroad, and particularly in that passage of the <hi>Syntagma confessionum</hi> which he cites in the last di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue, If <hi>Blondel</hi> in callng Episcopacy <hi>most ancient,</hi> doth except <hi>the more ancient Apostolick times,</hi> which he pleads as exemplifying <hi>Presbyterian parity,</hi> he gives it but the spurious after-birth of <hi>humane antiquity.</hi> The same we say as to his passage cited out of <hi>Moulin</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:104445:169"/>
(p. 90.) and if something of the [humane proestos] were granted to have creeped in ere Iohn went oft the stage, will that commend it any more then <hi>that mistery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and love of preeminence</hi> which the Scripture as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us was in Paules time and his? Surely by no meanes.</p>
               <p>Besides, we must here again tell our <hi>Informer</hi> that this <hi>Citation</hi> out of <hi>Moulen</hi> is among the rest of his <hi>Mutes,</hi> since he hath neither noted booke nor page.</p>
               <p>But now from our opinion of the unalterablenes of Presbyterian government, and our acknowledgment of the bringing in of a Proestos so early, the <hi>Informer will involve us</hi> (he sayes) <hi>in one of Two great absurdities. Parturiunt montes!</hi> What are these? the 1. is <hi>[That that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration who lived shortly after Iohn, was altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Christ and his Apostles minde anent Presbyterian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, else they would not have adventured to change the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment]</hi> But this absurdity is easily discussed, for it lights equally upon the Instance already given of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells defection in worshipping the golden Calf fourtie dayes (sooner then 40. years or more) after the holy patterne of doctrine shewed them upon the mount. How often doe we find suddener changes in scripture of the divine Institutions? How quickly after Ioshua and the elders did all Israell depart from Gods way and ordinances? How quickly did they relapse after deliverances, both in the times of the Kings and of the judges, yea and after solemne vowes of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How quickly after Hezekias death did they turne aside? How quickly after Josiahs death? How quickly after Solomons death did Rehoboam forsake the law of God and all Israell with him? I think these scripture instances of as universal, &amp; far greater defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then this was anent the proestos, might have made this man ashamed to bring this as ane absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. Now what will he say to his own Question here? I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:104445:169"/>
it possible, is it probable that Gods Israell could be ignorant of his minde, and adventure so quickly to change his ordinances? Heard not all the Churche of Israel Gods voice from mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> Had not these departers afterward known or seen his eminent seers, heard his word and seen his works? Could they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of his minde who thus suddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him? How could they then adventure to make such a change? Alace! What a poor <hi>querist</hi> is this? I think indeed He and his party have given the Instance in our generation, that such a sudden defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione is both possible and probable. Was ever a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more solemnlie and universallie ingaged unto God, and had seen more of his greatnes, power, and glorie, then wee did in the late worke of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? How long is it since Scotland not onely knew and imbraced Presbyterian Government; but also solemnlie vowed to mantaine it? But he knowes how universally this work and cause of God is now rejected, his Covenant abjured and disowned. And the <hi>Informer</hi> himself (who for what I know, might have seen our first beautifull house) is pleading for this <hi>perjurius</hi> change of Gods ordinances and lawes, and breaking his everlasting Covenant. Read he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the 106. Psal. 7. vers. <hi>They provocked him at the sea even the red sea, and vers</hi> 11. <hi>The waters covered their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and there was not one of them left—Then believed they his words, they sang his praise, they soon frogat his works, they waited not fr his counsell.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> bluntly supposes ane impossibility of a peoples cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing light in apostazing changes, and that all that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration most needs give a formall consent to this change of government in order to its introduction; both which are groundless suppositions, and they render this horne of his <hi>Dilemma</hi> very pointlesse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this change (as we said before) was but small
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104445:170"/>
at the first, onelie a <hi>fixed Moderator,</hi> and far from his Prelacy, which even in <hi>Ieroms</hi> time was but come the length of taking from Presbyters ordination, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rituall part of it. And the change had plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible pretexts of order, and union, as every innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath its own pretences, besides that this change was not all at once but by degrees. Wee must also here tell him, that the same very suggestion is his 3d. Reason to prove <hi>Ieroms</hi> bringing in Bishops in the Apostles time, and so a nauseating repitition.</p>
               <p>But if we decline this absurdity, the next he thinks is worse viz, <hi>That that generation went over the belly of light in changing the Government, and conspired against Christ and his Apostles Government, and none are found testifying against it. Answer</hi> 1. This absurdity doth like wayes fall upon the former Scripture instances of greater, and more sudden, and as universal defections of the Church of Israel. What will he say to these ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in relation thereunto? Were all ignorant? Did all sin against light, and adventure presumptuously to change the divine ordinances? And as for a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against these evills, the <hi>Informer</hi> himself and his party (for all their clamoures against us) falls under ane obligation to answer this, in relation to many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and erroures, which as early creept into the Church as Prelacy; Wherof we gave Instances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and no Testimonies are recorded against them. He seems to have forgot, or to be ignorant of our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes answer to this argument of Papists, calling for our producing of Testimonies against such and such evills, or dating their first rise, viz. <hi>That there might be, tho we have not known them, and that it is bad arguing from the defect of the History, or the darknes of the first original of such a corruption, to deny the plaine mater of fact, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption itself to be such.</hi> How many Thousand eminent persons and acts of these times (which we told him,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104445:170"/>
the learned doe acknowledge, to be very dark as to matter of fact) have never come to our knowledge? And since we have often told him from <hi>Ierom</hi> that this change was lent, and by considerable degrees, and intervalles of time, and Method of its procedor, some might be overtaken with weaknes, others puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with ambition, and upon this ground the one might endeavour, &amp; the other give way to this change, especially its first degrees being small in respect of what followed. Knowes not this man, <hi>that the evill one sowes his tares while men sleep?</hi> And this hierarchie being as in its nature, so in its rise, <hi>a Mystery;</hi> Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity! Mystery Babylon! Yea <hi>and a Mystery which was working long before this change,</hi> even in Pauls time; upon all these grounds his absurdity evanishes, and reflects a greater absurdity upon himself, who would have us shut our eyes against Scripture light upon such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as these, &amp; rather embrace 2 corruption contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto it, then acknowledge that the Church did erre. We know very well what a wicket this notion hath opened for obtruding and retaining popish innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and these men are fast warping in to that Method. As for that which he adds of <hi>Blondel (p.</hi> 94) <hi>who asserts that the Presbyters made him proestos, or fixed Moderator, who was first ordained.</hi> Wee told him already that this fixed presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, tho a deviation from the Scripture rule, yet is farre from <hi>the diocesian Prelats sole power in ordination and Jurisdiction,</hi> So that his confidence (some will be apt to say impudence) is strange in calling this <hi>a power epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall now existent,</hi> since notwithstanding all its after growth, it was not in <hi>Ieromes</hi> time come the length of our present Hierachical power of Prelats, by many dayes journey. Neither is it probable that Blondel could suppose this to be allowed of John, which he holds to be crosse to the divine pattern.</p>

Ans.</hi> Had the <hi>Informer</hi> attended better the places he points at, he would have keepd off this fantastick reflection. For they shew that these first <hi>Proestotes</hi> or Moderators, <hi>who were in themselves, and upon the Mater, meere Presbyters,</hi> were by former times and writers presented under ane <hi>Episcopal notion,</hi> and the power of Bishops then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, unto <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> especially, too credulously following in his <hi>Character</hi> and accounts of them, occasioned the deceaving of others, and that he and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaking of them in that manner and stile in the Catalogues, might deceave others, by naming them so, who were upon the mater meer Presbyters; whom the succeeding writers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (as they shew out of <hi>Iunius.</hi> Contr. 2. Ch: 5. not: 18.) and fancying to themselves such Bishops as then had obtained, fell into these snares of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they supposed that according to the Custome of their times, there could be but one Bishop
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104445:175"/>
in a Church at the same time. And to cleare it, that the persons whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks of, were upon the mater, <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in answer to that objection from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (lib: 3. Cap: 3.) where <hi>Bishops are named as set up by the Apostles,</hi> They answer that the word <hi>Bishop</hi> hath a various acceptation: and that <hi>Irenaeus names Anicetus, Higinus, Pius, Presbyters of the Church of Rome,</hi> the words being then promiscuouslie used. So that whatever impression <hi>Irenaeus</hi> might have of them according to the language and Custome of the time, yet upon the matter they were Presbyters only: and therefore they put the Episcopall partie to prove <hi>that those whom they named Bishops, were veri nominis Episcopi, or Hierarchicall Bishops.</hi> They doe not speak so much of the Impression which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> or <hi>Eusebius</hi> had of them, as of the <hi>true nature and State</hi> of these Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, whom according to the Custome of their times they call Bishops. By <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his calling them sometimes Presbyters, according to the promiscuous use of the names, even handed down to him, they prove that his expressing them under ane Episcopall notion then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, or any such impression of them which he might entertaine, was wrong: since according to the scripture language the Bishop and Presbyter imports no other office then a Pastour. What inconsistency will our <hi>Informer</hi> shew in this, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and others were deceaved in representing the first <hi>Proestotes</hi> under ane Episcopall notion, upon a <hi>Credulous</hi> report from their forefathers: and yet that the persons whom they thus represented were upon the mater Presbyters.</p>

Next, if these words will plead for a Hierarchie, even in the Apostles times, and that Bucer took upon the Testimonie of <hi>Tertullian, Irenaeus</hi> &amp;c, the Apostle James and others for Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall Bishops, surely he was oblidged to have taken notice of <hi>Ieroms</hi> proofs for the parity of Bishops &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the Apostles times; which since he doth not, its most probable that he means to assert the <hi>factum</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of exalting Presbyters to such a degree at that time, but not the <hi>jus</hi> as is said: else I see no consistencie in the words if he reckon the Apostle James in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For he sayes <hi>Apostolorum temporibus unus ex Presbyteris electus.

judgment in this point, and to fortify the answer adduced, I shall present unto him that which <hi>Bucer</hi> asserts <hi>(De Gub: Eccles:</hi> p: 432.) viz, <hi>That the Fathers call these first Proestotes or Moderators, yea even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves, Bishops</hi> (N.

them no doubt pills of too hard a digestion for his stomack. But <hi>Mr. Durham</hi> adding to his scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes of this important truth, Several clear testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys of most eminent <hi>Ancient fathers,</hi> asserting the very same thing, then <hi>Seria res agitur</hi> with our <hi>Informer,</hi> and he bestirrs himself amain to take these weapons out of <hi>Mr Durhams</hi> hand, offering several exceptions against his testimonys, which (in vindication of the memory of so great a <hi>Seer</hi> from this pampleters imputations, and for the more full confirmation of this truth) we shal now examine and repell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr Durhame</hi> sayes <hi>That not only Ierome, but likewise others of the Ancients, such as Augustin, Ambrose, Chrysostom, were of Aerius minde hereanent.</hi> To this he answers <hi>[That Mr Durhame brings this as Medina's assertion, as he is cited by Bellarmin.</hi> But knowes he not that <hi>Medina</hi> is cited for this by many others, as <hi>Dr Reynolds</hi> particularly.

words? are they not his? Or doe they not clearly assert the identity of Bishop &amp; Presbyter? To say that <hi>Augustin</hi> accounted <hi>Aerius</hi> a heretick for this, while he offers not to remove <hi>Augustins</hi> cleare assertion of the same thing, is but to sett him by the ears with himself, not to answer his Testimony. Next, as for <hi>Augustin's</hi> accounting <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius a heretick for this,</hi> he should know that the learned doe Consent that <hi>Augustin</hi> in this followes <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who first imputed heresie to <hi>Aerius,</hi> and made but very simple-insipid answers to <hi>Aerius</hi> arguments for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And moreover that <hi>Augustin</hi> relates his opinion anent the parity of Bishop and Presbyter, or rather his denying that their ought to be ane Ecclesiastick consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution anent their difference, <hi>as that which Epiphanius put among the roll of heresies, himself</hi> not <hi>positively determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that this was a heresie.</hi> For (as is consented unto by the learned, and particularly by <hi>Dr. Reinolds</hi> in his letter to <hi>Sir Francis Knolls,</hi> touching <hi>Dr. Bancrofts</hi> Sermon about the difference betwixt Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter) <hi>Augustin</hi> aknowledges himself ignorant <hi>how farr the definition of heresie doth extend.</hi> He <hi>enumerats the heresies</hi> which he found noted by other writers, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes not the <hi>definition of heresie to every one of them.</hi> Far lesse could he doe so in this point, which was his own judgement, as the passage cited by <hi>Mr. Durham</hi> doth evince. That <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> were of <hi>Aerius</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de as to Bishops, is the judgment of very many: <hi>sane cum Aerio sensit Hieronimus (saith Whittak. Contr.</hi> 4. <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 30.) <hi>Ierom truely was of Aerius minde, on which ground we need care the less that Aerius is so oft ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to us by blockish men.</hi> See how rude <hi>Whittaker</hi> is again to our <hi>Informer. Saravia</hi> himself (de <hi>Grad. cap.</hi> 23.) acknowledges <hi>that Ierom dissented from Epiphanius in this. Dr. Reynolds</hi> in that Epistle to <hi>Knolls</hi> about <hi>Bancrofts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> asserting with the <hi>Informer</hi> [That <hi>Aerius</hi> was for his opinion condemned of heresie by the whole Church]
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:104445:178"/>
proves from <hi>Ierom</hi> and other writters who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie with Epiphanius or flourished after him. <hi>That Augustin Presents that assertion anent the identite of Bishop and Presbyter, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> hereticall, only as he found it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Epiphanius, wheras himself knew not how farr the name of heresie was to be extended, as he testefys in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face concerning heresies.</hi> But that <hi>Augustin</hi> himself was of the judgement <hi>that by divine right, there is no difference betwixt Bishop and Presbyter,</hi> he proves from his words <hi>Epist.</hi> 19. he cites also<hi>—Iewell</hi> against <hi>Harding</hi> the jesuit (asserting likwise with the <hi>Informer</hi> that <hi>Aerius</hi> was condemned for his opinion as a heretick) who proves that <hi>Jerome, Augustin, Ambrose,</hi> were of the same minde. Thus wee see <hi>Augustin</hi> made in this point consistent with <hi>Ierome,</hi> &amp; also with himself, whom this man makes to speake contradictions, so as he may come faire off.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He answers That <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Chrysostoms Testimony will not come Mr. Durhams length, Becaus, Though Ambrose</hi> [or one <hi>Hilary] sayes that Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri una est ordinatio, that they are both priests, yet the Bishop is the first, So that every Priest is not a Bishop, for the Bishop is the first priest. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> hath left out wittily (whither honestly or not, let others judge) in his translation of this sentence, the inference which <hi>Ambrose</hi> Drawes from this identity of the office, viz, that they <hi>have both one ordination.</hi> He maks the office one, and the ordination one consequently, and gives this reason why they have one ordination, viz, because, every one of them is a priest or Minister, <hi>uterque enim Sacerdos,</hi> sath he: Their ordination, is terminat upon, and relative unto, <hi>one and the same office.</hi> Now what greater length would he have <hi>Ambrose</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come then this? <hi>That there is no diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rent ordination of the Bishop and Presbyter, and consequently no officiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> doth he not plead for ane <hi>officiall specifick dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?</hi> betwixt Bishop and Presbyter? Makes he not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104445:178"/>
the Bishops succeed the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> in their officiall power, and the Presbyters to come after the <hi>Seventy Disciples</hi> or meer ordinary Pastoures? Are their not <hi>many essential differences,</hi> which this mans principles, &amp; the present practise, fixes betwixt the Bishop &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, wherof we have spoken above? How can <hi>Ambrose</hi> then assert, <hi>that they have the same office and ordination?</hi> Where is the Consecration? Where is the Bishops sole power in ordination and jurisdiction? Where is his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voice among the Presbyters, making them in all their officiall power certain deputs under him, if their office be one, and their ordination the same with his?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the difference here assigned, viz, <hi>That the Bishop is the first priest, and that every Presbyter is not a Bishop in Ambrose sense,</hi> this will nothing help our <hi>Informer;</hi> Becaus 1. This is fitly applicable to the <hi>Proestos</hi> then in use, yea to the Moderator of a Synod, who (as such) hath a sort of <hi>Prostasie</hi> while the Synod sits, and every Minister is not Moderator, though the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator be no more then a Minister in his officiall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; nay, this is applicable to the <hi>least accidentall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference Imaginable.</hi> Every man is not white or black, yet every such is a man. Every Parliament man is not speaker, though the speaker is a Parliament man only as to his authority. <hi>Blondel</hi> his first ordained Minister, who, with him, is the first Bishop or <hi>Proestos,</hi> hath this properlie applicable unto him. 2. He must be minded, that Ambrose sayes, when speaking of the Scriptur - parity of Bishops and Presbyters, <hi>non per omnia conveniunt scripta Apostolorum ordinationi quae nunc est in Ecclesia. That the writings of the Apostles did not in every point agree to the order which was then in the Church.</hi> Now this <hi>preter - scripturall</hi> or new order of government, what is it but that anent the <hi>primus</hi> or first among the Presbyters? so that this very <hi>primus</hi> or <hi>prostasie</hi> (tho farr from the present Hierarchie of our
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104445:179"/>
Prelats as is said) yet comes after <hi>the scripture appointment—</hi>with <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and is <hi>unlike to that paritie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Bishop &amp; Presbyter, which is therein held forth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Informer</hi> Next offers something in answer to <hi>Chrisostoms</hi> Testimony, who asserts <hi>That almost there is no difference betwix a Bishop and Presbyter.</hi> And his great Answer is <hi>That notwithstanding these Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a difference, and themselves were Bishops] Ans.</hi> If the difference betwixt Bishop and Presbyter come to <hi>a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me nihil,</hi> or <hi>almost none,</hi> Surely it decays and is ready to vanish away. And what this difference is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in placed, we have already heard; and surely that <hi>prostasie</hi> in <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> time; behoved to be very in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, since it came to make upno greater difference betwixt Bishop and Presbyter then a <hi>ferme nihil,</hi> upon the borders of a <hi>non ens.</hi> As for what he sayes <hi>of their being Bishops themselves.</hi> I answer, they are the more impartiall witnesses in this mater; They tell us oft that <hi>Ierome was a Presbyter, and therefore no friend to Bishops.</hi> Now here is a Testimonie <hi>of eminent Bishops</hi> for this very truth which <hi>Ierom</hi> asserts, and which this man would make us believe, was condemned as a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. And surelie we are more tender of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who interpret any <hi>Prostasie</hi> or <hi>Episcopacie</hi> which they held, to be according to this their judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Episcopacie, and assert that what overplus of power they had or might possibly exercise, beyond that of a Presbyter, was by them lookt upon as founded on <hi>Ecclesiastick Custome</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiae usus,</hi> As <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks, but not to flow from a divine right, Then this <hi>Informer</hi> and his fellowes, who make them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one thing and practise another; yea and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themselves so grossly in maintaining as high a <hi>jus divinum, as Apostolick doctrine, and practise,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Hierarchicall Bishop, and yet assert a <hi>ferme nihil</hi> as to the difference betwixt Bishop and Presbyter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:104445:179"/>
But the <hi>Informer</hi> adds, <hi>That they might think Bispop and Presbyter to differ Gradu, not ordine, in degree not in order, which is still a debate in the Schools. Ans.</hi> This assertion is so improbable, that he dare but lisp it out, and faintly asserts it with <hi>a might be;</hi> But sure he must needs acknowledge this distinction of the Schooles to be much later then these Fathers, and any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall difference which they place betwixt Bishop and Presbyter, it is clear, that they found it upon <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Custome,</hi> as we heard both <hi>Ierome, Augustin</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> assert.</p>
               <p>But how long will this man involve himself in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and these Fathers also? Told he us not (page 15.) <hi>That Augustin upon Psal</hi> 45: 16. <hi>affirms, That the Bishops are properly the Successors of the Apostles unto their office.</hi> And saith he not immediatly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>That Ambrose upon</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 28. <hi>affirms of the Apostles first named in that Classe of Church officers, that ipsi sunt Episcopi firmante illud Petro, episcopatum, ejus acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat alter. That the Apostles are the Bishops by Peters as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, let another take his Bisheprick.</hi> Tells he us not likewise here <hi>that Augustin makes James the first Bishop of Ierusalem, and Peter, the first Bishop of Rome?</hi> Tells he us not, <hi>that they transmitted ane Episcopall power in that traine of Successors, proved by Catalogues of Bishops?</hi> Did we not hear him plead, <hi>that the seventy Disciples, placed in ane inferiour orb to the Twelve Apostles, are properlie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cceded by Presbyters; that Matthias behoved to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ane Apostle, tho one of the Seventy disciples,</hi> is his great argument to prove this. Now I beseech him <hi>per omnes musas,</hi> will he say that Apostles and Presbyters dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only <hi>ordine</hi> and not <hi>gradu, in order, not in degree?</hi> or that these fathers doe hold this opinion? how come their successors then to coalesce into one, after such a manner as to differ only in <hi>a ferme nihil, or almost noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Saith not Ambrose, <hi>Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri una est or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatio,</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:104445:180"/>
                  <hi>the Bishop and Presbyter have the same ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But the <hi>Informer</hi> will not adventure to say <hi>that the Apostle and Presbyter have one ordination.</hi> For <hi>Matthias</hi> one of the Seventy must be solemnlie by God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ane Apostle: And the Prelats must be solemnlie consecrat by their fellowes—<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to their new episcopall order. In a word, we heard from <hi>Cassander,</hi> that the Canonists and Theologues who dispute this Question, doe both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that as to a <hi>jus divinum</hi> or divine right, there is no difference betwixt Bishop and Presbyter either in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or degree. And so though it were granted (which yet the <hi>Informer</hi> himself dare not positively assert) that the Fathers tossed this question, it will nothing help him, nor prejudge <hi>Mr Durhams</hi> quotation, which speaks of a <hi>jus divinum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for what he adds, <hi>That the Fathers cited by Medina might hold the same notion,</hi> Let him hear how <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> (no friend to Presbyterian Government) repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents his assertion <hi>(de Cler.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE state of the Question in the <hi>Second Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> is twofold, 1. <hi>Whither the Prelacie now established by Law in this Church, be abjured in the national, and solemne league and Covenant?</hi> 2. <hi>Upon supposition that it is abjured in both the one and the other, whither the obligation of these Oaths stands against it, yea or not?</hi> Wee shall a litle touch.</p>
               <p>For the 1. Our National Covenant, sworne by <hi>King Iames</hi> in the the year 1580, and by the Estates of this land, and many times thereafter, solemnlie and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally renewed, both by our Church and State, doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude Prelacie. The passages thereof pleaded against Prelacie, and wherein our obligation lyes, are these. 1. In General, wee professe to believe <q>
                     <hi>the word of God to be the onlie rule,</hi> the Gospel contained therein to be Gods undoubted truth, as then received in this Land &amp; maintained by sundrie reformed Kirks &amp; States, chiefly by our own. Whereupon we renounce all contrary doctrine, and especially <hi>all kind of Papistrie in generall &amp; particular heads, as confuted by the word of God and rejected by the Kirk of Scotland.</hi> 2. After a large enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration</q> of many points of poprie, disowned upon this ground and vowed against, as contrary unto the word of God, and the gospel of Salvation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104445:187"/>
therein. <q>Wee renounce <hi>the Popes worldly monarchie, and wicked Hierarchie, and whatever hath been brought into this Church without, or against the word of God.</hi> 3. Wee vow to joyne our selves to this reformed Kirke in Doctrine, faith, religion &amp; Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; Swearing by the great name of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in obedience to <hi>the doctrine, and Discipline of this Kirke,</hi> and upon our Eternall perill to maintaine and defend the same according to our vocation, and power, all the dayes of our life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the obligation of this engadgement against pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie is evident these wayes. 1. <hi>All doctrines contrary unto, or beside the word of God,</hi> are here rejected and disowned: All doctrines contrary to the simplicity of the Gospel, recived and believed by the Church of Scotland, and whatever hath been brought into this Church without or against Gods Word. But so it is that the present hierarchy is contrary unto the Word of God, both in its Diocesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and Erastian mould, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large. And we heard that this Church of Scotland, since it received Christianity, did stand for a long time under Presbyterian Government, and untill <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent unto us from Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> never knew a Prelat, Ergo, Prelacie in its Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Erastian mould is here abjured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Prelacie is condemned in that clause of the <hi>Popes wicked hierarchie,</hi> whereby the Prelatick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is most clearly pointed at, which is evident thus. 1. That the Government of the popish Church <hi>is prelaticall:</hi> this man will not deny, it is by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Primats Deans &amp;c: and it being distinct from <hi>his Monarchie,</hi> for else the naming of his worldly monarchie had been enough: and moreover, it being ranked among these things which are brought into the Church <hi>against the Word of God,</hi> and into this Church <hi>against her pure Doctrine</hi> which was clearly the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104445:188"/>
sense of it, that assemblies, and the body of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church entertained; assemblies declaring that the Word <hi>[Bishop] was not to be taken as in time of Papistrie.</hi> And <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> (whose sense and Judgement herein was certanlie retained, and upon all occasions mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by our Reformers) accounting Prelacie to have <hi>quid commune cum Antichristo.</hi> Ergo, Prelacie is here vowed against simpliciter and in it self considered. 2. If he grant <hi>a hierarchie</hi> to be here abjured, sure it must be abjured with the rest of the corruptions enumerat in that large list of them exhibited in this Oath. Now these are abjured <hi>in themselves simpliciter, as contrary unto the Word of God and the doctrine of this Kirke, ergo,</hi> So must <hi>a prelacie</hi> or <hi>hierarchie</hi> be in its self abjured under the same <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> as thus brought in, whither by the Pope or any other. 3. This <hi>hierarchie</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in this Oath to be contrary unto the <hi>Discipline of this Church,</hi> as well as the popish Doctrine is therein supposed contrarie <hi>to her pure Doctrine.</hi> Now (as we shall shew) the Discipline which this Church then owned, was Presbyterian. So that that Discipline or Hierarchie, which stands in opposition to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Government, is here abjured: but so it is that prelacie <hi>ex se, &amp; sua natura</hi> stands thus opposit unto it, ergo, by the hierarchie, all prelacy is abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prelacy is abjured in that clause where we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <q>to joyne our selves to this reformed Kirk in her <hi>Discipline,</hi> as well as her <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and vow and sweare adherence unto both.</q> Now that the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline then owned by this Church, was Presbyterian Government or discipline, Is evident these wayes. 1. Discipline by generall assemblies and Synods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compleat parity of all Ministers, with a joynt decisive suffrage, is Presbyterian Discipline; but this was that Discipline owned by our Church: For her
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104445:188"/>
first Nationall Assembly (compleatly Presbyterial in its mould) was in the Year 1560. After which time untill 1580 When this Covenant was sworne, there were many assemblies exercising their power. 2, That is presbyterian Discipline, which did judicially condemne prelacie as having no warrand in the Word, and ownes no Church officers as lawfull but pastours, Doctors, Elders and Deacons. But so it is that this was the judiciall decision of our generall assemblies, long before this Covenant; for the first book of discipline, containing the Basis of presbyterian Government, was approved and subscribed by this Church in the year 1560. And the Second book of discipline in Anno 1578. Which two books compleatly overthrow Prelacie, &amp; layes down a mould of Presbyterian government. And therafter in the assembly at Dundie (Anno. 1580. Sess. 4.) The office of a Prelat was particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a solemne act, and abolished as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and void of Scripture warrand, ordaining <hi>under paine of excommunication such as brooked the said office to lay it aside, as ane office to which they are not called of God, and cease from preaching and administring Sacraments, under hazard of the same Censure; or using the office of a Pastour till they receive admission [de novo] from the generall assemblie.</hi> Now in the nationall covenant, this existent discipline being sworne to be maintained, who can say but that Prelacie is most formallie abjured therein; Especially if it be considered, that in the same year 1580 This nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal covenant was sworn, at which timethese things were so fresh &amp; recent. 3. That discipline which the takers and framers of this cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nant, at the taking of it, and in pursuance of its ends, did carry on and establish, that discipline it must needs include and engadge unto in their sense: but that was Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian-government. For (to omit many preceeding discoveries heirof mentioned in the Apology) in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104445:189"/>
year 1580. The assemblie after their judiciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator, that Prelacie is contrary to the word of God, sent Commissioners to the King to desire the establishment of the book of policie by ane Act of Council, untill a parliament were conveened; and what this book of policie contained, we did already hint. Then in this same year, the national cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and confession is sworn by the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. In the assemblie 1581. it is subscribed by all the members, and the Act of the Assemblie at <hi>Dundie</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. And it was again judicially declared <hi>that the Church did thereby wholly Condemne the estate of Bishops as they were in Scotland.</hi> At which very Nick of time the Confession of faith (Sworn before in the year 1580.) is presented to the assemblie by the King and Council, Together with his Letter to Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for erecting Presbyteries Compleatly through the nation, and dissolving Prelacies, all the three, viz, both the King, the Estates and the assemblie, fully agreeing in this judgement as to Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this oath for its maintenance. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this joynt authoritative determination of Church and State, Presbyteries were erected. Lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in this assemblie according to the forsaid joynt conclusion, the Second book of discipline contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mould of Presbyterial Government, and likewise this National Covenant and oath for its perservation, are (as the two great Charters of our Churches government and liberties) insert into the Churches records <hi>ad futuram rei memoriam,</hi> And that posterity might not be ignorant of the discipline sworn in that covenant. Upon which, and many such like grounds, the Assemblie 1638 did again judicially declare this sense of this National Oath, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was received with ane expresse application to prelacy, and the other Corruptions attending it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104445:189"/>
and taken by the whole land with a full concurrence of the civil Sanction and authoritie, Anno. 1640.</p>
               <p>The 2d. Great engadgement pleaded against pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, is that of <hi>the Solemne League and covenant:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin we vow <hi>the preservation of the reformed religion of the Church of Scotland in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and government according to the word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches.</hi> In the <hi>Second Article,</hi> Wee sweare <hi>the extirpation of poprie and prelacie, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, their Chancellours and Commissaries &amp;c. And all Ecclesiasticall officers depending on that Hierarchie—of whatever is found contrary to sound Doctrine and the power of godliness.</hi> Which engadgement hath been likwise taken by <hi>all rancks,</hi> by Parliaments, Assemblies, and the body of the people. Now that the Prelacie at this time established is abjured in this engadgement, is these wayes Evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Prelacie being razed in Anno. 1638. according to our national covenant, and ane engadgement being framed of adherence to the Religion established in Doctrine, worship, discipline and Government, in opposition unto all innovations formerly introduced, and upon both grounds, Presbyterian government, in its exact paritie being sett up, and judicially ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, both by Assemblie and parliament: that the Solemne league must needs strike against Prelacie, is in this apparent, because this league is clearlie refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the great ends of the national covenant, as it stood then established, explained and Sworne by this whole nation; and therfor is ane accessorie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgement, commensurat unto, and to be explained by the preceeding: and consequently none can doubt that it strikes against prelacie, and engadgeth to Presbyterian government, who knowes how former engadgements stood.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104445:190"/>
2. The preservation of the Doctrine, worship, Discipline and goverment then existent in Scotland, referring to the then establishment therof, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the former prelacie and all its corruptions; Its evident that all sort of prelacie &amp; whatever corruption in Government is inconsistent with Presbyterian sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and parity, is here abjured and covenanted against. As we engadge the preservation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and worship as then reformed, from Prelatick innovations, so likewise we sweare to preserve our Churches ancient and pure discipline as it stood then recovered from prelatick encroachments. That disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline &amp; government is here sworne unto, as the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and government of the Church of Scotland, which the Church and State of Scotland at this time established and owned: But so it is, that that was Presbyterian government, then fully ratified both by Church and State, Ergo, the preservation of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government is sworne; and by further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that government which was by Church and state extirpate, as abjured in the nationall covenant, and contrary unto this Presbyterian frame, was lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise abjured and covenanted against in this league. But such was prelacie, Bishops, Arch-Bishops &amp;c: ergo. Again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great ground upon which our adversaries deny the national Covenant to strike against prelacie, is, that they hold that the then existent discipline, to which in that Oath we vow adherence as the discipline of this Church, was not Presbyterian government, &amp; that King <hi>Iames</hi> did not own it. Ergo, (by ane argument <hi>a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis,</hi> and <hi>ad hominem)</hi> since its undenyable with them that <hi>de facto</hi> Presbyterian government was now enacted, ratified, established and sett up, both by Assemblies and King and Parliament, that goverment we must stand oblidged unto by the solemn league,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104445:191"/>
as the reformed discipline and government of this Church, and contrarily that government which was then <hi>de facto</hi> by assemblies, King and Parliament ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as inconsistent with Presbyterian government, and as abjured in the nationall Covenant, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wee cannot deny, but the solemne league stricks against. But so it is that prelacie was at this time razed by Assemblies, King and Parliament, as inconsistent with the nationall covenant, and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government then established, ergo this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne league stricks against Prelacie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The word <hi>preserve</hi> here used—and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression <hi>of common enemies</hi> cleares this further: <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>relates to that which one is <hi>in possession of,</hi> the common enemies of this possession, in the sense of all, both Imposers and engadgers, are the Prelats and their Malignant Agents, so that the holding fast of what was attained in point of reformation &amp;c: Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government in all its established priviledges against Prelats, Prelacie, and all the incroachements thereof, is here most evidently engadged unto.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That engadgement and oath which they who have set up prelacie in our Church, did Cassat and remove, as inconsistent therewith, that must needs, by their own confession strike against it: but so it is, that our Parliament and Rulers did wholly Cassat this solemne league, in order to the establishing of Prelacie. Ergo, by their own confession it strikes against it. They cassat the nationall covenant onlie as interpreted against Prelacie, supposing that it will not in <hi>its self</hi> strike against it, but the league they <hi>simply abjure,</hi> and disclaime its obligation as to a change of this Prelacie: Ergo they doe upon the mater acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it stricks against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finaly,</hi> Our adversaries doe grant that it strikes against Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Deans &amp;c: That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104445:192"/>
we are bound therby to extirpat such officers, though its onlie that <hi>specifick complex forme</hi> expressed in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article, which they think is properlie abjured. But 1. Is it not a prelacie inconsistent with Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian government (which we engadge to preserve in the First Article) which wee abjure and engage to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat in the Second, and under this formalis ratio, as thus inconsistent, in the sense and judgement of our Church and State (the Imposers of the Oath)? And are not Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Deans &amp;c: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Presbyterian government, then in being? 2. Dare this man or any of that partie deny but that the former prelacie which we had in Scotland was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be abjured by our Church and State, and the Imposers and renewers of this oath, and doe not all engagements bind according to the sense of Imposers, in the judgement of Casuists? 3. Is not our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now by two Arch-Bishops and twelve Bishops? Have not these their Deans, Archdeacons, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp;c? 4. Are not our Prelats restored to all their pretended priviledges, taken from them by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament who Imposed this oath? Nay redintegrat to a more absolute possession of pretended Spirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then ever any befor them possessed since our reformation? 5. Are we not engadged to extirpat <hi>all Eeclesiastick officers depending upon that hierarchie,</hi> as we are engaged against <hi>whatsoever is contrary to sound Doctrine and the power of godlinesse</hi> not in bulk onlie, but every thing <hi>Sigillatim</hi> upon this ground, and <hi>formalis ratio?</hi> And dare any of them deny that in the sense of Imposers, a diocesian Bishop or Arch-Bishop (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as their power now stands enlarged and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified) is contrary to sound doctrine, and the power of godlines? Dare he say that any of the Imposers judged ane Arch-Bishop, or Bishop, especially in such ane Erastian mould as he is now, to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent

with the word of God? Sure he were very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent who would assert it.</p>
               <p>This being clear then, that these engadgements leavells against the present Prelacie, let us point out Next, their obliging force.</p>
               <p>This will be clear, if we consider these oaths. 1. In their <hi>forme</hi> or <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> or nature and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. 2.

The Third command of that fiery law which Gods own voice pronounced from Heaven; and which his finger wrote upon the Tables, and which he commanded to be keept within the Ark, is, <hi>thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine,</hi> and with this severe Certificat, <hi>that he will not hold them guiltlesse</hi> who thus profane his name. He threatens to be a swift witnesse against the <hi>false swearer.</hi> [Thou shalt performe to the Lord thy oaths,] is amongst the grand and morall precepts frequentlie inculcat in Scripture. See levit: 6. 3. 19. 12. Numb. 30. 2. Psal. 15. 4. In this egagement the debt accrews to God, and the absolution consequentlie must have his speciall warrand. <hi>Quia religio juramenti pertinet ad forum divinum.</hi> Hence the Scripture is full of Instances of the Lords dreadfull punishing the sin of perjurie, witnesse that of Saul and Zedekiah whereof afterward. Now in both these engadgements, there is expresse mention made <hi>of Swearing by, and unto God.</hi> 2. These engadgements are <hi>promises</hi> or <hi>promissory oaths,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein we express our purpose, and resolution, as to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104445:193"/>
important duties both to God and man, <hi>invocking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs as a witness of our sinceritie:</hi> we have opened our mouths to God, and to one another in reference to great and weighty duties, relating to the first and Second Table. O what strong bonds are promises, especially of this nature; what conscience did even heathens make of them, where of instances are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly adduced in the Apologie (pag: 334, 335. &amp;c.) 3: These engadgements are <hi>vowes unto God,</hi> that is <hi>promises made to God in the things of God,</hi> such as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick and personall reformation: God here is not only <hi>invoked as a witness,</hi> but is the <hi>proper Correlat and partie</hi> in this engagement, and O but it is a fearfull thing to fall into his hands, to be punished for the breach hereof. The Scripture is full as to commands and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents to pay and performe our vowes, see Numb: 30: 2. 1. Sam: 1, 21. Ps. 76, 11. Ecc: 5, 4. 5. 4. They are <hi>Covenants,</hi> and that <hi>both with God and man,</hi> viz: <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgements to God for performance of duties revealed in his word,</hi> such as the people made, when upon the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes promulgation, they said, whatsoever the Lord commands we will doe, Exod. 19. 8. cap. 24: 3, 7. Deut. 5, 27. and 26, 17. and therefore are so often charged with <hi>breach of Covenant</hi> in their after diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. We have engadged to God (in these vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes) speaking to us in his word from heaven, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching nationall and personall reformation. Here is also a mutuall stipulation betwixt the nations, and with one another touching important duties of the 2d. table in relation to there mutuall rights. Now, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full in pointing out the weight and importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of such engadgements, see Ezek: 17. Jos. 9: 18, 19. Neh: 9: 38. Jer: 34: 18. So that in these Sacred bonds there is the tye of an <hi>oath,</hi> from the <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we owe to God,</hi> whose name we must not take in vain. The obligation of a <hi>vow,</hi> from the <hi>homage</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104445:193"/>
                  <hi>and fealty we owe unto him,</hi> the strength of <hi>a promise,</hi> both to God and man, from <hi>the influence of truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> all concurring to render the same Sacred and inviolable.</p>
               <p>The binding force of these engadgements does fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear in <hi>their qualities,</hi> as 1. they were <hi>solemnly taken on:</hi> Its a Maxime that <hi>the obligation grows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the solemnity of ane engadgement;</hi> and the Scripture aggregeth the breach from the solemnity, such as the <hi>cutting the ealfe in twain,</hi> and Zedekiahs <hi>giving of the hand</hi> &amp;c. For this imports deliberation and resolution in the engadgers, and renders the breach more scandalous and infamous. These oaths were taken by solemn as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and Parliaments, after conference, prayer, fasting &amp;c. 2. These are <hi>holy and most weightie</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements in the great concerns of Gods glory and our own salvation, the crown and kingdome of Christ against Anti-christ. 3. They are <hi>large</hi> and <hi>extensive,</hi> including duties of the whole word of God, all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we are tyed to in his holy law. 4. They are <hi>universall</hi> engadgements, all were given up to God in them, representatives and members of Church and state. 5. <hi>perpetuall</hi> and <hi>reall,</hi> as that betwixt David and Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than 2. Sam: 9: 7: 21: 7. That betwixt Ioshua and the Gibeonites, Ioshua 9: 18, 19. And that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Dent: 29: 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly the binding force of theseengadgements ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the <hi>subject they affect,</hi> as first, our Church in her representatives, and in their most publick capacity, the solemne assemblies in both nations. 2. State represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives &amp; Parliaments, thus all assurances are given, that either civil or Ecclesiastick lawes can affoord, and the publick faith of Church &amp; state is plighted with invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable tyes: So that they must stand while we have a Church or state, in Scotland; both as men and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as mmbers of Church &amp; State, under either a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104445:194"/>
or civill consideration, we stand hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably engadged: and not only representatives but the incorporation of Church and State are under the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> their binding force appears in the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>Object,</hi> 1. The <hi>immediatformall object</hi> is the Word of God &amp; the Truths and duties therein contained, and whatever is contrary to sound doctrine, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Godlinesse, under that <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> is here abjured, the eternall Truth of the Gospell as holden out in the Word, and received in this and reformed Kirks being the grand rule in this engadgement, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is approved by it, is embraced, and what is condemned by it, is rejected under that notion. 2. The <hi>more remote or materiall Object,</hi> are the publick, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, great and important Truths and duties the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein enumerat, both of the 1 and 2 Table, and the errours and sins therein abjured: To the observation, faith and obedience of the one, and abhorrencie of the other, under the formentioned consideration as either consonant unto, or dissonant from Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Word and truth, we stand perpetually and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably oblidged: So that this Oath hath ane <hi>objective,</hi> as well as <hi>subjective</hi> necessity contained therein, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the matter in its own nature, prior to the engadgement, as well as a necessity of performance flowing from the engadgement it self, which may take place in things indifferent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finaly</hi> the constantly obliging <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of these engadgments, joyned with the importance of the <hi>Matter subservient to these ends,</hi> further discover their inviolable obligaions. There is here both <hi>necessitas precepti, necessitas medij,</hi> &amp; <hi>finis.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sworne to be performed, falls under divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the sins and evills abjured, falls under divine prohibitions, and these engadgements are both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the matter it self, and as to the professed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104445:194"/>
scope of the swearers and engadgers, levelled at continually obliging ends, such as Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the advancing of Christs Kingdom, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick good of Church and State, the preservation and propagation of publick and personall reformation, truth, unity &amp;c. Now both these Oaths and Covenants are professedly entered into as perpetual engadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in order to these great ends for ever to be promoted, as their tenor clearly holds out.</p>
               <p>If any say what is all to the speciall obligation for Presbyterian Government, and in opposition to Prelacie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>? the Oath may be temporary or cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat and made void as to that point, though there be never so great duties otherwayes engadged unto therin. <hi>Ans</hi> This particular engadgement in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the maintenance of Presbyterian Government, and in opposition to Prelacie, runs along in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars. 1. It falls under the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Oath, vow, promise, and Covenant, and under the forementioned qualifications of solemnity, universality, and importance. Again 2. the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick faith of Church and State reaches this most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and is engadged for it. And 3. as Gods great ordinance holden out in his Word, Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment falls within the compass of the object of these Oaths, and under that consideration is sworne to be maintained, and Prelacie as contrary therunto is abjured, which contrariety hath been already clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Again Presbyterian Government is here engad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto as subservient to these great ends mentioned, and Prelacie is abjured as hindering the same, as both the Word of God and experience hath convincingly discovered.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Informers <hi>arguments against the abjuration of Prelacy in the nationall Covenant fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Some reasons of his against an Oath in generall, or this Oaths obligation upon the posterity, weighed.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE come now to examine what this new <hi>absolver</hi> or pretended <hi>doubt-resolver,</hi> hath presented to us against the oblidging force of these great engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The defence which he hath patcht up out of the <hi>survey of Naphtali,</hi> and that pamphlet called the <hi>seasonable case,</hi> consists of 2. parts. 1. He denys that the bond of either the national, or solemne league and Covenant, doth strike against the present Prelacie. 2. Upon supposall that the solemne league and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth strike against it, he denys its obligation. In both points we shall examine his grounds and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce his Method. I the doubter alledges that <hi>Prelates are abjured in the Covenant, so that none may warrantably owne the Ministry of such as preach under them, as being perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> To this consequence he repones nothing, but seems to admitt it, and therefore we need not speak unto it. Only he quarrells with the antecedent &amp; tells us that <hi>we would act more Christian Like, if we were sparing in judging another mans servants, who stand or fall to their own Master.</hi> But the judging there forbidden, being a rash felfish judging of others in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as meats or drinks, and (as Calvin pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraseth the words) <hi>de hominium factis pronunciare</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:104445:195"/>
                  <hi>extra verbum Dei de factis aliorum non licet statuere secundum nostram ipsius estimationem, sed ex verbo Dei. That we are not to judge of mens practises by our own opinion, but according to the rule of the Word, and not without its limits. Telling us further,</hi> that <hi>Iudicium quod a verbo sumitur, neque humanum est neque alienum that it is no human privat judgement which is drawn from the Scriptures,</hi> the impertinent application of this passage &amp; premised Scripture to our case, which is a practicall disowning of palpable perjury, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away from such, whose instruction causeth to erre from the words of knowledge, is obviously evident. This is no judging without Gods word, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, to say that perjury is perjury, sin is sin. Our <hi>Informer</hi> by this new knack would take away all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian judgement of discretion, yea by this his wide glosse, all judiciall decisions whither civill or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastik. Besides, is not his pamphlet a judging of another mans servants, Ministers and people, as schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks and what not, for disowning Curats upon the forementioned grounds. Doth he not and all his party judge, despise, and persecute the people God, for that which he calls <hi>indifferent,</hi> and a <hi>disputable point,</hi> at the foot of the page. But to proceed, his Doubter alledging [that all stand bound against Bishops in the Covenants which doe abjure them] he cryes out at, <hi>all Bound!</hi> as a paradox, and tells us <hi>that many Ministers and people never took it, and asks if we think them bound.</hi> Yes we think them bound as we do judge them bound in Gods covenant (Deut: 29.) <hi>who were not there, as well as these who were there, young and old, wives, little ones, from the hewer of wood, to the drawer of water.</hi> It seems this man either hath not read that chapt: or understands not the import of nationall compacts even among nations themselves; which do certainlie oblidge all members in the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, although not personally sworne by every

individuall. Will he say that no subject as a born subject oweth fealty and alledgeance to his Majestie, but such as have personally sworn the oaths of supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie or alledgeance. If so, then a man could not, be guilty of treason, which is certainly a breach of this fealty, unlesse he had personally sworn, which I know not who will assert.</p>
               <p>But the doubter alledging <hi>That it obligeth even the posterity,</hi> he tells us that <hi>this is a strange fancy, Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum being with casuists, vinculum personale, binding those that took it only, that accordingly the Covenant sayes, [we every one for ourselves] and not [for our selves and others]—That the father who was against Bishops, his swearing should not prelimit his sons judgement (who is for them) in a disputable point, or oblidge him to act contrary, to his judgment. Ans:</hi> 1. That there are covenants and oaths <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>hereditary,</hi> as well as <hi>personal,</hi> is evident in scripture; and if this man were not more led by fancy then truth he would not deny it, which is not only thus evident, but acknowledged also by Casuists. Was not that oath and Covenant, Deut: 29. made with them <hi>who were not there</hi> and <hi>belonging unto</hi> (and by consequence engadging) <hi>their seed for ever.</hi> Deut: 5: 2, 3. Moses tells the people emphatically that God made the Covenant with them who were then alive, even that Covenant at Horeb, though they were all near dead with whom it was made. Neh 9. 38. all entred into Covenant but only some sealed it. Was not that oath of Josephs brethren anent the carrying up of his bones from Egypt to Canaan, the oath to the Gibeonites, such as did reach and oblidge their posteritie? So that oath betwixt David and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan. 2. Sam: 9. 7. Now that the nature of this oath is such, cannot be doubted, it being about matters of perpetuall and everlasting importance, which no time can alter, evacuat or limit, and having the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104445:197"/>
publick faith of Church and state interposed therin, by a vowand Covenant with God and man over and above the oath: And likewise being in its nature promissory, in relation to duties, midses and ends <hi>perpetually necessary</hi> and <hi>oblidging,</hi> it is palpably evident that it is <hi>reall,</hi> and <hi>not personall</hi> only. 2. For that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>every one for our selves,</hi> it is very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently here alleadged to exclude the posterity: for the end and motive of the oath before this is expressed to be, <hi>the glory of God, the advancement of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the happiness of the King and his posterity, the true publick liberty, safety of the kingdomes &amp;c.</hi> wherin every ones private state is included; which of necessity includes the posterity and designes the obligation for them.</p>
               <p>Next, in the close of the first article, the posterity is expresly taken in, when the end and designe of the matters therin contained is said to be, <hi>that we and our posterity after us may live in faith and love &amp;c:</hi> And in the close of the 5. article we engadge to endeavour <hi>that the Kingdomes may remaine conjoined in a firme peace and union to all posterity:</hi> and therefor his negative inference viz: <hi>for our selves, and not for our posterity,</hi> is opposit unto the very sense, scope, and words of this oath: so that this clause is cleary referable unto the various capacities, conditions, and relations, wherein, in order to the work of God, the then engadgers stood. 3. his notion about <hi>prelimiting the son by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers engadgement,</hi> is a poore shift. For this might be objected against any nationall mutuall compact, in matters of a farr lower nature then this. This might have been objected against Josuahs oath to the Gibeonites. Might not the posterity look upon it as a disputable point to keep unto them, and might not Zedekiahs posterity look on it as a disputable point to keep that oath of his to the king of Babylon?
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104445:198"/>
I wonder if this man would think it ane unlawfull Covenant and vow to engadge for prelacie as now constitute, and oblidge for our selves and posterity, that it shall stand in this posture. Sure he will not deny the warrantableness of this, since he looks upon prelacie as the ancient apostolick frame, owned by the primitive Church. But shall the sons judgement who is other wayes minded, be prelimited by the father, or els must he act contrary to his judgement? let the <hi>Informer</hi> see to this. If he say its not a disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point to hold the present prelacie, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the son is oblidged to informe his judgement and act rationally, the obligation to the dutie carrying in its bosom a prior obligation to know it: surely he must acknowledge that this is our case and answer as to the Covenant; and that consequently his objection is naught, and the horns of his horned argument are crooked, so that it pushes us with neither of them. We might also here tell him that <hi>a prelimitation as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> in many things not indispensably necessary: will fall under the fathers paternall power over Children, witnesse that case of the Rechabites: And that this will not in every thing inferre <hi>a prelimi, tation in judgment as to the object simpliciter:</hi> Nay who knows no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> that the great morall precept [honour Thy Father and thy Mother] imports a very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obligation upon Children as such, in order to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to parents, and gives unto parents a large, and extensive authority hereanent. But shall the son be prelimit in his judgment anent all these, or act contrary to it? so this objection (in the <hi>Informers</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and according to his scope) will blurre out a great part of the 5t. Command. But what needs more, the matters here engadged unto, are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truths and dutys, not disputable points, as he and the rest of his adiaphorist latitudinarian party
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104445:198"/>
would make them: and therefor we are under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obligations to owne and mantaine the same.</p>
               <p>But if this man will abide a quere here, and a litle retortion of his notion further, thinks he it not hard to prelimit the faithfull ministery and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of this nation, in their judgement about his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable points of the present conformity, by so many laws and acts, or else oblidge them to act contrary to their judgement? Sure fathers have at least as great, if not a greater authority to limit their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then the Prelats and their party to prelimit the Presbyterian Ministers of this Church. Especially (which is our advantage in this comparison) the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being supposed under no previous contrary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to that which in this case the fathers put upon them in relation to prelacie, as the non-conformists are under counter obligations to that which is now demanded of them by their persequutors.</p>
               <p>Mr Crofton. (in his analepsis, pag. 145.) <q>tells us that considering the Covenant as made by the people of England, <hi>as a Kingdom and a Politicall body, professing the reformed religion,</hi> it looks like a nationall obligation, that the confluence of <hi>publick assent and authority</hi> by the people collectively and distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely considered, the accession of Royall assent, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes it a <hi>Publick and nationall Covenant, binding all persons of the nation</hi> (that sware, or sware not perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) and <hi>our posterity after us,</hi> in their particular places, and <hi>all that shall succeed unto the publick places, and Politick capacities of this kingdom,</hi> to preserve and pursue the things therein promised, so long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a kingdom, <hi>under one king, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of one reformed religion.</hi> He enforces this with the lord chief Barons speech, to the condemned traytors at the old baylie [you were bound to beare allegance to your king, yea though you may not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104445:199"/>
have taken the oath of alleadgance your selves, yet yow were bound by the Recogintion of king James and his posterity made at his first coming to the crown of this Realme, by the whole parliament, being the whole collective body of the kindom] hence he inferrs, <hi>that they and their posterity, must needs be bound,</hi> who themselves have [universaly] by the authority of such who were intrusted for them engadged the faith of the nation: for I see not (saith he) how they can give away our estates or take pardons in the name, and to the security of the nation if they may not in our name make oaths, promises, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants <hi>to bind us and our Succeeding generations and posterities,</hi> in sense whereof I cannot but desire all that wish well to England to consider <hi>the Covenant, the Solemne League and Covenant.</hi>
                  </q> So that with Mr Crofton it is an uncontrovertible point, that the obligation of this Sacred oath reaches the posterity, which he makes good from the sense and pleading of the Lord chief Baron in the point of alledgance and fealty to his Majesty which is the sentiment of all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and of the law itself. So that what our <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> calls ane <hi>odd fancy,</hi> appears to be a most solid truth, consonant both to Scripture, reason and the law of nations. As for the next objection of his doubter <hi>anent the fathers oblidging for the child in Baptism</hi> it is not our argument, nor is <hi>sutable</hi> to the state of this question, which is concerning a Covenant taken for our seed als well as for our selves; and if he acknowledge that <hi>the father binds not, in the name and room of the childe,</hi> then it toucheth not our point, for our question is about <hi>fathers taking on engadgements for themselves and their posterity.</hi> As for what the <hi>Informer</hi> adds here, its good that he acknowledges <hi>that ane oblidging force flows from the binding mater in that baptismall Covenant, and that the childs obligation is strengthened by his vow,</hi> which is enough
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104445:199"/>
in our case against him, since the matter of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and vows fall under divine precepts, to which the obligation of the oaths and vows is acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory. So that having sworne to keep these holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgements unto God, we must performe, and here he contradicts his forleader, the author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable case, who will have us either acknowledge the matter of the Covenant indifferent, or not plead the force of an oath or vow as superadded to that which was duty before.</p>
               <p>The doubter next objects <hi>That having sworne against prelacie we must not any more dispute, or question the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, citing, Prov:</hi> 20. 25. This objection he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiously for himself, but foolishly propones, that he may make way for some discourse (forsooth) upon this Scripture. We acknowledge as well as he, that we are not forbidden <hi>to enquire into an oath and vow in what cases, and how farre it is binding.</hi> Nay this is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, since we must both <hi>sweare and performe in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which requires a knowledge and inquiry as we saide before; and when an oath of vow is found <hi>materialy unlawfull, and vinculum Iniquitatis,</hi> it is no transgression of this precept to quite it. Such an inquiry as is in order to the understanding and performance of this vow in faith, we will allow whither to young or old. Only for what he sayes <hi>of many who were put to sweare at schools and colledges, and engadge in this Covenant, who could not do it in judgement,</hi> it is a calumnie which he cannot justifie, all being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and instructed therein who were come to Years of discretion, so as to be in capacity to enter into this Covenant, with judgement: and if lesser young ones present in congregations where it was sworne, did signifie a spontaneous consent, it was no more, then what Israels litle ones did by their presence before the Lord, Deut: 29. Well, but what is forbidden
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104445:200"/>
ehre <hi>to make inquiry</hi> (saith he) <hi>how the vow may be eluded.</hi> This is ingenuouslie saide, and hereby his own lips con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him and all his party, who have been now for many years, racking their wits to finde out evasions how to elude this Sacred vow. Witnesse the many pamphlets on this Subject since his Majestie's returne, and this mans among the rest.</p>
               <p>But the Doubter alleading <hi>that upon enquiry we will finde our selves bound against prelacy both by the nationall &amp; solemme League.</hi> He falls upon his impugnation first of the nationall Covenant, telling us as touching it [that the terme of <hi>the Popes wicked hiearchy</hi> will not include prelacie, as the <hi>survey of Naphtali</hi> fully proves] well, let us hear these proofs. The first is <hi>because king Iames and his counsel (the imposers of that Covenant, and the takers of it, Anno</hi> 1580) <hi>did in anno</hi> 1581: <hi>ratifie the agreement at Leith, made betwixt the Commissioners of the state and Church anno</hi> 1581. <hi>which was in favours of episcopacy. And would the king and counsell the next year have acted so contrary to it, if they had thought all episcopacy to be abjured therin Ans.</hi> Is this the great demonstration, which the Survever, and he have drawen out to prove this point, this being nothing but the old musty store of the Seasonable case, better propounded therein, then its here. To this I say, first, it is a very weak or rather wilde proof to conclude that such a corruption as prelacie could not be imported in that expression, <hi>Because the takers and imposers did some time after counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and contradict their engadgement:</hi> must the sense of a promissory oath and Covenant be measured by the after practice of engadgers? Sure he will not darre to admit this rule, and yet its the very topick of his argument. I would but ask him, if we could clearly demonstrat from the words of this oath, and from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104445:200"/>
this expression, that episcopacy is therein abjured, must he not grant that this argument taken from their after practice who took it, will signifie nothing, since it cannot stand good against the sense of the words, and the obligation natively resulting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Sure he cannot deny this, else he will swallow monstrous absurdities. And therefor unlesse he can disprove our arguments, which do prove prelacie to be abjured in that oath, and by the words in their genuine sense, he must grant that this <hi>practicall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> will signifie nothing. 2. He might have found that the Apologist outshoots the Surveyer and him, as also the Seasonable case in their own bow, and breaks this argument with a wedge of their own set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for whereas they alledge that about a year or lesse after this Covenant was imposed and taken, King James ratified that aggreement at Leith. He retorts that at the assembly 1581. <hi>which had declared prelacie utterly Unlawfull, and without warrand in the word,</hi> the Kings Commissioner presented to them (together with the Covenant subscribed by the King) a plot of presbyterys to be erected by him through the Kingdom, together with his letter to noblemen and gentlemen to be assistant therein, and for dissolving prelacies, to make way for these judicatories made up of Ministers and Elders. Hence (Saith he) how could King James intend prelacy by this confession since the self same day (a shorter time then half a year) wherein this confession (subscribed by him and his houshold) was presented to be subscribed by the assembly, he presented a plot of presbyteries to be erected through the Kingdom. Now let our Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Medium</hi> come in here, would King and counsell have acted so much for presbytery, and in opposition to Prelacie, in that very day wherein this nationall Covenant was presented by him, If he had not judged
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104445:201"/>
prelacie to be therein abjured, and presbyterie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto. And (if this assemblies carriage will have any weight in this argument) would they have recorded this oath as the Test and badge of this their nationall engagement, after they had immediatly before judicially declared against prelacie, if they had not looked upon it as abjured therin, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood this oath in a sense opposit thereunto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Informers</hi> next reason is, <hi>that in their strivings with the King to get prelacie away, they never used this argument; that it was abjured in the nationall Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, which they would have done, had they thought it to be included in that expression, of [the Popes Hierarchie.]</hi> This, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former hath very justly copied out of the Seasonable case. What? had the Surveyer in all these pages which he cites, no new notions to furnish him with, that this proctor is still feeding on the old store. But to the matter, first, how (I pray) runs this argument, [Ministers pleaded not this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at that time with King James: Ergo, There was no such meaning in the nationall Covenant] surely this is a wide consequence. 2. this is yet wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der [we know not of any such pleading at that time: ergo there was none] besides, he might have found that the Apollogist tells him out of Petries hist: pag. 448. That Mr. Melvin in anno 1584. writing to divines abroad anent our Church, shews them <hi>that three years since, the discipline of this Church was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, sealed, and confirmed with profession of faith, subscription of hand, and religion of oath, by the King and every subject of every state particularly.</hi> And that (pag; 570.) he shews that when some Ministers (anno 1604) were accused by the Synod of Lothian as to <hi>a designe of overturning the government,</hi> the synod pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>the confession of faith</hi> to them, as containing ane abjuration of prelacie, and a vow for presbyterian
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104445:201"/>
government, And that <hi>Mr. Forbes</hi> one of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled Ministers for holding that meeting at Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen in anno 1605. in his discourse to the gentlemen of the assize, shewed <hi>that they were bound by the nationall Covenant to mantaine the discipline of the Church,</hi> and having read it to them, he told them <hi>that they would be guilty of perjury, if for feare or flattery they discernd that to be treason which themselves had sworne and subscribed.</hi> Who also desired the Earle of Dunbar to shew the King <hi>what followed upon the breach of the oath to the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and that they feared the like should fall on him and his posterity.</hi> The Seasonable case (pag: 13.) acknow ledges that Ministers at that time lookt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as obliged against prelacy, by the national Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as well as we by the League, in plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to this <hi>Informer.</hi> As for that which he adds [of Beza's intention in writing against prelacie] we spoke to it already upon the first dialogue. And seeing this man objects to us Beza here again, we will offer to his consideration, Beza his 79. epistle written to John Knox, and dated at Geneva, Aprile 12. 1562. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he sayes, <q>This is the blessing of God that ye brought into Scotland, together with the sownd doctrine, <gap reason="foreign">

Then he adds, I <hi>would have thee (my Knox) and the rest of the brethren remember (which is now as befor our eyes) that as the Bishops brought in the papacie, so these false Bishops the relicts of papacie, will bring Epicurisme into the Church. Let them beware of this whoever wish the safety of the Church: and seeing ye have once banished is out of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

               <p>The Doubter next enquiring what is meant by the <hi>Popes hierarchie.</hi> He answers, <hi>not all Bishops, but these who actually depended upon the Pope, and that all Bishops can no more be understood, then reformed Presbyters, who renounce their dependance upon him; Presbyters and Deacons being a part of his hierarchie, as the Council of Trent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines. Ans.</hi> This is already removed when we did shew that prelacy is here abjured <hi>simpliciter,</hi> and absoluty, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from this dependance, it being here abjured as other corruptions are abjured, not mainly or only, because the Pope brought them in (as the assembly at Glasgow in the year 1638 clears it in their expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory act, and likewise the Apollogist pag. 396.) but as a corruption, <hi>

                     </gap>ex se &amp; sua natura</hi> of its own nature, contrary to the word of God, and the pure received doctrine of this Church. It is <hi>His wicked hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> as the rest of the corruptious therein enumerat, are called <hi>[his]</hi> such as invocation of Saints, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of altars &amp;c. Because introduced by him, not to distinguish these corruptions, from a lawfull dedication of altars, worshipping of Images &amp;c. Doth this man think that these Reformers would have admitted such corruptions presented under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notion then the Popes authority, and obtruded by this Argument; <hi>that their dependance upon him being broken off, they were no more to be accounted his corruptions?]</hi> or that they would have embraced extreme unction, or some other of his Sacraments, and the inferiour orders of Lectors, Acoluthi, Exorcists &amp;c: upon some other consideration then his Sacraments or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? surely he dare not assert this, and so the case is here. 2. As for his reason <hi>that otherwise all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Deacons should be abjured.</hi> It is very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, Because 1. Ministers and Deacons, are <hi>officers</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:104445:202"/>
                  <hi>of divine appointment,</hi> so that the abuse being removed, this divine officer stands; but prelacie is, <hi>exse,</hi> or of it self, contrary to the word of God, as we have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. The Hierarchie is abjured in that Covenant, as contrary to <hi>the then discipline of this Church,</hi> but so are not Presbyters and Deacons. 3. We have proved that the Hierarchie, and the speciall prerogatives which prelates arrogate to themselves, ar originaly papal, and they in a speciall manner are looked upon by him as his creatures. 4. as the Papacy cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prelacie, and any otherwayes then upon its should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, so neirher prelacie nor the Papacy can consist with Presbyterian government, and Presbyters divine right and power.</p>
               <p>The Doubter next objects [that all Bishops depend on the Pope, citing Appol: pag. 395. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for all Episcopacy is abjured in this oath.] He answers, <hi>the Apologie sayes they depend upon the Pope, in esse &amp; operari, but asks how he proves it, and tells us that to say it is so because the Pope acknowledges they depend upon him alone, is a poor because, evident to any ordinary capacity, resolving this upon the Popes [ipse dixit] like a Papist, and gives the Papists that advantage over Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that a Bishop depends upon the Popes supremacie, now and from the beginning, wherein he saith, protestants do oppose the Pope and prove that his supremacy was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by Councils and Fathers. Anf:</hi> The silly Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of this new agent of the tottering cause, is here very evident, in thus reflecting upon that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whose answers to these poor arguments of the Seasonable case, he dare not touch. For that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter alleging [that Prelates are not abjured in that Covenant, but as they depend on the Pope, as it abjures the five bastard Sacraments, as he makes them Sacraments, and that therefor the corruptions only of these offices which flow from him, are abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104445:203"/>
and as a part of his blasphemous priesthood.] The Apollogist taking this concession, inferrs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <q>That if these offices be abjured as a part of</q> his Hierarchie, and as confirmed by, and depending upon him, then Prelates are abjured, who depend <q>upon him <hi>in esse &amp; operári.</hi> The Prelate as such being no officer of divine appointment, as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and deacon, which if they were, then this Casuists argument would hold good, that we were to remove the corruption, and retain the institution and ordinance of God. But since we do suppose the office it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>self to be a corruption, and he hath not proved the contrary, his paralled as to the bastard Sacraments is naught.</q> And to clear this matter of fact that they are a part of the Popes hierarchie, by the Popes acknowledgement, that Author cites <hi>Peter-Suave</hi> in his history of the council of Trent, where the Pope would not have it determined, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelats were <hi>Iuris Divini,</hi> lest they should not depend upon him after this as formerlie. Now the question here being, <hi>whether the Pope lookt upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates as a part of his hierarchie, as in the capacity of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:</hi> in order to the clearing of this other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion depending betwixt this reverend author, and the Author of the Seasenable case, viz. <hi>whither our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers intended to abjure Prelats in that Covenant, as a part of the Popes hierarchie.</hi> To clear this matter of fact, what could be more pertinent then the Popes own acknowledgement, and judiciall declarator; that <hi>de facto</hi> they depend upon him, and areowned as parts of his hierarchie, is in this convincingly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. That <hi>de jure</hi> they have no divine warrand, this author supposed it as his principle, the contrary wherof neither that Pamphleter, nor any other hath proved: So that the Popes [ipse dixit] in this, is sufficient to prove this matter of fact. That he made not the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104445:203"/>
[ipse dixit] the rule to decide whither this officer be <hi>juris divini,</hi> or not, is in this convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly evident (and by consequence this mans obvious folly in imputing to him such ane assertion) that he grants, that if this Casuist had proved the Prelate to be <hi>juris divini,</hi> and institute by Christ or his Apostles, then the abjuring [of the Popes wicked Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie], would import only the abjuring of [the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this officer], whose lawfull office might be still retained: but this casuist taking this for granted that he is so institute, and reasoning upon that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, the author had good ground, until his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist as the affirmer shouldpro vehis supposition, to hold fast his own principle viz, that <hi>the prelats E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal being is papal:</hi> which is cleared by many of the Learned from convincing Testimonies. Let this Resolver read Leo (epist. 86.) and Swave (Tom. 4. pag. 465. of the Council of Trent, sess. 23. cap. 4. <hi>de Sacram. ordinis)</hi> where <hi>Anathema</hi> is pronounced upon any that denyes Prelates power of ordination. &amp;c. over Presbyters. I suppose he were alleging against a Papist that some of the Popish orders are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential pieces of his hierarchie, and should prove it by the Popes acknowledgment and constitutions, would he think the Papists rejoynder good, <hi>ergo, ye owne the Popes authority, and make his, [ipse dixit] judge.</hi> Say it were a question anent ths Acoluthi or <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists</hi> &amp;c. Whither they are a part of the Popes Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie? would he not think the Popes acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and owning them for such, to be a sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove this? Since he supposeth (and rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that they have no other right either <hi>in esse,</hi> or <hi>operari.</hi> Do not all our divines draw Arguments from the Pope and his councils acknowledgment, to prove their owning of many corruptions, and that they are properly theirs. But do they justifie the Popes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104445:204"/>
                  <hi>[Ipse dixit]</hi> in proving this, or in this method of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing? since they do suppose <hi>aliunde,</hi> that they have no divine right, as the Apologist in the point of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie rationally doth. 2. as for what he adds of <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churchet, or Prelates, their opposing the Popes pretended right and Supremacy hereanent,</hi> we say that they impugne his supremacy best, who lay an axe to its root [prelacie]. And to grant that prelacy is of its self a part of his Hierarchie, will no more justify his supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, then Pauls saying that the mysterie of iniquity was working in his time would do it. And al tho the first Proestotes or Bishops did not formally depend upon him, yet as a humane device they made way for him, and <hi>eatenus,</hi> are a part of his Hierarchie, which the opposition of some Bishops when he first attempted supremacy doth nothing invalidat. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the question here betwixt the Apologist and that Pamphleter, was about prelacie as it appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the Reformers <hi>in its then being and would,</hi> but not of the first proestotes or moderatours. What he adds here anent Calvin [his owning of a hierarchie, and pronouncing Anathema upon them who would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowne it, if cut off from its dependance upon the Pope] is answered already upon the 1. Dialogue. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e I shall only adde, that if Calvin in that passage, opposed unto the [Popish Bishops] <hi>Such as take Christ for their head,</hi> what curse will he not judge them worthy of, who owne and plead for such Bishops as pretending to renounce the Popes headship, take for their immediat head a <hi>civill Pope,</hi> and make him as to all spirituall maters, a more absolute head then the Pope himself.</p>
               <p>As for his argument from these Ministers who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the Doctors of Aberdeen [their declaring that the Doctors might take the Nationall Covenant, and yet debate and vote in relation to episcopacie in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104445:204"/>
the ensuing assembly] I wonder what blurred this mans eyes, that citing pag. 395. of the Apollogy, he could not look back, to pag. 393. where he might have found this argument of his Master the author of the Seasonable case answered, which this casuist drew from that pamphlet emitted anno 1638. under the name of his Majesties Commissioner; so that we have it here in the 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> concoction, and yet it is as raw as at the first. The answer in short is (I remit it at length to his reading in that peice) that it was not the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant it self that the Doctors scrupled to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, and consequently anent which that debate was stated betwixt the Ministers and them, but the addition containing, the application to the present times, which as to prelacie was expressed thus [a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing the approbation of the corruptions of the publick government of the Church] by this they <hi>thought</hi> they were expresly specifically bound against prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: this these Ministers denyed, but never said that prelacie was not abjured in the nationall Covenant it <hi>self,</hi> or the negative Confession. Let this Absolver read the answers of the Ministers, wherein this will be cleared.</p>
               <p>The Doubter next objects [that the decision of the assembly 1638. put it out of doubt that prelacie was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in that Covenant, and that all Episcopacy was meant by the Popes hierarchie]. To which he answers. 1. <hi>That prelacie being of divine, or Apostolick right, that decision is null from the beginning. Ans.</hi> wheras he sayes he hath proved prelacie to be of divine or apostolik right, I will presume to say I have proved the contrary; so that the Covenant is so far from being null upon this ground, that it is rather an accessorie tye to disown a corruption, to the disowning wherof, wewere before by scripture grounds preoblidged. But passing this, he next alledges <hi>that it was more then that assembly could</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:104445:205"/>
                  <hi>do to declare this.</hi> Who so? 1. (sayth he) <hi>how could they put a sense upon ane oath taken</hi> 58. <hi>years before, and few or none of the first takers alive, or if alive, few or none members of that assemblie? how could they know that their exposition was according to the mind of the first imposers?</hi> But why will this Plageary tell us still over and over the arguments of the Seasonable case, without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing the answer therof already exhibit unto him? did not the Apologist tell him, that this reason sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the sense of that Covenant to perish with the first framers. And whereas that casuist added, to make the argument stronger (which this his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple forgot) that the oath being <hi>vinculum personale,</hi> they could not give the sense of dead men. To this the Apologist answers, <q>that there is also a <hi>vinculum reale,</hi> as this nationall oath was, and that it oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all the Land, and the posterity, we were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in order to performance, bound to Search into its meaning, and that this was the proper work &amp; duty of a general assembly. That that casuist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledged (which this borrower should have noticed) that this was the judgement of Ministers concerning its sense when prelates were first obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Church, so that its true meaning from hand to hand was come to them, and that they were the more <hi>in tuto</hi> to judge of it.</q> And whereas the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Seasonable case had a Limitation in it which this man forgott, viz: [unless that assembly could produce authentick evidences that this was the meaning of Imposers] the Apologist told him that they did produce authentick expresse evidences, that such was the meaning of the first takers. I would know how this man comes to descant upon the sense of ancient writers in this pamphlet, and to determine anent sentences of private writers, dead severall centuries of years agoe? He is very confident in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104445:205"/>
fastning his Glosses upon Jerom's words. I trowe that Author is dead more then 58. years agoe. And for as clear as his words are against the divine right of prelacie, yet this man thinks he is Cock sure that this was not the meaning of Jerom's words, which presbyrerians alledge. <hi>Quis talia fando, temperet a risu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Seasonable case goes on to object next (and this resolver followes up at his heels.) <hi>That all which that Assembly produceth (Sess.</hi> 16.) <hi>to prove this to be the meaning of that Oath, amounts only to this, that the Church about that time of taking the Covenant, and also afterward, was labouring against Bishops, but proves not that episcopacie was abjured in the words of the oath.</hi> Now why would he not do his Doubter such a small piece of justice, as to put into his mouth the large answer of the Apollogist to this argument, from (pag. 406. to 409.) But this would have made him too stiffe a Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for this Resolver or Informer: but had he nothing in the <hi>Surveyer</hi> to resolve this? Well, the Apollogist here tells him and his Leaders in this argument, <q>that the Covenant supposeth a Government then in being, to the defence of which it oblidgeth: that that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was not prelacie, but presbytery, he clears by a large induction of our assemblies acts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedour, as the Assembly 1638. did before; so that, that matter of fact being clear, there is No doubt but that the nationall Covenant binds to defend and preserve presbyterian Government then owned and existing; even as its engadgement to defend the King must needs be understood of King James who was then reigning.</q> That this was the government then Existent and owned by this Church, we cleared in short already, and need not here repeat it. But 3. this <hi>Informer</hi> (passing over a more plausible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his Master the Seasonable case) enquires <hi>by</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:104445:206"/>
                  <hi>what warr and that assembly could put upon others their sense of the Covenant; they might declare their own sense</hi> (saith he) <hi>which possibly was not right, but how could they oblidge others to their sense, who had taken it before, the first imposers having given them no such power.</hi> The Apollogist here told him, that this assembly put no sense of their own upon any who took it either before or after, but as the representatives of this Church gave a judiciall interpretation of it, and by authentick evidences made it appear, that this was the sense of the imposers, and of the Church of Scotland when it was taken, and that such as sware it before with an explicatory addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [to forbear the approbation of prelacie, untill the assembly should try whither it was abjured in that oath] did consequently commit this unto, and were accordingly depending upon the assembly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the meaning therof; besides that the judicial interpretation of this nationall Church her oath, did of right belong unto this her supreme judicatory as is said. Here the Doubter objects [that those who took the Covenant after it was thus sensed by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, have abjured Episcopacy]. To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres <hi>that the assembly did intend to put no other sense upon it, then the sense of the words, and of the first imposers.</hi> Very true, but what then? <hi>the first imposers having no such meaning</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as to abjure Episcopacie, the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ground failes, and their posterior meaning could not bind against the first meaning.</hi> This last is easily granted, but the great pinch lyes in this, how proves he <hi>that the first Imposers never meaned it against Episcopacie.</hi> This he sayes is already shewed, but where? we must waite it seems for a new pamphlet to get an account of this great proofe.</p>
               <p>The Doubter next alleadeth to purpose [that we engadge our selves in that Covenant to adhere to this Church in doctrine, faith, religion and discipline,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104445:206"/>
—and to continue in the doctrine and disciplin thereof, which is Presbyterian discipline.] To this he answers. <hi>That by discipline, cannot he meant Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government.</hi> Why so? <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>at the first imposing of the Covenant there was no such govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Scotland nor for a confiderable time after. Ans.</hi> we have made it appear that Episcopacie was judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially declared unlawfull, and that both the books of discipline were received, which overthrow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, and asserts Presbyterian discipline, before ever that Covenant was taken; and that at the very time of taking it the old mould of prelacies were dissolved, and Presbyteries erected both by the King, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. But how proves our <hi>Informer</hi> that there was no such government in Scotland at that time? <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the King, for all Ministers essayes to introduce Presbytery, yet owned Episcopacy.</hi> But how proves he this, that at the imposing of the Covenant, he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned episcopacy? did he not owne the assemblies po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and the power of Synods? presented he not to that assembly 1581, a plot of Presbytries, and his letter enjoyning their erection, &amp; to dissolve prelacies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the subscribed Covenant? how did this own episcopacy? let Royalists take notice what an ingrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dissembler this man makes King James, in saying that he still owned episcopacy, when so palpably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning it to the sense of all reasonable men. And if king James came all this length as to the introducing of Presbytrie, surely Ministers essayes with him for this end, were very effectuall. Besides, its a poor argument to prove that this protestant organick Church was not at that time owning Presbyterian government, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising it (and by consequence that the Discipline as then existent, sworne to be mantained in that oath, is not Presbyterian) to say that king James owned episcopacie. Nay, in granting these essayes of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104445:207"/>
for Presbytry, he grants <hi>that Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was owned.</hi> For sute I am what was their sense and endeavours as to Presbyterian government from the beginning, the same were the sense and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the body of this protestant Church. But his 2d answer to the premised objection of his Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ushered in with a <hi>therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>—</hi>what next? <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the government meant in it must be Episcopacie, if any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mode of government be understood.</hi> This is well stept out, a piece beyond his Master the Seasonable case, who hardly comes this length. The man that will let us Episcopacie in this Church at that time, as the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imbracd by her, must have odd prospectives, and of a like quality with these of our <hi>Informer,</hi> which have descryed Diocesian Bishops in Scripture. We heard that the Seasonable case grants [that Ministers then lookt on themselves as oblidged against episcopacie, both by the nationall Covenant, and by the word of God] pray Sir, be tender of these Ministers reputation, were they so principled and still owning episcopacie too? this is strange, yea and owning it and promising to defend it in this Covenant. Besides, how will he reconcil our Churches <hi>labouring now against Bishops,</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him pag. 118. with her <hi>practising Episcopacy,</hi> which he asserts pag. 118. But his answer hath a proviso [if any particular mode of government was understood.] But why will this latetudinarian <hi>Informer</hi> cast the mist of a hesitating [if] upon a clear and plaine truth? strange! Speaks not the Covenant of an existent frame of Government embraced by this Church? What! Were they embracing <hi>a Proteus?</hi> was it an existent <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum vagum, or materia prima,</hi> some Embryon that had received yet no forme? But how proves he that Prelacie was sworne unto in that Oath? <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Year after, the King ratified the agreement at Leith in favours of Episcopacie.</hi> This we heard before, and did shew what an insignificant reason it is, from King Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104445:207"/>
practice a year after, to inferre what is the sense and intendment of this Oath, and the takers of it. A to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick and reason which none who are solid and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al will admitt. Yet the <hi>Informer</hi> still beats upon this Anvill. Besides, the Apollogist tells him (pag. 15.) that this treaty at Leith, anno 1571, <hi>was opposed and censured by the Nationall Assembly, the very next year;</hi> So that this national Church in her suprem judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, gave no consent unto, but opposed that treaty, and whatever recesses from her Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Government, were therin begun; But this mans sqeemish eyes, stil overlooks what he cannot answer. Now remark our <hi>Informers</hi> profound and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till reasoning in this point. King James did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure episcopacy in the Nationall Covenant, why so? Because the next Year he acted for Episcopacie. And when we allege that the Government to which that Covenant oblidgeth, was Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was then existent; he tells us that the Government then existent was episcopall. And when he is put to the proofe of this paradox against such clear evidences, he just recurrs again and tells us (for his proof) that King James then acted for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie; fine circular reasoning this is, and the <hi>Informer</hi> shall thus never want a <hi>Medium,</hi> &amp; knows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to answer the solidest argument against-him with turning, according to the Souldiers dialect, <hi>asye were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is meant by [discipline] in that Covenant? <hi>The substantialls of it</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and necessary policie as exprest in the first dook of discipline,</hi> 9. <hi>Cap. which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, tho particular formes (as some think) may be changed.</hi> But 1. Why will this versatil <hi>Informer</hi> bemist his reader what dark and generall expressions. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means he the <hi>[essential necessary Policy,] according to that phrase of the book,</hi> or a necessary Policy <hi>exprest and asserted in that book?</hi> If the first, I would ask him. 1. Why condescends he not upon that essential and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104445:208"/>
                  <hi>necessary policy,</hi> and gives no account of its nature and extent, as it is contradistinguished from that which is <hi>not necessary,</hi> but <hi>mutable.</hi> 2.

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> he mean all Church-officers of divine appointment, according to the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their qualifications, their authority, and its due exercise, with what sense or reason can he suppose, or any els, that this wil not determin <hi>a particular form,</hi> &amp; cansubsist without it? how can <hi>a particular form</hi> be more formaly and explicitly described then thus? But, next, if by <hi>necessary Policy,</hi> he understand <hi>the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy held out and asserted in that first book,</hi> I would ask him. 1. Why excludes he the <hi>second book,</hi> which was at this time extant and received, and which doth in severall chapters viz. 5, 6, 7, 8. treat of the Pastor, Doctor, Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Deacons office, which he will no doupt own as <hi>substantiall peeces of Church-policy,</hi> being so clearly asserted in Scripture. 2. Why answers he not to the account &amp; character of that first book given by the Apoll: (pag. 10.) who tells him <hi>that it overthrowes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy in the establishing of Church-sessions, the way of election and triall of Ministers, and severall other things contrary to the episcopall method;</hi> will he by this silence consent, that prelacy stands in opposition to <hi>the substantialls of Church Government,</hi> and the <hi>utterly necessary Policy therof?</hi> to a policy <hi>indeed unalterable;</hi> (to use his time phrase)? if he say, that he understands by this phrase, that policy which is necessary in either or both these books, but not the intir. Policy delineated therin; how will he prove that the Covenant-obligation in the Intention of the imposers, reaches the on and not the other? Next I would ask this <hi>Informer,</hi> whither thinks he that <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forms</hi> of Government are <hi>alterable,</hi> yea or not? if not, how comes he to distinguish them in this, from the essentiall necessary Policy which he cals <hi>unalterable?</hi> if he think them alterable, why doth he not positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104445:209"/>
this, but presents this opininion as <hi>the thoughts of some only,</hi> and censurs Stilling fleets opinion herin (pag. 76.) Besides, if by [substantials of Government] he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand [the disciplin asserted in that book,] he justles and deals stroaks what his reverend father B. Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, in his character therof exhibit in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, pag. 174. For first, he sayes <hi>it was framed in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Government of the reformed Church</hi> in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> which all know was Presbyterian. 2dly. He sayes <hi>it it could not take effect as being but a Dream.</hi> And did he call the [substantialls of Government] but a Dream, thinks this man? Surely either the Bishop or our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi> dreams. 3dly. <hi>He wisheth Iohn Knox had retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old policy,</hi> and therefore in his sense this policy was distinct from Prelacie. On the other hand the framers (the Ministry owneing it) supplicat the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament after it was drawn up for [the restauration of the Discipline of the ancient Church,] and for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Popes usurpation, and of all that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline that did flow therefrom, as inconsistent with the Discipline of the ancient Church, and the Disciplin contained in that book. How absurd is it to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that it was only <hi>substantialls</hi> which was at this time existent, and no <hi>particular forme;</hi> it being a forme of Government and the Discipline of this Church, which the Covenant oblidges unto; and the Apologist as, well as the Assembly 1638. could have given him a large account and proof of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forme at this time existent. In a Word, let us have all the substantialls of Government, i. e. AllChurch officers divinely appointed, with their due power and Assemblies higher and lower, and it will quickly justle his prelacie to the door, and make him him and hisFathers feest he dint of the true Church of Scotland, her sword and censures for what they have done, if they repent not.</p>

                  <p>The Abjuration of Prelacie in the solemne League and Covenant, vindicat from the exceptions of this <hi>Informer.</hi> Also <hi>Mr Crofton</hi> and <hi>Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> acquit of affoording any Patrociny to his cause. Dr Sanderson stands in terms of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to him in this point.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now this our Oedipus and doubt resolver who hath acquit himself so dexterously in absolving us from the nationall Covenant, marches up after the Seasonable case, to try how he can play the absolver as to the solemne league. And his Doubter making a wide step to the 2d. Article [wherein he allegeth Bishops are abjured, and that Protestant Bishops are meant]. To this he answers, <hi>That its not every kinde of Protestant Bishops that is there intended, and that Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus (pag.</hi> 14, 16.) <hi>holds that all episcopacy is not abjured, but that they could in England freely Submit to the primitive episcopacy viz, the precedencie of one over the rest; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom nothing is ordinarly to be done in ordination and jurisdiction—that they assert its only the English kinde of prelacy (expressed in the Article for that end) that is abjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which we have not in Scotland. That Mr Vines and Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker assert, that its only that complex frame consisting of all the officers there mentioned, that is abjured—that the Assembly of divines was reconcilable to moderate episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie,——That Timorcus holds that the English par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament &amp; our commissioners were not against all Episcopacy, (citing likewise Mr Crofton pag.</hi> 70: 71.) <hi>hence he concludeth that the English preshyterians would not cry out against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists as guilty of perjury. Ans.</hi> I. It is a very pityfull shift
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104445:210"/>
to measure our obligation in Scotland against Prelacy, by the 2d. Article of the league, which relates to the Church of England, wherein only that prelacy was exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent. For since Scotland, from the time of our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation never had such a Prelacie as the adversaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, they must consequently grant that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie which that article engadgeth to extirpat, is not solely or mainly the Prelacie which we stand oblidged against in that Covenant, but a Prelacy inconsistent with Presbyterian Government (and under that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall consideration) which in the first article we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged to preserve. In order to which preservation of our reformed discipline from our own Prelacie, the 2d Article, which doth relate to the extirpation of Prelacy in England and Ireland, is subservient as a mean to its end. This is convincingly clear, for I. <hi>Extirpation</hi> and <hi>Preservation</hi> being opposite terms, and the last being made use of as to our Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, must needs relate to Presbyterian Government as then established, in all its previledges, which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes the episcopacy formerly existent therein; And the <hi>extirpation,</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi> ingadged to in the 2d. Art. must relate to the then existent Prelacy in England and Ireland, and that by way of mids leading unto, and for execution of the ends of <hi>preserving our own established reformation,</hi> engadged unto in the first Article. 2. We said already that our Parliament did rescind all acts against our episcopacy, together with the solemne league, and restore Prelats to the sole possession of Church Government under the King, declaring clearly that the <hi>preservation</hi> engadged unto in the first article, cannot consist with our Prelacie. Again, as this duty of <hi>extirpation</hi> is engadged unto in so far as is necessary in order to the <hi>preserving</hi> of our own established reformation, by this Church prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally vowed and intended, so that clause in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104445:211"/>
end of the 2d. Article, viz. [to extirpate whatsoever is found contrary to sound doctrine, and the power of godliness] amounts both as to us and England, to such an extensive engadgement in opposition to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, that it totally excludes it even in our adversaries mould, under this <hi>formalis ratio</hi> as thus opposit to sound doctrine &amp;c. Which hath been cleared upon the first Dialogue.</p>
               <p>Next, will this man deny that these officers, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans, Chapters, &amp;c. are not in <hi>themselves</hi> and simply abjured in that 2d. article, or that the Presbyterians in England would not disowne them as inconsistent with the Covenant? Sayes he not that it is only a fixed presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of order which they are for? and is this all that Arch-Bishops and Diocesian Bishops do possess? have we not in Scotland Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans and are we not engadged to extirpat these in the 2d. article? how then can he say that it is only that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex frame with all these officers which we are oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against. Do not two remarkable clauses contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this gloss? I we engadgeto extirpate <hi>all Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick officers depending on that Hierarchie,</hi> what? is it only all in bulk, and not all and every one? this were equivalent to such a wilde assertion, as if one should say that after the enumeration of these evills <hi>schism, heresie, profannesse,—</hi>which are thus Summed up, <hi>whatsoever is contrary to sound doctrine and the power of godliness,</hi> this engadgement did only relate to all these evills complexly, and not to every one <hi>sigilatim</hi> or apart. 2. Whatsoever is contrary to sound doctrine in our principles, is there abjured as I said: but such are Bishops, Arch-Bishops, and I adde, whatsoever is inconsistent with our established reformation and with Presbyterian government, is also here formally abjured. In the 3d place, <hi>Timorcus</hi> is clearly against
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104445:211"/>
our <hi>Informer,</hi> for in explaining what is that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy which is abjured, he distinguisheth a Prelacie of <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> and of <hi>meer order. The prelacie of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,</hi> he saith is twofold, the first is, whereby the Bishop hath sole power of ordination and jurisdiction (such as is our prelacy now in Scotland) in which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>Timorcus</hi> saith that <hi>Ministers,</hi> do meet with the Bishop only <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> to give him advice, which is all that our Curats are allowed by law, as is said above, and scarce that. The 2d sort of prelacie he calls <hi>paternall,</hi> wherein the colledge of Presbyters have a constant Prelate or President, who must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with them ordinarly in ordination and acts of jurisdiction. He interprets the Covenant expresly to strick against <hi>the Prelate with sole power of ordination and jurisdiction;</hi> which prelacy he calls <hi>Popish</hi> even though the Bishop admit Presbyters to concurre with him in ordination and government. Now let this man say, since Timorcus (whom he will not assert that these others divines do contradict in this point) together with the parliament of England according to Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, do disowne such a prelacie as is here described, and interpret the Covenant obligation as reaching the extirpation thereof, doth not this articlé of extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to their sense, clearly reach and cut off the present prelacie of diocesian Bishops and Arch-Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, obtruded upon this Church? can he deny that they have the sole power of ordination &amp; jurisdiction, that all the power which Curats have according to our Law, <hi>is to give the Bishops advice,</hi> yea and not that either, unlesse he judge them to be persons of <hi>Known loyaltie and Prudence.</hi> And surely if this precedency of meer order, here exprest, be the only <hi>primitive Episcopacie,</hi> it is far short of what our <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> pleads for, and will never come up to justifie the prelacie now existent. And if in the sense of Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104445:212"/>
and the other divines mentioned, and in the sense of the imposers of that oath, the extirpation engadged unto, cuts off whatsoever is beyond this <hi>precedency of meer order;</hi> it is incontrovertibly clear that even in their sense, the prelacie now existent is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
               <p>That Mr. Crofton, and the Presbyterian Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting partie in England according to him, are not reconcilable to our prelacie, nor the Covenant in their sense, appears evidently by his pleadings for the Covenant, against the Oxford men and others. In his Analepsis (pag. 74. 75.) he mentions a breviary of reasons to prove [that the prelatical government in its formality is a plaine and clear papacie, and that <hi>a Diocesan Bishop,</hi> and ane <hi>universal Metropolitan</hi> or <hi>Pope</hi> differ only in degree and limites, not in kind] ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and approving of Salmasius and Beza's, calling episcopacie <hi>a step to the papacy;</hi> so that the very office of a diocesian Bishop as such, is as unlawfull as the Papacie in Mr Croftons judgment, it being with him a part thereof. Again (pag. 78.) whereas the Oxford men plead [that they cannot swear against episcopall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which they conceive to be of divine or apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick institution] he chargth them and Dr Gauden, with sophistick concealment of the <hi>ratioformalis objecti,</hi> and not describing of episcopall government: And tells him that episcopall government may denominat a government, <hi>communi concilio Presbyterorum,</hi> with a Moderator or Chaireman, <hi>ordinis causa,</hi> which he sayes is of divine institution, and exemplified act. 20. where Bishop and Presbyteter are terms synonimous denominating persons invested <hi>with the same office and authority.</hi> This he sayes the Covenant strikes not against, and the prelacie which is abjured he describes to be a government wherein <hi>one person is advanced into a distinct order of Ministrie above other Ministers, and is</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104445:212"/>
                  <hi>invested with Prince-like power over them, enjoying an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority peculiar to him eo nomine as Bishop, of sole ordination and jurisdiction, unto whom all other his fellow Ministers are subject, and must swear obedience to him</hi> &amp;c. I wonder if our <hi>Informer</hi> will deny this to be the characteristick of our present Prelats, or affirme that they possess no more authority in Church judicatories but <hi>a meer prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, ordins causa,</hi> which is all the Episcopacy which <hi>Mr Crofton</hi> holds that the Scripture, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according therunto, will allow. Thereafter, (pag. 72.) He tells these Masters, that Christ gave his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples charge that they should not affect <hi>superiority one over another, or princely power over Gods heritag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> and puts them to prove, that the <hi>office of the Ministry, may in ordination be divided, or that there are more orders of the Ministry then one</hi> (which our Informer still begs a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of) <hi>viz. Bishop or Presbyter, or more officers in the Church then Elders and Deacons appointed by Christ, or his Apostles by their apostolick authority. That the Presbyter (in whom are required the same qualifications, to whom is to be yeelded the same obedience, subjection andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, who recives the same ordination, and is charged with the same duty, and invested with the same power of feeding and governing the Church of God, with the Bishop, and none other) is an order distinct from, and subject to the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, to be ruled by him, and not to exercise his office but by the Bishops licence, and that the Presbyter must swear obedience to the Bishop as his ordinary.</hi> Which are the grand <hi>postulata</hi> and topicks of all this mans reasoning in point of prelacy. The autitheses of which tenets we see Mr Crofton most evidently maintaines as the sense of the Covenant in point of episcopacy; he further descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes (pag: 80. and 81.) the prelacy covenanted against, and anent which he challengeth these Masters proof of a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> to be such <hi>wherein one Minister or Bishop doth stand charged with all the congregatious and pastors——</hi>

And whither Mr Crofton holds not our prelacy, arch-prelacy, and metropolitan primacy, to stand upon the same ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis with the papacy, and to be equally with it, excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick to the Scriptures; and that he esteems conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Bishops and Arch-Bishops (which I hope he will not deny to be abjurd in the Covenant) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend (as such) upon the Pope as a part of his hierarchy. <q>Next (pag. 81) he sayes that it is not the first sort of episcopall government formerly described, wherein all Ministers are invested with equal power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hority or dignity, are all of the same order, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne by common counsel, but the specificall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy last described, which presumes it self to be a <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie:</hi>

for he tells us in the preceeding page that none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>a quantenus ad omne,</hi> &amp;c.

Besides (pag. 82.) he cites severall writers to prove <q>that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and distinction of Episcopall and Archiepiscopall chaires &amp; metropolitan primacies, owe their institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church of Rome, or politick constitutions of Princes. He tells us (pag. 84.) out of Cartwright and Whittaker—that the Church in respect of Christ its head (not his vicar, or superiority of single prelats) is a monarchy; in respect of the ancients and pastors that governe in common (all the Presbytrie) with like authority among themselves (not a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over them) it is an Aristocracie, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the people are not excluded, but have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, it is a Democracy.</q> The inserted parentheses are Mr Croftons; and let any judge whither he assert not with these authors, a Presbyterian frame of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment opposit to diocesian Bishops and Arch-Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops.

And pag. 5. summeth it up thus—that the Covenant cannot be accomplisht by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Prelats pride &amp;c. <hi>Whilst the Preeminence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, Paternal power, and juridicall authority assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them as distinct from, and above all other Ministers of the gospel, as the only immediat successors of the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> (So our <hi>Informer</hi> makes them) &amp;c.<hi>—are continued.</hi>
                  </q> What will this Oedipus answer to Crof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons assertion? Have not our Prelats this preeminence above Presbyters, as a distinct order from them? and have they not a juridicall authority over them, by our law and practise, and his pleading too? doth not Mr Crofton <hi>in terminis</hi> assert, that the Covenant obligation can never be satisfied untill such be removed? are they no more in Church judicatores, but Moderators and Chairemen, set up <hi>Ordinis causa</hi> to order the actions of the meeting? doth not our law give them a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice in the meeting, and alloweth Presbyters only to give them advice, if their Lordships do judge them prudent and loyall.</p>
               <p>Again, wheras the Dr, (pag. 18.) did conclude <hi>that the Hierarchy being dead, must rise in another qualitie.</hi> Mr Crofton tells him (pag. 6.) <q>That if it arise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant, it must be in the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Congregational, Classical, Provincial and National Assemblies or Synods of Church officers, <hi>Communi consilio Presbyterorum</hi> (this phrase of Jerome he frequentlie useth) to debate and determine the affaires of the Church, and <hi>Exercise all acts of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>

               <p>Finally, as for the authors after cited, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the sense of the 2d article which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we say, as it is not clear (nay the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is evident) that such proposals in explication of that article, were either mad or approven by all, or the soundest Presbyterians there present, so it is als evident that if prelacy even as by them reserved, be found contrary to <hi>sound droctrine, and the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dliness,</hi> that article of exti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Doubter objects next [that we are not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the parliament of England sense, but in the sense of the Church and state of Scotland, who imposed the oath, and meant it against all sort of prelacie.] To this he answers, <hi>that it being a common league of the three Kingdoms, the meaning must be determined by all the three; and that Timorcus shews that the Parliament of England their sense mas with concnrrence of our Commissiners. Ans.</hi> 1. We have already made it good, that giving the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi> the advantage of the sense of the 2d. article which he alledges, it will notwithstanding clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our present prelacy. Timorcus telling us expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (pag. 16.) that the Covenant, <hi>aperily oblidges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which termes</hi> he sayes <hi>are lyable to no ambiguity, and particularly against all such exercise of prelacie, as is by one single person, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating to himself sole and single power in ordination and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</hi> Darre this man deny that our present pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have this legall prerogative expresly allowed them by our lawes? is not all Church government to be managed by them with advice only of such of the Clergie, as their Lordships (forsooth) shall judge loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? so that the prelacie which Timorcus and the English are for, is point blanck cross to the present hierarchie; and the three nations sense of that article will (as we have proved) never be reconciled to his sense and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this point. 2. We told him also that it is not the 2d. Art. Whereby mostly or principally our obligation against prelacy is to be measured, it being that which relates especially to England, where Prelacy was then existent; and whatever sense any there do put upon that Article, yet they never offered to put any glosses upon our great engad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement to preserve our reformation then established, and never imagned nor offered the least limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our obligations both by the National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104445:215"/>
as then particularly applyed against prelacie, and likewise our obligation in the first part and article of the League, to preserve our establisht reformation, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, which consequently stands inviolable according to its native and necessary meaning, in contradiction to our Prelacie or any Prelacie whatsoever, as he dar not deny that this Church and Nation at the imposing did understand the same.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Informer</hi> permits now his Doubter to tell him [that we are engadged <hi>to preserve the Government of the Church of Scotland,</hi> which was Presbyterian, and that therefor in the 2d. article we swear against all kinde of Prelacie, Prelacie and Presbytery being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.] To this he answers <hi>that if we are in the</hi> 1. <hi>Article bound to maintain Presbyterie, and in the 2d left at libertie for some kinde of Prelacy, and with all if Presbyterie and Prelacie be inconsistent, then we have sworne contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, viz, to admit of no kinde of Prelacie, and yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of some kinde of it. Ans.</hi> 1. He hath it yet to prove that either we or England are left to a latitude (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Genuine sense of that Article) as to any prelacy, or whatever government else is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Presbyterian Government, because, 1 the generall oblidgements [to endeavour a reformation according to the Word of God—and to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat what ever is found contrarie to sound Doctrine and the power of Godliness] will (as I have said) necessarily import, both as to us &amp; them, ane engadgement against all kind of Prelacy under this notion and upon this ground. 2. As for [Englands reserving a latitude for a proestos] which he here alledges, Timorcus will tell us (out of Doctor Sanderson) of this rule as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of promissory Oaths <q>that tho its granted that promissory imposed Oaths must be interpret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense of Imposers, as our private Oaths
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104445:216"/>
according to our sense, yet both these rules are to be limited, so that neither our private sense of our spontaneous Oaths, nor yet the sense of those who impose Oaths upon others, <hi>must be other then will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, with the just signification of the words and phrases, in the Oath, vow, or Covenant,</hi> for this were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy [saith he] the simplicity necessary to every Oath, and indeed not to interpret, but to coin ane Oath or new obligation. Now the obligation of</q> both Nations in this Oath, is <hi>to endeavour reformation according to the Word of God,</hi> and <hi>to extirpat whatever is contrary to sound Doctrine and the power of godliness.</hi> If therefore a fixt Moderator, or any supposed moderat mould of Prelacy be found contrary thereunto, no mans glossings whatsoever, can (according to this necessary rule) prejudge the native import, significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and extent of these generall clauses. In the 2d. place, his contradiction here imputed to us, is but his owne airie imagination, for it is not <hi>ad idem,</hi> and <hi>eodem modo.</hi> Wherein he imagineth the contradiction to lye. Our duty to <hi>preserve,</hi> and our obligation thereanent, being relative to <hi>the establisht Government of the Church of Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>extirpation</hi> engadged unto, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to <hi>another nation and Church,</hi> wherein that species of Prelacy particularized in the Article, was existent; so that there is no liberty left for any kinde of Prelacy in Scotland; and for Englands reserving, I have told him that what ever glosses any may put upon that 2d. article, yet if the generall clauses and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions mentioned will exclude all kinde of prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, their glosses will not comport with the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and genuin sense of the oath, and therfor are not to be admitted. Since if it can be made good from the scripture that all kinde of prelacy is unlawfull, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the divine rule, and repugnant to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104445:216"/>
of godliness, the oath doth most clearly strike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mr Crofton pag. 110. in answer to the Author whom he calls Dr Featly's ghost, objecting that in the Covenant, the Church of Scotland is set before the Church of England, tells him that it is in relation to different acts, the Reformed Religion of Scotland to be <hi>preserved,</hi> of England to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;</hi> that it is no Solecism to put the <hi>factum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>fieri,</hi> to sweare the <hi>preservation of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> before <hi>ane endeavour to obtain</hi> the same or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to prefix <hi>the pattern</hi> to that which is to be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto conformed. He adds, that his Antagonist hath little reason to grudge that Scotland should be propounded as a pattern of Reformation to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, since <hi>Beda</hi> reports that <hi>this nation did as first communicat the science of divine knowledge without grudge or envy unto the people of England,</hi> citing his Eccles. hist. gent. Ang. lib. 5. cap. 23. Hence he infers, that it is no folecisin to propound us <hi>as a pattern of Reformation,</hi> who had first obtained it, and from whom Christianity it selfe was ar first transmitted to them.</q> Here let out <hi>Informer</hi> informe himself, first, that in the sense of the English Presbyterians, [the preserving of our establisht Reformation] is that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wherin our obligation to Presbyterian government is properly included; and that the article of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation yet <hi>in fieri,</hi> relates properly to England. 2. That they state a distinction betwixt <hi>preserving</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> as distinct acts, the one relating to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Scotland already obtaind, the other to that in England yet in fieri, wherin they check this mans blunt measuring our obligation against prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie first and principally by the second article, and his denying our obligation to preserve Pretbyterian government containd in the first, and his blunt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104445:217"/>
the obligation of the two articles, to give some shadduw of his fancyed contradiction which he would fasten upon us, viz. [That we are bound against all Episcopacie in the first article, and yet the second can admit of some.] For as we have before answered, so Mr Crofton tells him here again, that the <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>objects</hi> are different. The preserving of the Reformation, government and discipline of this Church (which we see he holds to be Ptesby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian government, according to our two books of discipline, and opposit to diocesan prelacie as such) is a different act and object, from these of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating Prelacie out of the Church of England. And thirdly, that with Mr Crofton, and the English Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, it is no such paradox as this man afterwards endeavours to perswade us, <hi>that the Covenant obligeth them to Reforme England according to our pattern,</hi> which we see they hold to be the <hi>Scripture pattern.</hi> For Mr Crofton tells his Adversary that our <hi>factum</hi> was to be their <hi>Fieri,</hi> and our <hi>acquired good</hi> in point of government, the measure of <hi>their good to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind,</hi> and that the <hi>good</hi> they were to obtain (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant) was <hi>the same with ours,</hi> and tells him <hi>in terminis</hi> and expresly, that our <hi>pattern</hi> is in the first article prefixed, to which they are to be conformed.</p>
               <p>From what we have said out of Mr Crofton tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his sense of the Covenant, and the sense of the English Presbyterians, who adhere thereunto, it is evident that it strikes against all prelacy including the priority and power of diocesan Bishops and Arch-Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops; That prelacy disputed against by Gerson Bucer in his dissertations de Gub. eccl.

of Timothy and Titus, cited by Crofton, pag. 83. <hi>as unanswerable pieces.</hi> Yea all Bishops whose office and authority is such as Mr Crofton (to use his own expression) <hi>might not stand up a Peer to them in officiall power,</hi> tho a simple Presbyter; so that our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former is quite out in telling us that in their sense the Covenant is reconcilable to our prelacy, and strikes only against that of England. Again, Mr Crofton in the Analepsis, (pag. 129.) answering the charge of <hi>Ambiguity</hi> put upon that clause of <hi>[the best reformed Churches]</hi> tells the Masters of Oxford, that the sense is <hi>[in endeavouring the reformation of England, the word of God shall be our rule, and the best reformed Churches our pattern.]</hi> Wherein he clearly asserts with us, that the obligation of the Covenant, reaches the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of whatever Prelacie is found contrary to the Word of God: But so it is that the Apostolick Churches (as we shall finde Mr Crofton here assert) owned no Bishops but such as he might stand up a <hi>Peer</hi> unto, so that the Scripture rule, and by consequence the Covenant according thereunto, strikes against, and cuts of all Prelacy of Diocesian Bish: of whatever Goverment doth admitt of any Church officers, above Presbyters. And in his sense they are oblidged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Englands prelacy or hierarchy, to a compleat presbyterian parity. The Scripture makes (with Mr Crofton) the Bishop and presbyter meerly <hi>Synonima;</hi> So that no prelacy wherein a distinction is admitted, can consist with the Covenant in his judgment; nor can any glossings of men prejudge this rule, and the obligation resulting from this clause to extirpate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy foot and branch.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Informer</hi> might have seen this his notion further refuted by the Author of that peice intituled <hi>[The case of the accommodation examined, pag.</hi> 39. 40.] who shews <q>that in so farre as England had attained we might
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104445:218"/>
close with them in a particular Oath, for extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an evill discovered, and yet for a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, rest upon the more general tyes so surely cautioned, till God should give further light—so that the engadgement of both parties expresly only to extirpat that species, did no way hinder the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Presbyterian Government, and rejecting of all prelacy to be Covenanted unto under the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral provisions—That, it was aggreeable to truth and righteousness for us to concurre, with that Church convinced of evills, but not so enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened as to remedies, in Covenanting against the evills in particular, and also to endeavour a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation according to the Word of God, and by vertue of this general oblidgement, become bound to make a more exact search anent the lawfullnes or unlawfullness of things, not so fully clear in the time of entering into the Oath, and after the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to reject what seemed tolerable. So that no hesitation among them, doth hinder England and Scotlands respective obligations to extirpate all episcopacy as contrary to that doctine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to godliness.</q> What inconsistency will the Informer shew us in this, that one nation vow adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its owne establishment in point of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Church Government, and likewise vow assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of another nation in the removal of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, tho the removall will not amount to such a compleatness of reformation at first, as will be every way like unto this establishment, both nations being notwithstanding oblidged <hi>respective,</hi> under generall clauses to make this reformation compleat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Informer</hi> next tells us, <hi>that it is doubted by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whither in the first Article there be any obligation to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain presbyterian Government.</hi> His first reason is, <hi>because there is no express mention of presbyterian Government therin,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:104445:218"/>
                  <hi>but only of our reformed religion in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government. Ans.</hi> this reason of the Seasonable case which he hath borrowed, is very insignificant. Our Church, after long wrestling being recovered from corruptions both in Doctrine and Worship, which Prelates had introduced, and her Discipline and Government according to the Scripture pattern set up, in Presbyteries, synods, and Assemblies, and all the priviledges of these her courts, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and establisht both by civill and ecclesiastick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions and laws, will any doubt (but the sceptick who will dispute that snow is not white) that the discipline then reformed and establisht, is in that oath sworn to be maintained. He may als well alledge that it is not the doctrine and worship then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, which we Covenant to preserve, as to doubt of the government, since this reformation then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, takes in all the three together, and in the same sense. Besides his Master the Seasonable Casuist, grants that there was then in Scotland no such offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as are enumerate in the 2d article, but an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht reformed government was then existent. Now dare any of these new absolvers or resolvers say, that it was not Presbyterian government, or that this was not the sense of the imposers of that oath. His 2d reason is, <hi>that Independents took that Covenant, and had a hand in wording that article, that it might not import any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular forme of government.—That the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no one forme of government, but with this proviso, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> The Seasonable case said this already, to which the Apologist returned answer <q>That the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Church at that time being Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall (as he acknowledged) there could be no other government understood, then what was then existent, established and reformed. That to say</q> Indendepents understood it of their government, will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104445:219"/>
no more reflect upon the Covenant, then upon the <q>Scripture it self, which Independents do alledge will plead for their government.</q> Next, I would ask this man, why may not the same insignificant quirk be also objected as to the <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> viz. that only the doctrine and worship with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso as reformed, but not the then established do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and worship, is understood in that article, and so sectaries may lurk under this generall also. Thus he may alledge that no engadgement or oath in relation to his Majesties authority will binde, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his name and Sirname be in it, because some may entertaine a <hi>chimera</hi> of their own under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties general titles. Alas! what ridiculous conceits are these.</p>
               <p>The Doubter next objects [that the English par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who together with our Scots Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners imposed that oath, did by <hi>[the reformed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment]</hi> understand Presbytrie which was then settled here, and that therefore we are to understand the oath in their sense who imposed it, whatever Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents think.] He answers, <hi>by denying that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish parliament understood the</hi> 1. <hi>article of Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for then they would have thought themselves bound to reforme England according to our pattern, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire in anno</hi> 1647 <hi>they toid our Commissioners, that they could never finde Presbytrie necessary by any divine right, and charged them with Superciliousness in judging that there is no other lawfull Church government, but what they call so, and with misinterpreting the article anent Church government.</hi> This the Seasonable case also said before him, and this hungry casuist catches up his <hi>cibum praemansum,</hi> but could not see the answer returned to this in the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. To this I say first, that the Parliament of England tendered not that oath to us, nor is their sense therof, principally to be eyed by us, as in his mould of the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104445:219"/>
and answer, he seems to suppose. The parliaments of both Kingdomes imposed the oath upon their own subjects, framed by the consent of both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own condition, and exigence; so that we are to look mainly to the procedour and sense of our Church and state, for a discovery of the genuin sense and meaning of that oath. Now it is most evident that the designe of our Church and state in framing and imposing of this oath, was to establish and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our Church government then in being, which, he who denyes to have been Presbyterian, in its compleat formes, and courts, he may deny any thing. 2. We told him alreadie, that whatever defection or liberty of glossing any might be guilty of, yet the words and clauses of the Covenant, as to that 1. article, are clear and abundantly significant, and will admit of no evasion. And in relation to the total extirpation of prelacie out of that Church where it was existent, the 2d Article, is as clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing. And therefore whither they lookt upon themselves as oblidged to follow our pattern yea or not, we have proved that they stood oblidged, both by that particular enumeration in the 2 Article, and also in the more generall clauses mentioned, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Prelacie root and branch. This man will make a meer Proteus of oaths, if their sense and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation must vary, turne ambulatory or ambiguous, according as men do shift or turne aside. We told him of Dr Sandersons rule, anent the import of the words of an oath, in their genuin sense in reference to its obligation, whatever liberty men may take to glosse, or interpret, which is the judgement of all sound Casuists. 3. Dare he say, that ever the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England denyed, that <hi>de facto</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian government was compleatly established in the Church of Scotland, or will he make them so irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104445:220"/>
as to deny this necessary consequence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 1. Article of the Covenant doth clearly oblidge this Church to its preservation as the reformed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then existent; and if his consequence cannot but be admitted, surely whither they looked on themselves as oblidged to follow our pattern yea or not they held no sense of this article contrary to our own sense, nor denyed our obligation to maintain our esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Presbyterian Government. And besides, they never denyed their obligation to reforme the Church of England according to the <hi>Scripture pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern;</hi> and that <hi>of the best reformed Churches,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to that pattern. And that the Church of Scotland, and other Churches where Presbyterian Government was existent, were such, was and is the sense and acknowledgement of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches themselves, as from their confessions we have made appear.</p>
               <p>For confirming this further (because the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath told us frequently of MrCrofton) let us heare how he will bespeak him in this point. In that piece intituled [The fastening of S Peters Fetters pag. 40.] He tells the Oxford men <q>of the Church of Scotlands Philadelphian purity—in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in writting, and excercising in practice that sincere manner of Government whereby men are made partakers of salvation, acknowledged by Mr Brightman on Apocalyps 3. and the Apology to the Doctors of Oxford, and of Beza's epistle 79 to Mr <hi>Knox,</hi> exhorting him to hold fast that <hi>pure Discipline</hi> which he had brought into Scotland, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>the Doctrine.</hi> And (pag. 41.) he cites the <hi>corpus confess.</hi> (pag. 6.) Where the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor layes down this as the ground of that Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches purity of doctrine, and 54 years unity without Schisme [that the Discipline of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104445:220"/>
as it is prescribed in the word of God, was by litle and litle received, and according to that Discipline, the Government of the Church disposed so near as might be] which he prayes may be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually kept by the King &amp; Rulers of the church.</q> These English Non-conformists, Beza, the Author of the syntagma, in Croftons sense, and himself together with them, thus clearly avouching Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which Mr Knox introduced, to have been the government of this Church since the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and which King Iames also owned. For after he hath told us in the same page <q>of Arundel, Hutton, and Matthews, three English Arch-Bishops, their approving the order of the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he tells the same Oxford men of the joy which King James profest in the assembly 1590 <hi>that he was born to be a King of the sincerest Church in the world.</hi> Again (pag: 39.) he makes mention of this Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches two books of discipline, as the great badge and Test of her government; and in answere to the Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford mens exception against that article of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which binds to preserve the discipline and government of the Church of Scotland [viz. that they were not concerned in, and had litle knowledge of that government] he tells them, that he wonders how an university conversing in all books, could profess they had no knowledge of these books.</q> So that in Mr Crostons sense and in the sense of the Presbyterian covenanters in England, the government engadged unto in that article, is that platforme of Presbyterian government contained in these 2 books of discipline, which adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do grant to comprehend an intire frame of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government.</p>
               <p>Again (pag. 141.) he gathers from the tenor of the Kings coronation oath at Scone, <q>that the royall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104445:221"/>
assent was given unto Presbyterian government <hi>in pursuance of the obligation of the solemne league and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and that, in his Majesties most publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as King of great Britain, France and Ireland, for himself and Successors: and asserting clearly the equity of the obligation, he asks the learned in law [whither the royall assent by such expressions publickly made knowne (as here it was unto acts and ordinances of parliament in his other dominions to be past here anent) be not sufficient to make an act of parliament a perfect and compleat law by the</q> equity of the <hi>statute</hi> 33. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. 21. &amp;c.] So that Mr Crofton clearly asserts our obligation to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian government to be contained in the Covenant, and to reach all his Majesties dominions. For he tells us in the preceeding page, <q>that to all such as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the constitution of England to be <hi>Merum imperium,</hi> wherein the King hath <hi>supremam Majesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> it is evident that his Majesties ratifying the Covenant thus, hath <hi>rendred it nationall.</hi> Again Timorcus (pag. 70.) asserts that the parliament who imposed the Covenant (anno 1648.) sent proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</q> to the King wherein was demanded <hi>the utter abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of episcopacie.</hi> Which is point blanck cross to the character of that piece obtruded by the <hi>Informer,</hi> and doth evidently demonstrat (compared with these passages of Mr Crofton) that the whole body of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian covenanters in England, both imposers and takers, parliament and people, understood that article of Presbyterian government.</p>
               <p>The Doubter here poorly grants [that England and Scotland did not understand that article in the same sense, but alledgeth that since our Church understood it of <hi>Presbytry,</hi> we are bound to it in that sense.] Upon this he assumes, <hi>That it will not follow that we are bound to it in the sense of our Church and state, but rather that in</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104445:221"/>
                  <hi>relation to government it is with out sense, since the imposers themselves were not aggreed as to its meaning. Ans.</hi> we have already made it good, both from the sense and scope of the national Covenant, the judicial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and application of it to our former prelacie expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ie, the nations universall taking it so, and the authorizing thereof both by King and parliament, as well as by the recommendation of the assembly, from the total extirpation of prelacy, and setting up Presbyterian government in all its courts, in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hereof, that that article of the solemne league which relates to the preservation of the then existent Reformation in doctrine, worship, discipline, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, cannot without extreme impudence be distorted to any other sense, then a preservation of the Presbyterian government then existent. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the league being framed and entered into by us, for our further security in relation to what we had attained. And this being the article framed by the Church and state of Scotland at that time, and this being also their scope and designe, discovered in their treaties with England, when that Covenant was entered into, I dare appeal this mans conscience upon it, whither ever any demurre here anent, or any other sense of this article, was offered by the English when the nations first entered into this oath? or whither, the imposers thereof in Scotland, would have engaged in that league with the English, upon any other termes then these, and in this their sense of that 1. article. Thinks the <hi>Informer</hi> that if any such thing had been muttered in the first transaction of this business, that the English did not look upon the Presbyterian government as the reformed government of this Church, that the Scots nation would have transacted with whem in this league? Nay, when (as Timorcus tells us) it was debated branch by branch,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104445:222"/>
phrase by phrase in the convention house, in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the assembly of divines, was there ever such a notion as this of our <hi>Informer</hi> started, that by the reformed government of the Church of Scotland, Presbyterian government was not to be understood? in a word, dare he deny that the godly conscientious Ministers and people of England, did in the sense of this oath, and even in imitation of the Scottish, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture patterne, plead for, and had begun to set up Presbyterian government, and are closs to their principles to this day.</p>
               <p>But he adds, <hi>that it is irrationall to say we are bound to it in the sense of the Church and State of Scotland, because they were but a part of the Imposers and the least Part. Ans.</hi> I told him already that in relation to the engadgers in Scotland they were <hi>the proper imposers,</hi> the authority of the respective rulers of both nations, in relation, to their own subjects being first and immediately to be lookt unto, and their sense &amp; scope therein to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eyed, and each Nation being properly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly judges, as to their own <hi>national end</hi> in this sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. Thinks this man, that the then represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of Church and State, did eye any other end as to Scotland, then the preservation of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Doctrine, Discipline, Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as at that time therein establisht. Moreover, the sense and scope of the article it self being convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclusive of Presbyterian Government, it can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no other glosse without manifest distortion, and frustration of the imposers designe therein. Next he tells us, <hi>that suppose Presbytery were meant in the</hi> 1 <hi>Article, yet the 2d will admitt some episcopacie.</hi> What poor stuffe is this. Suppose the Article of extirpation relating only to England and Ireland, would comport with some episcopacie (which the Informer hath not yet proved) what hath that to do with Scotland?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104445:222"/>
Or how can that enervate our engadgement to preserve the reformation as then establisht in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Discipline, and Government? Because in relation to the extirpating of Englands Prelacy after the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Scotland is compleated and sworn to, we are to bear with the English Church in some remaines of Prelacy, till God give further light, must we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for be oblidged or allowed according to the sense and scope of this Oath to corrupt or raze the Fabrick of that establisht reformation, and bring in again prelacy into that Church out of which it had been totally era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate? Nay, this is too dull inadvertancie. As for what he adds <hi>that Presbytery is not inconsistent with any kinde of prelacie.</hi> I answer that the presbytery establisht and sworn to be maintained in Scotland, is, and Beza is so farre from disowning this, that (as we heard) he exhorteth John Knox to keep that Church and house of God clean of prelacy, as he loved the simplicity of the Gospel.</p>

                  <p>The grounds, upon which the <hi>Informer</hi> undertakes to prove that the obligation of the Covenant ceaseth, although its oblidging force for the time past were supposed, examined at large.

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:104445:223"/>
OUR <hi>Informer</hi> having spent his Master pieces, and the cheife products of his invention, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those who have gone before him, upon this difficult task of reconciling the Covenant to Prelacy, doth next (as a liberall bold disputer) undertake to loose the Covenant, even upon supposall of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent obligation against it. And therefore mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Doubter tell him [that he bears off the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of anyobligation against episcopacie, either in the national, or solemne league, lest he fall under the charge of perjurie]. In answer to this <hi>he will suppose that episcopacy is abjured in both Covenants, and yet undertake to defend that they arenot perjured who now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to prelacie.</hi> The Doubter thinks this strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so do I. Because [to swear against episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie and yet acknowledge it is to do contrary to their Oath.] To this doubt he returns a large resolution, but still follows up the Seasonable case closs, for fear of miscarrying. And first, he begins with a threefold partition, <hi>either prelacy</hi> (saith he) <hi>is an unalterable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Government of divine or Apostolick warrand, or it is sinfull and contrary to the Apostolick Government, or thirdly of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nature, neither commanded nor forbidden, but left to Christian prudence as found expedient to be used or not.</hi> Here I must stope him a little, and minde the reader, that we did upon the first Dialogue, disprove this indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Proteus-Prelacie, as a monster to Scripture, since the Scripture condescending so far as to its institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of officers, ordinances, Lawes, censures; and (as we heard himself acknowledge) setting down all substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls of Church Government, prelacie must of necessity be either consonant or dissonant therunto, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence necessary or finfull, commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. So that he is to be limited to the first two, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104445:223"/>
any supposal anent the indifferencie of presacy, is but his <hi>petitio prnicipii;</hi> and the gratification of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for further clearing of this question: now proceed we. <hi>If it be the Apostolick Government derived from their times to all ages of the Church, he hopes we will grant that no Oath oblidges against it.</hi> This I willingly grant to him, but what then? Why, <hi>we must not cry out perjurie till what he hath offered on this head be solidly answered.</hi> Let this bargaine stand, I hope I have made his Scripturae pretences, appear to be vaine, and proven the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of that prelacie now established, both to the Scripture and pure antiquity, and till he hath answered what is offered upon this point, we may impute perjury to him by his own acknowledgment. What next, what if it be sinfull? Then he sayes <hi>we need not plead the Covenant obligation.</hi> No? may we not plead the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant obligation against Schisme, heresie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanness? May not the Oath of alledgance be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against treason, because before this Oath treason is a sin? Said he not already that the Baptismall vow is a superadded obligation, though the matter it self doth binde? did not the Oath and Covenant (Neh. 8.) containe an abjuration of many sins, against which the people stood before preoblidged? But he adds, <hi>its true a supervenient Oath makes the obligation the stronger.</hi> Right, why then may not we plead that which makes it stronger? Especially against this man and his fellows, who have such a mighty faculty of resolving and absolving all <hi>S Peters fetters.</hi> Sure they had need of Double nets who would catch a Proteus. Then he tell us, <hi>That the ablest champions for Presbytrie dar not assert episcopacie to be unlawfull.</hi> What champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are these that prove it to be contrary to Scripture, and yet dar not assert it to be unlawfull? Sure they are very faint disputants. We heard that Beza (whom our Informer will sure call a <hi>champion for Presbytery)</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104445:224"/>

                     </gap>olicall and the egg out of which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist was hatched.</hi> Was not that near the march of calling it unlawfull? But how will he now absolve us? Why, <hi>it must be indifferent, neither lawfull nor unlawful,</hi> and then the question is with him, <hi>if we could by our own Oath, make it absolutely and in every case unlawfull, so that we can never after submit unto it.</hi> He adds, <hi>that we are mistaken if we think that an Oath against a thing indifferent will in every case bind.</hi> Here I shall only tell him that since all his resolving skill goes upon this supposition, he should have travelled to <hi>Utopia</hi> with this resolution, since we do suppose and have proven Prelacie to be unlawfull, and so are not in the least concerned in what he saith upon this point: Since he is still arguing <hi>ex ignoratione elenchi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us see how he will absolve us upon this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which he must in pity be gratified with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can draw forth his weapons. Our <hi>Informer</hi> still stricks hand, with the Seasonable case and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer, telling us first, <hi>that the oath ceases to bind, if the thing sworn against, be a matter wherein our superiours have power to command us, they by their authority given them of God, may require obedience of us in any thing lawfull, and so may in that particular, command us to do or use what we have sworn against, it being a thing in it self lawfull, and in this case our oath ceases to binde. Ans.</hi> this simple notion, by our <hi>Informer</hi> poorly propounded hath no taste in it, and cannot reach our case, even though he had won over that insuperable mountain of the unlawfullness of prelacy, and had proven, or his adversary had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, to be indifferent, for 1. his supposition runs thus. <hi>That episcopacy is indifferent to be used in the Church or not as it shall be found expedient.</hi> Now, I beseech him, who is the <hi>proper judge,</hi> what frame of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment best sutes her condition? is not the Church representative, to whom is intrusted the power of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104445:224"/>
the keys? by what warrand will he bring in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate <hi>primo instanti</hi> to alter and set up Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he thinks fit, even granting it were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? he sought at first but a grant that prelacy was indifferent, but ere he can produce one reason for his point, he must have a further grant of <hi>Erastianisme,</hi> and that the Magistrate is the proper competent immediat judge in matters ecclesiastick. Who can stope the mouth of this hungry cause of his, that must have multiplied concessions of the adversary, and yet cannot subsist, but starves with its own weakness when all is done. For 2dly, although this were also gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what will he say in this case, wherein the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour hath bound and engadged himselfe with the same Oaths, vows, and bonds that the subject is tyed with, and hath solemnly vowed to God against such a frame of Government? Sure this will tye up his hands if we may beleeve the maxime asserted by Dr Sanderson and other Casuists that <hi>juramentum tollit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem</hi> even in a thing indifferent. Had we not the ratification of the Nationall Covenant with the band and explication against the Scots Prelacie, in plain Parliament by King Charles the first, under his hand writing 1641? Did not the King who now is in the Year 1650 and—51, swear and subscribe both this oath, and the solemn league and Covenant, and gave all imaginable assurances for upholding Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government, and in opposition to Prelacy? suppose he had power to command in this matter, sure his commanding power is tyed up, when he hath vowed and Open'd his mouth unto God, and lifted up his hand to the most high, <hi>That Prelacy shall never be allow'd within his dominions,</hi> far less commanded. Whatever power God hath given to Magistrates over their subjects, sure he hath given them no power to loose themselves from his oath and vow upon them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104445:225"/>
is. Thirdly, it is too laxe a principle, to hold <hi>that in every thing, in it self indifferent, the Magistrates power reaches to supercede or loose, the obligation of an oath or vow of the subject.</hi> For a subjects <hi>freedome and liberty,</hi> as in that capacity, and <hi>the Magistrats authority,</hi> being coordinate, as the subjects liberty must not justle with the Magistrat's lawfull Command, suited to the ends of government, so neither must the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Magistrate incroach upon this reserved liberty of the subject, who hath many things in his own power and without the reach of any lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Migistrate. A <hi>Subject,</hi> and a <hi>slave,</hi> are quite distinct things. God restrained &amp; set bounds to the power of Kings, and Magistrates whom he set over his people, so that they might not command such and such things. Therefor in what things soever, the exercise of a subjects liberty, crosses not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe and end of the Magistrates power exprest in Scripture, his vow is without the reach of the Magistrates suspending or loosing power. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both would not give Ahab his Vineyard, no not for money. What if a man in a parentall capacity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose a vow as to his childe in reference to some occupation or inheritance, which are supposed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s vow, to be things indifferent? Sure the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates suspending power will not reach this vow. This will be clear, if it be considered, That the preservation of the Subjectes liberty, is one of the great ends of the Magistates Authority.</p>
               <p>The Second case wherein the <hi>Informer</hi> tellsus, that ane Oath in things indifferent binds no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>is when the thing sworn is so altered in its nature, that it becomes sinfull and cannot be lawfully performed.</hi> He tells us that Casuists say, That <hi>cessat juramenti obligatio cum res non permanent in eodem statu Ans.</hi> This other case generally byhim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded here, shall be considered &amp; spoken to, when we shall see how hereafter he explaines and applyes it.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104445:225"/>
Therefore we shall in this place dismiss it with one word, That Prelacy is now the same, and worse thn formerly, And therfor the premised maxime cannot reach his Conclusion in the least.</p>
               <p>His Third case wherein he tells us, that the Oath in things indifferent ceaseth to bind, <hi>is, when it is impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditivum majoris boni, which he sayes the Seasonable case and the survey of Naphtali, do apply to this Oath.</hi> And how he applyes it we shall after hear, He tells us, they do prove; <hi>that supposing Episcopacie lawfull, though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

And that he solidly repells what is brought by the Apologie or Naphtali to the contrary.</hi> But how insignificantly either he, or these new Casuists, do loose the Covenant upon this Pretence, hath already in part, and shall yet further appear.</p>
               <p>What a laxe Adiaphorist is this, who by his new divinity, first takes this great duty of <hi>vowing</hi> or <hi>swearing</hi> quite away; For, no Oaths must be pleaded in things necessary, in this man's judgment, They canno in things that are sinfull or unlawfull have place, and so all the subject thereof must be things lawfull; and for this, there needs no more to make all Oaths and vows evanish, but a command from the superiour, and then they are gone. Secondly, he makes the Magistrat's posteriour and supervenient command, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>only loose all his subjects from the obligation of what is lawfully sworn, but also himself from his personall Oath: Though he hath sworn and vowed never so deeply, he hath no more to do but to make a Law against it, and then the Oath, as <hi>impeditivum boni,</hi> ceasethto bind either himselfe or his subjects. Thirdly, he makes all the reserved liberty of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (which Government is for preservation of) a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104445:226"/>
meer nullity and <hi>Chimaera,</hi> so as this liberty it selfe, or any vow or Oath in things which are properly within it's sphere, evanishes at every arbitrary command of the powers. Hence a subjects liberty resolves into a meer nothing or slavery. Fourthly, thus the Judgement of all Churches in Brittain and Ireland under this Oath, must in relation to the expediency of this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed lawfull Episcopacy, and its present suitableness to her edification, be at the meer beck of this arbitrary command of the civill power, as the sole and proper judge of this matter. And so.</p>
               <p>First, the Magistrate is not only the <hi>immediatjudge of all ecclesiastick Government,</hi> or what is most suitable to the Churches State and edification in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But 2dly, <hi>all judgement of discretion is taken away from the people of God,</hi> in relation to this matter of so high importance, and their acting in faith conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in this supposed obedience. So that men are made absolutly Lords over their <hi>consciences. Yea 3dly,</hi> all regard to the <hi>eshewing the offence of the weak,</hi> and the Scripture Rules in relation to their scandal, and stumbling, are made void; the meer command of the powers determining that matter, in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Informer. Yea Moreover, all our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian libetry in things indifferent,</hi> which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his precious blood, and which we are commanded so much to hold fast, is close swallowed up, so that both judgement &amp; practise, in matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath given a liberty, are tyed unto, and only regulable by, the arbitrary command of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: And what monstruous absurdities these are, the meanest capacity may judge.</p>
               <p>As for what he adds here, <hi>that an Oath about matters not sinfull, is alwayes to be understood with this restriction, [so long as lawfully</hi> I <hi>may] which the matter thereof requires, because the taker is under prior and greater obligations (viz</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:104445:226"/>
                  <hi>obedience to his superiour and the like) then that of the Oath in a thing indifferent, and therefor when the prior obligation crosseth this latter of the Oath, its obligation must cease. Ans.</hi> This prior obligation the <hi>Informer</hi> makes rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Magistrats command interposing, which according to his laxe and unrestricted supposalls, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes all Oaths no stronger then a threed touched with the fire, and when applyed to our case, is utterly impertinent, because; first, there are things in their own nature indifferent, yet within the sphere of the subjects reserved liberty; and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not within the reach of any lawfull command of the Magistrat, nor of any anterior obligation, to that of the Oath by further consequence; and that the matters in debate are not such, he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 2ly, The Magistrate himselfe hath by his own Oath (in this case) superseded and tyed up any right of commanding, which the <hi>Informer</hi> may suppose he had. 3ly, upon both these grounds, the performance of this great engadgement, can never justle with any lawfull command of the Magistrat. And by further Consequence, 4ly, There is no greater or prior obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in this case lying upon the Swearer, from the Magistrat's right, to breake or cut short the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this vow. All which is yet further convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear, if it be considered, that this great supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the lawfulnes or Indifferency of Prelacy</hi> (which is the grand Topick bearing the weight of his Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is but begged by him, and as an almes, given by his Adversary. But the contrariety of Episcopacy to the Scripture, which we have alreadie proved, being once supposed, it followes, that there is an obligation Prior to all Oaths, lying both upon King and subjects for it's Extirpation, but which is much more strengthened by the Supervenient Oaths and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ws of God upon them, for this great end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104445:227"/>
The <hi>Informer</hi> adds further, <hi>that our obligation to our Superiours, is Gods tye—our Oath a knot of our own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and that when two duties at once seeme to require per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and we cannot get them both satisfyed, the lesser should give way to the greater. Ans.</hi> 1. The same God who hath enjoyn'd obedience to Rulers, hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the subjects liberty, and Christian liberty, and by his authority salv'd and authorized Oaths and vows which are within the compass of that reserv'd li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, so the last knot is of Gods casting as well as the first. And such Alexander-like absolvers or Cutters as our <hi>Informer</hi> and his fellowes, will find that they are hewing at divine cords, when the curse due to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury shall enter into their houses and soules, if they repent not. 2ly, Hence in this case and question under debate, our obedience to the Magistrat (especially upon our true supposition of the unlawfullness of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and of the Oath against it, lying upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat himself) is sinfull; and so the comparison is betwixt <hi>duty, and sin,</hi> not a <hi>greater and lesser duty,</hi> which this man must grant is ever to be preferred. And besides, the <hi>Informers</hi> supposition, <hi>that this Oath is a meer voluntary deed of our own,</hi> which had so full a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Magistrates Authority, is among the rest of his <hi>gratis supposita</hi> and Beggings of the question, which we must send back to him with a lash, untill it be return'd with a due Testimonall of better proof then of his <hi>Ipse dixit.</hi> 3ly, Even upon <hi>his own supposition,</hi> Dr Sanderson will tell him, that any law made against an Oath, which is but spontaneous, if the law be alternative, to obey or suffer, the Oath will bind against <hi>the active part,</hi> and oblige not to obey the power in that supervenient command or Law, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary even to the privat spontaneous Oath, <hi>de Iur Promis. Prel. Sect.</hi> 9. But <hi>a fortiori</hi> much more will this oblige not to obey that Law, if the Oath be not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104445:227"/>
only spontaneous, but hath been fortifyed by the Legislative power, yea and vow of the Superior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who Pretends to loose it by his after-Law. 4ly, Whereas he alledges, <hi>Gods putting us under the commands of the powers in this case,</hi> and his freind Dr Burnet in this Argument, tells us that [our Oath being a voluntary deed of our own (as he <hi>gratis</hi> supposeth with the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)</hi> cannot prejudge the commands of our superiours, which are Gods own immediat commands.] They should know (as Timorcus long since <hi>Informed</hi> them Chap. 6. sect. 35.) That the Topick of this Argument being, <hi>The dominion of the superiour over the Inferiour,</hi> if the command or Law be the exercise of a dominion in things wherin he hath no dominion, the Oath will bind against such lawes. This man and his fellows are still talking of the prior obligation of obedience to the Magistrat, but they must know that the Magistrats dominion in this point must be instructed by a Patent from God the supreme Legislator, before we can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. And if our Oath interferre with the exercise of a dominion which is without its due sphere, sure it interferres with no prior obligation which God hath lay'd upon us. Even Azorius (Mor. Quest. l. 11. cap. 6.) will tell him, that an Oath will bind <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra mores jure civili institutos,</hi> if the divine Law be in any thing crossed thereby. Nay, Casuists, even such as Abbas, Silvester, Azorius, Molina, Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Leyman, Sanohes, Swares, do grant. That an Oath will bind against any civill Law, if it oblige <hi>ad paenam non ad culpam necessario,</hi> to punishment, and not necessarly to sin. And further most of them admit the binding force of Oaths against the Laws or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of superiours, <hi>ubi materia legibus opposita sine pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato fieri potest,</hi> where the matter of the Oath, which is contrary to the lawes, may be performed without sin it being <hi>non contra jus naturale aut divinum,</hi> that is, not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104445:228"/>
against the Law of nature or the divine Law. See Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morcus ubi supra. 5ly, Even putting episcopacie in the category of things indifferent, this Oaths obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it, will countervaile &amp; oversway our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to obey the Magistrate, and submit to his laws, In such a case, wherin it is found <hi>inexpedient for the Church,</hi> and particularlie <hi>for this Church,</hi> as by its apparent dreadfull effects is evident; such as the desolation and wasting of this Church, the spreading of poperie and Arminianism, the Casting out of many of the godlie Ministry, the fixed division therin, the endless Confusions and broiles, and therby the wide door opened to all Popish invasions &amp;c. For since the Magistrats simple Command cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what Government is expedient or inexpedient for the Church, this must be supposed that <hi>Prelacie is best,</hi> before the Command can be, so much as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Lawfull,</hi> els the Magistrat may injoyne an Hundred Oaths this year in such and such things as he calls expedient, and null them all the next year, though himself be engadged therin, upon pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency of the Matter, because of occurring circumstances, which will make mad work of Oaths, and hang them all at the Magistrats <hi>sic volo sic jubeo,</hi> as to their obligation. Its true that the greater duty (as is clear Math. 9. 13.) counter-balances the less, but I Pray, shall <hi>the meer will and Command of the power,</hi> determine the greater dutie? and be the sole and supreme rule to determine the Conscience, as to the expediency of a thing <hi>hic &amp; nunc.</hi> And though (as he sayes) every positive precept oblidge not <hi>ad Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Yet he must acknowledge, first, that <hi>it oblidges sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and though not as to <hi>the act,</hi> yet as to <hi>the eshewing the Contrary therof.</hi> And Secondly, to <hi>act semper,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when Gods command superseds it, as to other duties in their seasons. So that till he clear this in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104445:228"/>
point of prelacie, and that the renouncing of our Covenant, and presbyterian Government at the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats Command, is in our case the greatest duty, this rule makes against him.</p>
               <p>The Doubter, as to his first rule, anent the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of superiours interveening, objects, <q>that its hard to say that mans authority can loose the Oath of God, since in this Case we must say, that we have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our mouth unto God, and cannot go back]. To this he answers.</q> 1. <hi>That the law of God in the 5th Command layes the first and Primarie obligation upon us to obey our superiours, which Command we cannot bind up our selves from obeying. Ans.</hi> 1. the same God who gave that Command, did by the third Command oblidge both superiours and inferiours, to be a ware of <hi>taking his name in vain,</hi> and therfor not to presume to break their Oaths and vows in any Lawfull matter, unlesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>such Cases as himself the blest and supreme Lawgiver, excepts; which he hath not yet letten us see as to this Oath, wherin both superiours and inferiours have entered, and therby oblidged themselves to God against what he pleads for. So that Gods reserved Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, and Dominion, which (to use his own argument against him) is the primarie and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall tye, upon which this 5. Command is bottomed, and according to which our obedience therto must be Regulat, will cut short the obedience to the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in this case, wherin we cannot obey him in the Lord, and without violating our fealty and allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to the God of Gods, and wronging his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prem dominion. 2ly, In this same 5. Command, God hath limited the Power of superiours, and tied them under many bonds of duties to their subjects or inferiours, which, in none of their Commands they must trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and if they do, their Commands oblidge not Inferiours to obey. Now, that this Loosing the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104445:229"/>
of these Oaths is in our case an encroachment upon the subjects right and reserved Libertie, as well as christian Libertie, and an encroachment upon Gods sovereign right, is above Cleared. Next he sayes, <hi>this were a way to frustrat the superiour of all obedience, and every man might pretend,</hi> I <hi>have sworn against such a thing commanded, therfor</hi> I <hi>cannot do it. Thus privat persons might prelimit themselves from obeying in everie thing. Ans.</hi> in our case there is no such hazard, for the superiour hath prelimit Himself by <hi>his own oath,</hi> and this will not prelimit him upon such a pretence, from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in any thing that is Lawfull, or which falls within the Compass of his Power As a Magistrate and is suitable to the great ends of his Power, to say, that he cannot Arbitrarly loose people from a Lawfull Oath, sworn also by himself. But on the contrary, this pretended Informer his doctrine herein prelimtes and cuts short Subjects Libertie, and Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and Libertie of Conscience, subjecting it, and all Gods rules theranent, all scripture Rules of <hi>Expediency</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> and all Oaths and vows superadded to matters subordinat to these ends, unto the Magistrats arbitrary disposal and laws, which is a prelimitation equally if not more dangerous.</p>
               <p>Our Informer in the next place for proof of this his doctrine, sends the Doubter to <hi>Numb.</hi> 30: <hi>where</hi> (he sayes) <hi>the husband or parent is vested with a Power to null and make void the vow of the wife or daughter, and by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the King, who is Pater patriae, hath the same autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Ans.</hi> it will be a harder task then this man can well mannage to bring in the King here within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the <hi>father</hi> and <hi>husbands right,</hi> as to this absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power. For first, <hi>the Magistrats Power</hi> is far different from the <hi>Marital</hi> and <hi>Parental,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt King and subject is nothing so strait, as betwixt husband and wife, parent and Children, the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104445:229"/>
one being <hi>natural,</hi> the other <hi>Political,</hi> the one chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, the other not. A man may chuse to Live under what Magistrat he pleases, but the woman cannot cast off her husband, nor the Child shake off his relation and dutie to the father. Besides, subjects set up their Magistrats and Limite them: But so it is not as to the <hi>Marital</hi> and <hi>Parental</hi> relations. The husbands authority flows not from the wife her <hi>dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor the parents from the Children. So that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel argument can hardly be drawen from the Power of husbands and parents, supposed in this text, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Oaths and vows of the Children and wife, to that of the Magistrat in relation to his subjects. 2ly, in the beginning of that Chap. the Lords way of Laying down this great Sanction touching vows, seems to exclude the Magistrat from this absolving Power. For after the propounding of the Law touching the keeping of voluntary Oaths and vows, viz. <hi>that the person vowing shall not break nor profane his Word as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew signifies, but do according to all that Proceeds out of his mouth.</hi> 1. The Case of the wife and the Daughter not foris-familiat, is <hi>Gods great and only exception</hi> (exprest in the Text) from his own rule, and Law, touching the strick observation of voluntarie Lawfull vows. So that, the rule and Law seems to reach <hi>all other Cases,</hi> as to free vows, except only this. 2ly, in the Beginning of the Chap. we find that Moses spoke this to the <hi>Rulers and heads of the tribes,</hi> but the text is silent as to his apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this exception anent the father and husbands Power in absolving vows, <hi>unto these heads &amp; Rulers,</hi> which should have been especially intimat to them. Hence it may be probaby Concluded that the Rule and Law touching the observation of vows, stands fast in all other Cases except these here expresly excluded, by the Great Lawgiver. So that ere his argument can reach us, he most give in Sufficient proof that the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104445:230"/>
Magistrat stands vested with this Power, and falls within the Compass of this exception, in relation to his subjects. Not to detain him here in tasking him to prove, that this Judicial statute, as others of the like nature, doth belong unto the Christian Chùrch. But in the second place, Granting that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat is here meant, it will never speak home to his Point, but much against him, for 1. the dominion of the Superiour being the ground of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, wherin the husband and Parent have Power, if the matter of our vow be found such as is excepted from the Magistrats dominion, the Informer must grant that this text will not reach our Case. And supposing the matter, antecedaneously unto the vow, to fall under divine Commands, this is evident beyond exception. But because he beggs our concession, that it was before indifferent, I adde, if it be within the Limits of our reserved Libertie as free subjects, or of our Christian Libertie, its still on both grounds, beyond the reach of his dominion, and consequently excluded from this exception, and the vow must stand and oblidge according to the Grand precept here set down; so that a hundred discharges of the Magistrat will never touch it.</p>
               <p>We heard him acknowledge, that <hi>by [discipline of this Church] in the nationall Covenant, the substantialls of Government is understood,</hi> and that consequently it binds therunto; So he must acknowledge that our solemn Covenant will inviolably bind to this divine Frame of Government, &amp; no earthlie power can loose therfrom, no more then from <hi>Scripture institutions.</hi> And Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Featlie acknowledgeth <hi>that people may Covenant, without their Superiours, to fulfill Gods Law.</hi> Now, give us all Scripture Church officers, and their Rules of Government, &amp; Prelacie shall be quickly gone, So that upon his concession that the national or solemn league
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104445:230"/>
do reach the substantialls of Government, or what is necessary for the ends of Government set down in Scripture, it will amount to that which we plead for; and he must grant it falls not under the Magistrats Dominion, and that his argument from this text is lost. 2dly, this dissent which looses the vow, must be both <hi>ane open dissent,</hi> and also <hi>presentlie</hi> in the verie day he heares of it. <hi>Qui sero se noluisse significat putan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus est aliquando voluisse.</hi> That is, he that declares a late dissent, may be presumed sometimes to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his consent, saith <hi>Dr Sand. de jur. prom.</hi> This he cannot say as to our King. 3ly, It most <hi>be constant,</hi> the dissent suspending, but not loosing the obligation. The oblidging vertue being naturall, and inseparable to the vow (as Dr Sand. tells us <hi>de jur. prom. pag.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.) when ever the consent comes, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion returns. Now have not our King and Rulers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto, and ratefied all our vows both in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and solemn league and Covenant? 4ly, This consent of the superiour once given, can never he <hi>retracted by a dissent again.</hi> Whither it be before or after, he can never make it void, as the Text doth clearlie hold out. See Sand. 16. Prel. 7. Sect. 6. Now have not both the nationall and solemn League, the Consent &amp; vows of all our superiours ratifying the same. So that this text every way pleads for the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof; for this their consent, once given, they can never revoke, far less their Oath and vows, but the vows of the inferiours, are thereby rendered for ever valid; as Casuists in setting down these rules doe grant, so Aquinas, Filucius (Tract. 25 cap. 9.) Azor. (Moral. inst. lib. 11. cap. 10.) Sanches (lib. 3. Cap. 9.) Amesius (cas. lib. 4. cap. 22. Quest. 11.) Sand. (Juram. Prom. Prel. 4. Sect. 16.) But the Doubter objecting [this consent and ratification of our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, which therefore they cannot make void.]
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104445:231"/>
He answers, <hi>that by comparing the</hi> 12. <hi>and</hi> 15. <hi>verses it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that after the husband hath by silence confirm'd his wifes vow, yet he hath a power of voiding it again, and she is exonered of her vow, and bound to obey her husbands Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Ans.</hi> Although this were granted (as the Text stands in clear contradiction to it) that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might null the vow, after he hath confirmed it by a silence or tacit confirmation, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that his nulling power will hold, after he hath given not onlie a formall consent positive, but also solemnlie vowed and bound his soule to the Lord, in the same vow, which is most evidentlie our case. Have we not the solemn vows, subscriptions and Oaths of both King and Rulers, concurring with the vows of the subjects in this case? How then shall they loose <hi>their own vows.</hi> 2ly, this wilde gloss is expresly cross to Dr Sanderson, and other Casuists, their sense of this case and text as we heard, who hold that if once the superiour hath either tacitly or expressly, precedaniously or subsequently consented, he can never by his dissent again either discharge from the Oath or (so much as) suspend the obligation of it. Dr. Sand. saith (16. Prel. 7. Sect. 6.) its a true rule, <hi>quod se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel placuit amplius displicere non debet,</hi> what once in this case hath pleas'd the superiour, ought never to displease; Gods Word declaring it established for ever. If he hath consented (saith the Dr) either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, be can never afterwards take away its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation. 3. He makes the text contradict it self, for (ver. 7.) upon the husbands tacit consent, and holding his peace in the day he heard his wifes vow, the Lord declares that <hi>her vow shall stand,</hi> &amp; <hi>the bond whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith she bound her soule shall stand.</hi> And (vers. 14.) The husbands holding his Peace, <hi>establishes her vows</hi> and <hi>confirms them.</hi> Now then, God having declaire that the vow stands, is confirmd, and established as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104445:231"/>
                  <hi>soule-bond upon their soules,</hi> by this consent tacit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse how shall it be null, <hi>and not stand,</hi> by ane after dissent? Sure <hi>[to stand]</hi> is here opposed unto <hi>[not to stand]</hi> upon the termes of the <hi>present open dissent in the day he heard of it,</hi> which is the onlie exception. That which God declares to be confirmed, and to stand, upon the father or husbands consent, admits of no nulling afterward by them; but so it is, that the wife or daughters vow upon the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and ratefication, stands and is confirmed, as a <hi>soule-bond:</hi> ergo, it admits of no loosing by ane after dissent. I prove the major two wayes, 1. <hi>standing and Confirming</hi> here are opposed, to <hi>nulling and making void.</hi> And 2ly, this would make more Limitations then God makes, as to the Loosing of the vow; for there is no exception but that one, <hi>of the husbands open dissent, or the parents, in the day he hearts of it.</hi> This is the onlie exception from the rule in the 2d vers. anent the binding of the vow. But this mans gloss brings in another limitation cross to the very scope and express sense of the words viz. <hi>the husbands dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, after he hath by a previous consent ratefied the vow.</hi> That God admits the vow to stand, upon this express or tacit consent, is evident in the text.</p>
               <p>As for the reason which he adds, viz. <hi>That the wife is under a prior obligation to obey her husband;</hi> it is absurd and ridiculous, for will he carve ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> ane obligation in this point beyond what God hath so expresly limit and declard. This were to give the husband a power, not over the wife onlie, but over God himself, and his express declarator. As for that clause (ver. 15.) <hi>that if he shall any wayes make them void, after he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquitie.</hi> What a wilde inference is it, from hence to conclude ane absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power, in express contradiction to the text, and the limitations previoussie set down. To say that the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104445:232"/>
vow cannot be loosed, unless the father or husband <hi>declare his dissent in the day he heares of it,</hi> And that <hi>if he hold his peace he hath confirmed it, and the bond and vow shall stand;</hi> And yet that after all this, <hi>he may loose it by ane after dissent,</hi> is so plain a contradiction, that none can be plainer. If we will make the text then consistent with it self, the plain meaning is, that he shall bear her iniquitie, or the guilt which otherwise would have Iven upon the wife or daughter, if not hindered in the performance. That the guilt and punishment of the non-performance shall ly upon him who hindered the same, doth clearlie import the non-performance of it self to be a guilt (which contradicts his pleading and argument.) But the poor votarie being hindered, it lyes upon the hinderer as I said. So that we strongly inferr from this, the binding force of the vow, since the Lord terms the non-performance a guilt: as violent men hindring Ministers to preach, shall bear their guilt and punishment, which otherwise they were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto if neglecting this great work. All do know, what these Scripture-Phrases of bearing his judgement, bearing his iniquitie, being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Other mens sins, do import. Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this answer. His comments upon this phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se are verie vain [first he shall bear her sin (saith he) if a guilt] what is that? bear a guilt, if a guilt, sure <hi>a repugnantia in adjecto.</hi> His next gloss ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the husband <hi>ane expiator of the guilt because she did her dutie in obeying him, who revoked-his Confirmation upon just grounds.</hi> What, upon just grounds contrary to Gods command? this is ane odd exposition. Doth God give the least warrand here to absolve and null the vow, after it is ratefied by his previous consent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Poole in his annotations renders thus the sense of this 15. verse [after he hath heard them &amp;c.]
<q>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:104445:232"/>
and approved them by his silence from day to day, if now after that time spent, he shall upon further thoughts dislike and hinder it, <hi>which he ought not to do.</hi> Her non-performance of her vow shall be</q> imputed to him, not to her: Where, as he doth clearly assert (with us) that <hi>her iniquity,</hi> mention'd in the close of the verse, is the iniquity of the non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the vow, which is imputed unto the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, so, <hi>that he ought not to hinder</hi> the votarie, or stop this performance after that he hath confirmed the vow by silence; in plain contradiction to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers phantastick glosses and inferences. Wherin altho he pretend a concurrence of Interpreters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this verse of the husbands Lawfull voiding of the wifes vows after his previous confirmation, yet he hath produced none of their names.</p>
               <p>The Doubter enquires next how he applies his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rule, <hi>anent things sworn their not abiding in the same state, to the Covenant.</hi> He answers, <hi>that upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Prelacie is Lawfull, and abjured in that Oath, the great change now is, that Prelats are again Established, and submission to them commanded. So that we are now bound to obey authoritie herin, and not to keep the Oath.</hi> And this is verie sutable to his large absolving glosses, which we have alreadie heard and refuted, and which is Likewise removed by what we have said, anent the <hi>matter</hi> of this vow, which is not capable of any such absolving trade as is now set up. These mens pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giary faith and divinitie, makes all vows no stronger then straws. Though the Magistrats and subjects universallie vow, yet a Law (if the matter be not absolutlie necessarie, though never so expedient and edifying) makes it <hi>ipso facto</hi> null and void. If he had letten us see any greater good, expediencie, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie <hi>of prelacie,</hi> then <hi>in keeping this vow,</hi> he had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104445:233"/>
spoken to the purpose. But this neither he nor any of his party will ever do.</p>
               <p>In a word this lax rule as here interpret by him, will inferr many absurdities, as 1. that the meer Law looses the obligation of the vow and Oath, though the matter therof falls not under the dominion of the Ruler. Which, 2ly, it doth not if it be either expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or necessarie, and yet the meer Law (with him) robs it either of expediency or necessity. And thus, 3dly, mans law stepps up above the divine Law, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing the matter of the Oath upon the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned grounds. 4ly, He makes the expediency of the Law, and its being wholsome or no, cognoscible by no anterior or superiour Rule, but its self, and the meer will and power of the Magistrate, and to be obeyed upon that sole ground. 5ly, hence the <hi>obedience</hi> therof <hi>in faith,</hi> is excluded, and no acts of obedience can flow from spirituall knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Doubter next objects [that his Oath against Bishops had the first obligation, and therfor he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loosed by the after Law.] To which he ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, <hi>that the 5th. command, and submission to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man, had the first obligation, and that obedience to authoritie comes under the baptismall vow—that to say our Oath will oblidge against the Magistrats Command to the Contrary, will elude the express precept Ecl.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>to obey the kings command in regard of the Oath of God Ans.</hi> This is nothing but what we have heard, repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions <hi>ad nauseam,</hi> and still <hi>idem per idem.</hi> Our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the 3d command, <hi>not to take Gods name in vain,</hi> and to keep and stand to all Lawfull Oaths, and vows, unless in cases which God himself excepts, is surly a verie arlie, and a baptismall obligation, prior to any Law of the Magistrat, and such as no authoritie and Laws of men can evacuatand enervat; and our obedience <hi>to the ordinance of man,</hi> or the higher and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104445:234"/>
Lower Powers, <hi>being for the Lords sake,</hi> that is upon the motive of his authoritie, doth infer, that we must not dare to cross his authority, under pretence of obedience to the powers, in breaking lawfull Oaths and vows which he has commanded us to keep. Sure no Laws of men can supersed this obligation. That the Oath under debate is such, hath been already made good, and needs not be here repeated. As for that of Eccl. 8. 20. It makes clearlie against him; the English annotations having upon that text, mentioned the mutuall tye, oath, and Covenants betwixt King and subject, instancing 1. Chron. 11. 3. do tell us <q>that this is not only ane enforcement of the duty of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but likewise, that the clause contains a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, by which our obedience to men <hi>is bounded:</hi> And thus they sense the precept, <hi>keep the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>yet so that thou do not violat thine Oath and obedience due unto God. Our service to the one</hi> (say they) <hi>must be such as will consist with our fealty to the other. We are bound to God and his service by Oath and Covenant, and no subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat obedience to others, must make us forget our duty to him.</hi> Which clearlie crosses this <hi>Miss-Informers</hi> scope who would perswade to perjurie and breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, upon pretence of fealty to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat.</p>
               <p>Mr Poole in his annotations having told us <q>That the first branch of the verse is not to be understood universally, but of such commands as do not crosse the commands of God, expones <hi>this Oath of God</hi> mentioned in the second part of it, either of the Oath we are under to keepe all Gods Laws, or the subordinat Oath of fealty and allegiance. But adds, that this also may be understood, and is by learned Interpreters taken, as <hi>a limitation of their obedience to Kings,</hi> the words being thus rendred, as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew (faith he) will very well bear, <hi>but according</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:104445:235"/>
                     <hi>to the Word of the Oath of God,</hi> obey the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, with this caution that they be agreeable and not contrary to the Laws of God, which thou art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by thy own and thy parents Oaths oft renewed, to observe in the first place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for what he adds (out of the grand case) <hi>anent Iesuites Oath in Rome to preach in England Catholick doctrine, and of a Law made in England against the same.</hi> It is, so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bablie impertinent and unsuteable to the point, that I wonder at the mans confidence in presenting to the world such poor trifling fopperies in so weightie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Dare he say that the matter of our vows, which our Rulers themselves have taken, is in any measure like to this. Nay, doth he not suppose the <hi>Matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> of this Oath to be <hi>Lawfull,</hi> he must then confess this instance to be most impertinent. But the knack is, <hi>That abstracting from the unlawfullness of the Matter, it was declair'd, that ane Oath cannot bind against a Law, although the Law be made even after the Oath is taken.</hi> This was no doubt a lax determination, And such as he dare no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of a high rate.</p>
               <p>Come we now to his third case, <hi>anent the Oath hindring a greater good, then the performance it ill amount to and the dissolution therof upon that ground.</hi> This the Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thinks [will furnish people with a readie excuse to free themselves of Oaths, by alledging that some gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater good is hindered thereby.] To this he answeres 1. <hi>That Casuists admit this rule with these limitations viz. when</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:104445:235"/>
                  <hi>that greater good is certain, and no otherwise attainable, but by the discharge of our Oath, and a good to which we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged before we took the Oath. Ans.</hi> We shall not much contend about these rules &amp; limitations of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime <hi>in thesi,</hi> or in the generall, only I shall adde some more limitations here. That 1. This greater, certain, &amp; no otherwise attainable good, must be such, <hi>not in our apprehension only, but according to the Rule of the Word,</hi> for otherwise we are just where we were as to the hazard of perjurie, if every mans [thinks so], or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats [arbitrarie Laws] shall be the only Rule to determine this, as this <hi>Informer</hi> makes all resolve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto which he pretends in this case, in relation to that greater good, which he offers in breaking this Oath. Hence Gregorius Sayrus (clav. reg. l. 5. cap. 8. n. 15.) having determined that every man hath a power to commute ane oath for something better, is opposed by Silvester and others, who say, that the Pope must determine the good to be better. So ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Consequent to their Principles are even Papists in this point. And must not Protestants be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to refuse this limitation, that the Scripture (with us the onlie, and supreme rule) must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this greater good. Next, Timorcus will tell him, that the Oath thus irritat, <hi>must be onlie made to God, for if it be to our brother, and for his advantage, we must have his consent as necessarie towards the commutation.</hi> This he tells us, is agreed upon by Casuists, as well as the other limitations. To these we adde Dr. Sand. rule <hi>(de jur. prom. Prel.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.) that, <hi>precise ob hoc quod videtur impeditivum majoris boni, obligandi vim non amittit.</hi> Id est, <hi>That the Oath loseth not its obliging force, meerly because it seems the bindrance of a greater good,</hi> unless other circumstances also concurr (as usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie <q>there do) which either evince it unlawfull, or not oblidging. His reason is because in all cases
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104445:236"/>
it is not true that everie one is oblidged to do what is best, he means, <hi>simpliciter,</hi> and abstracting from the present circumstances) since this would open a flood-gate for all manner of perjury.</q> As for that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation (presented with an <hi>especially</hi> as the main one) anent the Oaths hindering the greater good, <hi>to which we were preoblidged,</hi> which this man foists in, to make way for his nauseating repetition, anent <hi>the Magistrats power,</hi> it may be alledged that it is not consistent with it self: for if we stood Preobliged to this greater good, it renders the Oath <hi>ab initio</hi> null, for the same cause on which it is loosed upon the prospect of that greater good. The greater obligation (as he sayes) still overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the lesser, &amp; ane Oath in prejudice of a greater obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and contradictorie therto, can lay on no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, for so we might be under contradictorie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations according to his way of reasoning about the Magistrats power. [I will have mercie and not sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice] is one of his illustrating instances. So that the obligation of the Oath, according to his reasoning in this matter, was like unto this inverted rule, viz. Sacrifice and not mercie, and being such <hi>ab initio,</hi> it could not bind. I know (as Dr Sand. saith) that which is abstractedly and <hi>simplicer</hi> a greater good, may <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and in such a complex case become the lesser, <hi>consideratis considerandis</hi> all circumstances taken in. But this he admits not, for he adds unto the known rule anent the greater and certain good in its time and circumstances, that other limitation anent the vower his being preobliged unto it, which can no otherwise be understood then in opposition to the obligation of the vow, unless this his added limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be redundant, or non-sense.</p>
               <p>But 2dly, let us come to the assumption, what is that greater good, attainable in breaking this Oath and vow rather then in keeping it. This he tells us is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104445:236"/>
                  <hi>obedience to authority</hi> (that's the <hi>panacea</hi> curing allwounds the universall topick, and <hi>primum mobile) avoiding of Schisme, Ministers serving God, in the work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to which they are called; these</hi> he sayes <hi>are greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goods then adhering to the Oath in a thing indifferent</hi> Then he adds, <hi>that Ministers should consider, whither is be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to lay aside their Oath, then their Ministerie. (Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie ane Oath about a thing indifferent) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitat, or do that which by consequence incapacitates them for the Ministerie—that Ministers think that by their Oath they are obliged not to continue in their stations, as matters now stand, and yet divines hold that the lesser duty gives place to the greater, as David did eat the shew bread rather then starve, Paul and those with him, did cast their goods into the sea &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Answer</hi> to this, we need not much enlarge, it being nothing but what is upon the matter already objected and answered. 1. If the Oath, for its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contain important duties falling under divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and unalterable obligations, if Prelacie be contrary unto divine prescriptions in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; the disowning of it consequently be a standing necessarie duty (which we do suppose and have proved, and he cannot disprove) then this man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will grant that all this tatle about <hi>the greater good in breaking the Oath,</hi> is to no purpose. 2ly, say prelacie were but indifferent, yet upon the supposall of <hi>the greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediencie</hi> of Presbyterian Government for this Church then Prelacie, and upon the certain supposition of all <hi>the Rulers engadgement in this Oath</hi> and vow to God against it, (the first of which suppositions he hath not disproved, and the 2d he cannot deny) it is certain, that both Rulers and Ruled their keeping the Oath, is a far greater &amp; more certain good, then their breaking it. 3ly, let Dr Sand. limitation here again come in viz. <q>That the Oath is not precisely loosed because it seems to contradict a greater good, unless Other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104445:237"/>
do also occurr, which either evince it to be <hi>unlawfull,</hi> or not oblidging, and that its not true that in everie case we are <hi>bound</hi> to do what is</q> best, that is unless <hi>omnibus pens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>is,</hi> and <hi>caeteris Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> all circumstances duelie pondered, it be found best; and then the Question is whither it were best for Rulers or ruled to keep this Oath for these great ends which he mentions, than to break it. Whither it be a greater good to keep a Lawfull Oath, though I suffer under authoritie levelling against it, or break it to please men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or whither I shall chuse the evill of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or sinning? (for he hath not yet proved that the interposing of the Rulers meer Law or authoritie, will make this Oath unlawfull, &amp; we have shewed that Casuists mantain the Contrary.) Whither peace with God be a greater good in keeping his Covenant, then peace with men and with the world in breaking it? This Question was soon resolved with Elias. The children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant—and I onlie am left &amp;c. 4ly, This greater good, he acknowledges must be such, <hi>as is no Otherwise att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>inable then by breaking the Oath.</hi> Hence the Question will be, <hi>whither the Gospel might not have been preached, schisme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, and God served in the Ministerie of the word, by keeping this Oath and Covenant with him?</hi> This man will come to a great height of impudence if he deny this. Nay, if he deny that this good might have been thus beter obtain'd. He alledges we have now a great Schisme by Presbyterian Ministers departing from their party, and he will not deny that many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preachers are Laid aside, the Magistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> is displeas'd and disobeyed, all filled with confusion and disorder, poperie like to creep in &amp;c. Now, had not all this been eshewed by keeping our Covenant with God? The gospel had been preached by Presbyterian Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rs, and he will not deny that all his party of Conformists
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104445:237"/>
too, had keeped their ownstations, this schisme had been avoided, and the Magistrat obeyed while commanding for God. So that this rule everie way makes against him. And in stead of obtaining <hi>a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good</hi> by breach of Covenant, we have lost the greatest good, <hi>the gospel and peace with God,</hi> and incurred much sin and miserie.</p>
               <p>I know he will say that he speaks upon the suposal of the Rulers disowning the Oath, and Establishing prelacie. But then I urge him thus, 1. Since he cannot but grant that the keeping of the Oath, or holding fast Presbyterian government, would have had the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned advantages following upon it, shall the meer pleasure of the Rulers cast the ballance, and disprove its native tendencie <hi>sua natura</hi> towards the formentioned effects? the matter of the Oath is still of it self, or of its own nature, more productive of these good effects; &amp; Consequently the keeping is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to breaking of it, which is attended with evils counterballancing these apparent good effects, which he imagins to attend this breach. 2ly, if the Oath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be commuted or changed, but for <hi>a greater good,</hi> and all these good effects mentioned, might have been <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; more certainlie attaind,</hi> by keeping then breaking it, then the Rulers commuting the Oath, or altering or breaking of it, he must acknowledge to be sinfull <hi>upon his own ground.</hi> Since they might have attaind these good effects of obedience, preaching the gospel, and unity, by keeping this Oath, and might have more surelie and better eshewed the forementioned evils then by breaking it. And then, let him in the third place seriously Consider, whither the Rulers sin in commutting or breaking this Oath, for neither a greater, nor more certain good, will warrand my breaking of the Oath to follow them in that sinfull course; and loose me from my obligation. 4ly, It will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104445:238"/>
hence follow, that he playes the petty sophister here, in calling disobedience to the Magistrat, in this one point of a sinfull command in relation to this Oath, (which on the formentioned grounds is proved Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) <hi>a disobeying of authoritie.</hi> For he dare not say that <hi>disobeying a sinfull command</hi> can come under this chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. And the true state of this Question is not, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a greater good, to obey the Magistrat or keep ane oath? but whither it is a greater good in this particular to obey him, in Embracing abjur'd Prelacie, or to stand to the Oath; and the issue of this is, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be best for the Church of Scotland to have or want Prelats? which, from what is said is soon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. 5ly, What if these <hi>pretended good issues,</hi> be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaild by <hi>greater evills:</hi> such as persecution of many thousands, godlie faithfull Ministers and Professors, laying waste Gods heritage, Blood, miserie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, schisme, (the godlie adherers to this Oath, being without all question this Pure Church) famine of the word &amp;c. Nay, according to Dr Sand. rule mentioned, where is the <hi>Relaxation of all parties</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged in Covenant one with another, as well as with God? were not the Churches of both nations nay in all the three Kingdoms, engadged to one another in this Oath? now thinks he not that this prospect <hi>of a greater good in breaking this oath,</hi> should have been laid to the eye of the representative Church in the three Kingdoms, in order to the change of government. And should not all parties engadged in this Covenant, have dispensed with it, and with one another in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of this greater good, and for obtaining this better government? thinks he that such a great question as this: <hi>What is this greater good in point of Church Government?</hi> And that other Question. <hi>Whither such great and solemn Oaths may be laid aside in order to the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it?</hi> Are Finally decided by <hi>the Magistrats Law</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:104445:238"/>
without the least owning <hi>the Church representative?</hi> and besides, he dare not say that all are bound to obey the Magistrat in all things indifferent. Is not <hi>subjection</hi> (by the acknowledgement of most, and even of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the surveyer) different from <hi>active obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, as for what he sayes of Ministers, the Apologist told him, and his master the Seasonable case, and I do tell him again, that God calls no man to preach the gospel by such ane unlawfull meane as perjurie and breach of Covenant, and that in this case Ministers suffering for truth, is a Confirmation of the gospel Phil. 1. 12. That in deserting and not preaching, they are meerly passive: being persecute for their integritie; so the charge and guilt of not preaching lyes upon their persecutors. Besides, the state of the question in truth, and in our principles importing a competition betwixt <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>suffering,</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>sin,</hi> not a <hi>lesser</hi> and <hi>greater duty,</hi> the folly and impertinency of his instance, anent <hi>the lesser duty over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the greater</hi> (exemplified by that, I <hi>will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not sacrifice,</hi> repeated here <hi>ad nauseam)</hi> as also that instance of Paul and those with him, their casting their goods in the sea &amp;c, is most evident. The sin and perjurie of this course of conformitie, being our principle, which he cannot disprove, even though we should grant all his pleading here (which goes but upon a begged supposition of prelacies indifferencie, and the indifferencie of the matter of the Covenant) what a flat folly is it, to tell us of <hi>preferring greater to lesser duties?</hi> wheras with us the question and case is, anent Ministers duty when <hi>the Magistrat refuseth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to preach, but upon sinfull terms;</hi> which one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration makes all his tatle here evanish in wind. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Rulers of a land discharge all preaching, but upon the terms that Ministers should commit some horrid act of wickedness, would this man admit any to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104445:239"/>
plead as he doth for doing evill that good may come of it, and to tell what a weightie duty it is to preach the gospel, and that the lesser duty of forbearing that evill commanded, is overruld by the greater obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preach, &amp;c. Well, he and his partie (like the pharisaik teachers, twixt whom and us he insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuats a comparison) are sure blind Informers and leaders, and may be set to learn better (thou that teachest another teachest thou not self;) For they have vented such principles anent sacred Oaths, as some heathens would be ashamed of, and which bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes all faith out of the world. For what he adds anent the Rechabites, when he shal equiparat the matter of their vow, a thing meerly civil, relating to their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from wine, and the manner of their dwelling, with the weighty and great duties of a Covenant with God, for publick and personal reformation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prove that hazart will equally plead for the laying aside of the last, as in some cases it may warrand a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing with some part of the first, the parallel shall be admitted, but till then, it must pass among the rest of the Informers <hi>gratis dicta.</hi> The <hi>Dutch annot.</hi> (on Jer. 35. 7.) Shew that <hi>Ionadab probably put this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgment on his posterity, upon his foresight (by a prophetick spirit) of the judgments and desolations to come upon Israel, in order to their inoffensive walk, and for inuring them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simony.</hi> And as for their dwelling at Jerusalem in case of hazard they shew (on. 11. V.) <q>that the Rechabits, laid aside in this <hi>one</hi> thing their fathers command, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was but a humane ordinance, which in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law of God, they might in some cases wave, <hi>which was also Ionadabs intention, and acceptable to God.</hi> And that in giving this account to the prophet of their practise in reference to their dwelling now at Jerusalem upon the Assyrians invasion, they do shew that their fathers charge, and their vow was not to be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104445:239"/>
extended to this case.</q> So that in their sense there was no breach of the vow properly and strictly taken, but onely the laying aside of a part of a humane ordinance, in case of extreme hazart, and this according to the nature and designe of the vow it self, and the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution therof.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The <hi>Informers</hi> answers to our Argument for the Covenant obligation, taken from <hi>the Oath to the Gibeonites,</hi> and <hi>Zedikiahs Oath to the King of Babylon,</hi> weighed. Upon the first argument after a foolish traverse about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy of the Oath to the Law of God, he yeelds the cause in granting that the Oath <hi>did oblige the first takers, and their posterity.</hi> Upon the second he begs the question and admits its chief scope and nerves. Likewise his answer to Psalm. 15. 4. His reflection on the Assembly 1638, and his argument offered by way of retortion anent our owning of Comissaries though abjur'd in the Covenant, largly scanned.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus we have seen into what a fascination and labyrinth of absurd inconsistent notions this new proctor hath involved himself, while endeavouring to loose these sacred bonds of our solemn vows and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with God, and that he hath run cross to the scripture, to Cafuists, yea to himself, in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. We shal now proceed to examine what strength is in the remnant of his reasonings upon this head;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104445:240"/>
And how he acquits himself in his answers to some pregnant passages of scripture pleaded for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The first that follows in this dialogue is that remarkable transaction of Joshua and Israel with the Gibeonites, largly and unanswerably pressed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven by such as have written for theCovenant; which this man thought he could not for very shame passe over; but sure he had better done so, then to have made such a pitifull and superficiall return. Well, let us hear it.</p>
               <p>The Doubter now assaults him as to this notion anent the greater good in quiting the Oath, with that instance of the Oath to the Gibeonites, [whom God had commanded to make no peace with, but enjyond Israel to root them out, to whom Josua and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might have said, Gods command Looses us from our Oath, and it will hinder a greater good, yet in that particular they rather dispensed with Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, then with their Oath; the acceptablness wherof to God, appeard in his punishing Saul a long time after for killing these Gibeonites, to whose predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Joshua &amp; the princes had suorn.] In answer to this, he runs out a great length anent that transaction, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe this argument. Which I shall now examine.</p>
               <p>But before I enter upon this, I would premise two things, first, that this trifling <hi>Informer</hi> hath so moulded our argument from this text as quite to divert it from its true channel and scope, which is <hi>to prove the oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging force of ane Oath or Covenant (Lawful upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) both upon the takers, and their posterity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of many circumstantiall sinfull aberrations from the divine rule, in the manner of entring into it.</hi> As is most evident in this instance as I shal after shew. And this man could not be ignorant, that this text is thus Improven by Timorcus and Others, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the Covenant, and this argument, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104445:240"/>
improvement of the text which he presents, is but a man of straw of his ownupsetting. Secondly, that we are not concerned in order to the evincing the premised truth for the proof wherof we adduce this text, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorly to determine this question, <hi>whither this Oath did contradict Gods positive Law, and how far any piece or circumstances of the divine precepts anent the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Cannanites, making no leagues with them, justles with this Covenant and Oath, and are found over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by its oblgation:</hi> for our argument stands good and intire, tho we abstract from any positive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in this point. So that in tracing our Informers extravagant discourse in answer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his own moulding, we shal rather disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the slippery grounds he walks upon, and the inconsistencies wherin he is involved by his answers, and confident assertion of the Oaths conformity to the divine Law, then positively to resolve and determine any thing in this debate, which this man hath no less ridiculously handled, then impertinently brought in. But to the point.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>he wonders that we make use of this argument to prove the obligation of our Oath against Bishops.</hi> But sure it is ane argument verie Sutable, if ane Oath into which Joshua and all Israel were cheated, ane Oath to heathens, and which had at Least-wise a verie appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent inconsistencie with Gods command, to root out these Canaanites, and not to pitie or spare them, is found so highly obligatorie, and even binding the posterity, how much more the nations Covenanting with God, and with one another for publick and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall reformation. But he sayes, <hi>That we mistake this place.</hi> Why so? <hi>First, if we think Ioshua was forbidden upon any termes to make a Covenant with these Canaanites, but to root them all out, and yet because of this Oath spared them, then</hi> (he sayes) <hi>we run in a most wild and gross opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:104445:241"/>
Severe censure! why so, what is that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? <hi>that ane Oath</hi> (saith he) <hi>can bind against a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, whither it be a morall or particular Command, its all one. So that as we said before, that ane Oath can bind against commands of men in authority, now we go a greater length, in making them bind againste Commands of God.</hi> But I answer, first, that there was a command of God to cut off these Canaanites, without pitying or sparing them, I hope he will not deny, and if he do, it is easie to be produced, Exo. 23. 32, 33. Exo. 34. 12. Deut. 7. 2. Nay more, Gods command herein was so peremptory, that where he appointed his people to tender peace to other cities, before they proceeded to destroy them, there is ane exception made (as Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son observes upon Joshua 9. 7.) of the cities of Canaan Deut. 20. 15, 16. <hi>thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the Cities of these nations. But of the cities of the People which the Lord thy God hath given thee for ane inheritance, thou shall save alive nothing that breatheth.</hi> To this place Jackson points us to clear this matter. 2ly, Its as evident that these Gibeonites had their saftie from this Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For upon this we have the judgement of all the princes of the congregation, (Josh. 9. 19.) in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that question about their saftie, <hi>we have sworn unto them by the Lord, therfor we may not touch them, because of the Oath which we sware unto them.</hi> Yea more, when many hundered yeares after, the injury of Saul is mentioned in slaying them, the ground of their right to Live and dwell among the Lords people, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the other Canaanites, is attributed expresly and solely to this Oath; 2. Sam. 21. 2. <hi>Now the Gibeonites were not of Israel but of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn unto them, and Saul sought to slay them, wherfor David said what shall</hi> I <hi>do for yow.</hi> Now the command being so express to cutt them off, and upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104445:241"/>
the other hand, their saftie being first and last attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted so clearlie to the Oath, that which this man calls <hi>a wilde and gross opinion,</hi> he must either impute to the Scripture-account of this matter, or resolve and accommodat this difficulty, which he is (in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures authority) oblidged unto as well as we. 3ly, that which he calls <hi>a wilde and gross opinion,</hi> is the Judgement of Learnd Divines, particularly of Jackson, who upon the twenty vers. of that 9 of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua, having moved this objection, <hi>that what the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sware was against the express command of God, who had often enjoind to destroy all these Canaanites.</hi> Returns this answer. <hi>That though one Oath or vow doth not bind men for doing of any thing that is absolutely unlawfull, yet in this case it was not so, because the charge which God gave for slaying the inhabitants of the Land, was a particular command, and so far only to bind their consciences, as it might be obeyed without any breach of the morall Law, as in Rahabs case it is also evident. But, here they could not obey that command of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their destroying all the Inhabitants of Canaan, without perjurie, which is against the Law and light of nature—</hi>he adds, <hi>that their perjurie would have given great occasion to the enemies of Gods people to blaspheme—So that</hi> (saith he) <hi>there lay a strong bond upon the consciences of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, though they were deluded by the Gibeonites.</hi> Now I think the account of this difficulty exhibit unto us here by this learnd divine, may make him ashamed of his assertion in this point, &amp; we may retort his objected ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie thus, if the morall Laws obligation in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perjurie, stood against and counter-ballanced a particular command of God in this matter, much more will the force and obligation of ane Oath, in a matter of far greater importance, stand good against any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Laws and statutes of men. And if even Gods positive Particular command, could in this case
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104445:242"/>
gound no dispensation with their Oath, but God would rather dispense with the particular command, than with it, how much more absurd must he be, who pretends a dispensation with, and a nulling of, such selemn Sacred Oaths and vows to God as we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in such weighty matters, upon the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commands of men, especially men under the same Oaths themselves.</p>
               <p>In the premised distinction of Mr Jackson, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former might have discovered the folly of his bold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restricted assertion; <hi>no Oath can bind against a comand, no not a particular command.</hi> For Jackson distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes (which this man admits yea and positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts) betwixt that which is <hi>simply and absolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and that which is unlawful only <hi>upon the ground of a particular positive precept,</hi> which in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiat cases may-come to justle with the absolutly binding moral Law, as in the instances adduced by the Informer himself is evident.</p>
               <p>4Ly, His own rule anent <hi>the lesser obligation over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the greater or Prior,</hi> will plead for this, and his instances, of <hi>Mercie and not Sacrifice,</hi> of Paul and those with him, <hi>their casting the goods into the sea, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids eating the shew-bread to keep from starving,</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the answers above set down. For here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar positive precepts, are overruled by the greater and Prior morall obligations of the 6th Command anent self Preservation. What absurditie then is there in this assertion, that the great morall precept of <hi>Not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods name in vain,</hi> did over-rule a particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive precept? Doth he not here see Gods great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Commands (in the premised instances) binding against lesser positive precepts. And when he saith <hi>that whither the command be morall or particular which the Oath binds against, all is one as to his fancied absurditie,</hi> he discovers ignorance, and inconsistency with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104445:242"/>
for in all his formentioned instances, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precepts do overrule positive, particular and lesser precepts. And why shall not also the great morall command anent <hi>not taking Gods name in vain,</hi> over-rule that positive and particular precept anent the staying of these Gibeonites, and far more our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vows, the present statutes of men. Sure, he will never be reconciled with himself here, or assigne a disparity. Hence Iackson having said that the bond of this Oath lay strongly upon the consciences of the Israelites to observe it, though they were deluded by these Gibeonites, addeth <hi>that in this the Rule holds good, I will have mercie and not Sacrifice,</hi> and from his own argument concludes that which he here denyes. So that this case of the Gibeonites (according to Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons solution of this difficulty, and that sense of this scripture followed by him and Other learned divines) strongly repells his rule, from the hindrance of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good to loose the Covenant, especially since this greater good doth with him still resolve into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of mens Laws. Had not the Israelites this ground more strongly to plead against the keeping of their Oath to these Gibeonits, since not only they were cheated into it <hi>(and dolus aufert consensnm</hi> say Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists) but it seemd to hinder a farr greater good viz, the obeying of Gods express command to root them out; yet Joshua &amp; the Princes knew not this new knack for loosing Oaths. But the interposing the sacred name of God in ane Oath, was with them so weighty a matter, that it overruled all these pretences.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen how he acquits himself as to his first charge of [a mistake of this place] and that what he calls <hi>a gross and wilde opinion,</hi> is the sense of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture embraced by learnd divines and consonant to his own pleading; so that in this charge he discovers too bold ignorance. What more hath he to say? he tells
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104445:243"/>
us 2ly, <hi>that we are mistaken if we thank, that Ioshua had no warrand to make peace with any of the Canaanites, but was commanded without once treating with them, to root them all out: because in Deut.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>he is commanded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim peace indefinitly to any citie he came to fight with, the Canaanites not excepted. Ans.</hi> How can this man say that the Canaanites are not excepted, from that offer of peace there injoyned, when as he doth not so much as offer to answer to these pregnant circumstances of the text, pleaded by Iackson and Others to prove the contrary. For, after the Lord hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to proclaim peace to a city before they assau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <q>it, there is (verse 15.) <hi>a limitation.</hi> Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee,</q> which are not of the cities of these nations (viz: who were devoted to destruction) therfor in the 16. vers. after the Lord hath thus ridd marches, as to the Canaanites they get this precept, <hi>But of the cities of these people which the Lord thy God doth give thee for ane inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth.</hi> Can any restriction and exception be more peremptory? and that we may know, who these are who are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from mercy, and from these offers of peace mentioned, the 17. ver. clears it. <hi>But thou shalt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroy them, namely the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizites, the Hivites and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busites, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.</hi> This additional motive <hi>of Gods command</hi> is here remarkably inserted; which is the more remarkable if compared with the 2. of Sam. 21. 2. <hi>The Gibeonites were not of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael but of the Amorites, and the Children of Israel had sworn to them.</hi> When the spirit of God, is reminding us of this story in pointing at Sauls guilt, we are first told that they were <hi>of the Amorites,</hi> a people devoted to destruction by Gods command, but excepted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104445:243"/>
from the rest that were destroyed, upon the ground of this Oath, and upon this ground solely.</p>
               <p>Jackson upon this passage, holds <q>that the offer of peace, is not to be understood of any city of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan upon these grounds, first, because they were expresly charged utterly to destroy the inhabitants of Canaan, to the end they might dwell in their room and might not be ensnard by their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among them; and secondly, we do not read that ever Joshua tendered peace to any of the cities, tho it be mentioned as a strange thing, and a signe of Gods hardning their hearts, that never any of those people, did of their own accord crave peace, save the Gibeonites Josh. 11. 19.—Yet we never find that there was peace profered them, and it seems that the Gibeontes did therefore seek it by craft, because Otherwise they saw it would not be granted them; and 3dly, it is expresly noted as a fault in the Israelites, Judges 1. 28. <hi>that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</hi> Hence he concludes, that this is only to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of such cities as they should besiege that were not of the land of Canaan. And upon the 15. vers. <hi>Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations,</hi> He adds, but these must neither have peace offered them, nor must their women and little ones and cattell be spared when their cities are taken by force; for the following reason (saith he) doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly exclude them from both these favours (citing</q> vers. 18.) <hi>That they teach you not to do after all their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations &amp;c.</hi> Sure it had become this Magisteriall <hi>Informer</hi> to ponder these reasons ere he had obtruded upon us his bold and inconsiderate assertions in this point. The <hi>Dutch Annot:</hi> on this 15. vers. expresly assert <q>that the cities of the Land of Canaan are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104445:244"/>
from offers of peace, because the Lord had commanded them to be banned (that is devoted to destruction) as is related in the sequel. <hi>Mr Poole</hi> upon this 10. vers. asserts that this seems to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not of the cities of the Canaanites, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from vers. 16, 17, 18. who were under <hi>ane absolute sentence of utter destruction,</hi> Ex. 23. 32, 33. Deut 7. 1, 2. Whence they are blam'd that made any peace or league with them, Judges 2. 2. but of the cities either of other nations who injur'd or disturbed them, or commenced war against them, or aided their enemies, or oppressed their friends and allies or of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselves, if they were guilty or abettors of Idolatry or apostacy from God, or of sedition or rebellion against authority, or of giving protection and defence to capital offenders. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gen. 14. Judges 20. 2. Sam. 20. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish annot. upon this 10. vers. do also assert that this offer of peace is not to be understood of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Canaan, for they were to be more severly dealt withal vers. 16, 17. and for shewing them more favour Israel is blam'd Judg. 1. 28. but of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without the land of promise vers 15.</q> So that our Informer is here runnig crosse to the plain sense &amp; scope of the text, and the current of Interpreters.</p>
               <p>But he adds, <hi>that there was a difference betwixt these Canaanites and the nations a far off in relation to this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of peace to them. First, it was to be upon the termes of relinquishing their idolatry, yeelding up their Lands, and becoming servants. That therfor leagues with them are forbidden, they reserving their heathnish worship.</hi> But where will he shew us this restriction, or difference in Scripture? <hi>non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit.</hi> We have seen Gods peremptory precepts to cut them off, to save alive none that breatheth of these excepted cities and nations. We find also peremptory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104445:244"/>
to make no leagues with them, no not for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill commerce, as they might with other heathens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, Exo. 23. 32, 33.<hi>—thou shalt make no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them—they shall not dwell in thy land, as</hi> these Gibeonites were permitted; so Exo. 34. 12. Deut. 7. 2 we have the same precepts renewed. Now, where is this exception, as to these leagues? it lyes upon him as the affirmer to prove and instruct this limitation, which he here affirms, out of the text. God who gives the law must himself also give the exception. And this man must be charged with malapert intruding into what he hath not seen, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to put in his exceptions, unless he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them, which yet he hath not done. I confess God who is above the Law might allow an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in certain cases, especially such as this anent their Oath, but looking to his own precept we find no such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from it. 2ly; he sayes, <hi>there was this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them and other nations, that if they refused peace, they were to be worse dealt with then any other city that was not of the Canaanites, because (Deut.</hi> 20. 16, 17.) <hi>in ease of their refusal, nothing was to be saved alive while, other cities were but to lose the lives of the Males only. vers.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15. Now, the violence which he offers here unto the text, is obvious to any that but reads it. For after that (ver. 10.) the lord hath laid down this Law in generall, anent their proclaiming peace to a city before they assault it, and showen (in the 11. ver.) That if the city yeeld, they shall be tributaries—(vers. 12, 13.) God injoyns that if the city refuse peace, every male must be cut off—and (ver. 14.) the Women, little ones, and the cattel must be saved, and its spoile taken. Then (vers. 15.) to ridd mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to shew whom all these prescriptions relate unto, and whom not. The lord adds<hi>—thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:104445:245"/>
                  <hi>thee which are not of the cities of these nations.</hi> And then (as I said) in relation to them the severe command followes (16. ver.) <hi>but of the cities of these nations which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shall save alive nothing that breatheth.</hi> And that these excepted cities and people may be known they are particularly named as in above expressed. He sayes, <hi>in the case of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall, nothing was to be left alive, and they were to be worse deal; with than others, who refused peace, who were to lose the males only.</hi> Wheras the text appeares express, that the Law anent offering peace, and dealing thus according as it was accepted or refused, <hi>did not belong to them at all,</hi> but that they are very clearly and peremptorly excepted from it. As for his long confused parenthesis here foisted in <hi>anent the difference betwixt the peace and a league, and that Ioshua first made a league with the Gibeonites, but knowing them to be Canaanites-brake it, because contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God</hi> (citing Josh. 9, 21, 22, 23.) <hi>and meerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them a peace.</hi> It is fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tly contradictory to the text, for (vers. 15.) it is said, he made peace with them and <hi>made a league with them</hi> (and this league was) <hi>to let them live, and the Princes of the congregation sware unto them.</hi> Lo here is the Identity of the peace and league, and the designe and contents of it <hi>[to let them live.]</hi> The Dutch annot. upon 15. v. [the princes of the congregation sware to them] tell us, that they rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Oath that which Joshua had promised them, viz. that they should remain alive. The English annot. in stating the question and difficulty concerning the contrariety of this transaction to Gods command, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it thus, <hi>whither Ioshua in making peace with them, and the Princes in confirming it by Oath, did Lawfully or not.</hi> And speak to the Lawfulness, or unlawfulness <hi>of both Ioyntly</hi> without any distinction, but make no exception in the least of <hi>the league</hi> as if distinct from <hi>the peace</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

by Oath, which certainly in statingthe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion they would have expresly excluded, had they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined any such distinction. That Joshua keept the peace and the league, and that this league &amp; peace was to let them live, is accordingly set down in the same termes when the Princes ratefied it; and all along where <hi>the peace is</hi> mentioned, <hi>The Oath</hi> (and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence <hi>the league</hi> which was therby confirmed) is proposed as its ground. They smote them not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had sworn by the Lord (18. vers.) And (vers. 19.) the Princes determine they must not touch them, because they had sworn to them. And (20. vers.) we will let them live lest wrath be upon us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have sworn unto them. And (vers. 21.) the Princes said to the People let them live—as they had promised unto them. Lo all along the Oath is most consciencioussly observed, and that as accessory unto, and confirming this whole transaction, both the peace and league, the, scope and sum wherof is still expressed thus <hi>[to let them live.]</hi> As the text makes no distinction, betwixt the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>league</hi> in this ratefication, so the intendment therof is never extended byond their life and saftie first or last. How then can this man say that Joshua brake the league, since the termes therof were to let them live (ver. 15.) which is acknowledged by the Princes &amp; faithfully performed. The league and peace and Oath here are still one, and fall under the same consideration as consonant, or dissonant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; if the peace was contrary to the command so was the Oath, and if the league was contrary to the command so was the Oath also. For it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the text speakes of the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>league in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discriminatim</hi> or without distinction in relating this transaction, and of the Oath as accessory both unto the one and the other; so that the Oath was unlawfull, if either the peace or league was unlawfull, and if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104445:246"/>
was broken the Oath was broken, and Joshua and the Princes were perjured: Wheras the text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords their faithfull performance of the Oath as rate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying all that transaction. But it is no strang thing to see men so notoriously blotted with perjury seek pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents in scripture Saints if they could finde them. But this instance will stand in judgement against them if they repent not.</p>
               <p>Whereas he saith, <hi>that Ioshua brake the league as contrary to the command of God when he knew them to be Canaanites,</hi> giving this as a reason why <hi>he allowed them a peace only.</hi> It is such a flat contradiction to the text, and to it self, as none can be more plain. For according therunto Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua could not break this league without breaking his Oath which confirmed it, and could break neither the one nor the other, and allow them a peace. Since this peace was the import both of the league and Oath, and all that the Scripture mentions as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Joshua, was peace and their life, and nomore; and this all along Joshua and Israel keept, and precisely because of the Oath. As any who reads the text may see. The Dutch Annotations upon Josh. 9. 15. expone that branch that relates to the Princes swearing thus, <q>that they ratified by Oath that which Joshua had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them, viz, that they should remain alive.</q> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as they clearly hold that the Oath was accessory to this whole transaction, so they make it intirely to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in this that they should have their life. And upon 2. Sam. 21. 1. Where Sauls guilt in slaying these Gibeonites is mentioned, they paraphrase it thus, that <q>it was contrary to the promise made to them &amp; rate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Oath. Josh. I. 15, 18. And whereas we are put in minde in the 2. ver. that [the Gibeonites were not of</q> Israel But of the Amorites]—they para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase it thus, that they were remaining of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations whom God had commanded to destroy
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104445:246"/>
—and the other clause of the verse wherein we are put in minde [that Israel had sworn to them and Saul is said to have sought to slay them in his zeal] they paraphas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it thus, that it was <q>irregular fained zeal whereby he thought to mend what Joshua and other godly Governours, according to his opinion had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected or ill done, but it was directly against the Oath made by Gods name, by his special providence, for which thing God was now greatly provocked, as by</q> this pleague upon the land, &amp; Gods answer appeareth. Wherein, how evidently they stand in opposition to this mans glosses and pleading upon this head, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to themeanest reflection since onely for thatOath they charge guilt on Saul. The English annotations upon (ver. 18.) say, <q>that abstracting from the Princes Oath it had been cruelty to have slain them seeing <hi>they had violat a lawfull Covenant.</hi>
                  </q> Now how this aggrees with this mans gloss of [Joshuas breaking the league, as contrary to the commandment] let any judge. Jackson thus senses ver. 23.—<q>the curse, which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon the people of this land requires that you be cut off as well as the rest, yet because of the Oath which we have taken this curse shall be upon you in bondage and not in death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His next instance to prove his supposed limitation of Gods command to destroy the Canaanites is that of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab her being spared Josh 6. 17. Which clearlie crosses his pleading &amp; argument here; for 1. the spies upon very strick terms state their Oath: and told Rahab not only that if she should make the least discovery of their busi ness, but likewise that if she or her friends, even so much as one of them, were out of the house when the city was taken; this Oath should not reach them, whatever submission she had made. And 2dly, All Joshuas ground when he commands the spies to secure her and her friends, is their Oath: they are commanded to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104445:247"/>
bring out the Woman, <hi>[as they sware to her]</hi> and for no other reason. 3ly. I pray, what saved her friends and her relations as well as her self from this common destruction? Surely, they made no peace nor any such submission as this man supposeth necessary to exeem them from the commanded destruction, nor was there any assurance the spies could have touching them, and therefore they could not be upon any other ground saved, but because included in this Oath. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, what power had these two men to transact a peace without Joshuas advice and knowledge? the ground of, their transacting with her, is their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and the Womans offer of their saftie. Now I retort his argument here against him; to prove that they were spared upon other terms then the Oath, he adduceth this instance of Rahabs preservation upon the submission mentioned, viz. her making and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of peace, and hence concludes that she (and by consequence the Gibeonites) together with her friends, were saved upon other terms, then meerly upon the Oath, and that abstracting from it Israel was obliged to save them. But one might argue thus, if Rahabs friends (at least) might have been Lawfully cut off upon the ground of Gods command to cut off the Canaanites who made or accepted no terms of peace, and were only saved by the spies Oath, then the Oath (according to the Informers own principles) did bind in opposition to a positive precept to cut off the Canaanites: but so it is, that upon the ground of this Oath only her friends wer spared, as this man cannot deny: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Oath did bind here in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to a positive precept. He dare not say that her friends were proselyts, or did in the least directly or indirectly submit. Nay for any thing that the spies knew they might be as cursed heathens as were in all Jericho (for what was Rahab her self before God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104445:247"/>
touched her heart) and consequently by Gods positive precept devoted to destruction with the rest. Yet this Oath, made even to another for them, yea an Oath which had a seeming extortion of fear in the spies hazard, saved and exeemd them from this stroak &amp; curse, so that in this case himself must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that the Oath did bind in opposition to the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precept. And this one clear Scripture instance seemes enough to prove the point <hi>that the Oath did over-rule a particular, positive precept,</hi> though all that he sayes of the Gibeonites were admitted.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>that it is evident, from Iosh.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>that if other cities in Canaan, had submitted, as Gibeon, Ioshua might have spared them.</hi> I answer; the Text sayes that <hi>de facto</hi> they made no peace, and that God hardened their hearts that they might come against Israel and fall. But this will be too weak to bear the weight of his conclusion <hi>that Ioshua might have spared them all.</hi> For 1. How can this consist with the plain posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command as to their utter off cutting (often renewed) and with Gods promise of giving Israel their inheritance, to spare them all. <hi>For the Psalmist tells us, that he did drive out the heathen with his hand and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his people, he did afflict the people and cast them out. Psal.</hi> 44. 2. And Psal. 78. 54, 55. <hi>He brought them to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Sanctuary, even to this mountain which his right hand had purchas'd. He cast out the Heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</hi> Hence as they were frequently enjoyn'd to cast them out least they should become a snare to them Exod. 23. 33. Deut. 7. 16. Ex. 34. 12. So Israels sparing them when they were planted in that land is frequently reprehended as their great guiltiness Judges 1. 27, 29, 30, 31, 33. And Judges 2. 1, 2. Upon which ground the Lord threatens as a punishment <hi>that he will not drive them</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104445:248"/>
                  <hi>out: But that they shall be thorns in their sides.</hi> And this threatning we find execute, and the same very guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness presented as the cause of it, viz. <hi>That they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the Lord commanded them.</hi> Psal. 106. 34, 35. which confirmes this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; and therefore this historicall clause in that passage of Joshua, is to be expounded in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the plain and positive command, which we have already seen clear. 2ly. Jackson upon that 19. ver. [there was not a city that made Peace with Israel &amp;c.] tells us, <hi>that this is added as a reason why the wars with the Canaanites lasted so long—because the Inhabitants did obstinately stand out—and attempted not to procure conditions of peace save only the Gibeonites—</hi>Which is far from coming up to his scope and designe. For it is one thing to say that <hi>de facto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>he wars lasted long—because none of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to yeeld but Gibeon,</hi> and another thing to say <hi>that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua was not oblidged nor commanded to cut off any but those who thus warred and resisted.</hi> Which will be the more weighty, if it be considered in the third place, that as in the command to cut them off, no such restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction appeares, but upon the contrary the Canaanites are excepted from mercy, so we do not find that Joshua offered terms of peace (as this man alleadges he was obliged) unto any of these that were cut off, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted them as those whom God had devoted to be destroyed, in obedience to his holy, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere command, As we heard Jackson hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. This will be more clear, (and therin the Informers adversary might puzle him) If we shall again reflect upon the remarkable circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that transaction with the Gibionites. In the 6. ver. of that 9. of Joshua, they propose the matter thus, <hi>we are come from a far country, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make a League with us.</hi> Whatever they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104445:248"/>
of Gods command to cut off the Cananites, this surelie was a strong argument with Joshua. Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the answer in the 7. ver. <hi>the men of Israel said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventur ye dwell among us, and how shall we me make a league with you.</hi> Sure their offering terms of peace and submission, might have stopped this question and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre according to his opinion, who holds that upon their submitting to terms of peace, They might have been spared and even incorporat among Gods people, as he tells us from Josh. 11. 19. <hi>that all these Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>es might have been spared, had they thus submitted</hi> So that in his sense their first offer was a ground of peace. Especially since (as is observed by learned Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from their offer in the 8. ver.) they sought peace from Joshua and Israel upon their own termes, and offered to accept any conditions proposed by them. Which was the lowest step of submission. And when they further answer that demurr about the place of their abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e with this general, <hi>we are thy servants,</hi> i. e. We offer our selves to thee &amp; all that is ours, which was enough in this mans Judgement, to except them from the stroak threatned, and commanded to be execute upon the rest of the Canaanites. Yet this doth not satisfie Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua, but again he particularly interrogats them upon these two points, <hi>who are ye?</hi> and next, <hi>from whence come ye?</hi> This their free and general concession (as some do judge) giving Joshua just cause to suspect that they were of the cursed Canaanites whom he was to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy; and then they tell him that wherin the <hi>dolus</hi> lay, we come from a far countrey. Now, I suppose they had answered to these two Questions thus, <hi>we are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites, and we dwell here.</hi> Thinks this Informer that Joshua would have lookt on himself as obliged by Gods Law to transact with them. What needed then his peremptory Interrogations (after their declared submission) anent their stock and lineage, and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104445:249"/>
place of their abode? What needed the people mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and desire to cut them off, after the contrary of what they pretended was discovered, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof? Nay thirdly, why is it, that again and again their saftie is attributed solely to the Oath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least hint of their submission as having any influence thereupon? <hi>Finallie</hi> that passage Joshua 11. 19. [no citie made peace—For it was of the Lord that they might have no favour] seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no more but this, that favour might have been shown them had they submitted, but how? Even by God the supreme lawgiver (whose mercy is over all his Works) his dispensing with his own Law, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere positive precepts, (as in the case of the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites he did) and in what Method it seemd best unto him, but it will be hard to inferr from this a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the precept it self for the reasons already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So that all that seems to follow from this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is, that had they submitted, God might have spared them by a speciall dispensing with his own Law, (For he will have mercie and not Sacrifice) and Joshua upon Gods appointment. But not that the Law it self did dispense with them.</p>
               <p>As for what he adds in further confirmation of this opinion, anent Salomons imposing bond service upon the remains of these cursed Nations, and their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity afterward, whom the children of Israel were not able to cast out (which, in ane odd phrase, he calls a kindness) and anent these Children of Solomons servants, mentioned Ezra. 2. 55, 58.] Jackson will tell him <hi>[That it contradicts not the Law</hi> (Deut. 7.) <hi>anent utter smiting them, and shewing them no mercy, since, that Law may be meant of the inhabitants that were in the Land at their entring first into it, not of their posterity. Especially these who had their lives previously secured.]</hi> Which fully cuts off his argument from this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104445:249"/>
Text. And this is also the answer of Mr Poole and other learned interpreters upon this passage. Besides, that the Nethinims were probably the Gibeonites issue, and were however all of them, by a long tract of time Proselyts incorporat among Gods people and professing the true religion, which providentiall title might abundantly secure their lives</p>
               <p>The Dutch Anotations upon Josh. 29. 27. do inferr from the nature and mould of that phrase which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies [a delivering them over.] that hence it is thought they were called <hi>Nethinims</hi> i. e. <hi>given and delivered over</hi> which confirms the answer adduced. However the person who should directly impugne the <hi>Informer</hi> as to what he maintains in this question (which he hath impertinently brought in without any ground, to make some shift of answer) might further tell him that this being <hi>but a practice,</hi> cannot be pleaded <hi>against a rule,</hi> but must be measured by it, which is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple acknowledged by all.</p>
               <p>And here I shall exhibit some remarkable inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies of this man with himself upon this point 1. he supposeth that Joshua and the princes their Oath to the Gibeonites stood inviolable as to this transaction both now and herafter; for he sayes (page 143.) that <hi>Sauls slaying the Gibeonites moved God to wrath, because it was contrary to Ioshuas Oath made to their fathers.</hi> Now Joshua &amp; the Princes Oath ratefied all the Transaction with them, &amp; was accessory therunto as the text most clearly holds out, viz. both the league and the peace; yet he tells us (page 141.) <hi>that as soon as Ioshua knew them to be Cananites, he brake the league as contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God,</hi> and consequently his Oath confirming it according to his doctrine as being Likewise contrary to the command. 2ly, In that same page he tells us <hi>that no peace was to be concluded with the Canaanites, unless they became servants &amp; renounced their heathnish idolatries,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104445:250"/>
                  <hi>and that with the same proviso leagues were discharged with these Canaanites.</hi> Yet immediatlie after he makes a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this point betwixt <hi>a peace,</hi> and <hi>a league,</hi> and tells us, <hi>that Ioshua had first made a league with them, but when he knew them to he Canaanites, he brake it as being contrary to the command of God, and only allowed them a peace.</hi> Now both <hi>the peace,</hi> and <hi>the league,</hi> were equally allowed and commanded upon thir termes of yeelding up their Lands, and relinquishing their Idolatrie, and both were equally dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged if they did not so, according to the <hi>series</hi> of his reasoning, as is obvious to any Reader. How then (I pray) could Joshua break his league with them as contrary to the command of God, more then the peace, both which he holds to have been allowed them with this proviso. 3ly. He sayes <hi>Ioshua and the Princes sware nothing but what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> (pag. 142.) Now the text is most express that they sware the league ver. 15. <hi>and Ioshua made peace with them, and made a league with them to let, them live, and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</hi> This league he sayes <hi>Ioshua brake as contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God,</hi> in his second answer; yet in his 3d an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer he tells us, <hi>that the Oath contained in it nothing contrary to the command.</hi> Again, he sayes God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make no peace with them, <hi>But upon the termes of submission, relinquishing their idolatrie, and giving up their Lands.</hi> To this only he restricts the Princes stipulation, as falling under the command, yet acknowledges the command will include a league also upon thir terms, which els where (as I said) he dstinguishes from the peace, which he holds was not to be allowed them even upon thir termes. And likewise, in his second answer he tells us that they had peace only <hi>upon their submission,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning these other termes. Likewise he sayes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104445:250"/>
that on these termes he <hi>transacted to spare Rahabs friends,</hi> but where was this assurance as to her friends?</p>
               <p>4ly, He acknowledges (pag. 143.) <hi>that Gods wrath for slaying the Gibeonites was because of Ioshuas Oath, made to their fathers.</hi> Yet page 108. he cries out upon his Doubters assertion anent ane <hi>Oath binding the posteritie,</hi> as a strange fancy, and tells us that Casuists say, that <hi>Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum est vinculum personale, binding these only who take it.</hi> Now wheras this man wonders much at our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from this text anent the Gibeonites, let any judge whether his own shattered inconsistent discourse be not rather an object of wonder.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, his third answer to the premised argument of his Doubter, from this instance of the Gibeonites, is <hi>that Ioshua did nothing contrary to Gods command, which was to spare them upon their submission. Ans.</hi> (Besides what is touched anent his inconsistency with himself in this, and what we are to add, anent the impertinency of this unto the point, though gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.) I say first, that Joshua and the Princes were bound to spare them abstracting from this stipulation and Oath, is more then he hath proved, and appears contrary to the command above expressed, and the current of the context where this Oath and stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is set down; whether we consider Joshuas pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie demands and demurres anent receiving them to peace, after they had expressed their submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or the Oath its being again and again mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both in setting down the stipulation its self (ver. 15.) and the reason why they were not smitten (ver. 18.) and the Princes judicial determination. (ver. 19.) as <hi>the sole ground</hi> of Joshuas and the Princes obligation to them, without the least hint <hi>of any other,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly might have been (and consequently if true would have been, might his impugner say) very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently and strongly pleaded by Joshua and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104445:251"/>
to quash the peoples murmuring at the sparing of them. 2ly, I might say, that this stipulation and Oath, although cross to a particular positive precept, yet notwithstanding, as matters here stood cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiat, was consonant to a generall moral rule of Gods mercy, who loves it better then Sacrifice. And the sparing of these Gibeonites was grounded upon this great moral precept [of the reverence due to Gods name, interposed by a Sacred and Solemn Oath.] Which answer is the verie determination of Joshua and the Princes in this matter. His impunger might here adde that it is utterly improbable, that in the Princes determination of the question [whether these Gibeonites were to be saved, and the stipulation with them held as valid] their submission would have been omitted, if they had understood Gods command with this limitation, which is a doubt that would much puzle this Informer to resolve.</p>
               <p>His 4t, Ans. is, <hi>that God was angry at the slaying of the Gibeonites, because it was contrary to his command, to give them peace upon their submission, and unto Ioshuas Oath to their fathers, and not meerly because it was contrary to the Oath. Ans.</hi> Joshua and the Princes Oath is both in that 9. of Joshua, and the 2. of Sam. 21. mentioned as the only ground of their right to their life, without the least hint of any command anent their having peace upon their Submission, which notwithstanding this antiscriptural Informer (who will be wise here above what is written) sets in the first place, as the principal cause of their right. When the reason is rendered (2. Sam. 21.) why these Gibeonites had a right to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Israelites, though they were not of Israel, but of the Amorites, it is expressed thus, <hi>the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul sought to slay them.</hi> Again, since he grants that God was angry at the slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Gibeonites upon the ground of Joshua
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104445:251"/>
and the Princes Oath to their fathers, he confequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grants that this Oath, notwitstanding of the cheat by which Joshua and the Princes were brought under it, was still binding and did oblige the posterity, which is the Chief point that this instance is adduced to prove against him, as we shall presently shew. For what he adds after, it is not much noticable. The reasons of the English annotations as touching this Oaths consonancie to Gods Law, we are not in this point concern'd to scanne, since our argument stands good even upon their supposition. As for these who say, <hi>that Ioshua and the Princes Oath, was contrary to Gods Law, and do therfore assert that it did not bind.</hi> We have shown that as herin they are not ours, so in this assertion they clearly cross the Scriptures, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what is above touched.</p>
               <p>Here we shall again minde the Reader for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion to this argument and instance anent the Gibeonites, that all this mans clamour, about the consonancy or dissonancy of this Oath to Gods Law, is out of the way, and never meets our reasoning from this passage, even as its moulded by himself, so that we may without losing our argument as to its main scope, grant all that he sayes <hi>anent the consonancy of the Oath to the divine precept about cutting off these Canaanites, and that it did admit these restrictions which he speaks of.</hi> But our argument for the Covenant is here twofold 1. That this Oath and Covenant with these Gibeonites though its matter were of a far lower nature then our Sacred Covenants, and vows, yet did not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blidge that, but all succeeding generations, And therefore much more our solemn sacred vows, so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and universally sworn, and about the great concerns of Publick and personal reformation, do oblidge all the posterity. Now this being our main Argument, he is so far from denying it, that he grants
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104445:252"/>
it upon the matter, in asserting and yeelding unto us, <hi>that this Oath consonant to Gods Law, did bind the posterity;</hi> for thinkes he that we doe not suppose and hold the matter of the Covenant to be consonant to Gods Law' Why then wanders he out of the way, while preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to answer this argument, and pleaseth himself, and leads his Reader off the way with unprofitable talk not to the purpose? The consonancy of our Oath to the Law of God, being even his own supposition in this argument. 2ly. From this instance we argue (as I said) for the binding force of the Covenant even upon the adversaries supposition anent the coact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, deceit, fear, or such like irregularities in the manner of entring unto it, (which they use to make a great clamour about) and from this text we conclude that all these will not loose the Oath, when once it is taken. Since here there was <hi>a notable cheat</hi> whereby Joshua and all Israel were brought under this Oath, taking away both <hi>a rationall assent of the Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>the free sutable election of the will, quia dolus aufert assensum</hi> that is, <hi>deceit takes away assent,</hi> say Casuists, Yet all this did not irritat this Oath when taken. And even as himself states the objection, his Doubter alledges, that the pretence or appearance of <hi>a greater good in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Oath,</hi> was not wanting,—and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pleads, <hi>that this Oath did bind the posterity.</hi> Now what his roaving discourse anent <hi>the Oaths consonancy to the Law,</hi> sayes to all this, let any rational man judge; Since both his Doubter and he, do suppose the matter of this Oath lawfull. He knew that his stating the question aright and speaking to it, would have made the vanity of his answers appear, and therfore he started this notion <hi>anent the Oaths binding against a precept,</hi> that tossing it a little upon his forked pen, the unwarrie Reader might beleeve, he had return'd a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this argument: Whereas he but beats the air
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104445:252"/>
in ane airie discourse out of the way, and yeelds the cause when he hath done.</p>
               <p>Next he sayes, <hi>we use to plead Zedekiahs breach of Oath to the King of Babylon, which the Lord was so much displeased with.</hi> But how, and to what scope we plead that text, he durst not set down, nor put into the mouth of his Doubter any formall argument from it; Which if rightly propounded, he knew well his cause would quickly fall before it. This man could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how Timorcus, and others, improve this text, viz. that Zedekiah who was of the Kings seed, the son of Josiah (Ezek. 17. 13.) had ane Oath put upon him by the King of Babylon anent his, and the Kingdoms feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and subjection to him (2 Chron 36. 13.) after he had overrunn the land, and made prisoner Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin his Brother, and keept Zedekiah himself under his power. That he could neither have the crown, nor his libertie without this Oath of fealty to the King of Babylon, which was forced upon him out of fear, and as a prisoner—yet for the breach hereof (Exek. 17.) he is threatned with the losse of all. <hi>Shall he break the Covenant and be delivered—as I live saith the Lord surely my Oath and Covenant that he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken even it will I recompence upon his head. And in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</hi> Here was ane Oath, forced upon a prisoner, and a King of Judah, and upon the matter inconsistent with Israels Laws, made that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom might be base, yet the breach of it was thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly revenged: Therfore much more dreadfull is the breach of our solemn vows, whose matter is of such high importance, and their end so excellent, and the power imposing so native and Lawfull &amp;c. What sayes he to this Argument? he tells us, <hi>that the Iews were commanded to submit to the King of Babylon</hi> (Ier. 27. 6. <hi>&amp;c.) so that the breaking of the Oath was disobedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> But who denyes this, and what doth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104445:253"/>
reprove? doth not his Doubter and himself also suppose the matter of the Covenant to be consonant to Gods command. But how takes he away these nerves, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ckling points of this instance and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Covenant. 1. That this Oath was forced upon him as a prisoner. 2ly, taken by Zedekiah out of fear. 3ly, had a very apparent Inconsistency with a greater good, viz. to free Gods Church and people from a heathen slavery. 4ly, was cross to many stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Laws of Israel, yet neither the force of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Invader, in imposing this Oath, nor the fear and bondage of this King of Israel when he did take it, nor the apparent inconsistency of its matter with a greater good, and its certain inconsistency with the standing Laws of Israel, did loose the Oath when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor exeem the breaker of it from wrath and Judgement. And all this because it was upon the matter warrantable, and allowed of God, as we hold the Covenant to be. And therfore neither force, fear, bondage, the greater apparent good in breaking it, nor the inconsistency of it with our present Laws, none of all these pretences (we say) will loose the Oath of our Covenant, the matter of it being warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and of such high importance as is said. Sure it is obvious to any that this answer of his, sayes nothing to the antecedent or consequent of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Covenant, nor touches it in the least.</p>
               <p>The Doubter objects next [the mark of the blessed man (Psalm 15. 4. vers.) swearing to his own hurt and not changing.] In answer to which this Informer grants, <hi>that in many things a man may swear to his hurt and not change.</hi> This is sound, and in so far he must grant, that the Oath may hinder many goods and yet not for all that be violat. And in recompence of this concession I readily yeeld to him, <hi>that ane Oath will not</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104445:253"/>
                  <hi>bind to a mans hurt in every thing, as to take away his own life.</hi> And that such ane Oath binds only to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as being <hi>iniquitatis vinculum.</hi> But what will he say to this argument which he makes his Doubter here mutter out? Why, <hi>when it hurts</hi> (saith he) <hi>those in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and peoples soules, it will not bind.</hi> True, but how doth the keeping of the Covenant hurt peoples soules, or these in authority? we read much in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the hurt that breach of Covenant hath brought upon both these. But how a peoples keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God wrongs either their soules or these in authority, we would gladly hear. Dare he say that every disobedience to the <hi>command</hi> of Rulers, impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches their <hi>authority?</hi> or that peoples want of the means and ordinances of life, is to be imputed to Godly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ministers, whom for keeping Gods Covenant they have chased away from their flocks &amp; families? As for <hi>familie hurt,</hi> or in relation to things of this life, ther's no question but that ane Oath in many cases will bind notwithstanding therof; Which is the Judgement of all Interpreters. But now the Doubter having spent all his arguments, hath only one poor General left, viz. <hi>that we are tender of Oaths.</hi> To this he ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers first, by acknowledging, <hi>that we ought to be considerate before we enter into ane Oath.</hi> Very true, and had we all been so, there had not been so many contradictory and ungodly Oaths, standing upon record against Scotland, as this day there are. Withall he sayes, <hi>we should be well advised before we thinke our selves discharged of an Oath.</hi> And no doubt if he and his party had advised this better with God, with his word, with sound Casuists, and their own consciences, they had not upon such poor grounds as we have seen, first perjured themselves, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for others doing the like. <hi>But yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>to think we cannot be at all discharged of an Oath, in a thing not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:104445:254"/>
                  <hi>is to be more tender then we ought to be.</hi> True: but not to take every matter of an Oath for not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, which he may have the confidence to call so, but cannot prove it, and not to admit every ground of discharge as lawfull, which such Adiaphorists as he may pretend, is to be no more tender then we ought to be.</p>
               <p>But here, our Informer will reach a blow again at the Assembly 1638, <hi>because of their loosing Ministers, who entred by the former Prelats, from their Oaths to them.</hi> But where is his discretion and tenderness, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects this as a fault of that assembly, and yet dare not exhibit, nor offer to scanne their grounds men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their act, in reference to these engadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? wherein, because that Prelacy is condemned in the word (and consequently <hi>the matter of these Oaths,)</hi> and likewise found contrary to the priviledges and reformation of this Church, to maintain which, the se Prelats themselves who exacted such Oaths, stood engadged, and such like grounds, they prove them to be <hi>Materially sinfull, iniquitatis vincula, and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning null or never obliging,</hi> and do not pretend (as he) to loose <hi>from Oaths antecedently lawfull and binding.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Prelats being removed, this Oath supposing their existing power and office, was <hi>ipso facto</hi> null and void, as the souldiers military Oath to the captain upon the disbanding of the armie, and so its root was plucked up. <hi>Sublata causa tollitur effectus. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blato relato tollitur Correlatum.</hi> So that he gets but a Wound to his cause, in kicking thus against the pricks.</p>
               <p>But he tells us, <hi>that he will come yet nearer</hi> with an other argument, and so he had need, for the precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding have never yet come near our cause nor his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe. Well what is this? <hi>Commissaries</hi> (he saith) <hi>were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:104445:254"/>
                  <hi>in the Covenant, as officers depending upon the abjured bierarchy, yet we ownd them, before Bishops were restored, and why may not he, the abjured Bishops also.</hi> But will he suffer a Reverend father Bishop Lighton to answer for us, and shew him the disparity of our Commissariot (a meer ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil administration, influenced and authorized by supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour civil Governours, as a part of the politicall consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Kingdom) with a Church office. In his first letter anent the Accommodation, printed in that piece entituled, <hi>The case of the accommodation examined,</hi> he will tell him, <hi>that though we have the name of Commissaries yet they excercise not any part of Church discipline.</hi> Which he sets down, expresly to distinguish them from <hi>the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries abjur'd in the 2d Article of the Covenant.</hi> Now, the difference of this owning our Commissaries in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, from owning and swearing fealty to the Bishop as a Church officer, in all his Spirituall usurpations, is so palpable, that any may see the impertinency of this instance even in Bishop Lightons Judgement. Moreover, we abjure in the Covenant <hi>all Ecclesiastical officers depending upon that hierarchy.</hi> But will he dare to say that the Commissary, whose <hi>administration</hi> is properly <hi>Civil,</hi> and when the Covenant was taken had not <hi>the least dependance upon a Prelat,</hi> was <hi>an Eclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical officer depending upon that hierarchy.</hi> Surely the meanest capacity may discover the vanity of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Doubter objects this, [that the Commissaries did not then depend upon the Bishops, and therfore might be ownd as not contrary to the Covenant.] To this he answers, <hi>that upon this ground of a non-dependance upon Bishops, we might have ownd a Dean at that time, or a Bishop, as having no dependance upon an Arch-bishop; and that he cannot see why any member of the hierarchy under the highest, might not have been owned and retaind on this ground, as well as the Commissary. Ans.</hi> The disparity
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104445:255"/>
is manifest to any of Common sense; the Dean <hi>sua na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi> is an Ecclesiastick officer, and the very office de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a relation unto, and Ecclesiastick dependance upon a prelat, in spirituall administrations: so that Prelacie being laid aside, and the hierarchy smoothed to Presbyterian Parity and Government, the Dean is a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and so is the diocesan Bishop, and can no more subsist, the basis and fountain of his very office <hi>qua talis, or as such,</hi> being removed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. But the Commissary (a civil officer and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat) his administration, of its own nature civill, depends upon, and is regulat by, superiour civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and so in that case subsists intirely as a part of the civil Government, where prelacie is abolished; and can no more be scrupled at, because a prelat did somtime usurpe an authority over that office, then the office of the Lord high Chancellour, or any other civil office of state, and inferiour offices theron specially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, because somtime a Prelat was Chancellour, and usurped authority in these matters, ought to be disowned or scrupled at upon this account.</p>
               <p>2ly, He sayes, <hi>this answer comes near to what he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, anent the English divines who hold, only that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex frame to be abjured in the 2d article, which consists of all the officers there enumerat. Ans.</hi> 1. It is more then he hath proved, that the English divines do owne (even <hi>sigillatim</hi> or apart) all these officers, or looke upon themselves as only obliged against that complex frame consisting of all the officers enumerat in that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. We heard before out of Timorcus (whom Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Lighton in that letter, and the Informer himself cites, as holding that our Prelacie is consistent with the Covenant, and whom they appeal unto in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) that they disowne all Prelacie, where one single person exerciseth sole power in ordination and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, all Prelacie beyond a Proestos, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104445:255"/>
the name and thing of Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deans, Chapters, Arch Deacons. Timorcus in the 7. Chap. adds,—<q>all Bishops not Chosen by the clergie and people—all Bishops who act by Deans, prebends, and exercise their power by Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Commissaries &amp;c.</q> Doth not the article it self abjure, <hi>all ecclesiastical officers depending on that hierarchy.</hi> So that though we did come near to what they say in this answer, we come never a whit nearer him. 2ly, we told him already that the Commissaries office is <hi>properly Civil,</hi> though usurped upon by the Prelat, so that when purged from this usurpation, and running in the channell of a meer civil administration, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced and authorized by Superiour civil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as a part of the political constitution of the kingdom, it falls not within the compass of <hi>an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical officer depending on the hierarchy,</hi> by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and Bishop Lightons. How then was the owning of him before the introduction of Prelacie, contrary unto the Covenant.</p>
               <p>But because he suffered not his poor Doubter to tell him that the Commissary, besides that in our late times, he did not depend upon the Bishop, is really and upon the matter with us a Civil, not a Church officer, he thinks to surprise him with a third answer. <hi>That now the Comissaries do actually depend upon the Bishops, yet we scruple not, nor decline their Courts and authority, and if we decline them not (as according to our Principles we are oblidged) how are we free of perjury? and if we can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Commissary notwithstanding the Covenant, why may not he also a Bishop. Ans.</hi> What poor tatle is this? we told him already that the Commissariot is of it self a lawfull Civil administration, not ane Ecclesiastical function, and the prelats usurped authority cannot render this civill office unlawfull. Wheras the dicoesan Bishops office, is a pretended <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:104445:256"/>
                  <hi>function,</hi> and in its very nature a gross corruption, and contrary to the word of God, as is above cleared. Which disparity is palpable to any that will but open their eyes. Do we abjure any Civil courts or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in that article? are they not termd expresly <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical officers</hi> who are there abjured: Nay, doth not Timorcus tell us that in England the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries <q>exercise a power in Church discipline by a delegation from the Bishop.</q> And doth not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Lighton deny this to be competent to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries here. For in that passage of the letter now cited, he sayes we have nothing but <hi>the name of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries,</hi> he means in respect of these in England, who exercise ecclesiastical discipline under the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. Didoclavius pag. 458. Cites <hi>Cowellus in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete,</hi> about the office of the Bishops Commissary in England, speaking thus, <hi>Commissarij vox Titulus est Ecclesiasticae Iurisdictionis (saltem quousque commissio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit) in partibus Diocesios a primaria Civitate tam Longe dissitis ut Cancellarius subditos ad principale consistorium Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi citare non potest &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>That is, that <hi>Commissary</hi> in England is a title of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction so faras his commssion will allow in places which are so far remote from the cheif city of the diocess, that the Chancellour without great molestation cannot cite them to the Bishops cheif court.</q> Didoclavius tells us <hi>(ubi supra)</hi> that according to the Statutes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the Chancellour is the Bishops principal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, &amp; the Commissary the Bishops foraneous officiall.</p>
               <p>To conclude, 1. The Bishops power as to Civills, and their deputation of this their power to Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours is a most gross usurpation, Contrary to the Scripture, which forbids the Minister to entangle himself with things of this life. Our Lord himself would not so much as be an arbiter in a civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se. Paul speaking of the ministerial duties, saith
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104445:256"/>
who is sufficient for these things. The Apostles must Give themselves continually to the Word. Cartwright against the Rhemists upon 2. of Tim. 2. 4. Proves that pure antiquitie Knew nothing of prelats thus medling, citing Jerome (super Sophon. cap. 1.) who expounds that place against Ministers medling in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affaires. And Cyprian, who applies this place against one who took upon him to be executor of a Testament: <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 9. <hi>concil. Carthag.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Apostol. can. (Can.</hi> 6.) <hi>Seculares Curas non Suscipite.</hi> Likewise Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, who affirmes that <hi>Worldly Government is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the priest.</hi> (Lib. 5. Epist. 33.) Smectimnuus (pag. 32. Sect. 10.) cites concil. Hispall. 2. Cyprian Epist. 28. against this deputation of prelats power to Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, Commissaries &amp;c. and Brings in Bishop Dounham aknowledging (Defens. Lib. 1.) that in <q>Ambrose time and a good while after, which was about the year 400. till presbyters were wholly neglected, the Bishops had no ordinaries, vicars, Chancellours, Commissaries, that were not Clergie men.</q> But this restriction they affirme to be a meer blind, and Challeng him to shew any such under-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Bishops in those times. So that they hold this to be one main point of difference betwixt their Bishops, and the primitive Bishops. 2dly, in England, not only hath the Commissary a Civil administration under the Bishop, but hath Likewise power of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual censures, and a great part of the Bishops eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical administration, committed unto him both over Ministers and others; such as suspension, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, excommunication: See Didoclav. (pag. 464, 465. de officialibus) Cartwright (2. repl. part. 2. pag. 69.) who shews <q>that the prelats not only exercise Tyrrany themselves over the Church, but bring it under subjection to their very Servants, yea their Servants Servants such as Chancellours,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104445:257"/>
Commissaries &amp;c.</q> 3ly, it is clear that since the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we never had in Scotland such Commissaries; but our Law and practice since that time, and since Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Prelacies were dissolved, hath much reduced them to the state &amp; Quality of other civil officers, whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of its own nature depends upon superiour civil officers. For this we have (as I said) Bishop Lightons own Confession, <hi>that we have but the name of Commissaries</hi> here, <hi>who have nothing to do with Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> Only their civil power is invaded again by the Prelats. 4ly, B Lighton and this Informer do both plead, <q>that its only the officers enumerat in the 2d Article of the Covenant, and the Commissaries as then moulded &amp; Existent in the Church of England, that this Oath oblidges against.</q> And so <hi>according to their Principles and pleading,</hi> our Commissary here, so vastly discrepant from theirs, falls not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Covenant abjuration. Hence finally, the owning of the Commissary in his Lawfull civil admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, can be no acknowledgement, either, 1. of the English Commissaries Power, which he hath not. Nor 2dly, of the Prelats usurpation upon this civil office; no more then the simple using of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws, and the ordinary civil courts during Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells usurpation, was a homologating the wickedness therof, which this man will not dare to assert. An usurper may be <hi>in titulo,</hi> and such submission and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the civ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l power invaded by him, as doth acknowledge <hi>the providentiall Title,</hi> and his being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the power <hi>de facto,</hi> and having as they use to say <hi>jus in re,</hi> or actual providential possession therof, If there be no active concurrance towards his Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, is, as to civills, free of any guilt of the usurpation, and will import no acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the usurper his Pretended <hi>jus.</hi> Which is the Judgement of all sound divines and Casuists.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104445:257"/>
But the case is far different as to our Informers deriving his deputed Ecclesiastical Ministery or spiritual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Bishop; because, 1. the Prelats office it self is a gross usurpation, contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so is not the Commissaries office. 2dly, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats usurped possession of unlawfull power over the Church, which is Christs Kingdom, cannot give him so much as <hi>a providentiall Title;</hi> and therfore all acknowledgement therof is unlawfull. Thirdly, his submission to prelacy as now it stands Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat, is an acknowledgement both of the <hi>possession,</hi> and <hi>jus,</hi> which this man will not deny, and this is far dictinct, from an act which doth but indirectly acknowledge the <hi>usurpers possession.</hi> So that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is ane express acknowledgement and owning of a gross encroachment upon Christs Kingdom (his Church) which is <hi>toto Coelo</hi> different, from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a possession <hi>de facto</hi> of, and <hi>a Providential title</hi> unto, a part of the civil administration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world, which are mutable. And as for a testimony against this usurpation, I suppose that had the people of God disowned these civil courts, upon this ground of the Covenant obligation, his party, for the preceeding reasons, had signally cried out against it, as an AnaBaptistical rejecting of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full civil Government, more then he doth upon this Pretence, alledge a homologating of Prelacie, in this acknowledgement. But however, we say, that the people of God their notour and standing testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against Prelacie it self as now Established, doth sufficiently reach this among other its usurpations, although this piece of civil Government be <hi>eatenus</hi> or in its own nature and as such, owned as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
               <p>But now our Informer charges us with another breach of Covenant, upon the ground of <hi>schisme,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:104445:258"/>
which he sayes, <hi>we are carrying on in opposition to the peace and liberty of this Church, which Christ has bequeathed to her in legacie.</hi> This heavy charge we would gladly know how he will instruct, and because he cannot stay to discuss that point in this dialogue, we will therfor supersed our enquiry here, and pass over to his <hi>third dialogue,</hi> and Examine therin the grounds of this accusation, which we doubt not to discover, to be as Irrational, as these examined in the preceeding Dialogues.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE state of the Question <hi>in the third Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> is anent <hi>sinfull separation and Schism; whether the people of God be guilty of it in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to such Ministers as contend for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, rather then Curats or Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists; And whether they stand in this case of our Church) oblig'd to adhere to the one or the other, as their true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, from whom they are to receive the gospel ordinances, and to whom they owe subjection, reverence, and obedience accordingly.</hi> This state of the Question our Informer cannot in the least pick a quarrel at, it being most suitable unto his pleading, which is all along ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this supposition, <hi>that conformists do stand in a Ministerial relation to this Church, and professours therein:</hi> from which he concluds peoples obligation to adhere unto them, <hi>as their only true, and proper Pastours.</hi> And in correspondence to this principle and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, doth universally and absolutely fasten the charge <hi>of intrusion</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> upon Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

For clearing this let us take a litle view, first, of our Church of Scotland her case at Prelacies introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2ly, of her present case. 3dly, of the different grounds which the Presbyterian and Prelatick partie plead upon, for the peoples adherence. 4thly, on whose side the separation stands. Schism is a <hi>sinfull se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a Church, with whom, &amp; in what acts we are bound to adhere.</hi> So that when this Question is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who are that Church to which we stand under obligations to adhere, it will go far to clear this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

                  </gap>y down these three suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in relation to the matter of fact. First, that our Church from the infancie of her Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with <hi>popry</hi> rejected <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and in her National capacitie, and in her supreme Judicatories disowned it as contrary to the Word of God, as a piece of Antichrists wicked Hierarchy: And in her National capacitie abjured the same often, solemnly, and universally. This hath been already clear'd upon the preceeding Dialogue. 2ly. Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment hath been look't on by our Church, as <hi>the only Government of the Church appointed by Christ</hi> in Scripture, and as the hedge of her reformed Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. Nay the owning of it hath been the great badge and <hi>Criterion,</hi> to try her true members; the subscribing the books of Discipline, and the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant of old, and the solemn league of late, with engadgements of adherence to Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have been the ordinary door of entry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104445:260"/>
into her Ministry. This, as to mater of fact, is clear and undeniable. 3ly, Our Church hath Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially condemned E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>In the 2d place,</hi> as to our Church her present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, these things are clear and undeniable. 1. That all the legall right of the late work of Reformation is removed in the <hi>act rescissory.</hi> 2. Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is raz'd, and the Church-Government monopliz'd in the Arch Bishops and Bishops, obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon this Church: And the right and liberties of Presbyters and all our former Church-Judicatories is removed and taken away. 3ly, Ane arbitary and Erastian Prelacy is set up in opposition, both unto our Churches <hi>intrinsick power of Government,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise her particular frame <hi>of Presbyterian Government.</hi> 4. All her vowes and great Oaths both in the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, as explaind An. 1638. And in the solemn League against Prelacie, and for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her reformation, are disown'd, raz'd, and cassat, as far as legall enactings can reach. 5.

Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters betwixt three and four hundred disown, and stand in opposition to this course, and a great part and body of the professours of this Church have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise disownd the same, &amp; stood their ground. Hence upon what is said, it followes in the 7th place, that ane ax is laid to the root of her reform'd Doctrine,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104445:260"/>
Worship and Government; The great hedge thereof is removed, viz: her solemn vows: and beside, her <hi>doctrinall principles</hi> anent the Antichrist and his Hierarchy, the Churches intrinsick power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Christian libertie, the unlawfulness of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant ceremonies in Gods Worship; her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine anent Justification, the Imperfection of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Christs certain, determinat, and full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for sinners, in opposition to the Socinian and Arminian errors; The morality of the Sabbath &amp;c. are opposed by this innovating prelatick partie. And next, for <hi>her Worship</hi> (beside what corruptions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready introduced, and others pleaded for, as <hi>the perth Articles &amp;c.)</hi> It is, upon the matter, subjected to mens arbitrary impositions; And our National Covenant and Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ssion is disownd, <hi>ae stricking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst popish corruptions,</hi> and also our late confession as asserting the above-mentioned Doctrine &amp; principles. And for Government, the Curats are meer slaves of Prelats, in all their meetings by his negative voice, and the Prelats themselves are but the Magistrats crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And thus as our late consession is disownd in relation to several doctrinal points of Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, moralitie of the Sabath, free election, &amp;c so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in relation to its principles as to Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernment, and Christs appointing Officers, lawes, and censures, as head of his Church, his not giving the keys to the civill Magistrat &amp;c. Wherein our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick party are come so great a length that the late theses from St Andrews an. 81, daines that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines whose confession is authorirized by the generall Assembly of this Church, with no other name then that of a <hi>conventicle.</hi> 8ly, Our Churches case is now worse then when prelacy was introduced by King James. The Limitations of Erastianism by the Act of Parliament An. 1592. in relation to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104445:261"/>
                  <hi>her priviledges concerning heads of religion, heresy, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and censures, clear this.</hi> Next, Church-Judicatories were not discontinued, but sat upon their old ground; and Prelats were restored by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to their <hi>civil dignities</hi> only. Hence 9ly. Its clear that this pure Presbyterian Church hath been <hi>meerly passive</hi> as to all these innovations lately intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; her true representatives or lawfull Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies never having consented to this course of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, as appears by the Assembly 38. Their act anent these meetings, at Linlithgow 1606; at Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow 1610. at Aberdeen 1616. At St Andrews 1617. at Perth 1618. Which consented to Prelacie; All which meetings they demonstrat to be contrary in their frame and constitution, to the priviledges of this Church. And at prelacies late erection Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Judicatories and Synods were preparing <hi>a Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Testimonie,</hi> before they were raisd. So that the voice of our lawful Assemblies is still heard in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this course; &amp; since Prelacies erection we have never had so much as a shadow of ane Assembly &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the 3d point, viz. <hi>the different grounds which the Presbyterian and prelatick party</hi> (and this man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) <hi>do plead upon, for the peoples adherence;</hi> take it shortly thus, the prelatists do plead first, that they are Ministers, and in that relation to this Church. 2lv. That corruptions in administrators will not (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own principles) warrand separation from ordinances. 3ly, they plead <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> which (they allege) is broken by peoples withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. These are the cheif topicks they insist on. On the other hand Presbyterian Ministers plead for disowning them according to the forementioned sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the question, first, from this that the body of Presbyterian Ministers &amp; professours adhering to our Churches reformation, principles, and priviledges,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104445:261"/>
are the pure genuine Church of Scotland, tho now fled into a wilderness; whose voice we are called to hear as her true Chiidren. 2ly, that this course of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is a meer intrusion on this Church, and invasion of Christs Kingdome, prerogatives and ordinances, subjecting the lawes, officers and censures of his Church unto men, exauctorating &amp; putting in officers without his warrand; that Prelats, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes consequently, have no right to officiat as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in this Chuich. Since both the one and the other are arrand intruders upon the same, and promoters of this Schismatick destroying course of defection. 3ly, that our <hi>Churches divine right</hi> and claim to her priviledges stands fast, notwithstanding the present encroachments and invasions thereof; and her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens obligation of adherence to the same according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 4ly, That hence it followes, because of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency of this course of defection, that all are obliged to keep themselves free from the least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to it, and therefore to disown Curats; both as maintaining principles contrary to the principles and doctrine of this Church, and as standing in a stated op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to her, &amp; likewise as the obiects of her censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, if she were in capacity to draw her sword. That the people of God have both <hi>corrupt doctrine</hi> to lay to their charge, beside the <hi>corruption Worship;</hi> and also their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the fellowship of this Church, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people away from our vowed reformation &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the 4th place, to come to clear ths great point <hi>on whose fide the separation stands,</hi> let us premise these things. 1. Every separation is not sinfull, even from a Church which hath the essentialls, yea and more then the essentialls, a man may go from one Church to another without hazard of separation. But further, in these cases separation is not schism. I. It if be from those (tho Never so many) who are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104445:262"/>
drawing back, and in so far as drawing back, from whatever peice of duty and integrity is attaind. For this is still tobe held fast, according to many scripture comands, as we shall shew. So Elias when Gods Covenant was forsaken, was as another Athanasius; (I, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>only am left)</hi> in point of tenacious integrity. 2ly, if we separat in that which a Nationall Church hath commanded us as her members to disown by her standing acts, and authority, while those from whom we separat own that corruption. 4. If Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters their supposed separation be ane officiating as they can have access, after a National Churches refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is overturnd, and they persecute from their watchtowers by these overturners. For in this case the persecuters separat from them, and chase them away. 4. There is a Lawfull forbearance of union and complyance with noto ious backsliders, in that which is of it self sinfull, or inductive to it, which is far from separation strictly taken; The commands <hi>of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from every appearance of evill,</hi> and <hi>hating the garment spotted with the flesh,</hi> do clearly include this. 5. Many things will warrand separation from such a particular Minister or congregation, which will not warrand separation from the Church National; nor infer it, by Mr Durhams acknowledgment <hi>(on scandal</hi> pag. 129.) For <hi>if scandals become excessive,</hi> he allowes <hi>to depart to another congregation.</hi> 6. There is a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withdrawing from persons and societies even in worship; the precepts, <hi>to avoid them that cause divisions and offences contrary to the received Doctrine,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. <hi>to come out from among the unclean &amp; be separat.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17 <hi>to cease from instruction that causes to erre from ehe words of knowledge, Prev.</hi> 19. 27. <hi>to save our selves from the untoward generation.</hi> Act. 2. 40, will clearly import this by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. 2dly, This charge <hi>of sinfull separation</hi> which they put on Gods people supposes many thigs which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104445:262"/>
must be proved, as first, that the Prelats and their adherents, are the only true organick Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which is denyed; her frame and constitution being such as it said; surely the Ministers and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours adhering to her reformation must be the true Church of Scotland tho the lesser number, as they should have been, <hi>if this prelatiok defection had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely popish.</hi> These souldiers who keep the Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rals or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are the true army, not the deserters of the same. Either the Church in this Nation as lately reformd &amp; constitute, and to whose constitution many Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists vowed adherence, was not the true organick protestant Church of Scotland, or this partie, whose constitution, Principles, Doctrine &amp; practice, are point blank contrary therunto, is not. 2. It supposed that there is <hi>no lawfull use of ordinances among Presbyterian Ministers,</hi> as persons who have no Lawfull call to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat in this case. Hence this man pleads for disow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them <hi>universally</hi> and <hi>absolutely;</hi> but we affirm they are Ministers standing in that relation to this Church, and under the obligation of Christs comand to officiat, which Conformists have not yet disproved 4. He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that every thing which may be expedient as to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and order of a Church, when enjoyning her <hi>full peacable constitution,</hi> will equally oblidge <hi>in her broken and persecute condition,</hi> when a prevailing backsliding party is in her bosome. Now; scripture and reasen will disprove this: circumstances of order must give place to important duties in extreme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity as this is: the scattered officers of the Church of Jerusalem, went every where preaching the gospel (Act. 8,) so did Ministers in the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. 4. It is supposed that <hi>our change is only as to government: and such only as was in King Iames time,</hi> both which we have showen to be false. 5. He takes for granted that their <hi>personal faults</hi> who are conformists,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104445:263"/>
and a supposed <hi>pullution of the worship</hi> therby, is our ground of non-union; and that our granting them to have <hi>the essence of a Ministeriall call,</hi> and that <hi>their scandals will not pollute the worship,</hi> will infer the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them in this our case, which is also false. For even upon this supposition, we are not bound to owne them no more then ane <hi>ingraind Schismatick,</hi> obtruded forcibly by a party of the congregation upon the rest of the people, might be ownd on this ground. 6 This man begs the question in supposing that the constitution and frame of the Prelacy now establish't, is <hi>the same with that of the ancient Church,</hi> for he often tels us that we would have separat from the ancient Church, upon the same grounds for which we disown Conformists. Whereas we have shewed the difference of our prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from theirs in many points. That our prelats both <hi>as Diocesian &amp; Erastian,</hi> are wholly discrepant from the ancient Bishops. 7. He takes it for granted, that Ministers who disown this course of backsliding <hi>their relation to their flocks is cut off,</hi> in the present posture of our Church, and that the Prelats and their substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts, (the Curats) are the onely proper representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church of Scotland, who accordingly have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the lawfull power and exercise of the keyes as to either admission or censure of Ministers. A principle alwayes disowned by our Church. See <hi>Protesters no subverters</hi> (pag. 96.) <hi>Rutherfoords due right of Presbyt.</hi> [pag. 430. 431.] <hi>Altare Damasc.</hi> (pag. 23.) 8.

Nay Apollonius thinks that the divine relation of a Minister to this Church, tho banisht from his native country, doth stand. <hi>Ius Majestatis circasacra part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 331. (9.) He still supposes that, what will not <hi>exse, or of it self plead for disowning the hearing of the gospel, or of a Minister simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer,</hi> will plead nothing in this our case <hi>for disowning Conformists.</hi> The mans weakness, personal faults, not lecturing &amp;c. are not of themselves sufficient to cut us off from hearing absolutely. But tho this be granted, we have the pure genuine Church of Scotland, and her faithful Ministry to adhere unto, and over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove these grounds mentiond, conformists <hi>schismatick practice, and corrupt Doctrine</hi> to lay to their charge, which will make this ground in our case very weighty and preponderating; and this the Informer himself must grant, for he will not say that such like preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or arguments in our case, were valid as to the owning of Nonconformists and des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rting of Curats. Moreover he will grant, that Presbyterian Ministers might Lawfully be heard, if Conformists were not standing in their way. Now so the case is in relation to Presbyterian Ministers pleading; for that none of these things which he mentions were valid to infer peoples disowning of Conformists, were there no other Ministers in Scotland, and if this Church had universally, both Ministers and people faln into this cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>se of backsliding, will be readily granted; But without any advantage to his cause, as is evident. To these many discoveries of his <hi>begging the question</hi> in this debate, our plea and arguments will be clearer if we add a short view of our suppositions in this case
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104445:264"/>
and question. Such as 1. our principle of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of prelacie. 2. The binding force of our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. 3. Our Churches divine tight to her Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and priviledges once establisht. 4. that this is a case both of defection, and persecution. 5. of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition betwixt Ministers &amp; professours contending for our Reformation, and a party of backsliders overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. 6. The tendency of this course of Prelatick defection, to raze our Reformation; and that if not prevented; it will end in propery. 7. That Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ministers relation to this Church, and their obligation to duty founded upon that relation, is not extinguished but subsists notwithstanding of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent violence and persecution, which they with their weeping mother are exposed unto. Having premised these things, from what is said we may draw forth at length the great state of the question thus, <hi>whether, when the Reformation of a National Church in Doctrine, worship, discipline and government, is by a backsliding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty overturnd, and a course-carryed on to raze it, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left a considerable body of Ministers &amp; professours, who stand in opposition to that course, and are in their capacities testifying against it, are these Ministers and professors who preach and hear in opposition to that course, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Ministry and hearers, the scismaticks?</hi> This being clearly the state of this question, we shall offer these arguments to fortifie our principle of disowning conformists in this our case, and denying a subjection to them as the Ministers of this Church, and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Presbyterian Ministers in the exercise of their Ministry, and acquit this principle and practise from the Informers charge of sinfull separation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whoever of the two partiss adhere unto the true genuine Church, owning her constitutions, authoritie and priviledges, its certain the contrary party must be the schismaticks; here it must be seen who are the

first departers, who have first broken the hedge, who have first disownd and opposed the Covenants, the Government, the sound and pure doctrine of this Church, in complyance with persecuters, surely they and they only are the schismaticks. Had not this inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion been made upon our Church and her priviledges, what would have been her Judgement of the present principles and practices of Conformists in any of her Lawfull courts? would they not have been judged censurable as the worst of Schismaticks?

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> upon such as withdraw from them as schismaticks, were not this a ridiculous charge; and Just so is that of Conformists in this case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every schism supposes ane obligation of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that Church from which the separation is made. Now then, let him prove <hi>ministers obligation to joyn into this Prelatick course</hi> (without which they will not admit them to officiat) and disprove <hi>our prior obligations to opposeit;</hi> or else Ministers obligation to preach, and peoples consequently to hear in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this course of defection, will stand good on the old grounds, and all the scripture comands (foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Pastours of this Church their Ministerial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) to set the trumpet to their mouth, and give a Ministerial testimony against this defection, and peoples obligation to hear and take warning, will press and plead for that which he calls schism and a sinfull separation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence Presbyterian Ministers, and professors are in this their practise never toched, by all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and defences, but these are weapons in their hands against him and the conforming party. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas he pleads <hi>the essence of the ministeriall call,</hi> which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104445:265"/>
conformists lay claim unto, Presbyterian Ministers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that <hi>Nonconforming Ministers have this,</hi> that they are Ministers of this Church, and have a better right to officiat as her true pastours then Prelatists. And if this will not plead for hearing Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, why shall this argument be thought valide for hearing Curats? is not the same way from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> and from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens?</hi> if his concession tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>the essence of their Ministerial</hi> call, will not (with him) infer <hi>hearing Non-conformists,</hi> because of their <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed schism:</hi> Ergo <hi>a fortiori</hi> it will not infer <hi>the hearing of Curats,</hi> who <hi>really are such.</hi> 2. he pleads that <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and failings in administrators,</hi> or <hi>even some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in ordinances,</hi> will not infer <hi>disowning of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> Why then pleads he for <hi>disowning Presbyterian Ministers</hi> and <hi>ordinances adminis red by them,</hi> to whom this is so clarly applicable. 3ly, he pleads <hi>union.</hi> But let him say, what was the order and union of this Church before these innovations? was it <hi>ane union under Prelacie, Erastianism, and persurious breach of Covenant;</hi> was not our Churches Reformation in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, worship, discipline and Goverment, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful order and union? Now who broke this? supppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se we should Plead <hi>union,</hi> against his withdrawing Presbyterian professours from Presbyterian Ministers, will he owne this pleading? or not rather disowne it, because he thinks <hi>our union is schismatical;</hi> well, so we hold and do prove <hi>the prelatick union</hi> to be: &amp; therefore untill he disprove our charge against his party, this pleading is null.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Divines, do tell us (particularly Timorcus chap. 7. page 32.) <q>that a sinfull separation which falls within the compass of schism, is <hi>from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a Church as walking according to the divine rule;</hi> otherwise, if the Churches deviation specially be great, there is no fear of any guilt by schism in depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104445:265"/>
from it; and hence infers, that unless absolvers can instruct that prelacy is <hi>juris divini,</hi> disowning and abjuring it cannot be schismatical.</q> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this man himself grants, that schism in its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acceptation, <hi>is taken for a causless separating,</hi> and that <hi>where communion with a Church cannot be held without sin, in that case separation is necessary.</hi> Now then if we can prove, <hi>that our non union is not causless,</hi> and that <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be held with Conformists (in our case and circumstances) without sin,</hi> we are not Schismaticks by his oun confession. To clear then this great point of the sinfulness of owning them in their demanded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; we offer these considerations. 1. Owning them and subjecting our selves to their Ministry as the Pastours of this Church, hath a <hi>palpable breach of Covenant in it</hi> as the case now stands, for all along we must suppose its binding force, and that there is a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable body of Ministers &amp; professours contending for it, and that the question is, to which of the parties contending we are bound to adhere, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our principles anent its binding force, and the unlawfulness of Prelacie, which this man cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. The owning of them in the manner above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed is a breach of Covenant many wayes. speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as this man pleads for it, with a totall disowning of Presbyterian Ministers in their Ministry. In this case it is a <hi>resiling from what we have attain'd in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> contrary to the first article, wherein we are bound to maintain purity of worship and Doctrine as then establisht. Now their preaching is for the most part consisting of <hi>corrupt doctrine</hi> contrary to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? And their prayers have severall petitions with which we cannot joyn, such as for prospering Prelats and their courses; Not to speak of the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the lecture, repeating of the creed at baptism, singing a set forme of conclusion, or what innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104445:266"/>
in worship are introduced. Again, this is a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ience with promoters of this course of backsliding, and a <hi>suffering our selves to be withdrawen from our union</hi> engadged unto, and a denyall of suteable <hi>assistance to faithfull Ministers contending for the Covenant</hi> against backsliders, all which are contrary to the other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thereof. This will be specially clear, if it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considered. That 1. The body of presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters being ejected, if disown'd in the manner and extent pleaded for by this Informer, the presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian interest, and our Reformation according to the Covenant, will be extinct, sold and betrayed. 2. Hearing Curats and peoples subjecting themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to their Ministry as the Pastours of this Church. is by the Rulers required as <hi>a direct badge and Test of owning Erastianism and prelacie, in opposition to the Covenant &amp; work of Reformation:</hi> So that its <hi>a case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> now to adhere to a faithfull Ministry conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for it. 3. Ther's no other way to exoner our consciences before God and the World, and Declare our nonconformitie to this course of backsliding, but by this practice, there is no getting of wrongs redrest, or corruptions in the Ministry removed. Thus the Apology pag. 272. 4. We are in the Covenant engadged against <hi>Indifferency,</hi> in this great work of Reformation, and is not this the way to fall into it more and more. 5. We engadge that we shall ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avour, that <hi>this work of Reformation shall remain invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to posterity.</hi> But what memory shall the posterity have of this work if prelats and curats be thus submitted unto? 6. We engadge opposition in our capacity to all prelatick malignant enemies of the Lords worke and interest; but how is it performd when we thus strengthen their hands, in their avowed opposition therunto. 7. How <hi>assist we and Defend in this common cause of Religion and liberty, such as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:104445:266"/>
                  <hi>into this league,</hi> when we thus Divide from our suffering brethren, wound and offend them and shake off a faithfull Covenant-keeping Ministry. 8 How maintain we our reformed Doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and union, when thus owning false prophets, and the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge, and such as cause Divisions and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrary to the Doctrine we have Learnd. Prov. 19. 27. Rom. 16. 17, 18. 9. How <hi>maintain we the priviledges of our Church and her Reformed Government?</hi> when owning intruding prelats and their creatures as Ministers of this Church, and disowning her true Ministers, now taking her by the hand. This practice is ane approving of Curats call and mission, rather then that of presbyterian Ministers, which no man will deny to be contrary to the Covenant. Next, owning and adhering to Curats in this our case, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our principles, hath <hi>an accession to much guilt otherwise,</hi> such as. 1. The owning of a palpably blasted, and Disowning a palpably sealed Ministry. 2 A high reflection on the sufferings of many Godly upon this ground. 3. A shutting of our eyes against Ministerial Discoveries of the sin and duty of the time. 4. A casting of our selves on tentations of greater complyance. 5. A breaking of fellowship with these that are contending for Gods worke and denying a sympathy with them, yea a trampling on their blood which has been shed on this ground. 6. A disowning the Ministeriall authority, and tearing the commission of Christs faithfull Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and depriving our selves of the blessing and benefit of their Labours &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This practice of denying a Subjection to the Ministry of Conformists, and of our Rulers demanded conformity therin unto the present course of defection, will be found to fall under great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104445:267"/>
                  <hi>scripture obligations, such as</hi> 1. The obligation of <hi>perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in integrity, and holding it fast.</hi> Colos. 1. 23. Heb. 10: 23. Psal. 25. 21. Supposing prelacy unlawfull, and the binding force of the Covenants in reference to all the work of reformation as it stood establisht, this practice is clearly cross to the premised obligation, both as ane acknowledgement of prelacy and Erasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani me, and also as a Disowning of faithfull Ministers. 2. The obligation of <hi>keeping at the greatest Distance from sin,</hi> exprest Jude 23. 1 Thess. 5. 22. 1 Tim. 5. 22. will infer Disowning Curats in this case. 1. All Direct, or interpretative consent to sin, is here Discharged. 2. A practice otherwise lawfull, will on this ground become <hi>inexpedient hic &amp; nunc.</hi> We must not eat in the case of offence, tho we may freely eat all meats Rom. 14. 14. 1 Cor. 10. 25. Now on the forementiond Suppositions, the owning of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats hath an accession to their sin, beyond that of ane <hi>apearance or a touch,</hi> It being both a Deserting the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministry, and a badge of conformity to Erastian prelacy, and all the corruption and defection of the time, which is therby advanc'd &amp; promoted, 'tis also in this case of competition, a deliberat adherence to the prelatick rather then presbyterian interest. 3. The great obligation of <hi>a testimony to truth and Duty,</hi> exprest Heb. 10. 23. Mat. 10. 32. will plead for this practice, <hi>All truth</hi> must be avowed, &amp; <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally avowed.</hi> We must walk <hi>circumspectly, or exactly</hi> as the Word imports, &amp; we must avow truth &amp; duty on the greatest hazard; even the smallest mater is great, when <hi>a testimony is concernd in it,</hi> were it but the circumstance of <hi>an open window,</hi> Daniel durst not ommit it upon the greatest hazard. And as this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny must be <hi>full,</hi> so must it also be <hi>constant.</hi> Demas shame is, that the aflictions of the gospel made him forsake the Apostle after great appearances for Christ, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104445:267"/>
embrace this present world. And beside, whatever <hi>truth or duty is opposed,</hi> that becomes <hi>the speciall object of this testimony.</hi> Hence Ministers and Professours in their capacity are called to contend for this Work of Reformation; and Ministers silence as to <hi>a Ministerial testimony</hi> against this course of backsliding, and <hi>people's disowning them,</hi> and <hi>adhering to Conformists,</hi> is so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably cross therunto, as nothing can be more. 4. This practice is inferd from the scripture obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to guard <hi>against the slumbling and offending our brethren,</hi> exprest 2 Cor. 6. 3. Math. 18. 6. 1 Cor. 10. 32. Here is Discharged any <hi>Dictum vel factum quo alius deterior redditur, saith Polanus.</hi> Whatever practice gives occasion of our brothers sinning, of calling truth in question, of acting with a Doubting conscience, or which weakens his plerophory or assurance, is here discharged. And neither the lawfulness nor Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the thing it self, nor mens Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it, Nor the weakness, yea or wickedness of those in hazard to be stumbled, will warrand the Doing of that out of which offence arises. Paul De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares all meats lawfull, yet will not eat in case of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence 1 Cor. 10. 25. 1 Cor. 8. 13. This Declaring of <hi>the lawfulness of that practice,</hi> is equivalent to <hi>any civill Declarator or Law</hi> which alters not the nature of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. Paul will not have the weak stumbled Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. 8. 11, 12. Nor give occasion to the malicious who desired occasion 2 Cor. 11. 12. Now owning of Curats as the case is now circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat doth harden them in their apostacy, and hath a tendency to wound the peace of the godly who dare not owne them, or may provoke them to act against their light; and therefore unless owning them could be proved a necessary duty, as matters now stand, the premisd scripture obligation will infer it to be sinfull. 5. disowning conformists will clearly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104445:268"/>
follow from the scripture obligation, <hi>to turn away from seducers,</hi> and such as turn aside from Gods way. 2 Tim. 3. 1. The apostle having given a large Induction of evills adhering to these in the last dayes, putting among the rest of their black <hi>Theta's, Covenant breaking,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his discovery with this grand precept (ver. 5.) <hi>from such turn away.</hi> We must beware of false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the concision, and of such as walk not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the received ordinances, Math. 7. 15. Rom. 16. 17. Philip. 3. 2. 2 Thess. 3. 6. Christs sheep do flee from the stranger, and hear not his voice. Iohn. 10, 27. 1. All promoters of wayes contrary to the simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the gospel, are here commanded to be eschewed. 2. We must know and discover such by their fruits and practicall unfaithfulness, as well as false Doctrine, Mat. 7. 16. compared with 2 Tim. 3. These that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically act the foxes Cant. 2. 15. are to be taken away, and consequently eschewed, the saints must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed against these <hi>that ly in wait to deceive,</hi> God disowns these that make sad the hearts of the godly and strengthen the hands of evill doers. Ezek 13. 22. such as stand not in his counsel Ier. 33. 22. &amp; cause peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to err by their lies and lightness. Ier. 26. 32. Now upon the forementiond suppositions its clear that Conformists are leading aside from our Reformation, opposing the principles &amp; priviledges, of this Church; they are <hi>Covenant breakers</hi> from whom we are <hi>to turn away;</hi> they are speaking peace to the wicked, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the wound slightly, and are ruling with force and rigour Ezek. 34. 4. 1 Pet. 5. 3. Witness their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent violence. 6. This practice of Presbyterian Ministers officiating in opposition to this course, and peoples ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to their Ministry, is inferr'd from the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obligation of <hi>many terrible charges and adjurations laid upon Ministers, in reference to a faithfull diligence in their Ministerial function, and a suteable Ministerial testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:104445:268"/>
                  <hi>concerning the sin and duty of the time,</hi> which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly inclusive of their peoples reciprocal diligence, in attending their Ministry, and their obedience and faithfull adherence accordingly. They are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>cry aloud and shew the people their sin Isa.</hi> 58. 1. and as they would not have the blood of souls upon them, to give faithfull warning touching sin and duty, and their peoples case and hazard, especially in times of great sin and judgement, when God is terribly pleading his controversy with them Ezek. 3. 17. hence they are enjoyned <hi>to be instant in season and out of season, reproving, rebuking and exhorting with all long suffering and Doctrine</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. And as faithfull <hi>watchmen on Ierusalems walls, never to hold their peace day nor night till she be establisht, and made a praise in the earth Isa.</hi> 62. 6. <hi>to fulfill and make full pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And as these comands in order to Ministerial dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, do singularly oblige herunto in this case, so the <hi>scripture woes and threatnings thundered against Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters negligence and unfaithfulness,</hi> are very convincing and awakening. See Ezek. chap. 3. and chap. 13. 5. 6: Hence on the forementiond suppositions it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. 1. That Ministers are oblidged to be constantly instant in season and out of season, in their Ministerial testimony against this course of defection. 2. This case of defection and persecution ampliats and extends this duty to all to whom they can have access, as the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered preachers Acts. 8. Went every where prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the gospel, after that persecution that arose about Stephen. 3. This Ministerial testimony upon the forementioned grounds, must be levelled at all the corruptions of the times, and all the branches and degrees of our defection. 4. The duty and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of God, is reciprocall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable therunto. And if hearing Curats and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104445:269"/>
disowning Presbyterian Ministers, be not inconsistent with this great obligation, let any Iudge.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in a Reformed Church, which having overturnd her Reformation, hath shut out, laid aside, and persecute away sound adherers therunto both Ministers and professours, and will not admit Ministers to officiat, but upon the sinfull terms of complyance with their way, cannot charge the sound party with schism in standing where they were, &amp; own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prosecuting their respective duties, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and flocks, in opposition to these overturners and backsliders. For this would justify the most ingraind schism that ever was heard of; Now so the case is here, for all Presbyterian Ministers are cast out, and they and all sound professours adhering to them persecute, unless they will retract their principles, and conform to prelacie. Ministers, in taking up a new tenour and exercise of their Ministry in a precarious servile dependence upon Erastian prelacy, headed and influenced by a meer civil papacy; And people, in subjecting themselves to the Ministry of the servile deputes of Erastian prelates, as a badge of their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty complyance with, and submission unto, this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous supremacy, and consent to the overturning of the pure constitution and reformation of this Church. So that the Presbyterians their plea is an owning of duty against Schismaticks disowning it. Do not our Divines tell the Romanists on this ground, <hi>that they have seperat and persecute us away from them, and that therefore the schism lyes upon themselves, not on us:</hi> So the case is here. Let this man say, what would have been the judgement of our Church in any of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer judicatories, anent a party owning such princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as Conformists do, and persecuting or casting out all that oppose them, and dare not concurr in their course of backsliding in overturning the sworn
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104445:269"/>
Reformation of this Church; I dare appeal to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former himself, if such would not have been judged censurable as the worst of Schismaticks. And he can assigne nothing now to turn or cast the scale, no ground of disparity, unless he place it in this, <hi>that prelatists are the greater number, and have the civil power on their side.</hi> And if this pityfull plea will carry it, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists have long since outweighed the protestant Churches in this debate, which this man will not for very shame admit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This practice of adhering to Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and disowning Curats, hath nothing of the <hi>ingredients of schismor, sinfull separation from this Church,</hi> included therein, as matters now stand, and as the question is stated on the forementioned hypotheses. Which will appeare in these cleare positions in the point of schism (which are evident in their own light) being applyed and brought home to our present case. 1. Schism is <hi>a starting out from under due relations to a Church and from her Ministry,</hi> and duties accordingly. But in this our case, and practise under debate, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and professours <hi>are pursuing the duties of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective relation to this Church,</hi> as it stood reformed and establisht before these innovations, and the Apostat prelatick party are doing the contrary. 2. In a sinfull Schismatick separation, it is alwayes supposed <hi>that the withdrawing, is from those who are holding the communion of the true Church,</hi> otherwise we lose the basis and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all sound definitions of schism. But here the persecute party <hi>are owning the Reformation of this pure Church against a party of separatists,</hi> who have broken her order, union, and National vows; and who are also censurable by all her standing acts. 3. In a proper Schismatick separation, <hi>the principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of these from whom the separation is made, are supposed to be subservient to that Churches union, right establishment,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104445:270"/>
                  <hi>and for maintaining her communion;</hi> but to separat from those whose principles and practice is a stated opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and in so far as an opposition) to her purity and Reformation, is to maintain her true union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and not sinfully to separat from it.</p>
               <p>The Assumption as to this practice under debate, might be cleard by a large induction of particulars. If we take a view of the two parties (Presbyterian and prelatical) their carriage in relation to this Church: It will be evident, 1. In general. That Conformists their principles and practice, is a direct impeachment of our establisht reformation, and that Presbyterians are maintaining and adhering to the same. 2. Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists do avowedly disowne and abjure our Covenants, Presbyterians adhere unto and owne the same. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists are breaking and dissipating our Churches establisht order and union, Presbyterians are in this practice contending for both; the one party is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Church both by persecution and reproach, the other is taking her by the hand, endeavouring her help and comfort in this her deep distresse, and so the Covenant obliges to disowne the first, and adhere to the second. 4. The one is censurable by her, the other deserves her praise. Now can there be any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in this, to which of these parties people are obliged to adhere according to the principles of our Reformation.</p>
               <p>In the 4th place, In a sinfull separation as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in worship, it must be supposed, <hi>the worship of that Church ownd and establisht therein,</hi> because a party innovating herein, as well as innovating in doctrine and government contrary to that which is establisht, are <hi>hactenus, and ipso facto</hi> (in this their practice, and upon this very ground) schismaticks both in their worship and government. Therefore to disowne them therein can be no schism; for this would involve a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104445:270"/>
palpable contradiction, that these withdrawers in this same practice, and in the same respects and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances therof, were Schismaticks and not Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Now prelatists their doctrine is new and odd, and not the voice of this Church. And their worship, (over and above the corruption adhering to it) is the worship of an innovating party, and contrary to our Churches establisht order. And therfore to disowne them therein is no sinfull separation from this Church her fellowship and worship, while existing in her sound and purer part, and opposing these innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In Schismatick separation, <hi>the rent is made in the bowels of the true and genuine Church.</hi> So that when a schism and rent is stated betwixt a godly Ministry contending for a pure Churches Reformation, against an apostat party of the Ministry: the sound professours stand preobliged to adhere unto, and strength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

The <hi>union</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of this Church, is already broken by the prelatick innovators and backsliders, and by them only; so that upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of this fixed schism, the people of God must adhere to the sound Church and Ministry. And in this <hi>extreme necessity,</hi> the <hi>lesser obligation</hi> as to parochial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, must give place to the <hi>greater duties</hi> of preserving and maintaining the Churches union and reformation, when a course is carried on tending to ruine it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Every sinfull separation is, <hi>from the fellowship of a Church either in her Ministry, lawfull courts, or Worship and ordinances,</hi> according to the various relations, state and condition of Separatists, whether Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or others. But in this our case, Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and professours separat in none of these respects
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104445:271"/>
from the genuine Church of Scotland. 1. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters separat not from <hi>her courts;</hi> for none of her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courts are now publickly own'd or existent. 2. People separate not from <hi>her Worship,</hi> as it stood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and vowed unto, when they owne the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances dispensed by her true pastours,</hi> for that only is the true Worship of this Church. Nor 3. from <hi>her Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>a due subjection to her faithfull pastours in the Lord:</hi> And therefore neither from the fellowship of her faithful Ministers and professours. Where is then the Schism? Since both the Doctrine, Worship and Government of this true Church are ownd, and backsliders and Schismaticks only (and as such) are disownd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Schism supposes that these whom we withdraw from, <hi>are such to whom we are under obligation to adhere:</hi> for it is <hi>a breach of union,</hi> which is cemented and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate by the <hi>obligations</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> of those who are concerned to hold it fast; So that where <hi>the obligation to the duty</hi> in subserviency to this union cannot be demonstrate, to be incumbent upon such and such persons, and in such acts, By whom and wherein this union is to be upheld, the charge of <hi>Schism</hi> upon these acts, which are supposed to violat that union, evanishes and falls to the ground.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104445:271"/>
grant <hi>that it is no breach of any of his rules or reasons to hear them.</hi> That [they are Ministers] and [are prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith and repentance] that [they have a lawfull Ministeriall call and ordination &amp;c.] All these he thinks will plead nothing, as the case is now circumstantiat, for adhering to them, because of that in their present condition, which outweighs all this, and looses peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples obligation to owne them, which he thinkes is no Schism but duty: Now, let our Informer turn the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; if there be first that in Curats present state, which preponderats as to our disowning of them now, tho all that he pleads as to their <hi>ordination,</hi> and <hi>ministerial call</hi> were granted, its no Schism in this our case to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne them according to his own principles and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this point. 2. He must grant that denying to hear <hi>hic &amp; nunc, and in such a complex case,</hi> is different from <hi>a denying to hear simpliciter,</hi> or <hi>disowning such a mans Ministry simpliciter,</hi> or absolutely, as he will grant that out of this case <hi>Presbyterian Ministers might be heard,</hi> and that disowning them is not <hi>simpliciter a disowning a true Ministry or Church, or them as Ministers;</hi> So that its this <hi>case of competition with Conformists,</hi> which with him casts the ballance. Hence as matters now are stated and circumstantiat, and upon our principles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Hypotheses, he must grant there is that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists case, which <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> will loose our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to <hi>receive the ordinances from them as the ministers of this Church,</hi> which is the <hi>white in the marke</hi> wherat all his arrows are shot. Such as 1. that we are preo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by a lawful Oath to extirpat and disowne them. 2. That they are promoters of a Prelatick designe to ruine our Reformation. 3. That they have avowedly disownd our Covenants, and that we are commanded by the overturners of our Covenanted Reformation, to hear them as a badge of our renouncing it; and concurring in this course of backsliding. 4. That they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104445:272"/>
are intruders, and not entring in at the door, and in the way and order of this Church; That they are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thrusting out, and persecuring her faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, that they perjuriously renounce a call from the people, and ordination by the Presbyterie. All which grounds he must either grant will supersede our obligation to owne conformists <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> according to our principles, or quite his plea and pleading as to the disowning of Presbyterian Ministers in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Ministry.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He pleads in the close of the preceeding Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>that the covenant abjures Sel isme.</hi> Now let us stand to this Decision; the Informer will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfyed if I shall borrow one of his topicks, and shoot ane arrow from his own bow; I would offer then to him this syllogisme. That Schism which he pleads against is a Schism abjured in the Covenant: but disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conformists in their present state &amp; circumstances, &amp; refusing to be subject to them as the Ministers of this Church, is not a schism abjur'd in the Covenant; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The assumption I prove thus. If the disowning of Presbyterian Ministers in their present state and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and withdrawing from them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Ministerial function and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial testimony against prelacy and for the Covenant, be that schism which is abjurd therin then a refusing to be subject to Curats (against whom they are testifying as the Covenant breakers, and upholders of prelacy) ad not owning them as the Ministers of this Church, cannot be that scism. Unless he will mak this scism, such a Janus as will cast a maligne condemning aspect upon both the contending parties, and bring adherers unto either of the two, under this imputation. But so it is that disowning of Presbyterian Ministers in the exercise of their Ministry, is condemned in the Covenant as schism this we have already made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104445:272"/>

now to examine the grounds on which this new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suist imputes <hi>sinfull separation</hi> to us therein, We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the evil of <hi>Schism</hi> upon these Texts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him, which might have caused sad reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on himself and his party, who are guilty of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and offences contrary to our received ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the doctrine of this Church: And so are lashed by that Scripture Rom. 16. 17. And who would have have us saying I am of this or that Rabbi or Prelat, contrary to 1 Cor. 1: 12. It's they who have disownd a spirituall pure unity with this pure Church, and are seeking a perjurious union in departing from God, contrary to that precept Ephes. 4: 3. And are so far from esteeming others in Lowliness of mind better then themselves, as we are enjoynd. Phil 2. 2. That their Rabbies trample on all Ministers; and their underlings do most insolently persecute and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise faithfull Pastours for adhering to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, authority, and union of this Church, against their innovations. Schism is no doubt an evill which hath much infested the Church, and our Church: and the Scripture sufficiently discovering the evill thereof we need not Cyprian, nor Jeroms elogies anent unity, to persuaed it. Only where he insinuats from that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cyprian, which he mentions. Who asserts from 1 Cor. 13. [that who are slain in their Schism, their inexpiable sin is not purged by their blood, and that they are not Martyrs] that such is the case of the suffering people of God at this time; we may discern the cruell venome and sting of this mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, for all the sobriety which he pretends unto; I shall only tell him, that as its more then he will be ever able to prove, that the Lords remnant are guilty of this sin, and are assembling <hi>out of the Church,</hi> when attending the Ministry of Christs faithfull Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in this Church, so he and his fellows sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104445:273"/>
these murderers upon them in this duty, will (if they repent not) be exposed to that vengeance which the cry of their souls under the altar, who have been slain for this their Testimony, doth plead for. He would also do well to resolve this doubt upon Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Testimony, viz. Whether Cyprian did ever hold, or if himself will dare to assert, <hi>that the blood and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the best of martyrs did expiat their guilt.</hi> As for Jeroms assertion [that Schism. and Heresy, or some degree of it go together.] I think it is fitly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to himself and fellow Conformists, who since their departing from the unity of this Church, and her sworn Reformation, have not only, to justify their course vented gross errours in point of Oaths, and otherwise, but are now (as every one sees) posting fast to Rome, in denying many and great points of our Protestant profession. We accord to Augustines saying [that separatists (as such) receive no life from the body] &amp; the unquestionable godliness, &amp; fellowship with the Father and the Son, to which many Presbyterians are admitted, and wherein they shine, compared with the abominable prophanity of the whole of those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that owne Curats, will by this rule declare who are the Schismaticks, and separatists from Christs body.

Is very suteable to him, and those of his way, who have now of a long time rent the Lords faithfull flock, wounded our Church, and taken away her vail: esteeming themselves Christians of the first magnitude, so he esteems his most reverend Arch-Bishops and reverend under-fathers; What pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull preambles are these.</p>
               <p>The Doubter alleadges [that every separation is not schism.] This (as we heard) he acknowledges, and that <hi>when communion with a Church cannot be held without sin, separation is necessary;</hi> wherein he yeelds all that we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104445:274"/>
plead; since we have proved that in this our case, joyning to their way and party is in many respects sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and since he Instances <hi>the protestants plea for sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from Rome on this ground,</hi> knowes he not that the Papists tell us such stories anent <hi>union with the Church, and that suffering without the Church is no Christian suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> to Iustifie their bloody persecutions, which very well sutes his case. And no doubt the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants answer, viz. [That we are in Christs Church, because owning his truth, tho separat from their sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But the great charge followes, viz. That <hi>we are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of as groundless and unreasonable separation, as we shall read of in any age of the Church. Bona verba!</hi> How is this made good? <hi>first,</hi> (saith he) <hi>in casting off Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian love which is heart Schism.</hi> 2. He chargeth with <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Schism in separating in acts of Worship.</hi> Now what if we recriminat in both these, and retort this double charge upon himself. Have they not disownd the Worship of Presbyterian ministers &amp; Professours, and charged all to separat from them, meerly for non-complyance with their perjured Prelats? 2. Have they not for many years glutted themselves with their blood, I may say sweemd in it, upon the same very ground of forbearance as to prelatick complyance, and endeavour by multiplyed lawes and Acts, to root them out of the very nation? Good Sir, Pull this beam out of your own eye, that you may see a litle clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in this point. But as to the first he sayes, that we <hi>make difference in Iudgement as to lesser matters</hi> (Church Government) <hi>a ground of difference in affection, as if they were no Christians who are not of our persuasion in these things, putting thus lesser points into our creed,</hi> and un

I thinke Christian affection to their souls, is best seen in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and testifying against their soul-destroying sins. <hi>Thou shalt by any means rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him</hi> is an old standing rule.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104445:275"/>
man seeing his first flight or Rodomontade too fierce; he did well to clap his wings closser. Upon a review of this page, I find our Informer in this charge playes but the pityfull Camelion and versipellis: for finding that this assertion of his, <hi>that Christians of all ages since Christs time and in all places have own'd Bishops, Liturgies, Festival dayes and other ceremonies,</hi> would have drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the heavy burthen and task of a proofe, he lightens himself of this burthen, by a prudent <hi>[almost]</hi> which in this point is very significant. But his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the liturgies, Festivals, and other ceremonies within the compass of the last thousand years (sullied with all popish abominations) appearing too simple inadvertency, within the compass of two or three lines, he secures it with a <hi>[much above.]</hi> But lest this prove too broad reckoning, he instances <hi>the second or third cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi> from whence he sayes, we beginne our reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to Bishops, festivals, liturgies, and other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. But 1. why mends he the matter so inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently, as to run in such a wide uncertainty as the the length of 200 yeares in that calculation which he imputes to us. 2. I challenge him to shew what presbyterian writter did ever commence the original of liturgies and festivals, with his blind &amp;c. of other ceremonies (which will travell who knowes whither, and include who knowes what) from the third, far less the second century. I affirm that its more then he or any for him can prove, that the Church hath had Bishops, liturgies, and festivals since Christ. Our writters have abundantly proved the contrary; and we challenge him to shew either his Diocesan Bishops, liturgies, or festivals and the &amp;c. of his ceremonies, in the first Apostolick Church, or in these two ages mentioned by him. That there were not diocesan Bishops then or long after, we have already proved, and far less Erastian
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104445:275"/>
Prelats. For holy dayes, let him shew by divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment any other then the Christian Sabath, in the Apostolick Church if he can, or in the first succeeding ages. As for the feast of Esther, it is acknowledged to have come in by custome after the Apostolick times. For liturgies, we assert that the Apostolick Church and age knew no such thing as set &amp; impos'd liturgies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, other then Christs prescriptions as to baptism &amp; the Lords supper, and that they pray'd as was suteable to the present action and circumstances of time, place, and persons; If he betake him to the liturgies which are ascribed to Peter, James, Mathew, Andrew, Clement, Mark, Dionisius Areopagite, and other Disciples: protestant writers will stigmatize him for embracing that which they have abundantly proved to be counterfit. That liturgies had no place for a long time in the Church, is proved by clear testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; Tertullian (Apol. cap. 30.) shews <q>that in their publick Assemblies christians did pray <hi>sine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitore quia de pectore,</hi> that is, <hi>without a prescription because from their heart.</hi> And in his treatise <hi>de Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> sayes, that there are somethings to be asked according to the occasions of every man—that the Lords prayer being laid as a fundation, its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to build on that fundation other prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every ones occasion. Agustine epist. 121. tells us that <hi>liberum est,</hi> Its free to ask what was in the Lords prayer <hi>alijs atque alijs modis,</hi> some times one way somtimes another. Likewise Justin Martyr Apol. 2. tells us that he who Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the people pray'd according to his ability <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</q> We might also tell him of Bishop Andrews success, or rather disappointment in seeking an old Jewish Liturgie, which when sent to Cambridge to be translated, was found to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed long after the Jews rejection, so the Bishop
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104445:276"/>
being asham'd, suffered this notion to die and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie never saw the light. See Smectim and Didoclav. pag. 615, 16, 17, 18, 19. &amp; seq. 2. What consequence is this, that because we disowne a Schismatick party of Innovators introducing these corruptions mentioned: Ergo we disowne them as no Churches wherein these have been admitted. Must we bring in, or comply with every corruption once purged out, the retaining wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be consistent with the essence of a true Church? what consequence or reason is here? Again, doth not he and all his brethren stand in direct opposition to the order and government of the Presbyterian Church of this Nation, and unto all that own's the same: will he then admit this consequence that he unchurches her before prelacie came in, and other reform'd Churches govern'd Presbyterially. So we see himself must acknowledge this his reasoning naught.</p>
               <p>The Doubter alledges [that these things mention'd, are of later date then the Apostles.] To this he ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers that <hi>Bishops were from the Apostles time.</hi> The contrary wherof we have proved either as to diocesan or Erastian Bishops, such as he means, yea even a <hi>proestos</hi> which in the Apostolick age had no place, as we have made appear. Next, He tells us that <hi>Polycra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in the debate about keeping of Esther with Victor Bishop of Rome, alledged Iohns authority.</hi> But <hi>how proved he this,</hi> is the Question, not <hi>what he alledged;</hi> surely bare alledging, as in other cases, so specially in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is bad probation; Then he asks, <hi>if we will hence infer that they were no good christians who used these things suppose that they came in after the Apostles times?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer we thinke that in so far as innovating they were not <hi>Sound Christians,</hi> and so must he thinke unless he will be wise above what the Apostles have written; Then he tells us, <hi>that from Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>It appears that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit</hi>

Ans.</hi> 1. How proves he, that the points in controversy viz. prelacie, laying aside our vows and Covenants, Erastianism, litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and festival-dayes for mystical ends and uses, are such nothings or indifferent matters, as meats or dayes were at that time, wherin <hi>pro re nata</hi> the Church might use her liberty. As for diocesan Erastian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, we have made its antiscriptural complexion to appear, so that it is not within the compass of any Lawfull liberty of the Church to embrace or establish it; We have also made the binding force of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants appear, and that the laying aside of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, is a horrid guiltyness, which this liberty can never be extended unto. Likewise the liturgies and imposing of set formes of prayer, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricting publick Worship therunto, have been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently impugned from Scripture and divine reason, by several of the godly learned, and discovered to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the spiritual liberty of Gospel Worship. The holy dayes also have with the same evidence been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by our divines, who have proven that they do impinge upon our Christian liberty, are contrary to the fouth command enjoyning worke all the six dayes, except on such occasionall fasts and feasts as are held out in the word, &amp; likewise are reprobate by the New Testament prohibitions about superstitious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dayes: The Jewish dayes being abrogat (as the Informer cannot but grant) how dare we impose upon our selves a new yoke? If it were here perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to dilate upon these points, our principles herein might be abundantly fortifyed, and the truth cleard

Again, that tolerance which the Apostle speaks of as to dayes and meats, relates to that time and case only of the weak Jews, when the ceremonies tho dead were not yet buryed (as they were to be honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) especially while the temple of Jerusalem stood, and the legal worship therein by Gods providence was continued. But as these observances were ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to the Gentiles (except as to blood and things strangled for that exigence only of the weak Jews) so after when christian liberty was known, and this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exigence was over, and the ceremonies buried, It is within the liberty of no Church to unbury them, or tolerat these or such like observances in others. Finally this very text condemns him, tho his begged supposition were granted. For 1. <hi>The eater must not despise him that eats not:</hi> why then do Conformists pursue Nonconformists, with such grievous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Lawes? they not only despise but persecute to the death, and vilely reproach them; <hi>who art thou that judgest another mans servant?</hi> why then do they Judge &amp; censure Nonconformists so highly in their pulpits and pamphlets (and the Informer in this) as Schismaticks, of as deep a dye as ever the Church was infested with? 2. <hi>He that but Doubts is damned if he eat,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Why then do they so violently press conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doubters to their way? 3. <hi>If thy brother be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>with thy meat, thou walks not chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</hi> Why then are they so uncharitable as to grieve Nonconformists with prelatick exactions? if the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and despising the forbearer be forbidden, much more are their cruell edicts and constraining Lawes,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104445:277"/>
whereby they burden the consciences of tender for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers in this case. The practice of <hi>Victor</hi> as to the Asian Churches, was no doubt highly uncharitable, but it was so mainly because of his censuring about such a trifle as Esther-observation; &amp; we see from this schism the sad effects of innovations; and that the Churches unity &amp; peace is best keept by adhering to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the gospel: and so our departing from the gospel simplicity in point of government, and introducing abjured prelacy, is the chief ground of the present schism, and confusions in this Church.</p>

Again, how proves he that no assemblies are orderly except the Prelatical? we avow our meetings for worship, to be the most orderly according to our Churches established Reformation, and that their Assemblies are cross to her constution, order, and union, both in respect of Curats perjurious intrusion, the doctrine which they deliver, and their manner of worship, which is cross to this Churches practice and appeintment; his charge of <hi>schism</hi> and <hi>disorderliness</hi> is still begged, but not yet

Let him produce (if he can) in our Assemblies for worship, that which is contraire unto the nature, constitution, and worship of the assemblies mentioned in that scripture; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this be, we may on better ground recriminat this charge upon his withdrawing people from the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Presbyterian ministers and professors.</p>
               <p>The Doubter alledges poorly that all do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their parochial Assemblies, but some do now and then keep them. He Answers, that <hi>tho all withdraw not in alike degree, yet the least degree is unwarrantable—that people advance from step to step, that some after with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from them, hear only the Indulged, or those who have still preached without conformity in their own Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and within a little will hear none of them; that some hear in their own Churches but will not communicat, the reason whereof he cannot understand, since the efficacy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments depends not on the Minister, that the lest degree of separation makes way for a greater—that Baxter in his cure of Church divisions, tells of some turning separatists, who dyed Infidels. Ans.</hi> He hath not yet proved that the withdrawing which he mentions, is <hi>a Sinfull Schismatick separation;</hi> and we hope we have made the contraire appear. As for these degrees he mentions, we say. 1. His cruell uncharitablness to Presbyterian Ministersis here very conspicuous, since he will not allow them to be in the least heard or own'd in their present case and circumstances. Certainly to tye up people from occasional improvement of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious gifts which God hath bestowed upon his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, even in a setled state of the Church, and in her
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104445:278"/>
right constitution, is cross to that <hi>interest in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gifts and graces,</hi> which the members of Christs mystical body (upon the ground of their union and communion with the head, and among themselves) are priviledged with. And in impeaching this the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> blotes himself with scismatick uncharitablenes of the deepest dye. 2. As its no strange thing that in such a time of darkness, desertion, and defection, peoples recovery be gradual, and sometime attended with Infirmities in the manner of duties incident to us while in time, so the contrary influences of love to truth and duty, and fear of hazard, may be easily productive of such variety in the carriage of poor ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der souls in this matter. In a word, the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being a special badge of our union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in and with Jesus Christ, Its no strange thing that tender souls scruple to pertake thereof from men at so palpable a distance from him, as Conformists, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially while this ordinance may be enjoyed more pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elswhere. He tells us, <hi>that Schismaticks ar cut off from the body, and receive no life from it,</hi> and (if we may draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an inference and retortion from this assertion) the people of God must judge Conformists to be such. For these effects of separation which Baxter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we bless the Lord the contrary effects of sound piety, in many who were prophane while owning the Ministry of Conformists, are convincingly apparent, since they separated from them: and the effects of backsliding from Gods truth, viz. gross prophanity, or atheisticall Indifferency in the matters of God, are as sadly evident in those who having once own'd Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers, have return'd to Conformists again. As for what he objects and answers, <hi>anent some of their own party going to others then their own parish-Curats, whom unless insuperable lets hinder to attend their own parish-Church, he would have his fellows not to owne.</hi> We are not much concernd to notice any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104445:279"/>
then to tell him that <hi>parvo discrimine refert,</hi> which of them people go to, the best of them being as a briar, and the most uprights as a thorn-hedge, and all of them blotted with such Schismatick opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Church her pure constitution and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as may put it beyond debate with tender souls, (lovers of truth and duty) that they ought adhere to Christs faithfull ambassadours rather then any of them.</p>
               <p>The Doubter objects, [that its hard to hinder to go where we may be most edifyed; since <hi>we must Cover the best gifts.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 31.] He answers 1. that <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is not directing private Christians, what gifts in others to seek after for their edification, but shews that though there are diversities of gifts, and every one should be content with his own, given for the edification of others, yet that he should seek after better, not in others, but in himself. Ans.</hi> Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former doth but trifle and deal deceitfully in his way of representing this, and some objections ensuing; for 1. He supposes that this is lookt upon <hi>in it self,</hi> as a sufficient ground of adhering to Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, without previous consideration of <hi>all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of our present case;</hi> and also in supposing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing casts the ballance (in the Judgement of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter) as to profiting or not profiting, but <hi>difference of gifts;</hi> whereas we grant, that the soveraign Influence of Gods Spirit, (who teaches to profit) renders the means and ordinances effectual to salvation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ministers gifts be great or small. 2. We grant, that tho people have <hi>a discretive Iudgement</hi> as to gifts, and their own profiting, and are to try the spirits, yet in a setled state of the Church, they are not to shake off the due regulation and guidance, of a faithfull Ministry set over them in the Lord, so as to be wholly at their own disposal herein: since there is no Justling betwixt <hi>the privat discretive,</hi> and <hi>publick</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104445:279"/>
                  <hi>Ministerial judgement,</hi> in this matter. 3. As in the tryall of Intrants, not only <hi>the sufficiency,</hi> but <hi>suteable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of gifts</hi> for such a people, is to be eyed. So when a faithfull Minister is thus duely called and setled, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are obliged to owne his Ministry, by a due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the ordinances administred by him, which is all that decency, union, and order, and that act of our Church after mention'd, doth call for; which notwithstanding cannot be supposed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all occasional usemaking of other gifts bestowed upon faithfull Ministers, which were (as I said) cross to the communion of Saints, and beleevers interest in one anothers gifts and graces. But 4. our question here being stated upon the supposition of the greater part of this National Church their apostacy &amp; defection from our sworn Reformation, and a great part of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and professors adhering to their principles, viz. to which of the two parties on this supposition people are to adhere in worship? sure the Lords palpable blasting the backsliding party their gifts, as to any saving success, and on the contrary his as palpable owning and sealing with his blessing the Ministry of his faithfull servants adhering to his truth, is a loud call (in this broken state of our Church, and case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and persecution) to come out from the one party and way, and adhere to the other. So his Doubter in this and the next objection, should have argued thus. <hi>In this case of defection and overturning of our Reformation, God being pleased to seal with a palpable blessing on our souls, the word from Ministers adhering to their principles, we may safely look on this as a call from God to hear them, rather then the prelats perjurd hirelings, whose Ministry we have found palpably blasted since they complyed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>his course of perjurious back siding, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Gods work.</hi> In this case certainly its an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument very pungent, and founded on that of Jer.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104445:280"/>
3. 31, 32. Where the Lord threatneth the prophets <hi>who caused the people to err by their lies and lightness, and whom he hath not sent nor commanded tho they prophesie,</hi> with this, <hi>that therefore they shall not profite the people at all.</hi> So the Argument going upon the supposition of our Churches broken and persecute state; and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition betwixt <hi>a faithfull Ministry,</hi> and <hi>a party of Schismatick Innovators, and overturners of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> will infer nothing against our Churches setled order under Presbyterian government, nor the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies act. 1647. presupposing the same; and its not meerly <hi>the gifts,</hi> but <hi>Gods saving blessing</hi> attending the same, which is the ground of this argument, and that practice pleaded for, thereby.</p>
               <p>Now as to his answer, Its palpable that it meets not this argument in the least, and besides his exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive gloss is very impertinent, viz. <hi>because we are to seek the best and edifying gifts f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>r our selfs in our siation, therefore we are not to seek the best in others also.</hi> What consequence is this? Sure the <hi>Informer</hi> will not deny <hi>simpliciter,</hi> that people are to seek after the most edifying Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and this will follow on the <hi>very ground of our edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> which we are to design in seeking the best gifts, in and for ourselves. Nay, the one is the great mean subservient to the other; a faithfull edifying Ministry is Gods Method for winning to the best gifts for my self; and therefore as a mean leading to this end, fals within the compass <hi>of this command, to seek and Covet the best gifts.</hi> So a greater then he, Voetius, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it a duty to seek the best edifying Ministry, on this ground <hi>De politeia Eccles. pag.</hi> 52. And likewise on these Scriptures, Luk. 8, 18: 1 Thess. 5. 22. And removes objections to the cotraire.</p>
               <p>His 2d answer is, <hi>That the Apostle is there pressing unity, and not to despise the meanest gifts, more then the meanest member, and to avoid Schism verse</hi> 25. <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104445:280"/>
Then it followes, that in the sense of this precept, which we have explain'd, seeking the best gifts, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with unity, and avoiding Schism, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in this our case, its no wayes inductive to schism, but consistent with a due esteem of the meanest gifted Minister who is faithfull, to withdraw from <hi>scandalous innovators, who have already fixt a Schism in this Church,</hi> by opposing her sworn reformation, order, and unity. Nay as matters now stand, this is the surest way to keep our Churches union and integrity; Since this their course has such a clear tendency to the ruine of her Reformation and pure constitution, in doctrine, Worship, discipline and Government, as is above clear'd.</p>
               <p>His 3d Answer is, <hi>that edification is to be sought in an orderly way, not in a way that marrs the Churches peace—and that though our sense of this generall direction were granted, its thus to be understood. Ans.</hi> Let our sworn establisht Reformation, its principles, rules, and design, sit in Judgement and determine, who are greater enemies to this Churches peace and order, they or we. Was not this Church priviledged with a beautifull order of Government, pure Gospel-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and sound doctrine, before Prelacy was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? Well then, the way to this Churches true peace, Union, and order, must be in opposing their <hi>pretended order,</hi> who are letting in the enemies, and have broken her walls and hedge. Many of them said and swore that the Presbyterial Government of this Church, was a beautifull order, unto which since they stand in opposition, they are the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, who disowne them. As for that which he adds, <hi>of peoples neglecting Ministers set over them in the Lord,</hi> he must prove <hi>that Conformists are such Ministers,</hi> who are both scandalous for the far greatest part in their carriage, having no visible badge of the Lords
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104445:281"/>
call, and do owne principles, and carry on a designe point blank contraire to our reformation, have left the peoples conduct, in the way of truth, given up all their Ministeriall authority to abjured prelacy, and make it their work to destroy, and waste the Lords vineyard. Tho it were granted that they had been so set over people, yet since they are tracing wayes of Schism, and innovations condemned by our Church, Christs flocks cannot owne, or be subject to them, as their soules spiritual guides, they being men that have corrupted the Covenant of Levi, and made many stumble at the Law: And besides since that comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (in subjection to conformists, and disowning of Presbyterian Ministers) which he doth here plead for, is in very deed <hi>a despising faithfull Ministers set over their flocks by the Lord,</hi> and <hi>standing in a Ministeriall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them;</hi> and whom consequently the Lords people are called to honour and obey, this same reason whereby he would persuade to adhere to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming party, pleads more strongly against them. And his rule aftermentioned <hi>not to do evill that good may come of it,</hi> will conclude that we should not under pretence of keeping parochiall order, or for eviting confusion, deprive our selves of the blessing of the Ministry of Christs faithfull Ambassadours, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto whom in this case we are under so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations.</p>
               <p>As for the Canons after'cited by him, <hi>against Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters receiving these of another congregation to the Worship,</hi> We say, that according to the Informer himself its clear that such <hi>rules of decency and order,</hi> are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culat for every meridian, every time and case of the Church: extraordinary cases must have suitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and circumstances of <hi>parochial order,</hi> cannot in this case be pleaded, when <hi>our main order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is already destroy'd, and a persecuting party is in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104445:281"/>
our Churches bosome, tearing out her bowels; when a besidged city hath within her walls a party of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed defendants betraying her to the enemie, they are the most orderly and faithfull watchmen who resist them, and run to the posts which they have betrayed. Again, should the many Ministers now perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute (let us suppose they are residing in the bounds) plead parochial order, for their parishes adhering to them, and disowning their Curats incumbent, the Informer will not say, that <hi>parochial order,</hi> will plead for owning them in this case. Or in the case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Ministers turning enemies to Prelats, and by consequence Schismaticks in his account, he will grant that the people (whom we will suppose they are breaking off from the union of the Prelatick Church) ought not to owne them, but were concern'd to go else where to hear. Now, the case being so with us this argument by his own confession, cannot now have weight until all that we plead against them on this ground, be answered.</p>
               <p>Next, he cites <hi>the Act of the Assembly</hi> 1647. <hi>Against them who withdraw usually from the Worship in their own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, except in urgent cases made knowen unto, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven by the Presbytery.</hi> Concluding, <hi>that therefore they thought not this a fit method of edification, &amp; that this act was made to prevent Schism.</hi> But had he set down the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of that act, it might have coverd him with blushes, and would expose him to the censure of every Reader; for it is grounded upon <q>the then compleat establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the work of Reformation, this Churches comely order of Presbyterian Government then exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, her Presbyterian unity and peace, the purity and liberty of the Gospel ordinances then righly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</q> But what will this say to the present case of defection and persecution, wherein the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry are thrust from their flocks, and that work raz'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104445:282"/>
dare he say this assembly did intend to stretch their act to such a case as this, or to stop Ministers from officiating in such a distrest &amp; destroyed condition of our Church Suppose this case had been stated in that Assembly, <hi>What if Presbyterian Government shall be razed, Prelac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the 7th Article of their directions for family Worship past that same day, they suppose this Church to be then <hi>blest with peace and purity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do except from the compass of these directions, the case of <hi>corruption and trouble,</hi> wherein they say, <hi>many things are commendable, which are not otherwise tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable;</hi> And dare he say that they would not call this <hi>such a case.</hi> He makes the Doubter yet again poorly except, [that men have different gifts] which is here a meer nauseating repetition, to fill up idle pages. Upon this our Informer very discreetly and charitably tells us, <hi>that we can litle judge of an edifying gift, and do call railing at Bishops, or at the civil powers, and a tone in the voice so.</hi> Just as Dr Burnet said before in in his roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Dialogues. What is the Judgement of Gods people as to edification, and the evidence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters presence with Presbyterian Ministers in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his people, depends not on this Character, it being comprobat by clear proofs, and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notour to such as can spiritually taste and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:104445:282"/>
But he will offer some considerations about <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of gifts, and edification by them,</hi> which is to no purpose; since our plea is not meerly grounded upon the gifts of preachers whether Conformists or others; but abstracting from this, we say first, there is much more then <hi>meer gifts,</hi> yea and an <hi>edifying gift,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to ground a peoples owning a Minister <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> or <hi>in every circumstantiat case,</hi> as their pastour: what if he be in a schismatick course? what if he be violently thrust in, and hath shut out their Lawfull pastour stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that relation to them, to whom by this mans concession they owe <hi>special subjection, reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the Lord?</hi> (for this we will find him hereafter plead) are the people bound in this case to owne the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, because of his gift? Nay he will not say it. Now the case is Just so with us. 2. We told him that our case is a case of competition betwixt the betrayers and destroyers of our Reformation, and a faithfull Ministry adhering to, and contending for it: so that its this great Ministerial qualification of <hi>faithfullness,</hi> (opposit to Curats <hi>

I know our Informer will say that they are disorderly, and so disowning them, is no despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their gifts. Well then, he grants that men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts may be <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> or in some cases disown'd, and no hazard of this undervaluing and despising their gifts, or quarrelling with the Almighty, &amp; so the rebound of his own blow in this retortion strikes his argument stark dead; and he must grant that the question is, <hi>which of the two contending parties, have best right to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat as Ministers in the Church of Scotland, according to her principles and Reformation?</hi> and according thereto it will not be difficult to determine who are the most orderly &amp; to be heard, &amp; the disorderly have no reason to complain. 2. He sayes <hi>we must not think the meanest gifts, useless.</hi> But he must grant that men may sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render them useless, as he alleges Presbyterian Ministers do and we prove that conformists do so. 3. He tells us <hi>that the best gifts cannot work without the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e on gifts, is to idolize men, as those</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. Then he tells us, <hi>how Zanchius was offended with that frenchman of Geneva, who said he would leave Paul, should be come there, and hear Calvine.</hi> But what will this arguing reprove? must they be stigmatiz'd as Idolizers of men and gifts, who will not Idolize abjur'd prelacy, and perjur'd apostats, and in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them while wasting and destroying a purely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104445:283"/>
Church, discountenance a faithfull Ministry contending for her reformation, and signally bless'd therein? surely his instance anent Zanchius, may be well apply'd to such as will hear none but Curats, and wholly disowne Presbyterian Ministers; Again, if the best gifts cannot work without the spirit, and the spirit works ordinarly and best with those who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him, and as having their senses exercised, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wait for his breathings in duty, what hope is there that profane men, and greivers of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in walking contraire to God, his people, way and interest, (as are most Conformists) should have the spirits seal attending their Ministry. What more? He tells us 4. <hi>That sometimes the spirit will act with the mean gifts more then the greater as Peter Acts</hi> 2. <hi>is found to have converted more in one sermon, then we read that our Lord himself did, tho he spoke as never man spoke. That Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Ans.</hi> 1. He must grant that this argument, taken from the spirits working great things by smal means, will not plead for owning Presbyterian Ministers, to whom many of his <hi>Scioli Rabbies</hi> impute weakness of gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think that <hi>aliunde</hi> or upon other grounds, such Ministers are not in this case to be heard. Well then let him take home his argument as insufficient, untill he prove that <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> Conformists are to be heard rather then Nonconformists, and prove his groundless suppositions above mentioned (wherein he begs the question) and disprove our true supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions above also rehearsed, or this argument will sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104445:284"/>
Just nothing. 2. For his Instances, as this man would be sober in such comparisons, so we must tell him ther's a great difference betwixt little, &amp; no success, a Ministry <hi>with small effects;</hi> and a Ministry <hi>palpably blasted as to any saving issue;</hi> and betwixt <hi>sincere designing of success, and mourning over the want of it,</hi> making it a complaint (as our Lord wept over Jerusalems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and disobedience) and the Ministers desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>himself,</hi> and no such thing, and wanting this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression mentioned. Sure as it will be hard for him to point us to any of their constant hearers who have been converted by their Ministry, so it will be as hard to point out any of their preachers, who have the peoples spiritual profit for their design, or their unprofitableness as their burden &amp; complaint to God. And since both these are conspicuous in Presbyterian Ministers, Its quickly resolved which of the two are standing in Gods counsel, and travelling in birth to beget souls by the gospel, and to have Christ formed in them. But he would have us <hi>praying for Conformists, and laying aside prejudice. Ans.</hi> I think we are Indeed called to lay aside <hi>prejudice at their persons,</hi> and to pray <hi>for their repentance;</hi> but to pray for <hi>a blessing on their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> who are in such direct opposition to the Lords people, work, and Interest, were a mocking of God, and hardning them in their sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently hearing and receiving the ordinances from them as the Ministers of this Church were a strenght ning of their hands in their disobedience. Beside, will he allow people upon their praying for Presbyterian Ministers to hear them? I trow not, then it seems<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laying aside prejudice and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Curats, may consist with not hearing them. His next childish objection put into the mouth of his Doubter <hi>[that tho some withdraw all will not]</hi> is not worth the noticing. It were good for our Church
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104445:284"/>
all her members did so understand their duty and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatons, as to deny that subjection to Conformists which he pleads for. And that such pastours as they who destroy but feed not, had no flocks: For they have not brought back the straying, nor heal'd the sick &amp;c. But he tells us, <hi>he hath proved that none ought to withdraw.</hi> How insignificant his preceeding proofs are, hath been discovered, and if his ensueing be no better, Its certain that <hi>Successus defuit ausis,</hi> and that he hath overshote his marke, in this undertaking.</p>
               <p>The Doubter enquires next [what obligation lyes on him, to be an ordinary hearer in his own congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] In answer to which the <hi>Informer</hi> tells us first, <hi>of our obligation showen by him to maintain union, and of the Acts of the ancient Church, and our own.</hi> Which I have already answered. Next, he tells us, <hi>of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal obligation betwixt a Minister and his congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which cannot be so easily broken; the Minister is to labour diligently and faithfully, among the people of his charge Ezek.</hi> 33. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>the people of his charge are to attend his Ministry to esteem him highly, and love h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He asks <hi>how we obey this charge, when we disowne, discountenance, and turn our backs upon our Ministers, and will not receive the Law from their mouth. Ans.</hi> That there is <hi>a reciprocall tye betwixt a Minister and his flock,</hi> is easily acknowledged: but the <hi>Informer</hi> forgot the main and necessary point here (to make this weapon strike home, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument run straight without a byass) viz. <hi>What makes up this tye according to the Scripture pattern.</hi> This he should have condescended upon, and made it good in the case of Conformists, and then his arguing had been pertinent, and formidable to the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists. But what will this poor general say, <hi>that there is a reciprocal tye betwixt a Minister and his flock,</hi> while he hath not made appear, what is the Scripture
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104445:285"/>
foundation and <hi>basis</hi> of that tye, &amp; but begs the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the application thereof to his case. I suppose a Presbyterian Minister should plead this to warrand his officiating among his people, in opposition to the Curat incumbent, <hi>that the people are bound to owne him as their Minister, because of this reciprocal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ye: That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obligations</hi> (mentioned by the Informer) <hi>lyes on him to be faithfull and diligent, which while he is endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (according to his duty, founded on his relation to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) the people are therefore bound to attend on his Ministrie to esteem him, love him, receive the Law from him, and and not to discountenance nor discourage him by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another.</hi> Now let this man shew what he will answer to this pleading, and his argument will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evanish before his own answer; If he say that the tye is loosed, let him instruct <hi>what that is which has in this case loosed it.</hi> Sure neither the Magistrates violence, nor Prelatick censures, according to our Principles, and the Doctrine of sound divines, when this case is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stated. And if this divine tye stand, what will he say? Will it not 1. follow (according to him,) that a Minister may be under a standing tye to his people, and they to their Minister, and yet the people for all this may not be obliged to hear him but another <hi>hie &amp; nunc,</hi> and that warrantably, without hazard of disobedience to these Scriptures; and then he hath with his own hand cut the throat of his bare ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall argument from <hi>the reciprocal tye.</hi> Sure in some cases <hi>the tye</hi> may stand, and yet the <hi>actuall reciprocal exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> or obligation to the exercise of duties may be <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> warrantably suspended in very many supposable cases as of Physicall impediments in the people and Minister, hostile invasion, Pestilence, Imprisonment &amp;c. 2. If the <hi>tye or relation</hi> do stand, and likewise all things which <hi>do immediatly dispose to the exercise of duty,</hi> then the Prelatical incumbent is in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104445:285"/>
this case an <hi>intruder,</hi> and not to be own'd. For I suppose he will not say, that a Presbyterian Minister might lawfully officiat in his own Parish, after the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat is setled there, for this would quite cross the scope of his Argument. Now the Question betwixt the two competitors is, <hi>which of them hath the prior lawfull, and standing tye?</hi> will he dare to deny, that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ministers had this; and since he cannot shew how it is loosed, nor prove it to be loosed, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will militat not for him, but against him.</p>
               <p>Next, as for what he cites out of Mr Durham on Revel. pag. 105: 106. anent this tye, It is still <hi>extra oleas,</hi> and nothing correspondent to his purpose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he instruct that which is the <hi>basis</hi> and foundation of this Relation <hi>in the case of Conformists,</hi> which he neither doth nor offers to do. Mr Durham speaks <q>of a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial delegation from Christ, of his speciall warrand and appointment to such a man to treat with such a flock.</q> Now sure this most be instructed from his Word and Testament, as to Curats, before he can from this make any shew of Argument. For Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian ministers do upon better ground lay claim to this special appointment in relation to their flocks, upon which conformists have intruded: yet this man thinks these ministers are not to be owned. And since this deputation and appointment is, with Mr Durham, the foundation of the duty betwixt minister and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it must be cleard from the word in the case of Conformists, before this passage of Mr Durham will afford any patrociny to his cause. Then he tells us, <hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Mr Durham holds that this obligation is not founded on meer voluntary consent.</hi> Well let him mark this, and then he must acknowledge, that its not meerly the <hi>Curats gaping consent for the fleece and filthy Lucre,</hi> nor
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104445:286"/>
the peoples <hi>blind consent,</hi> that will make them <hi>Ministers of these Congregations where they officiat.</hi> What is it then that founds this relation? The <hi>Scipture-commands</hi> (saith Mr Durham) 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Know them that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among you and are over you in the Lord. Heb</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, for they watch for your souls as they that most give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, &amp;c.</hi> But will this man deny that Mr Durham speaks upon the supposition of the Minister his having the Ministerial call and mission according to the rule of the Word, to ground his pleading these Scripture commands, and his special commission to such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And that he look't upon <hi>the Presbyteries mission, and ordination, and the peoples call,</hi> together with <hi>due qualifications,</hi> and the visible evidences of Christs call in the person thus admitted, as the foundation of this special relation to such a flock, according to the Scripture pattern, and the order and Government of this Church then established. I durst pose his conscience upon the truth of this; and whether Mr Durham did ever dream of a speciall relation to a flock in this Church, <hi>resulting from a Prelates mission in a Method of perjury, in opposition to our Covenant and sworn reformation, without the mission and ordination of a Presbytry, or the peoples call, and in a way of intrusion upon the charges of faithfull Ministers violently thrust out by persecuting Prelats,</hi> the men thus obtruded being for most part such as have nothing that may ground a reasonable or charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble construction of them, that they are <hi>sent of God,</hi> but palpable evidences of the contrary, While in the mean time the faithfull Ministers are willing to cleave to their flocks, and the flocks to them? If he say that all the Ministers he pleads for are not such. I Answer, he makes no limitation of this Argument, but pleads the foremention'd Scriptures, and Mr Durham's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony universally, and tells us in the next page, <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:104445:286"/>
                  <hi>Mr Durham binds the people fast to the Ministers of their own congregations by this discourse,</hi> he means to the Ministry of all the Conformists. As for that passage of Mr Durham's Testimony after cited by him <hi>anent the Sympathy betwixt Ministers and flocks, and the reckoning that will be made in relation to mutuall duties.</hi> We think it pleads very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that Sympathy that ought now to be betwixt Presbyterian Ministers and their flocks, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists have usurped upon, and the mutuall perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of duty to each other upon all hazards, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Curats intrusion. And if Paul aggreag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particularly the Gentiles slighting and grieving him, by his particular delegation to them, which was, even as to the Apostle himself, by the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ds of the Presbytry Act. 13. 13. Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers delegation to their flocks, which was in this manner, must needs stand, and may be much better pleaded upon this ground then that of Curats Who are sent to flocks by Prelats as their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and have nothing like Pauls delegation in their mission. So that Mr Durhams arguments, and the Scriptures cited by him, are so far from <hi>tying congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to conformists,</hi> as this man alleages, that they tye them <hi>to their own faithfull Presbyterian pastours,</hi> and by consequence to disowne prelats and their intruding hirelings, as none of the lawfull Pastours of this Church.</p>
               <p>I might here add that the account of the Pastours duty, and the ground of the people's subjection and obedience exhibit to us in these scriptures which he mentions, doth sufficiently exclude their party from any claim therunto. What? <hi>do they hear Gods word and warn the people from him,</hi> who are generally so ignorant of his word walking contrary to it themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and hardning others in rebellion against him? are they <hi>watching for souls as they that must give account?</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104445:287"/>
who are loving to sleep and slumber; and dare not say most of them, that ever they enquird at any soul how it is betwixt God and them? <hi>do their lips keep know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> who have departed out of the way, and caused many stumble at the Law? are they <hi>labouring and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing as to sin and duty,</hi> who are ringleaders in a course of defection? Sure if the duties of subjection, reverence, and obedience, suppose such characters of Ministers, and such qualifications as are here exprest, people are hereby abundantly discharged from such subjection and obedience as to Conformists, who are so palpably destitute of these qualifications. So that the <hi>Informer</hi> falls utterly short of his intended advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by this citation of Mr Durham, and the scriptures therin mentioned do wound his cause t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Our <hi>Informer</hi> upon this point of <hi>separation</hi> (which he holds to be his fort-royal in the present diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) having plyed his Doubter with offensive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, will needs shew his skill and just dealing in acting the defendant for some time. But I doubt that his defensive armour and answers shall be found as thin and penetrable in this debate, as his impugning weapons are bluntand pointless. Well, this fair dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant, will hear some of our arguments against the owning of Conformists, but be sure they must be of his own mould and digesting, for these can best suit the design of that pretty piece of pageantry, which he is acting in this pamphlet. The first argument which his Doubter offers, is [their not entring by a call from the people as all Ministers should (citing Act. 14. 23.) but by a presentation from the patron.] In ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to this, he spends some discourse upon that text, which we shall examine. But to clear this point the more fully, I will premise three things. 1. That the people have a divine right to call their pastou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before in the 9th argument against Episcopacy, and from other scripture-grounds beside this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a weighty ground also, unto this we refer the reader. 2. That upon supposal of this divine rule and pattern of a Ministers Lawfull call, it doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104445:288"/>
follow, that the <hi>patronages</hi> are a corruption, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Ministers call in this respect maimed, and not so consonant to scripture as it ought to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though it be granted that a Minister presented by the Patron, and not called by the people, hath <hi>the essence of the Ministerial office,</hi> and might in some cases be owned as a Minister, yet this will plead nothing for the owning of Curats as the case is now circumstantiat: Because 1. Its certain that according to the principles and reformation of this Church, as establisht before these innovations, a Ministers entry by imposition of the hands of the Presbytery, without the usurping Prelate, and by the call of the people without the Patron, is <hi>the more pure and scriptural way of entry into the Ministry;</hi> and moreover <hi>the only way of entry own'd and authorized by her supreme Indicatories,</hi> and by consequence its most suitable to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian principles, when there is a competition betwixt the one and the other, and Ministers thus Lawfully called, are violently ejected by men reestablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prelacy, and patronages, formerly cast out and vowed against, that people do adhere to their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pastours rather then these Innovators and intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which will be convincingly clear, if it be also considered particularly, that as prelacy &amp; allits corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; usurpations now existent and introduced, were fully removed and abjured by this Church, so <hi>laick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages</hi> in speciall were upon most weighty grounds removed by the parliament 1649. in correspondence to our Churches declarator as appears in the Narrative of their 39. act. viz. <hi>The sense of the obligation lying upon them, both by the National and solemn league &amp; covenant, by many deliverances and mercies from God, &amp; by the latesolemn engadgement to duties, to preserve the doctrine and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and vindicat the liberties of the Church of Scotland—to advance the work of Reformation—and considering</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104445:288"/>
                  <hi>that patronages &amp; persentations of Kirkes is an evill and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under which the Lords people &amp; Ministers of this land have long groan'd. That it hath no warrand in Gods word, but is founded only on the Canon Law, that it is a popish custom brought into this Church in time of ignorance &amp; superstition, that its contrary to the 2d book of discipline, wherein upon solid grounds its reckon'd among abuses that are desired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and Contrary to several acts of general assemblies, prejudicial to the liberty of the people, and planting of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the free call and entry of Ministers to their charge &amp;c.</hi> This act the parliament 1662 did ranverse among other pieces of our Reformation: <hi>Ordaining all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that entered since</hi> 49. <hi>to have no right to the benefice, till they obtain a presentation from the Lawfull Patron, and collation from the Bishop.</hi> Now upon supposal of the Covenant obligation, and our engadgement therein to separat from any corruption contrary to our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give a testimony to that work, to with-draw from backsliders, is there any doubt but that people are oblidged (upon these grounds) to adhere to that body of faithful Ministers, who are standing to our principles and sworn Reformation (whereof these points mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are one main piece) rather then such as have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd aside to this course of perjurious defection. Sure our obligations mentioned do every way include Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers, &amp; exclude Conformists. Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ministers are maintaining the peoples right and liberty to call their pastour, Conformists are selling away this peice of her reformation &amp; liberty, and thus crossing the scripture-pattern, the first are adhering to this Churches vowes (and people are obliged to owne these Ministers that are pursuing the ends) the other are casting them away &amp;c. Again 3. all the motives mentioned in the premised act of parliament, and in our Churches publick acts in opposition to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages, and prelatick usurpations in a Ministers

               <p n="4">4. This man dare not assert, that the granting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists <hi>to have the essence of a Ministerial call,</hi> will in every case infer the conclusion <hi>of hearing them,</hi> or that the granting a Minister to have this, is <hi>the only &amp; adequat ground</hi> which will in all circumstantiat cases make hearing necessary. For 1. What if he be violently obtruded by a part of the congregation upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously call'd Minister his labours, to whom the people stand oblig'd to adhere? Again 2. What if he be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a Schismatick course, setting up an altar against an altar (as some of these men tell us in their Pamphlets) will a people cross their principles as to his having <hi>the essence of a Ministeriall call,</hi> if they refuse to follow him in that Schismatick course? Nay he will not say it. 3.

disowning of Presbyterian Ministers in their administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, notwithstanding of their having <hi>a lawfull call,</hi> and pastoral relation to this Church, will be easily retorted upon himself, and abundantly counterballanced by that which in the case of conformists may be pleaded to supersede, and stop the peoples owning of them in this circumstantiat posture of our Church. So that the state of the question here being this, <hi>whether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters ordained by Bishops, and presented by Patrons, or those who are ordained by the Presbytry, and called by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have best right to officiat in this Church, as her Pastours, according to the Scripture rule, her reformation and principles, and to be own'd or disownd by the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</hi> The decision will be very easy and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Presbyterian Ministers, and exclusive of all his fraternity.

their persecuting and opposing faithful Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for her Reformation. 3.

But now what sayes our <hi>Informer</hi> to this text Acts. 14. 23. which is brought by his Doubter to prove the peoples right in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Pastours.

He tells us <hi>that Doctor Hamond and other Criticks shew, that the word is oftenused by writters to express the action of one single person, as its taken by Luke Acts</hi> 10. 41. <hi>Speaking of Gods chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or appointing, So that the word is not necessarly to be underst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Informers 2d answer is, <hi>That Greek wri ters do ordinarly use this word to signify ordaining a person to a charge, without voices and suffrages.</hi> And that here its so to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, he proves from this, that <hi>Paul and Barnabas are said to do this work exprest by this Greek word, and not the people; That we will not say that Paul and Barnabas ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Ministers to these Churches, which were to yeeld the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.

Ans.</hi> All this is nothing but his <hi>petio principii</hi> and what is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already 1. That this word signifies ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ordaining of a Person to a charge without votes and suffrages, is most false, and contrary to the sense of the word in Greek authors contrary to the Scripture acceptation of the word, &amp; to sound divines as we have heard. And to this may be here added (which is also the observation of the above mentioned learn'd writters) that we find extraordinary Officers in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times not put into their functions without the Churches consent, hence we may conclude, that far less ought there to be an intrusion of ordinary Ministers without their consent. Paul &amp; Silas were chosen of the whole Church to their extraordinary delegation, Acts. 15. 22. Pauls company were chosen by the Church 2 Cor. 18. 19.

                  </gap>, we told him that the Syriack version understands it of the Disciples. <hi>Mr Gillespy (loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citato)</hi> proves that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Dutch Annot. upon this passage do tell us, <q>that this was a custome among the Greeks in chusing their Magistrats, that the people by lifting up their hands give to understand their voting, so it seems that from thence this custome was also used in the primitive Church, that the setting forth of Ministers of the Church, being done by Apostles or those that were sent by them for this purpose, was approved by the Church by the lifting up of their hands; which use long continued in the Church; as the Ecclesiastick hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories testify.</q> And having told us that others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this of imposition of hands (which they set down as the secondary and less probable opinion) they add <q>that this also was done with consent of the church as appears by the fasting and praying which was done by the whole Congregation, and was also done in this chusing of the Elders, referring to 1 Tim. 5. 17. Acts 10. 41. upon which passage they shew, that the Greek word in Acts 14. 23. signifies properly by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of hands to choose or ordain, and is here used concerning the choosing of ordinary Ministers by the suffrages of the Church, to which this extraordinary choosing of Apostles is here opposed, as being done by lifting up or stretching forth of Gods hand alone. Upon Acts. 6. 6. where mention is made of laying on of hands, they tells us, that as this was usual in blessing Gen. 48. 14. in sacrifices Lev. 1. 4. and in installing into offices Numb. 27. 18. Deut 34. 9. So the Church (pointing at the Apostolick Churches practice) in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture of Ministers, did thus dedicate them to God his service, and used thus to wish his blessing 1 Tim. 5. 22.</q> The English annot. upon this text under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

do shew, <q>that the word signifies making of such a choise, as was made or confirmed by lifting up of hands, to signify suffrages or consent, and having told us of the general signification of the word in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ordination or appointing chap. 10. 41. they add, that the Syriack reads the text thus, [and they appointed to them Elders in every Congregation.] Whence they collect that Paul and Barnabas did not all alone in ordaining &amp; Church-government; other Christians shew'd their consent or approbation of the persons who were ordained Elders by lifting up their hands; as very weel knowing, of what behaviour they had been among them: so <gap reason="foreign">

That the choosing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by suffrage, and consent of the Church, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and held out in this passage under debate, in the consentient judgment of Interpreters, and that this greek word, as in its ordinary, so its special ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in this place, will clearly infer so much, whatever authority in ordination and election as to Paul and Barnabas, and of Ministers consequently, the circumstances of this text will bear out and infer. 2. That this interest of the people in the election and call of Ministers is comprobate by the judgement and consentient practice of the ancient Church, as the history therof doth verify. 3. That that passage Act. 10. 41. doth (in their sense) nothing invalidate this right of the people, held out in this text, the one place speaking of an immediat choosing by God, the other of mediat and ordinary by men, the one, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at ordination and appointing of the Apostles to

That this right and interest of the people in Ministers call, as it is founded upon the ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and unrepealed priviledge of Gods Church under the old Testament, so it hath besides this, and such like instances, and exemplary recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the new-testament, a constant moral war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand <hi>of the peoples knowledge anent the case and behaviour of their spiritual guides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His 3d answer to this text is, <hi>That if we understand it of a hand suffrage we lose by it.</hi> Why so? <hi>because we give advantadge to the Independents for popular election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters wherea; we give this power not to all the people, but to the session.</hi> And he tells us, <hi>that therefore understanding Presbyterians have forborn to pressthis text. Ans.</hi> 1. We have proven that a congregational Eldership is <hi>Iuris divini,</hi> &amp; that by consequence this election strictly taken must be their priviledge, See 9 Argument against Prelacy on the 1.

Who these understanding Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians are, who do not understand this place as warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people's interest in the election &amp; call of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, the <hi>Informer</hi> hath not given us an account, since his Doubter is none of them, and if he mean the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of <hi>jus divinum Ministerii Evangelici,</hi> he will finde that they do clearly assert this truth <hi>(propos.</hi> 1.) so as it do not exclude the due right of Ministers herein.

Branch, do require <hi>the people's consent and approbation,</hi> as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily antecedaneous to the ordination. Besides, could the <hi>Informer</hi> be ignorant that there are several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weighty Scripture grounds &amp; arguments pleaded by our writters to fortify this right of the people; why did he not then put these also into the mouth of his Doubter, and give us an account of his own, and his

Episcopal Masters' skill in dissolving them? Moreover tho it were granted, that all here did concurr in this suffrage where no Eldership was yet constitute (as Mr Gillespy Judgeth probable miscell. pag. 14.) it will nothing infringe the power of the Eldership in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches constitute, there being a vast difference betwixt the <hi>modus rei,</hi> in Churches constitute, and these <hi>in fieri</hi> or that are to be constitute. Again 2.

And that among the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

Again, supposing Elderships here existent, this phrase may be well referr'd to the people, as importing their consent and approbation, reserving still to the Eldership their Juridical suffrage, and decisive vote in election. <hi>Mr Gillespy (ubi supra)</hi> clears this, shewing <hi>that in Athens it selfe the people did</hi>

               <p>If any object that the giving the suffrage and election of Ministers to the Eldership, excluding the people, makes the breach greater betwixt the Independents and us then needs, it being sufficient to clear us from their principles, that we allow not either to the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or congregation, the formal authoritative mission and imposition of hands. And that our arguments upon this head seems to give to the people not onely consent, but suffrage in election. I shall desire first, that Mr Gillespies answer be considered (Miscell. page 24.) to an objection about our homologating with Independents in this point. Who sayes <q>that in this point of election we do not homologate with them, who give to the collective body of the Church (wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children under age onely excepted) the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of decisive vote or suffrage in elections, we give the vote <hi>onely to the Eldership</hi> or Church representative, so that they carry along with them the consent of the <hi>major</hi> or better part of the congregation. So that he makes the attributing of this decisive voice &amp; suffrage in elections, <hi>unto the people,</hi> to be down right Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency &amp; the march stone of their difference from us. He tells us afterward, that <hi>the consent and knowledge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>whole Church</hi> without which Ministers may not be intruded, &amp; <hi>the counsel and deliberation,</hi> (which is distinct from this consent) to the ablest &amp; wisest of the congregation, especially <hi>the Magistrates.</hi> But he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes from both these the <hi>decisive vote in Court or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory,</hi> &amp; the <hi>formal consistorial determination</hi> in the case of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104445:296"/>
election, and this he sayes, belongs onely unto, and consists in, <hi>the votes of the Eldership.</hi> And that the Independents contrarily give the <hi>conference and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to the Eldership (as we use to do in Comittees) but <hi>the decision</hi> to the whole Congregation. Adding further, that such as have written against Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do thus state the difference betwixt them and us in this point, viz. not whether matters of great importance and publick concernment ought to be determined with the peoples free consent (for this we grant) but <hi>whether the cause must be brought to the body of the Congregation to give their voices therin together with the officers of the Church,</hi> citing <hi>Laget in his defence of Church-government, chap.</hi> 1. and <hi>Mr Herle</hi> Prolocutor of the Assembly of Divines in that piece intituled <hi>the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency on scriptures of the Independency of Churches</hi> page 3. where he sets down this forementioned consent to the Minister who is to be chosen, as that which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to the members of the congregation in common. Adding further, that Independents place the whole es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a calling in election, accounting ordination to be but a solemnizing of it, wheras we place the potestative mission, not in the Churches election but lawfull ordination.</q> So that in the judgement of these Divines the reserving to the Presbytry the <hi>formal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative mission</hi> is the not the <hi>sole point of difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Independents and us, nor can a man be cleard from Independent principles in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who extends the <hi>decisive juridical<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> vote in election</hi> beyond the Eldership, and gives this <hi>decisive, suffrage strictly taken to the people</hi> Besides, the absurd and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequences following upon this opinion, allowing the <hi>formal juridical elective suffrage</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are evident, such as 1. That this goes in some respect beyond Independents opinion as to the peoples power in elective suffrage, who though they give it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104445:297"/>
to the collective body, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>with a restriction exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding women, children and persons under age, not to every individual. 2. That this will inferr that <hi>every point of government</hi> and every cause, relating immediatly to the congregation, must be brought <hi>to the multitude</hi> or <hi>body of the people,</hi> to give their voices therin together with the officers of the Church, for upon the same ground that the elective suffrages belong to them, so must every piece of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now Mr Laget <hi>ubi supra</hi> expresly states this as the Independents principle, and as that wherin they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us 3. This cuts off <hi>all right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>a juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical eldership,</hi> which is by our writters asserted and made good from the scriptures, and makes all their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative decisive suffrages, in this and other points of government, in reference to the congregation, <hi>an invasion of the peoples right,</hi> and unlawfull usurpation of their power; for if this formall decisive suffrage belong to all the collective body <hi>jure divino,</hi> how can they give it away? 4. This will by consequence bring the collective body to have their <hi>formal decisive juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal suffrage, in superiour Church-judicatories, Presbytries, and synods,</hi> in every point wherin the congregational eldership and session have an immediat interest. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, since <hi>consent and knowledge,</hi> is allowed by our writters to the <hi>whole congregation,</hi> and <hi>deliberation</hi> and <hi>counsel</hi> to <hi>some eminent members,</hi> the elderships <hi>elective suffrage,</hi> (which in their judgement is necessar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with this) cannot be said to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the due right of the collective body of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in this point; unless (as I said) we step over the march-stone, and bring in the <hi>whole collective body</hi> of the congregation to have <hi>a decisive suffrage</hi> in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In a word, the scripture arguments, and other grounds here hinted, which do clearly conclude the people and congregations right as to <hi>a call in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>

Where he shewes that the people had their right in chusing their Pastours. Onely, to prevent mistake upon these passages, we would take notice, that this <hi>suffrage</hi> here atribute <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>indiscriminatim,</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and clergy, must be understood <hi>pro uniuscujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que modulo</hi> and <hi>according to every ones capacity,</hi> for the reasons above rendred. Since both Ministers right in ordination, and also the right of a juridicall elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in churches constitute in reference to the election of Ministers, hath (as we have shown) a clear foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Scripture and antiquity. But of this enough. 2. We have also proven that we are not concerned, nor in the least constrained by our principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this case, <hi>to null a Church or Ministry where this call is wanting,</hi> it being enough for us, that the want of it is <hi>a corruption</hi> rendring a Ministry not so pure as it ought to be, and that our case being a case of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition betwixt Ministers holding fast this piece of our Covenanted Reformation, and a party of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

Innovators opposing and rejecting it, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to the vomit of this and other corruptions, after they have been seen, cast out, and vowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst: We are upon the grounds of our Reformation and vows, sufficiently warranted to leave these inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators, and adhere to the faithfull Ministry. 3. As we did shew that the granting of Curats their having <hi>the essence of a ministerial call,</hi> will not infer our <hi>hearing and owning them in every case,</hi> and especially <hi>in ours</hi> (which himself must grant, unless he fall in a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) so its more then he can prove, that this Church of Scotland from its first beginning, till 1649 had pratronages; Which being founded on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, and several ages posterior to the pure Church in this Nation, planted (as we heard) without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats by some of Johns Disciples, how absurd is it to assert that it had <hi>Patronages from the beginning.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, whatever tollerance of these corruptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be removed may be pleaded for, yet such as have embraced them now, yea &amp; as a badge of owning this deformation of our once glorious Church, are certainly to be disowned by all who would hold fast their integrity. For what he adds, <hi>anent our owning Presbyterian Ministers adhering to our Reformation, tho they have been presented by Patrons,</hi> It's both impertinent to the point and already answered, For its not this <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter, or only,</hi> which we ground upon in this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as is often said, but the principles, state, practice, and design, of Conformists <hi>in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex case</hi> Beside, who sees not the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Minister owning the principles of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and disowning this with other corruptions, although the times necessity did constrain to make use of patronages in their first entry, when our Church was as yet groaning under this bondage, and such as owne this corruption both in judgment and practice
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104445:299"/>
after it is rejected, and the Church delivered from it, yea and owne it as an express badge of Conformity to abjured Prelacy. Sure they are very blind who see not the difference betwixt these.</p>
               <p>The Doubter alleadges [that patronages are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in the Covenant] and the <hi>Informer desires to see in in what place.</hi> But if he will open his eyes and but read either our National or solemn league, he will easily see this; for patronages being <hi>a popishcorruption contrary to the Word of God</hi> (as we have proved) it's abjured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>rites or Customs brought into this Church; without or against the word;</hi> And likewise in being condemned in <hi>the</hi> 2. <hi>book of discipline,</hi> to which we vow adherence as unto <hi>the discipline</hi> of this Church, it must be in that respect also abjured; And as <hi>contrary to sound doctrine, the power of godliness, and Government of this Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the 2. book of Discipline, it is abjured in the solemn League, wherein we likewise vow <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to that discipline.</hi> But (saith he) <hi>Since patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages were in use aster the Covenant, why was not this breach discerned, and was this Church perjured all that time. Ans.</hi> The forecited act of Parliament shewes that this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption had been long by this Church groan'd under, and long before that time declared and testified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, both in the 2. book of discipline, and by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies thereafter, and if (the interposing of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magistrat being necessary to remove this) the Church still untill that time groan'd under this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where can he fixe his challenge?</p>
               <p>The next argument of his Doubter for not hearing Curats, is [that they are ordained by Bishops.] To which he answers 1. <hi>That all whom we refuse to hear, were not ordained by Bishops.</hi> He means those who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Presbytery, and have conformed, <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We have already told him that it is not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal ordination <hi>simply and abstractedly from our case,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:104445:300"/>
which is our ground of not owning them, but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal ordination of <hi>perjured intruders breaking our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reformation, and ejecting our faithfull Pastours, and testified against by our presbyterian protestant Church which they have thus intruded upon.</hi> 2. We have told him that the concession of their <hi>lawfull ordination for substance,</hi> will no more plead for our owning them in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex case, then their concession of <hi>the lawfull ordination of Presbyterian ministers,</hi> will infer <hi>an obligation upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists to owne them,</hi> which is a consequence that they all deny. And that they must grant, that owning of <hi>the episcopal ordination in this complex case,</hi> is different from a <hi>simple owning of it,</hi> in relation to hearing. Even as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ministers are acknowledged by conformists to have a <hi>lawfull ordination for substance,</hi> whom notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will not <hi>suffer the people to hear.</hi> 3. Those who were so ordained and have conformed, having (as I said) <hi>eatenus</hi> or in so far, renounc'd their Presbyterial ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adhering to the prelatical as the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, this their disowning of our reformation (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aggreged by their perjury and apostacy) puts them in the same, yea a worse condition as to our hearing them, then those that are meerly ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prelats. <q>3. He tells us, That on this ground we would not adhere to these whom Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus ordained, nor would we have heard a minister for many ages of the Church; Then he tells us of Jeroms, <hi>quid facit excepta ordinatione Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus,</hi> and that ministers have now a hand in ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Conformists. That on this ground we would not have heard the members of the Assembly 1638. who were thus ordained, and some now though non-conformists, who were ordained before the year 1638 by Bishops, the valitidity of which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vindicat by <hi>

                     </gap>ie: Ans.</hi> We have already proven, that Episcopal ordination
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104445:300"/>
is not in the lest warranted by the Authority of Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus supposed in these Epistles, but rather a Presbyterial ordination, which is the pattern shewed upon the mount. 2. We have also proven that his prelatick ordination, whereof the Prelat hath he sole and proper power according to this constitution, is a stranger, in the first purer ages, and even in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's time. 3. We have also proven that the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the essentialls of their ministerial call who are ordained by Bishops, will plead nothing for own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Curats, who are both scandalous and perjured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders and have nothing for the most part which may in the least ground a charitable construction that they were ever called of God; and are standing in opposition to a faithful ministry, by them excluded and persecute from their watcthowers, none of which can be said of the instances which he mentions. As for that concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which he pretends Conformists have with the Bishops in ordination of ministers, it is according to our Law, <hi>meerly precarious and pro forma.</hi> And therefore utterly insufficient to found his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>The Doubter objects, [that tho some of them were ordained by the Presbytery, yet they are now turn'd the Bishops Curats.] He might have added, and turned <hi>court or Erastian-Curats,</hi> since the <hi>all</hi> of our present Conformists authority, is derived from <hi>the court</hi> and subordinat to the <hi>supremacy,</hi> as is evident in the act of restitution and other subsequents acts. In answer to this he alleadges <hi>weakness of Iudgement, strength of passion</hi> in the objecter, but really shews both in himself, by telling us, <hi>that we may fear Christs threatning; he that despises you despises me,</hi> since he hath not yet made, it appear that the men he pleads for have a <hi>relaion to this Church as her true Pastours,</hi> according to the principles and tenor
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104445:301"/>
of our Reformation. Then he tells us, <hi>that Curat signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a cure of souls.</hi> But the <hi>True Non-conformist,</hi> told his fellow Dialogist, that <hi>this term</hi> owes its invention to mens vanity, loathing the lowly Scripture style of <q>Minister, and is in effect nothing but the issue of the corrution of the Churches humility, and that what they pretend herein while destroying in stead of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is like to stand in Judgement against them at the great day.</q> For his next interpretation of [Curat] viz. <hi>he that serves the cure tho not the Minister of the place, but the substitute of another,</hi> We owe him thanks, for one egg is not liker another, then they are to such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious substitutes. But he will not have them called <hi>the Bishops Curats, as if he were Pastour of the diocess, and they deputed, under him, and Bishop</hi> (he saith) <hi>hath such thoughts of ministers.</hi> What their <hi>thoughts</hi> are, is best seen by <hi>their deeds.</hi> We have proved that according to this frame of prelacy the Bishop is properly the sole Pastour of the Diocess. In the 7. Argument against Prelacy.</p>
               <p>The Doubters next objection is, [that they are perjured persons, and therefore not to be heard.] He answers 1. <hi>That many of them never took the Covenant, and therefore are not perjured,</hi> which is already removed, when we did prove from Deut. 29. that it oblidges even those who did not personally swear. Its remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable that Deut. 5. 2, 3. God is said to have made a Covenant with his people in Horeb, even with us (saith Moses) and all of us alive here this day. They were dead who engadged at Horeb, and many there present were not then born. So Neh. 9. 38. all ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into Covenant, but some only did seal it. Sure the <hi>intention, and relation</hi> of the Covenanters, and the <hi>matter of the Oath it self,</hi> will make it thus extensive. Next he sayes, <hi>Ministers that took it, and comply with prelacy are not perjured, for the reasons which be gave in the last</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:104445:301"/>
                  <hi>conference.</hi> Which reasons I have there answered, and proved that there is nothing in our case, which may in the least limit or invalidat its obligation, and upon the grounds which are offered to evince the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obligation of that Oath, I do affirme that they are perjured. 3. He tells us, <hi>That scandalous faults tho de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving censure, yet while it is not inflicted, and the person not convict, his Ministry ought to be waited upon, as Iudas who came cloathed with Christs commission to preach, so long as he was not convict, yet was to be heard. Ans.</hi> 1. He grants <hi>that scandalous faults, specially of an high nature, and if the man be impenitent, do deserve deposition.</hi> Now their faults are both scandalous and of a high nature, such as prophanity, perjury and apostacy, in all which they are most impenitent and avow the same; and as for their being convict and censured, which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as needfull for disowning them, I answer they stand upon the matter convict by clear scripture grounds, and by the standing acts and Iudicial decision of this Church in her supreme judicatories and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which have condemned and made censurable with deposition their present principles and practices, in opposition to her vows and government. Again, there is a great difference betwixt what ought to be people's carriage toward scandalous Ministers when a redress by Lawfull Church Judicatories may be had, to which people may have recourse, and what the duty of a people is in that case, wherin a prevailing backsliding party, and a persecuting Magistrat owne such Ministers; so that the true Church can have no access for censuring and removing them. In this last case supposing their scandals to be of a high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this inevitable necessity of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity for present, may supply the defect of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal censure (in the judgment of some) and ground a disowning of them, as if they were already cast out,

especially if their entry be by perjurious intrusion, and their profanity and scandals therafter notour to all. Now how applicable this is to Conformists, needs not my paines to subsume. We might also here tell him that there are scandals which are <hi>officiall,</hi> rendring the man <hi>coram Deo</hi> no officer, and that in case of their becoming very atrocius Mr Durham will allow to depart to more pure ordinances. <hi>On scandal page</hi> 129. Although we will not take upon us to determine, how &amp; in what cases, during the Churches incapacity, &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed state, a Ministers atrocious scandals after his entry, and perjurious usurpation in the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therof, may supply the want of a formal censure, yet absolutly to deny that in any imaginable case, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the scandals and intrusion of the minister, the Churches incapacity to censure, or the peoples clamant necessity, and apparent advantages for their edification otherwise they were oblidged to own him still, and that nothing but this declarative sentence, could loose their tye, would, infer very dangerous consequences obvious to the meanest reflection. Specialy that in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of supposed duties, flowing from the tye and relation, they would crosse many scriptur-precepts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the contrary. Shall Christs sheep follow the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and stranger, and not beware of wolves and false prophets, strengthen Covenant breakers, and scisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, because a perturbed Church cannot draw forth her censure. If it be said that this will open a door for separation, since every one displeased, may pretend that scandals are of an highnature. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The sinful abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive pretences of men, is a poor argument to infringe any truth or duty. 2. This absurdity may be retorted in the other extreme, and under pretence of the mans exterior call who is not (nor can be in a Churches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed state) censured, Christs sheep may (as I said) be given up to destroying wolves, the means and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104445:303"/>
of their edification lost, and their soules exposed to most imminent hazard of perishing. 2. There is a pure Ministry and Church free of their scandalls, and testifying against them, so that adherence to them rather then Curats is only a <hi>non-union to corruption,</hi> or a scandalous party of Innovators who have gone out from the fellowship of this Church, and such a <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration negative or non-union,</hi> as Mr Rutherfoord allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, <hi>Due right of Presbyt. pag.</hi> 253, 254. such as he sayes was <q>the carriage of the faithfull in relation to the Donatists in Augustines time, or a separation from the <hi>most and worst part</hi> not the <hi>least and best part,</hi> as he there distinguishes, calling the greatest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt part the Schismaticks; As before the Jewes came to blaspheme, there was no reason to joyn to them rather then the Gospel Church, planted by the Apostles, to which Mr Rutherfoord sayes, converts were to adhere.</q> 3. We have heard that according to our principles and the tenor of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we are to look upon them as <hi>Schismaticks from this Church.</hi> So that upon this very ground of <hi>hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and mantaining this Churches purity and union,</hi> they are to be disowned by Gods people. Our <hi>Informer</hi> will grant that abstracting from a Ministers being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise either censured or censurable, he ought not to be followed in a Schismatick course to the ruine of a pure Churches union, but is <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be left: for upon this <hi>ground</hi> he pleads for <hi>disowning Presbyterian Ministers</hi> abstracting from their being any <hi>otherwayes censured.</hi> 4. Are there not many Presbyterian ministers <hi>neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict nor censured,</hi> and whom he dare not call <hi>scandalous,</hi> whose conversation and walk is both convincing and shining, and such as discovers that Christ is in them, that they have the masters seal and call to preach the Gospel, who have entered into this Church by the door, and are standing in a ministrrial <hi>relation</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:104445:304"/>
to her, yet he pleads for disowning them, meerly because their Ministry is cross to the <hi>prelatick union and order.</hi> So he must grant that Ministers may be disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this ground of Innovating upon, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in opposition to <hi>a Churches establisht union and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> abstracting from this formal censure. As for what he adds of Judas, its very impertinently alledged here, for his theft and other wickedness was as yet <hi>secret,</hi> and not become <hi>open</hi> and <hi>scandalous,</hi> which excepts him from the compass of this question, which is anent Ministers guilty of <hi>open and avowed scandalls,</hi> intrusion into the Ministry, violent ejection of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pastours, and persecution of a pure Church. None of which can be said of Judas.</p>

               <p>But 2. To his argument, <hi>The pharisees were scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their life, corrupt in their doctrine, yet the saints separat not from ordinances, and Christ allowed to hear them.</hi> This man might (if he had been ingenuous) have found this objection solidly answered and removed by severals. I answer 1. Its more then he hath proved, that the owning of the Pharisees ministry is here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, because 1. The command of <hi>observing what they enjoyned,</hi> will not necessarly infer this; we may observe what morall Philosophers, or papists bid us do under such like restrictions and limitations, upon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104445:305"/>
which people are enjoyned to observe what the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees prescribed; we may observe what civil Rulers bid us do, but not own them as teachers. 2. There are many things in the context, which seem utterly to repugn to this inference that our Lord enjoyned the owning or attending of their instructions as ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick teachers. 1. He bids beware of <hi>their leaven or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> Math. 16. 12. joyning them with Sadducees who denyed the resurrection, and erred fundamentally, sure not to hear them was the best way to evite their leaven, 2. It will be hard to prove that they were <hi>Priest Pharisees,</hi> since all the Pharisees were not such, as <hi>Nieodemus and Ioseph of Arimathea,</hi> who were civil Rulers, and consequently any command to <hi>obey them,</hi> will no more infer <hi>hearing them preach,</hi> then such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as to council or parliament. The thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is not <hi>hearing them as teachers,</hi> but only <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> which may be very properly enjoyned as to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rulers. 3. The <hi>qualities ascribed unto them,</hi> such as their sitting in <hi>Moses chair,</hi> who was King in Jesurun, not <hi>Aarons</hi> who was the Piest, their loving the chief seats in synagogues, (whereas, if teachers, their chief seat was knowen, and appropriat to them) their paying tithes (whereas, if priests tithes were payable to them) these qualities (I say) seem to import that they were not <hi>priests and teachers by office,</hi> that hearing of them, or attending their ministry as such, is enjoyned <hi>hearing of</hi> and atteding their Ministry as such. 15. 4. Christ bids <hi>let them alone,</hi> which sounds like, <hi>owne them not as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</hi> He calls them <hi>blind leaders of the blind,</hi> nay he calls them <hi>the stranger whose voice the true sheep hear not,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true shepherd Math. 15. 13, 14, Joh. 10. 4, 5. and such as shut up heaven against men, and hindred such as were entring; all which seem very inconsistent with a command of <hi>hearing them.</hi> 5 Christ spoke to the disciples as well as the people in this precept. Now its certain
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104445:305"/>
that neither the disciples did eyer hear them, nor could they leave his Ministry, nor is it found that Christ who came to fulfill all righteousness, taught them to do so, by his example. Finally the words of this precept have for their scope to engadge to beware of the Pharisees infectious evills: so that this command to do &amp; observe what they delivered as sitting in Moses seat, which they did then possess, is but by way of concession, which supposes only that which he intended shortly to abolish, and now would have improven for the best advantadge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Granting that they were to be heard, I deny his consequence, that therfore Curats in this our case are to be heard also; the cases are very different, and the disparity when cleared will discover his consequence to be naught, <hi>from the hearing of the Pharisees, to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Conformists.</hi> I offer it then in these particulars. 1. These Pharisees Ministry was not <hi>of it self actually exclusive of, and a direct intrusion upon</hi> the Ministry of faithfull teachers. Suppose they had chased away all Israels Lawfull teachers, and by perjurious violence thrust themselves into their rooms, would our Lord have bidden own or hear them? If our <hi>Informer</hi> say so he will contradict himself, and overturn the scope of his reasoning in this dialogue, for he thniks that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of Presbyterian ministers, <hi>is intrusion,</hi> and therupon pleads <hi>for disowning and not hearing them.</hi> 2. He pleads for owning Curats <hi>as Christs ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours cloathed with his authority to deliver his message,</hi> but Christ doth here (at least for any thing he hath said from this text) only enjoyn to hear <hi>the Pharisees interpretation and decision of that nations Municipal or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law,</hi> anent the rules of external righteousness and civil policy, which two are very different. 3. Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving guarded the Law from their corrupt glosses, and the disciples from their snares, shewes in this precept
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104445:306"/>
how to make the best advantage of that dispensation, now ready to vanish away, since he was shortly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a gospel ministry, and remove all that legal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, and then none of them were to be heard: But this man pleads for disowning our faithfull sent gospel ministers under a standing relation to this Church, and the obligation of Christs standing command, and commission to officiat, and this in favours of intruding hirelings usurping their places, and opposing these faithfull Ambassadours in their masters work and message. Now who sees not the difference betwixt these. 4. They were not in a stated opposition to a faithfull body of teachers, ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged and owned by the sound Church of Israel and testifying against them, seeking to root them out, and together with them a reformation, to which all had recently vowed adherence. 5. There was <hi>no badge or Test of complyance w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>b all their abominations</hi> particularly appointed and enjoyned by the Rulers, in this <hi>act of hearing</hi> them, as there is in our case in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the hearing of Curats, rendring (as I said) the not hearing them, and adherence rather to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministry testifying against them, <hi>a case of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> especially this difference will be apparent, if our National vows and Covenant, expresly obliging <hi>to adhere to these faithfull ministers,</hi> in opposition to them and their course of backsliding, be duely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Next, as for what he sayes of Simeon and Anna; Joseph and Mary, their attending the temple Worship at that time; as his argument there from is removed by what is said, so to clear this further, I add 1. That its wide reasoning from the godly their lawful concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with that Church (now under the rust of old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions) in what was good and sound, to our deserting a sound Church and ministry to comply
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104445:306"/>
with <hi>abjured corruptions, and Schismatick innovators,</hi> reintroduced after they have been cast out. 2. Its as wide reasoning, from their <hi>not separating</hi> from Gods ancient Church upon the ground of corruptions, to conclude against <hi>non-complyance with a party who are not our Church</hi> (tho they usurp her name) but are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and testifyed against, by our true Church and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. We in this case (as I have said) do not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat from the <hi>Church of Scotland, her Doctrine, Worship, or ministry,</hi> but only from <hi>Schismatick backsliders from the union &amp; reformation of this Church.</hi> But in the case of these old saints &amp; worthies, separation from the temple, would have imported an absolute separation from <hi>the ministry &amp; Church of Israel.</hi> In a word, the utter impertinency of all his pleading in this argument, and from these instances, appears in this, that he supposes that its meerly for Conformists <hi>personal faults</hi> we disowne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances administred by them, as if they were ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> by polluted; which has no more truth in it, then that its meerly for Presbyterian ministers <hi>personal faults</hi> as pulluting the worship, that he pleads for disowning them, but upon the grounds of the present case and circumstances, wherein they stand, he pleads for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning Presbyterian ministers, and they more justly because of Conformists present case, plead for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning them, as is said and cleard above.</p>
               <p>After this he cites Mr Durham on Revel. 3. <hi>infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from what is said of the Angel of Sardis and Laodicea, that a minister as to his case unsound, may be owned and esteem'd as such.</hi> But how impertinent this is to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any may see, for their scandalous carriage in their walk is much more then unsoundness as to their case, which notwithstanding we acknowledge will not of it self, and <hi>primo instanti</hi> warrand separation from ordinances in every case. But we have cleared that we have much more to lay to the charge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104445:307"/>
then either <hi>inward unsoundness, or outward scandalls</hi> simply considered; even their corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, their intrusion, their stated opposition to this Church her principles, union, and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As to what Mr Durham adds, and our <hi>Informer</hi> cites in relation to <q>the ordinances their not suffering derogation in whatsoever hands they be anent a due ministerial respect to the Pharisees tho their rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness was discovered by our Lord: that Judas was to be received as an Ambassadour with other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles—that God makes usefull Instruments sometimes—and that edification doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly depend upon the holiness of the Instrument, Act. 3. 12. Matth. 7. 23.</q> Its utterly remote from our purpose, as is clear from what is said, for neither can he prove that this practice is a <hi>separation properly such,</hi> nor doth that case of <hi>an Improvement of the pharisees teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing during that time of the legall dispensation, now shortly to be abolisht,</hi> meet our purpose, nor the case of Judas <hi>hid abominations,</hi> correspond with that of <hi>avowed perjury and apostacy from the vows and Reformation of our Church.</hi> Nor is there here a supposed <hi>prior obligation of adherence to conformists ministry,</hi> preponderating any objection <hi>as to their scandalls.</hi> What can this man say, if we shall plead these reasons of Mr Durham, for adhering to Presbyterian ministers, viz. <q>
                     <hi>that ordinances ought not to be despised in whatever hands they be, that even the pharisees and Judas himself might be heard,</hi> and therefore much more Presbyterian ministers of this Church, that God can make even graceless men Instruments of good; that the efficacy of means depends not on the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the instrument.</q> Now will he admit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of <hi>owning Presbyterian Ministers</hi> from these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; nay, he thinks that maters stand so with them because of their supposed <hi>Schism and disorder,</hi> that for as applicable as these things are to them, yet they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104445:307"/>
ought not to be heard. And so by <hi>his own confession and pleading</hi> this will conclude nothing for him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his above mentioned <hi>groundless suppositions</hi> be made good. Now let me retort of our <hi>Informers</hi> angry Querie here, how can they Justifie withdrawing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from Presbyterian Ministers, since not so bad as the scribes and Pharisees, if they have <hi>either knowledge or moderation.</hi> He must then of necessity grant, if he will not contradict himself, that all these grounds will not plead for hearing in some cases, &amp; that the London Ministers assertion anent <hi>the validity of the Episcopal ordination for substance</hi> (repeated here again <hi>ad nauseam)</hi> falls utterly short of proving his conclusion. Those Ministers do assert, that the Presbyterian ordination <hi>is the more pure and conform to the scripture pattern,</hi> what will he then say to this conclusion, that upon this ground (and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially because Conformists themselves owne the validity of Presbyterian Ministers ordination) <hi>they are inconsequent to themselves, as well as going cross to scripture and sound reason, in disowning the ministry of the Presbyterian ministers of this Church, and withdrawing people from hearing them.</hi> Let him pull out this beam from his own eye, and his answer shall easily serve for us.</p>
               <p>The Doubter alledges, that in Math. 23. [We are not bidden hear the scribes and Pharisees, and that the words will not bear that.] He answers <hi>that he forbids not to hear as we forbid to hear Conformists. Ans.</hi> 1. We have seen that there is more may be alledged from the Scripture as to a prohibition to be their ordinary and constant hearers at least, (which he pleads for as to Conformists) then he can alledge as to a command of hearing. 2. That the tollerance or allowance of a hearing of them during that shortly to be abolisht le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dispensation, is far from coming up to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of owning curats in this our case. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104445:308"/>
                  <hi>that Mr Durham speaks of a ministerial respect due to these Pharisees, and that without hearing, this ministerial respect is Lame. Ans.</hi> Mr Durhams reason anent a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial respect is in relation to the Improvement of their teaching, &amp; tho granted in the greatest latitude he can imagine, will not inferr his conclusion of owning Curats in this case as is already cleared. Admitting that a <hi>due Ministerial respect,</hi> will infer <hi>hearing</hi> in Mr Durhams sense and instance, yet in our case, (which I told him Mr Durhams assertion will not speak unto) acknowledgment of a man to be a Minister, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>a Ministerial respect in so far,</hi> will not bear this conclusion, else the <hi>Informer</hi> hath in a clap devoured and eaten in again all this Dialogue in pleading against this Ministerial respect in hearing Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whose Ministerial authority he acknowledges. 2ly, He answers, <hi>that our Lord enjoyns obedience to that which they bid do, and that as sitting in Moses chair—and how could that be except the people heard them teach from Moses chair—he that bids obey a Ministers injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the word of God, consequently bids hear him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his doctrine from the word. Ans.</hi> We told him that for any thing that he, or any of his fellow pleaders, have yet offered from this text, these Pharisees might be <hi>civil national doctors and interpreters of Moses Iudiciall Law, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> municipal Law,</hi> from his civil chair, who was <hi>King in Iesurun,</hi> which will no more infer a hearing them <hi>teach and preach as Church officers,</hi> then our obedience to the <hi>King, Council, parliament and Session,</hi> will infer that conclusion. 2. His paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels as to <hi>the command of obeying a Ministers doctrine from the word</hi> its inferring <hi>an injunction of hearing him deliver these doctrines from the word,</hi> is (in this case and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) pityfull sophistry and begging of the question, in supposing that these anent whom this injunction was given, were <hi>Ecclesiastick Ministers,</hi> which he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104445:308"/>
hath not yet proved. 2. That <hi>teaching from Moses chair,</hi> is in this case equivalent to <hi>Ministerial gospel teaching and preaching from the word of God,</hi> which he has not proved either, since (as I said) Gods word contained the Jews municipal Law, which civil Judges might in that capacity deliver and interpret, in relation to external righteousness betwixt man and man in things of this life. Finally, granting they were to be heard teach and expone, which he hath not yet made good from the text, it will nothing help his cause for the reasons often given: so that the <hi>separation</hi> which he improves this place against, being his <hi>groundless suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> alledged but not proven by him, and by us dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by what is said above, and likewise the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>of this hearing the Pharisees</hi> to our <hi>hearing Curats,</hi> being his bare <hi>petitio principii,</hi> his assertion after sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned viz. <hi>that this passage will stand against us to our conviction as against the seperatists in Queen Elizabeths time;</hi> is but a piece of his ignorant arrogant confidence; there being a vast difference betwixt our case, and that of those separatists at that time, as shall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. And beside, Presbyterian Ministers of this Church have much more to say from this text, for their people's adhering to them, then prelatists can plead.</p>
               <p>The Doubter next alleadges, [that many Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall men have entered upon honest mens Labours, and therefore ought to be disowned as intruders.] He answers 1. <hi>That all are not such, that some Conformists have keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> their places they bad before the change, others have entered in to the labours of those that are dead and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported elswhere. Ans.</hi> Our <hi>Informer</hi> doth miserably pinch and narrow <hi>a sinfull intrusion</hi> by this description; which himself must acknowledge. For should a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Minister step into his own Church upon the death or transportation of one of the Curats, who
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104445:309"/>
will question that this man will call it an intrusion according to his principles anent the prelatick Church, and so he must acknowledge that notwithstanding what he here pleads, the Curats entry is intrusion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our principles; beside that the Ministery of those who have conformed, and were Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially ordained, being an <hi>express owning of the principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> practices and design, of this prelatick schismatick destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party,</hi> and by their acceptance of collation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, and concurring in the Prelats pretended Judicatories, <hi>a ministry compleatly of the prelatick mould,</hi> its <hi>reductive,</hi> if not <hi>formaliter,</hi> an intrusion; or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with the general intrusion and usurpation upon the pure reformed Ministry and Church of Scotland, even as a state officer or Magistrat his taking his office from <hi>Invaders,</hi> while an army is in the fields against them, doth fully and fitly denominate him an <hi>Invader</hi> in the exercise thereof, tho it be <hi>materially</hi> the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and imployment which he had before. Or as an inferior officer in an army taking his <hi>office and a new commission</hi> from an <hi>usurping General,</hi> and other usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping superior officers, who are dissolving and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the true army,</hi> expelling the <hi>true General</hi> and officers contrary to their first commission, doth partake in that usurpation. Considering the Church of Scotland as it stood establisht in doctrine, discipline, worship, and government, and her National and solemn vows, surely this course of Conformity is a most <hi>gross intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon her,</hi> without so much as a shadow of consent; and so is all partaking therein by consequence, which no Conformist can acquit himself of; and therefore according to the tenor and principles of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, cannot be lookt upon as any of our true Church her Sons and Ministers.</p>
               <p>But here our <hi>Informer</hi> poseth us with some great <hi>queries</hi> forsooth 1. <hi>Whether Conformists were active in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:104445:309"/>
                  <hi>Presbyterian ministers, or came in before they were out, and their places declared vacant. Ans.</hi> Whoever is active or passive in outting them, one thing is sure, they are violently thrust out contrary to the word of God, and the rules, order, and Reformation of this Church. So that come in who will, they are Intruders. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have come in upon a charge to which faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers of this Church have Christs Keyes and commission. 2. Because come in and obtruded by those who are ingrained <hi>usurpers, thieves and Robbers;</hi> I mean perfidious Prelats (often abjured and cast out of this Church with detestation) and not in the order of this Church, Nor by her door. A poor man is by a number of Robbers <hi>dispossest of his house,</hi> they put in <hi>a seeming neutral,</hi> to keep house for them; the poor own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er seeks <hi>his possession,</hi> &amp; complaines of this <hi>usurpation,</hi> O saith the new tennant and Robbers depute, I am no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, I have a good right, I put you not out, but found your house empty. Now let <hi>the Informer</hi> use a litle ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest application and answer his weightie <hi>Querie.</hi> 2. He asks, <hi>why will those dispossest ministers suffer the people to starve, because they have slept out of their charges. Ans.</hi> The people are <hi>starved</hi> &amp; <hi>poysoned too</hi> by those that come in; &amp; these Ministers are concerned upon their faith to the <hi>great shepherd,</hi> to endeavour what they can to save his lambes from the wolves, and give faithfull Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial warning of their <hi>flocks hazard.</hi> Next, he tells us, <hi>though a minister be transported against his will, yet the people should submit to his successor.</hi> True, when for the Churches greater good, he is transported to another watchtower by her faithfull guides, and true Church Judicatories, but not when the true pastour is chased away by usurping perjured Prelats; and an <hi>intruding hireling</hi> brought in as <hi>their vicar.</hi> Its this mans <hi>perted self</hi> (to use his own phrase here) that blurrs his eyes to draw a <hi>similitudinar argument</hi> from such an <hi>absimilar instance.</hi> One thing he did well to add as a proviso, viz
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104445:310"/>
                  <hi>the successors coming in upon an orderly or fair call.</hi> And doth this man think that Conformists have this <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call</hi> according to the Reformation and doctrine of this Church? Nay, is he not disputing against this call, and so if this be a necessary condition of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Lawfull succession, the <hi>Informer</hi> is in the briers of a palpable inconsistency near of kin to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. <q>As for what he adds of the necessity of a Ministry, and making the best of what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</q> help in our superiours, we say, that were the Rulers using their power for giving one <hi>Lawfull pastour</hi> for another, and in the method of this Church, and according to the <hi>scripture pattern, by Lawfull Church Indicatories,</hi> these reasons would say something; but when they have overturned the Reformation of a Church, and contrary to that Churches vows and their own, are obtruding abjured prelats, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of profane hyrelings as their deputes, to exclude and ruine a faithfull Ministry, his reasons in this case are naught, and speak nothing to the point. <q>As for what he adds afterward of Ministers, in the year 1648 ejected for asserting their duty to the King, and their submitting while others were put into their charges.</q> I Answer, he will never while he breaths be able to prove, that they were deposed for asserting their duty to the King, and not rather for promoting an ungodly course tending to the Kings ruine, and the ruine of our Reformation, and for other pieces of their scandalous miscarriages, by the true Lawfull Judicatories of this Church. So that upon both grounds, the flocks were concerned to submit to such faithfull pastours, as were set over them in the way and method of this Church, and according to the scripture pattern.</p>
               <p>His last answer to this argument of his Doubter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Conformists Intrusion is, <q>that Presbyterian
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104445:310"/>
Ministers intrusion, is from parish to parish over the Labours of all the Ministers of Scotland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Conformists intrusion (if it be so) is but over one parish.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We told him before, that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers, notwithstanding the prelats vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and usurpation, are <q>Ministers of this Church</q> of Scotland continuing still in that relation to her; So that the present presecution and violence, as well as backsliding of the Prelatick schismaticks and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators, warrands their more enlarged officiating by the same grounds, upon which the presecute officers of the Church of Jerusalem went <hi>every where pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now follows another argument of his Doubter [that Episcopal Ministers are abjured as depending upon the hierarchy, and therefore cannot be heard without breach of the Oath.] In what respects the owning of Conformists, especially as that practice is now circumstantiat, is a breach of Covenant, we have cleard above, and need not again repeat it. He answers. 1. <hi>That Ministers are not mentioned in that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</hi> But if they depend <hi>upon that Ecclesiastical hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy as Church Officers,</hi> why are they not mentioned. Next, its enough for our purpose, that the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Ministry <hi>as depending upon prelats,</hi> is in this our case abjured. 2. He tellsus, <hi>that dependance on that hierarchy doth suppose, and is to be understood of a hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, made up of all the officers enumerate in that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as the English Presbyterians sense it, which hierarchy we have not in</hi> Scotland. This conceit I have already confuted, and proved that beside this Article, we are by the first bound to <hi>preserve the establisht Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Government of this Church, and to adhere to all that enter</hi> into this <hi>Oath, in the pursuing of its ends;</hi> and <hi>not to suffer our selves to be withdrawen from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and our union therein by terrour or persuasion,</hi> is an obligation lying upon us in the 6. Article, which doth abundantly (as we have said,) reach the disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Conformists.</p>
               <p>In the next place he tells us, <hi>that to binde our selves to disowne Ministers depending upon Bishops, is to binde our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to sin.</hi> I Answer whatever may be said of such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgement <hi>simpliciter</hi> and absolutly considered, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to engadge our selves against <hi>the reintroduction of Prelacy into a pure Church reformed from it,</hi> and against <hi>all dependers upon, and promoters of that Interest in such a Church,</hi> in the capacity of Church officers, and <hi>eatenus</hi> as promoting and depending upon it, is both <hi>a lawfull and necessary engadgment,</hi> necessarly flowing from &amp; depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104445:311"/>
upon the abjuration <hi>of prelacie it self.</hi> That Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters tho faulty may be heard, will (as we have oft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate) nothing help his conclusion. Since he can not deny that their <hi>faultiness</hi> in some cases may barr <hi>their being heard,</hi> as he supposes Presbyterian Ministers faults puts a Lawfull stop in the way of people's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them. Then he tells us, <hi>that he hath showen epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy to be a Lawfull government which none might Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjure,</hi> for this we referr the Reader to what is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered on the <hi>first Dialogue</hi> where we have proven the contrary, and that it is a government contrary to the word of God, which therefore we were obliged to abjure.</p>
               <p>Lastly he tells us, <hi>that by this exposition of the</hi> 2. <hi>Article we were bound not to owne Ministers who were in office at the taking of the Covenant, but to extirpat them since they depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Bishops as to their ordination still, even after they had taken the Covenant, unless they renounced their ordination received from Bishops, and had been ordained a new by meer Presbyters, which they thought themselves not bound to do by the Covenant, or they were Ministers without a true or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination all that time, and then all their Ministerial Acts were null since they proceeded from that ordination.</hi> And yet (he sayes) <hi>we never serupled to hear such Ministers notwithstanding of this dependance upon Bishops in part, if they disowne Bishops for the future. Ans.</hi> What a silly knack is it which all this tatle is founded upon, viz. <hi>Ministers who received ane ordination from Bishops, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops with Presbyters, in a Church upon which they had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped, are still to be lookt upon as Ministers depending upon Bishops, even after Prelacy is abolished, and Presbyterian Government established in that Church.</hi> So poor a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I am sure the least reflection may discover its vanity, ordination being Gods ordinance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and the Bishop <hi>qua Presbyter</hi> being vested with a power in it, ordination by the Bishop with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104445:312"/>
Presbyters (tho maim'd in respect of the Bishop's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated power, which is a corruption adhering to it) cannot by any good consequence be said to depend in its <hi>esse</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> upon the Prelat, and far less in <hi>operari</hi> or <hi>esse</hi> after that corruption is removed and abjured, and Presbyterian Government set up. Doth a souldier or Officers commission or Military power slow still from a Colonel after he is disbanded? Nay this is too gross inadvertency. Were <hi>Zuinglius, Luther,</hi> and other of our Reformers dependents upon the <hi>papacy or popish Prelats</hi> after their cleaving to, and embracing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? Do not all our divines distinguish the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials of their ordination from <hi>these corruptions adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it,</hi> and assert that they had a Ministry Lawfull for substance, and an ordination to their Ministry, tho coming to them through that impure channell. This man Justifies the <hi>Pope's plea,</hi> where is your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry (saith he and the Romanists) you have no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry but what you have from us? do not our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes tell them that the Ministry and ordination it self being Gods institution, we have them from the Lord, now restored and recovered from their corruptions, and are not dependers upon them for our Ministry? did all our Reformers Ministerial acts flow from <hi>the pope or papal ordination</hi> as such? Let our <hi>Informer</hi> take heed of this <hi>praemunire,</hi> for this dangerous error which he hath fallen into, will expose him to the severe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all protestant Churches. 2ly, Hence Ministers who were ordained by Prelats with Presbyters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, were no more bound (yea less bound) to renounce their ordination simply, then <hi>Zuinglius or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> were obliged to renounce theirs; especially since their ordination was in a protestant Church, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Prelats owning the protestant profession (which our <hi>Informers</hi> charity will no doubt esteem a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable difference) and their not renouncing it <hi>simpliciter</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104445:312"/>
will no more make them still dependent upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates as to their Ministry, when prelats are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then <hi>Zuinglius and Luther</hi> were dependent upon the <hi>Pope</hi> as to their ordination, and the acts flowing therefrom, after their separation from the Church of Rome, or infer that they did owe their baptism to the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the ordination of the popish priest who bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them, and were concerned to be rebaptized. So that the popish cause and interest is much oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our <hi>Informer,</hi> if his pleadings for our prelacy wil hold good; and it is no bad <hi>omen</hi> that both inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests are thus embarqued together in this man and his fellows reasonings for them, and must stand and fall together, which fortifies our hope and confidence, that as the first hath begun to fall, so the other shall gradually decay, wither, and fall with it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The <hi>Informers</hi> answer to the Doubters argument anent <hi>separation from a corrupt Church,</hi> and the retorted charge of <hi>schisme</hi> upon Conformists, examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUr Doubt-Resolver will seem ingenuous in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering an answer to some chief objections against the owning of Conformists, and therfore puts into the mouth of his personat Doubter, some more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, in such a mould as he supposes is for his best advantadge, which I shal now consider, and deal faithfully with him and his supposed Doubter, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting these arguments, (which he hath disguised) in their genuine strength, and shall examine his ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104445:313"/>
which when weighed in the scripture ballances and according to the true state of this question will no doubt be found as empty and insignificant as any of the preceeding.</p>
               <p>The Doubter hath another argument [that we are warranted by the word to separat from a corrupt Church.] This objection he curtly and advantagiously propones, making his Doubter suppose 1. a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <hi>separation</hi> in this practice, from a Church to which we are bound to adhere, which this new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat has not as yet made good. 2. That any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions generally, or such as may denominate a Church in some measure corrupt, will warrand a separation, which is a principle we do not owne. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Church may be joyned with Lawfully wherein there are great corruptions, and this with Mr Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and others on that subject. But as to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we say, if the contraverted joyning be in that which is clear and necessary duty in the present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, there can be in this joyning no stain, but in so far as a concurrence with that which is duty out of <hi>that complex case,</hi> cannot be performed without a direct complyance with, or stain of these corruptions, then a proportioned separation is needfull in so far as suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that exigence; and yet even in this case we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that other duties in the fellowship with that same Church may be owned: and that fellowship is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to be broken off (upon the preceeding ground) in these things wherein there is no such hazard. But now what sayes he to this argument, 1. He tells us, <hi>we are mistaken if we think the Bishops a corruption, and that this will not be granted. Ans.</hi> I hope I have made it evident that they are a corruption, and therefore to be disowned. The 2 answer is, <hi>that its a mistake to think that for corruptions, and even great corruptions, a Church is to be separat from.</hi> Then he tells us, <hi>of the corrupted</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:104445:313"/>
                  <hi>of the Church of Galatia; that in the Church of Corinth an article of the creed was denyed, that there were great faults in the Asian Churches Rev.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>and of the great corruptions that were in the Church of Israel, as is evident in the books of the Kings and Prophets, yet the people of God were not commanded to separat as long as the substance of the worship was not corrupted, as it was by Ieroboams calves. Ans.</hi> 1. What if Presbyterians shall borrow this argument from him, and from these instances of not separating from a Church, notwithstanding of great corruptions, shall plead for all professors in Scotland their adhering to Presbyterian Ministers and this Presbyterian Church, as having <hi>a worship not substantially corrupted,</hi> whatever other <hi>personal faults,</hi> or corruptions they may be lyable unto, that yet they are a true Church as to the main, and that therfore they ought to be joyned with, as the Churches of Corinth and Galatia (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were great corruptions) were still adhered to by professors. What will he say in this case? I know he will say that its ridiculous for such a party of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks to call our selves <hi>the Church of Scotland.</hi> But what if we return this answer to him again, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Reformation and principles of our Church (out of which Prelats were ejected, vows against them universally taken on, and Presbyterial government compleatly setled therein) Its ridiculous to call <hi>a party of Prelats and their adherents the Church of Scotland,</hi> or for them to usurp her name, who have thus overturned her Reformation. So that untill he make good the above mentioned <hi>hypothese:</hi> or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, viz. <hi>that Conformists are the true organick Church of Scotland, that this our practice is a separation properly such; that its meerly because of Conformists personal faults that we withdraw;</hi> that we are <hi>under prior obligations to adhere unto Curats with all their corruptions rather then our Presbyterian Ministry and Church,</hi> which is both free of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104445:314"/>
them and contending against them; untill these and such like suppositions be made good, his argument from the preceeding scripture Iostances as to joyning with a Church that hath corruptions, is a meet <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio principii,</hi> and will not help his cause in the least. Which will be further evident if we consider in the 2d place, that the case of these Churches and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors therein was far from ours in relation to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Doctrinal corruptions</hi> of Galatia as to the legal Ceremonies, (by the bad influence of judaizing tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers) tho they were of a large, yet the <hi>Informer</hi> will not prove they were either of such an universal spread and tincture, or strengthned by such an universal acknowledgment, as to make the state of that Church correspond with his <hi>hypothesis</hi> in this argument. 2. That error in the Church of Corinth in relation to the resurrection, appears not to have been owned by their teachers and Church officers, far less publickly avowed and obstinatly and presumptuously maintaired by them or any considerable number of hearers, which makes their case wide from ours, wherein so many preachers who call themselves Pastours of this Church, &amp; many others, obstinatly and avowedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our abjured corruptions; the Church of Corinth was in capacity to censure any handfull that owned this error, &amp; <hi>to purge out this leaven,</hi> but so is not our Church in this case as to the mantainers of Prelacy and its other corruptions, so that there is here no remedy but for the sound part to keep themselves pure from their conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and destroying course.

He answeres by denying this assertion. <hi>Neque enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>tota Ecclesia Corinthiorum negabat resurrectionis fidem: sed aliqui tantum, quos redarguebant alij. Idem de Galata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Ecclesia sentiendum: qui nec omnes, nec tam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <q>That is, this whole Church of Corinth denyed not the resurrection, but some only who were opposed by others, the same we must judge of the Church of Galatia, who did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, nor so hainonsly err in the foundation, but by the persuasion of false Apostles were hesitating, whether the faith of Christ was sufficient to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or if the circumcision was also needfull, for he sayes in that same place as also to the Corinthians, a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this leaven was not of them all but of some only, by whom notwithstanding all were in hazard, which the Apostle endeavours to prevent.</q> The Dutch annot upon the same place [How say some among you &amp;c.] observe <q>that this error was not <hi>common of the whóle Church,</hi> but <hi>of some only</hi> whose names are not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104445:315"/>
exprest, as 2 Tim. 2. 17. that by shaming them he might not fright them from conversion. And upon Gal. 5. 9. they shew that this <hi>little leaven</hi> spoken of, may be either understood of the <hi>false doctrine</hi> it self, or <hi>the men</hi> who promoted this doctrine, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were <hi>few</hi> yet did much hurt,—and therefore were to be eshewed.</q> Now, how dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned for extent and infection, these corruptions were unto these of our Church about which our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is, is obvious to the meanest reflection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Lameness of our <hi>Informers</hi> similitudinary argument from the one to the other. Which will be yet further evident, if we consider. That</p>
               <p n="3">3. He cannot make appear, that in any of these Churches there was a formal legal <hi>Iudicial enacting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing and commanding</hi> of these corruptions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours used, to exclude and root out all who would not submit to them, by Barbarous violence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, particularly faithfull Ministers for testifying against the same. Nor can he prove that adherence to these erroneous corrupters in their Worship, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and enjoyned as an express Test and badge of owning their errours, and renouncing the truth, and all the sound party adhering thereto, which is so cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a difference, that it quite invalidats these Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as to any argument against our practice, for this destroying backsliding Innovating party of this Church have laid down courses either to engadge to a <hi>formal owning of their corruptions,</hi> especially the faithful Ministry of this land, or <hi>else to exterminat and root them out &amp; all sound professours together with their Testimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word whatever concurence in duty these corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he mentions may be consistent with, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the sound professors were called <hi>to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves free of the contagion</hi> thereof by all means, and the Church was to use all endeavours <hi>to purge out</hi> and rid
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104445:315"/>
her self of these <hi>corruptions</hi> and <hi>corrupters too</hi> if obstinat, Paul wished they were <hi>cut off</hi> who <hi>troubled</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Galatia, that is censur'd and laid aside as rotten members who were in hazard to grangrene the whole body. The Officers of the Church of Corinth are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to purge out the old leaven,</hi> since a litle would quickly <hi>leavent the whole lump.</hi> And the Apostle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them for not casting out the Incestuous man, &amp; enjoynes the sound professors in that Church to come out from among the unclean and be separat, as they exspect to be received of God. And our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> for not casting out them that held the Doctrine of Balaam, and the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans—and the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> for suffering Jezabel to seduce and infect with scandalous errors and practices the Lords servants. Now the scope of these precepts will say, that when the case is so cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiat, that the Church and sound part can have no access for removing and censuring destroying cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters, especially while by violence endeavouring (after they have departed from a pure Church her sworn Reformation and constitution) to force all to a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them, or exterminat the impolluted rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that this sound Church (I say) are to keep themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves free of their contagion, to follow their duty in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to them, and mutually to strengthen one another therein; which is enough to Justifie our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this case. In like manner, the many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Prophets <hi>to abstain from the pollutions of the time,</hi> and threatnings for accession thereto, will by proportion infer this our practice mentioned, and that when a case is such that no concurrence can be had with Innovators in their worship without the stain of their sin, and when they are persecuting all that will not concur with them, a non-union and forbearance is most necessary. Had any corrupting treacherous
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104445:316"/>
Prophets or others of the Church of Israel in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with persecuting Rulers, <hi>enacted universal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with some gross corruptions, and ejected all the faithfull non complying teachers priests or prophets, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting none to officiat except these corruptions had been formally acknowledged,</hi> Let any say what would have been the faithfull prophets decision in this case, and whether upon the same ground on which they so oft dehort from the least complyance with any sin, they would not have allowed and commanded the faithfull prophets and members of that Church to oppose them, and cleave unto their respective duties, and unto one another in the following thereof. As for what he adds, <hi>that there was then no command to separat from the worship while it was not substantially corrupted.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he will charge a <hi>corruption of the worship it self, or in the substance thereof</hi> upon the duties now owned and performed by Presbyterian Ministers and professors, from whom he notwithstanding thinks its duty to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, so that untill he prove (as I said) Conformists their better claim to officiat as Ministers of this Church, then Presbyterian Ministers, this argument lights heavy on himself, and the censures put upon Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Donatists falls upon their <hi>dividing and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party.</hi> The case of these Schismaticks being as far from ours as east from west; were Novatians or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists first cast out by a violent backsliding party for not concurring in a course of backsliding, in overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Churches sworn reformation, and were they enjoyned &amp; commanded, to owne the course of these backsliders? I think the Donatists &amp; Novatians their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against adherers to the union of the true Church, is a fit emblem of the present practice of Conformists, how can this Man say, <hi>that there were then greater corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them now.</hi> Can there be greater corruptions in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then a papacy of the highest degree, as is their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104445:316"/>
premacy and hierarchy? can there be greater corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>in practice,</hi> then perjury and such grosse propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as Conformists are blotted with for the most part? greater corruption in principles, then <hi>Popish Arminian</hi> errors &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Doubter objects, [that if we may not separat from a corrupt Church, what mean these scripture commands enjoyning separation, such as 2 Cor. 6. 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor. 5. 11 2 Thes 3. 6 Rev. 18. 3] We have already said that he deals deceitfully in making his Presbyterian Doubter assert that we may separat <hi>from a corrupt Church in every case,</hi> but this we say, that in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever case, and in how far soever; we cannot joyn with a corrupt Church without the contagion and stain of its corruptions, in so far and in that case, a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is necessary, and falls within the compass of these scripture commands. And that in this our case, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded conformity as to Presbyterian Ministers and professors cannot be yeelded, without the stain of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists their sin, is above cleared. So that he needs not tell us here, <hi>that every corruption is not a sufficient ground of separation.</hi> For we have heard our <hi>Informer</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>that a Church may be in that degree corrupted, as will render a separation warrantable; yea and necessary.</hi> I could wish he had condescended upon that degree of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and showen us here the <hi>maximum quod sic, &amp; minimum quod non,</hi> as to the ground of this separation, and how far these corruptions may strike at a Churches vitals, and yet her life and essence as a Church sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. And here I would close in a litle with this Man, and enquire, that since a Churches corruptions will (with him) in some cases render a separation necessary, upon what ground is it necessary, and from what prior principle is this concluded? sure it must be upon this ground, <hi>left union with that Church blott the soul, and make us share in her sin.</hi> So that in this case, we are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104445:317"/>
not obliged to hold union and fellowship with her when it is infectious, as is most clearly imported in that command 2 Cor. 6. and if separation be <hi>upon this ground allowed,</hi> whether the corruption be <hi>lesser or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, eatenus or in so far,</hi> we are obliged to separat, for <hi>Majus &amp; minus non variant speciem rei.</hi> Next, I infer that a non-union to a <hi>corrupt party</hi> who cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Church,</hi> or at lest whose being the Church is <hi>magnalis &amp; sub judice,</hi> will be <hi>a fortiori</hi> warranted, and upon lesser grounds then <hi>separation</hi> which supposes <hi>an anterior obligation of union,</hi> and <hi>actuall union</hi> out of this case, and abstracting from it.</p>
               <p>But for these scriptures mentioned, he sayes they will not prove our point, and to that of 2 Cor 6. 14. he answers, <hi>that our Lord is speaking of separating from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly fellowship with Idolaters, not of withdrawing from christian assemblies.</hi> But doth he not enjoyn that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration because of the <hi>hazard of Infection by their sin,</hi> and why not also from christian assemblies where there is <hi>the same hazard of this Infection?</hi> did he not acknowledge that the <hi>case of a Church</hi> or christian Assembly may be such, as will render even <hi>a separation necessary.</hi> Now if in this case the tender separater should plead this text, and that corrupt Church or assembly of Christians give our <hi>Informers</hi> answer, viz. <hi>that it pleads only for separating from fellowship with Idolaters, not of withdrawing from christian Assemblies,</hi> how will he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat himself, and reconcile this answer with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. But for these texts 1 Cor. 5. 11. and 2 Thess. 3. 6. he sayes, <hi>they are meant only of needless fellowship in privat converse with scandalous persons, but allowes not to withdraw from the publick worship because of the presence of such scandalous ones, as if this did pollute the worship, though it may be the fault of Church guides not to keep them back. Ans.</hi> The ground here is the same (and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him) whatever be the withdrawing which is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104445:317"/>
more immediately enjoyned, viz. <hi>lest their fellowship prove contagious, scandalous or in any measure sinfull,</hi> &amp; so if fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with a Church in her Assemblies be <hi>thus infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious,</hi> these scriptures do enjoyn a separation upon <hi>the same ground;</hi> and by necessary consequence from what he hath acknowleged: And therefore this answer is nothing to the purpose, unless he will retract his concession, <hi>that there may be corruptions in a Church and her assemblies, which will render a separation necessary.</hi> Next, as for what he adds, <hi>that ordinances are not polluted by the presence of scandalous ones.</hi> It is not for him, nor against us; since he acknowledges, there may be <hi>a Lawfull</hi> yea <hi>necessary separation from a Church &amp; her assemblies in worship,</hi> tho not upon <hi>this ground</hi> of the <hi>ordinances their pollution by the presence of scandalous ones:</hi> because of the reason which we have already heard; and we do also upon other grounds then this of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended pollution of the ordinances by their scandals, maintain our disowning Conformists in their worship to be a duty (as we have heard) even that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all to a sinfull complyance with them, in a schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick departing from the unity of this Church and perjurious overturning the work of reformation, and will neither suffer Ministers nor professors to joyn with them in worship, but with an express aknowledgement (in the intent of our Laws) and owning of this defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Sure we are commanded to withdraw from every Brother that walks disorderly, (which our <hi>Informer</hi> pleads as a sufficient ground to disowne Presbyterian Ministers &amp; withdraw from them because of their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed disorder and schism, tho the ordinances in their hands are not polluted with their supposed guilt,) and from all fellowship with scandalous brethren, which is contagious and may pollute us, Now, are not they <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disorderly</hi> &amp; cross to the doctrine, discipline, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this Church? are they not consequently
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104445:318"/>
schismaticks? are not their scandals infectious, when they will suffer no Ministers to possess their charges, or officiat either with, or without them, or people to enjoy ordinances among them, without direct own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their defection, and overturning our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a professed submission to their abjur'd prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as is clear in the acts enjoyning Ministers prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and peoples hearing in conformity to prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the supremacy.</p>
               <p>For that of Rev. 18. he sayes, <hi>that it enjoyneth a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Rome's corrupt doctrine and Idolatrous worship, but warrands not a separation from a Church where no such corruption is.</hi> I answer, The ground of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is <hi>the danger of Infection</hi> by Rome's sins, as is expressed in the text, which will consequently hold wherever this danger is, whatever be the <hi>the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sins</hi> from whence this danger flowes, for (as I said) <hi>majus &amp; minus non variant speciem</hi> and we may add, that other Known rule, <hi>a quatenus ad omne valet sequela.</hi> In whatever case an union is unwarrantable and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, a proportioned separation is upon this ground enjoyned. Nay, if the conjunction have but <hi>mali speciem</hi> or be inductive to sin only, the command <hi>of eshewing, every appearance of evill,</hi> will reach this withdrawing, unless the conjunction be on other grounds an <hi>indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible duty.</hi> Now our Covenant obligations, and our Reformation as itstood established being duely ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it will be clear that Conformists are schismaticks and destroying Innovators, and there is no prior obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to joyn with them, but rather to disowne them in this course. Sure this man holds that <hi>fellowship</hi> with Presbyterian Ministers <hi>in their assemblies for worship is contagious,</hi> and that people are obliged <hi>to leave, and come out from them,</hi> tho he dare not lay <hi>Idolatrous worship nor corrupt doctrine</hi> to their charge, and so he must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this and such like commands will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104445:318"/>
a separation upon the general ground here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, abstracting from that special case of Romes Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worship and corrupt doctrine. Its very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical reasoning from the denyall of <hi>the special ground and nature of Romes contagion,</hi> from which christians are called to separat, <hi>to deny a separation upon any other contagion</hi> to fall within the compass of that precept, which is to reason from the denyall of the <hi>species</hi> to the denyal of the <hi>genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Doubter in the next place retorts his charge of separation upon himself, and alledges [that we have better ground to charge Conformists with schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their departing from the government of this Church, to which we are still adhering, so that they have gone out from us, not we from them.] We proved this charge already from the constitution and Reformation of this Church as it stood established, and our universal vows of adherence therunto, so that such as have overturned this work of Reformation, (not Presbyterian government only) they are properly the <hi>first dividers and deserters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us hear how he acquits himself of this charge. 1. He sayes <hi>that their submission to prelacy is in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commands of superiors, whom we are bound to obey in things not sinfull, So that their obedience is duty, and Presbyterians their non submission is disobedience to authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Schisme from the Church.</hi> But 1. His Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alleadging that Presbyterial Government is <hi>the Government of this Church,</hi> and inferring thereupon that departing from it is <hi>Schism,</hi> and that Prelatists have gone out from Presbyterians, not they from them, which is a very clear consequence, and will clearly infer the departers to be Schismaticks upon any description of Schism which he can assigne; And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this being the great ground upon which this man and his fellows do charge Presbyterians with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104445:319"/>
Schism, viz. That they are <hi>separat from the present Prelatick constitution,</hi> since he offers no formal answer either to the antecedent or consequent of his Doubters argument, what will the interposed command of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers signify to alter <hi>the Nature of Schism,</hi> or to make that practice which is <hi>Hactenus</hi> upon Scripture grounds <hi>Schismatical,</hi> to be <hi>no Schism.</hi> This I must say is strange divinity, but like enough to that of these men who make the Magistrate a Pope over the Church, her ordinances, and over sacred Oaths and vows. 2. We have proved that their submission and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this point, is a high rebellion against God, in disowning at mens arbitrary command, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his house appointed in his word, and embracing an abjured Hierarchy contrary to it, and against which all the nations were engadged. So that our practice is obedience to God, and a keeping of the union of Christs body, and theirs is both <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He tells us, <hi>that he hath proved in the first conference E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie to be the only Government left by Christ, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by his Apostles: So that our disowning it is Schism from the Scripture Church Government, and that of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, as well as from them.</hi> To this I only say, that I hope we have made the prelacy he pleads for, appear to be a stranger both to Scripture and antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Again he tells us, <hi>that in this charge of Schism, he means it not only or mainly in respect of Government, but of separating from their Assemblies for Worship, which is Schism tho the Government were wrong.</hi> I answer 1. If he ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledges that <hi>separating from the Government is Schism,</hi> why answers he not our <hi>countercharge,</hi> that their party did <hi>first separat from the Government of this Church, and that therefore the Schism lyes first and principally at their door;</hi> for that which he sayes of <hi>the Magistats command,</hi> is (as we have heard) utterly insignificant to wipe of this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104445:319"/>
charge. 2. This charge of the <hi>first Schism on his part</hi> standing good, for any thing he hath said, that which he here adds <hi>of our being Schismaticks, because of our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from their Assemblies for Worship,</hi> is like wise naught. For upon this ground of his Doubter, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not disprove, viz. That they have made the <hi>first breach and separation,</hi> they are <hi>Hactenus Schismaticks,</hi> and so are to be disown'd <hi>in their worship upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> and ground, upon which he pleads fot disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Presbyterians Assemblies for Worship tho he can lay nothing else to their charge, or alleadge any <hi>substantial corruption</hi> of the worship. And so the recocted <hi>crambe</hi> which he here presents to us again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the Scribes and Pharisees, Simeon and Anna their attending the Temple Worship, Zacharias and Elizabeth, Joseph and Mary their not separating there from &amp;c. Pleads as much for his Presbyterian Doubter in relation to the owning of our Presbyterian Assemblies for Worship (and much more) then for him. Since he dare not say that they are <hi>more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted then the Church of the Iews was at that time,</hi> and so we may echo back his <hi>alas how will you justify this sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of yours,</hi> with an enquiry <hi>how he and his party will justify their separation from the true Ministry of the Church of Scotland?</hi> What if a party of corrupt Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites had risen up and pursued a course of defection, tending to raze and ruine all Gods ordinances, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all such Priests and Levites as would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr with them, and had appointed <hi>an acknowledgment of and concurrence with their wicked defection,</hi> to be <hi>the only condition</hi> upon which they will <hi>admit either priests or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to share in the ordinances? In the mean time a great body of Priests and people adhering to Gods ordinances, and contending against them, had been keeping their possession of the temple Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as long as they could?</hi> I dare refer to our <hi>Informer</hi> to give judgment in this case and shew, what Simeon and Anna, Joseph and Mary would have done, and to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104445:320"/>
which of the parties they would have adhered? And let our cause be judged by this.</p>
               <p>His Doubter in the next place objects [that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists lecture not, &amp; therefore may not be heard.] Here he but trifles to insinuat that this is solely lookt upon by us as a ground of not owning them. But in so far as in this our case its a piece of their apostacy from our <hi>establisht reformed Worrhip,</hi> and an expresse badge of <hi>conformity to prelacy,</hi> and in both these respects, <hi>flat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and breach of Covenant,</hi> we look upon it as having its own influence with other grounds to warrand a <hi>non-union to them</hi> while standing in a stated opposition to faitfull Ministers mantaining, this with other pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Reformation. To this objection our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi> answers, 1. <hi>That some Conformists lectured, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> were separat from.</hi> And so might all of them be upon the forementioned grounds thus disowned and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat from, Altho they had keept a form of this, but I beleeve they are for signs and wonders among them who keep the lecture, or owne it at all. Next he tells us, <q>of the ancient reading of the Scripture in the Jewish Church, and of Moses and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Synagogues, Acts 13. 15, 27. and 15. 21. and likewise in the Christian Church.</q> But what then? who denies this, why, <q>they have (he tells us) the Scriptures publickly read in their Churches.</q> But I trow the <hi>reading</hi> is the better of <hi>expounding,</hi> and he might have found, that the Levites (Neh. 8. 8.) read the Law of God distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gave the sense, and caused the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the reading; And he dare not say that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient publick reading of Scriptures among the Jews was by Gods appointment a dumb reading with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exposition. Why gave God <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>teachers</hi> unto his Church if not for this end? and faith comes mainly by hearing the Word preach't. Why then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104445:320"/>
grew his reverend Fathers and their conforming Sons, so angry with this Churches laudable practise of <hi>giving the sense together with the reading</hi> (comprobat by that ancient Practise of the Jewish Church, which he pretends) since otherwise the Text read ane 100. times is still like a kernell under a hard shell. Nay <q>but he sayes, if we separat upon this ground we would have separat from the Church in all ages.</q> Sure not from that Church where the law was expon'd and its sense given, as well as read, beside that our non-union to our prelatick Innovators, (or withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing too if he please) hath this as an appendix with other grounds, that Conformists in withholding our former <hi>lecture</hi> or <hi>expository reading</hi> from the people, and substituting a <hi>bare reading</hi> in its place, discover themselves to be teachers who are <hi>keeping close</hi> and not <hi>opening the seals of Gods book,</hi> &amp; are afraid that their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers should learn too fast.</p>
               <p>In the 3d place, he tells us a tedious storie, <hi>anent the disuse of our first authorized method of Lecturing, which was at first only to read one chapter in the old testament and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the New with brief explication of occuring difficulties, but that thereafter we held with one chapter, then with a part of one, and raised observations—making it a short sermon, so that its all one to separat for this, as to separat for shorter sermons, which are,</hi> caeteris paribus, <hi>thought better then a long.</hi> Then he tells us further (to cloak this their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness) <hi>that variety of purposes are hardly retained, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a wearying, and that one thing puts out another</hi> &amp;c. But what fruitless talke is all this? If our Churches appointment was of this nature at first to open up diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties upon the reading, did she therefore intend to cut off the exercise of that gift anent practical obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which is found in experience so eminently edifying as himself acknowledges in the next page, and the method of <hi>preaching abroad,</hi> to which method
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104445:321"/>
we are beholden for some excellent commentaries upon the Scripture, which would probably have been by this time Intire through the whole bible according to the design and mould projected by the Reverend brethren and Ministers of this Church, If our Prelats lazy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tribe, had not invaded the pulpits of the Lords faithfull labourers. Again, suppose there was as to this method some deviation from the first appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet since our Church gave a tacit approbation &amp; universally used it, his censure is too critical &amp; saucy; beside, to plead from the variation in the practice to a total disuse, is dull reasoning; and whatever the lecture was at first this is certain, that this universal practice and eminently edifying piece of publick duty, owned by our Church, was presently disused and discharged by prelats, and its disuse became one of the <hi>badges of conformity,</hi> and a part of their <hi>mark</hi> upon <hi>their creatures,</hi> and therefore <hi>eatenus</hi> in all reason it ought to have its own weight with other grounds, as to disowning them, in their present state and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. The experience of all the true seekers of God can disprove sufficiently what he adds, of <hi>a tedious nauseating</hi> as the issue of <hi>variety of purposes;</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety rather taking off, then begetting tediousness whence the Scripture is composed for this end of such a sweet variety of purposes and methods. His story of <hi>Pembo's defiring to hear one word or sentence at once, and no more till after a long time,</hi> is calculat well to patronize a reading or non-preaching Ministry; but the many scripture precepts given to christians anent <hi>growth in Knowledge, and leaving the first principles,</hi> and not to be alwayes <hi>children in understanding,</hi> and likewise the scripture precepts straitly charging and enjoyning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be instant in season and out of season prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, exhorting with all long suffering and doctrine, sufficiently discovers the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

4. He tells us, <q>that suppose it were a fault, every fault will not warrand separation.</q> We say not that every fault, nay nor this simply considered, will warrand separation, but that this with many others presumptuously maintained and avowed, will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand a non-union unto a schismatick party of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors destroying and overturning a well reformed Church, and rooting out a faithfull remnant of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herers thereto. As for <hi>the want of the circumcision and the passover for sometime in the Iewish Church,</hi> which he next pleads as that which did not <hi>cause a separation,</hi> not to stand upon the particular impediment of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision while in the wilderness or an inquiry into what speciall lets might have had an influence (or a sinfull influence) upon the disuse of the passover, yet Conformists case, who are but a <hi>schismatick unsound part of this Church,</hi> rejecting an approved ordinance and duty, in complyance with and subserviency unto a perjurious course of defection, is so far discrepant from this, that any may see the disparity. As for that of 2 Kings 23. 22. <q>That there was not holden such a passover (as that of Josiah) from the dayes of the Judges that judged Israel, nor in all the dayes of the Kings of Israel, nor of the Kings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</q> Its only spoken comparativly in respect of the <hi>spirituality and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>lemnity</hi> of that passover, and doth not suppose ane absolute disuse of this ordinance through all that time. A learned Interpreter upon this passage doth paraphrase the verse thus, <q>that there was no passover celebrat with so solemn care, great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and universal joy, the greater because of their remembrance of their miserable times under Manasseh and Amon.—And that from the dayes of Samuel the last of the Judges, as its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressed 2 Chron. 35. 18. None of the Kings had with such care prepared themselves, the Preists
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104445:322"/>
and people to renew their Covenat with God as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah now did.</q> And as he will not be able to prove that out of the case of persecution, invasion, disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or captivity, and the inevitable necessity flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing from these, there was a warrantable disuse of these holy ordinances, so professors their not separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from that Church even upon a sinfull disuse; will never come home to his purpose, as is already oft clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 5. He adds, <hi>that upon this ground we would separat from all other Churches, and from our own Church before</hi> the year 1645. And then he would please us again by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, <hi>that he could wish all sermons were as Lectures, the chief points of a long text being propounded, which would be more edifying, then when they rack thè text and their brains</hi> (a native and kindly character of his party, and their preaching) <hi>to seek matter from their text to hold out the time.</hi> But we have oft told him that its not <hi>this defect only,</hi> or without the circumstances of our <hi>present case,</hi> that we plead as a ground of disowning them. And if he account the Lecture-method of preaching the <hi>more edifying,</hi> with what conscience have they depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Gods people of this exercise &amp; method of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon my Lord Bishops orders? It seems his <hi>ipse dixit</hi> is the <hi>first rule of edification</hi> with our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former</hi> and his fellows, a principle well suited to lawless and Lordly prelacy, which must have all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances mancipated to its arbitrary commands. So that our <hi>Informer</hi> giving the supreme Magistrat a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power over Church-Government, and solemn sacred Oaths and vows, in the preceeding Dialogue, and the Bishops a dominion over Worship in this, puts pityful fetters upon Christs glorious bride; and as in this point and most of his reasonings, in begging the question, he but skirmishes with his own sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, so in thus wounding our Church, by his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous laxe principles in his pretended healing, but

We shall next discover, some more of his errors, which, are the issues of the former, &amp; of the wicked designe for promoting wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they are presented. The first that offers it self to be considered, is in the point of <hi>Scandal.</hi> From which we argue against the owning of Confor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:104445:323"/>
His Doubter in the next place offers to him an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against hearing Conformists, [taken from <hi>the offence and stumbling</hi> of many godly, flowing from this practice of hearing them, since they look upon it as a sin; and tells him <hi>that the Apostle sayes we must not give offence nor lay a stumbling block before others.]</hi> We have already proposed, and some way improven this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the <hi>scandal of the weak</hi> in this case. To this he first answers, <q>that when we are forbidden to give offence, Its meant of not doing that which is of itself sinfull, whereby we grieve the godly, and lay a stumbling block in the way of others by our evill example; but when we do our duty in obeying God, we cannot give offence to any, and if they take offence Its their own sin and weaknes, but none is given. As here (he sayes) its their weaknes to offend at maintaining unity and peace, that this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives a good example, and to ly by from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conformists for fear of offence of the weak, is to omit duty and harden them in sin.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> offering this reply from the sense of that scripture generally hinted by his Doubter, seems at first view to restrict the command of not giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to <hi>that which is in it self sinfull,</hi> wherin it might easily be made appear that he contradicts sound Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, scripture and himself. Especially the passage to which the Doubter referrs being of a far other sense and scope. But lest this censure should appear too Critical, and upon consideration of his second answer, I shall not medle with what he sayes here in <hi>thesi,</hi> or this assertion in it self considered. But to the assumption &amp; application of this passage in his answer, I return to him this in short, that he doth but here still beg the question in supposing that the owning of Curats is in this our case a duty and <hi>a maintaining of peace and order in the Church,</hi> wherof we have made the contrary appear:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104445:323"/>
and that maintaining the true union and peace of this Church, is to owne her true and faithfull Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, contending for her reformation, true order, and union against their course of defection: and so this practice is both sinfull in it self and scandalous to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>His 2d Answer to this premised argument of his Doubter is, <q>That the Apostle ordinarly when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to give offence; speaks of the use of liberty in things indifferent, that it must not be used to the offence of the weak brother, lest contrary to his conscience he be emboldned to sin, 1 Cor. 8. 10. Or be grieved because he thinks we sin in doing what we should not, Rom. 14. 15.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We shall not much stand upon this, only we here see that the lawfulness of a thing in it self, will not (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him) Justify it in that case wherein, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the weak is emboldned to sin, grieved, or made more weak and his plerophory hindred.</p>
               <p>And that the sincere enquirer for Truth may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this sound persuasion, and guarded against what he after subjoyns, I shall here offer unto him the sense and Judgment of an eminent Father, and Reformed divine upon this point. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> upon Rom. 14. Homily 25. Expones all the Apostles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to the same scope, of the unlawfullness of offending the weak in things indifferent. Particularly upon verse 13. <hi>Si non salvare fratrem</hi> (saith he) <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam habet, id quod &amp; Evangelici talenti de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sed inquies quod si suopte vitio scandalizatur infirmus? propter hoc ipsum ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum fuerit, ut illum feras, Nam si fortis esset, tali cura opus non haberet, nunc vero quia imbacillior est multa etiam curandi diligentia opus habet,</hi> that is, if it be faulty not <q>to save our brother, as the hider of the talent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104445:324"/>
it evident: What will not even the giving of Scandal do. But you will say, what if the weake be scandalized by his own fault? Upon the same very ground it is just that you beare with him. For if he were strong then he would have no need, of such care, but because he is weak he stands in need of much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for his cure. In the next homily, he hath many things upon the rest of the Apostles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the same purpose.</q> Upon the 14. ver. I <hi>know nothing is unclean of it self.</hi> He offers an objection to the Apostle for clearing the words. <hi>Quid igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur non corrigis fratrem, ne putet aliquid immundum esse? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

concerns his servants; another way, because they wound his body and members, Thirdly, in that the work which he accomplisht by his own death, they destroy by their own ambition.</q> Upon the last verse of the chapter, <q>If eating of flesh make my brother offend I will eat none while the World stands.</q> He saith, <hi>Hoc Magistri optimi est officium, suo exemplo erudire quae dicit,</hi> Et <hi>non dicit sive juste, sive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juste: sed quomodocunque.

And he saith not I will not eat whether justly or injustly: But whatever way I will not. As also he saith not that he will not eat of the Idolothytwhich is forbidden for another cause. But if that which is lawful and permitted give scandal, even from these things I will abstain, and not for a day or two, but during my whole life. For he saith I will not eat flesh while the world stands. And he saith not lest I should destroy my brother: But simply lest I should offend him.</q> And a little afterward having shown, that what the Apostle speaks belongs unto us. he saith, <hi>dicere enim quid mihi curandum est, si ille scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizatur, &amp; ille perit? Crudelitatis illius atque inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis est: Atque tunc quidem ex eorum, qui scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabantur, infirmitate id contingebat. In nobis autem non itidem; Talia namque peccata committimus, quae etiam fortes scandalizant: Nam cum percutimus, cum rapimus cum trahimur cupiditate, &amp; tanquam servis liberis abuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, nonne haec sufficientiasune ad scandalizandum?

For when we strike, and offer violence to them, and are drawn by our own lusts, and abuse free men as if they were slaves, are not these sufficient to scandalize them? Say not to me, this man is a Shoemaker, the other a Tanner, the other a statuemaker, but consider that he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and a Brother. For we are the Disciples of those fishers, Publicans, and tentmakers. For Christ was educat in a tradsmans house, &amp; disdained not that his mother was betrothed to a tradsman, and himself lay in a manger for his cradle, neither found he where to lay his head: Was wearyed with his journey, and received maintainance from others.</q> In which passages, it is evident that Chrysostome upon the great moral and Apostolick grounds, of the weak their interest in Christ, his tenderness of them, his dying for them, their spiritual hazard while their conscience is wounded, their liberty in Christ, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and uncharitableness of offending them, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the hainusness of, &amp; vehemently inveighes against this sin, and clearly asserts with the Apostle, that the lawfulness of the practice in it self, affords not the least warrand for doing of that out of which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104445:327"/>
seth, or whereby the weak brother it made more weak.</p>
               <p>Next, I shall offer the sense of an eminent <hi>Reformed divine</hi> upon this point. <hi>Pareus</hi> upon this chapter doth fully confirme our principles on this head. Let the <hi>Informer</hi> read his analysis of the chapter, where he will find him digest the Apostles reasons and arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the giving offence in matters lawful, and learnd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosecutes them in his exposition, which he will find to be such as do cut the sinnews of the new and dangerous principles in this point, which the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick formalists do maintain, citing Chrys. in some of the passages mentioned. Which purpose he also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes in his commentary upon Rom. 14. and 15. Chap. Upon the 7. verse anent <hi>the pollution of the weak conscience,</hi> he sayes <hi>that this pollution is not so much to be imputed to themselves, as unto those that did induce them to eat by their ill example.</hi> Upon the 9. verse he shews that <hi>the lawfulness of their practise excuseth not abuse in this case,</hi> calling scandal, <hi>dictum vel factum quo alius deterior redditur,</hi> citing Rom. 14. 21. Upon the 10 vers. he shews that the danger and guilt there pointed at, is <hi>the inducing of the weak to imitat the practice with a fluctuating conscience.</hi> Upon the 11. He shews that the Apostle puts together aggreging circumstances of this sin of giving offence in things lawful viz. <hi>that we ought to edify and not destroy by our knowledge,</hi> next that <hi>the person scandalized is our brother.</hi> 3. <hi>An infirm brother, whom to wrong must be extreme malice,</hi> 4. Which is the greatest of all, <hi>that Christ hath dyed for the infirm brother.</hi> The same he resumes upon the 12, vers. and explains the sense of Chrysost. and Beza as to the wounding of the weak conscience. Upon the Apostles conclusion vers. 13. He shewes that he expresseth <hi>a resolution of the same nature and extent with that Rom.</hi> 14, 21. viz. <hi>not to do that whereby our brother stumbles, or is offended or</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:104445:327"/>
                  <hi>is made weak.</hi> Adding, <hi>idem vult intelligi de toto genere rerum mediarum &amp; licitarum, potius in his se libertate sua cessurum, quam ut fratrem offendat. Sic the sin tacite ingerit quae est presentis loci doctrina praecipua: In casu scan dali etiam a rebus licitis abstinendum esse: Quia tunc sunt illicitae &amp; peccata, per accidens quidem sednostra culpa, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quod facere possumus ac debemus, (N. B.) offensionem infirmorum non cavemus.</hi> That is, <q>the same he will</q> have to be understood of all things lawfull &amp; indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, that in these we ought rather to cede from <q>our liberty then offend our brother. Thus he tacitly enforceth that point which is the chief Doctrine of this place. That in the case of scandal we must abstain from things lawfull, Because then they become sins and unlawfull by accident, yet by our fault when we guard not against the offence of the weak, which we can and ought to do.</q> In the close he sayes, that <hi>the Apostle will have us in things lawfull not simply to eye what is our right, but what charity and edification do require,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let us come to the assumptian and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Informers concession, to the present case and question, are there not many weak brethren who may be embolded to sin, or (may we suppose) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me sinfully if I hear Curats? Suppose the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice were lawfull in it self, what will cure this mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Behold a <hi>Catholicon</hi> presently, <hi>We must know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that if the command of Authority interpose &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the thing Indifferent, then its no more in my liberty</hi> pro tunc. <hi>Because</hi> (forsooth) I <hi>am restricted by Authority, which makes the thing necessary. Ans.</hi> 1. This man charges a great defect upon the Apostle Paul who in all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses upon guarding against offence in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, makes no mention of this new case &amp; knack, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>making the indifferent thing necessary, by the command of Rulers, and exeeming thus the giving of offence from guilt?</hi> But all along he pleads by many arguments in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104445:328"/>
mentioned, that if the thing be <hi>indifferent,</hi> the case of <hi>offence</hi> makes it unlawfull. And all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in these passages, which do press the eshew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of offence are moral and constantly binding (and consequently admit no such restriction as this) such as Christs tenderness of the weak, their redemption purchased by his blood, Christian liberty, the evill of my brothers doubting, whatsoever is not of faith is sin &amp;c. And he moves objections against his doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, such as, I have knowledge; I have faith—And shall I be limited of my liberty, because an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is weak or wilfull &amp;c. Such like objections he moves and answers, but of this exception and restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction anent <hi>a command from Rulers altering the nature of the thing,</hi> and loosing all his arguments in relation to offence, the Apostle mentions nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This puts a blasphemous authority, upon the Magistrat; we know the terrible interminations and threatnings thundered against <hi>giving offence,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the dreadfull tendency thereof, <hi>wo to them by whom offence comes,</hi> Again, <hi>better be cast into the sea then offend one of the little ones—destroy not him,</hi> saith Paul (with thy offensive carriage) <hi>for whom Christ dyed.</hi> Now will the Magistrats command give me sufficient warrand and security in and for a thing indifferent, <hi>to destroy my brother,</hi> and, will it list off Christs <hi>wo</hi> and make it lighter then a feather, which is more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then to be cast into the sea with a milstone tyed about ones neck.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would know if this <hi>Informer</hi> will deny that the Apostolick precepts in relation to offence &amp; scandal, pressed with important and great motives in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Scriptures; are of <hi>ane universal and moral nature,</hi> and do reach and oblige <hi>all that owne the profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> in <hi>their several relations and capacities.</hi> These precepts founded upon the everlasting and constantly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104445:328"/>
binding grounds and motives of union, <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>love to the brethren</hi> (the great gospel command) <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the communion of Saints,</hi> (the very bonds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments compacting and strengthning Christs mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body) none can deny to be of an universal extent, and to be among the grand rules of Christian practice limiting and directing our carriage <hi>in whatever relation</hi> we stand, whether Ministers or people, Masters or servants, Parents or children &amp;c. And the superiour being under the obligation of these great rules (unless we will make God a respecter of persons) it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followes that they do direct and limit him <hi>in the exercise of his power,</hi> so that this being one <hi>Regula Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> as to all the Magistrat Laws; its must absurd to imagine that his counter-practice and Laws can loose himself or others from this divine superiour obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unlesse we will deiesie him and make his Law &amp; practice the soveraign and supreme rule in every point as well as in this. Whence it followes by necessary consequence that the practice which is offensive, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and destructive to our brother, in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent circumstances, and upon the constant unerring scripture grounds &amp; rules, cannot be altered in its present quality and state by mens commands crossing the divine Law, but remains a sinful scandalous practice though a hundred Lawes enjoyn and authorize it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Was not Pauls Apostolick declarator that <hi>evry thing sold in the shambles might be Lawfully eaten,</hi> as powerfull to exeem that action of eating such things from the compass of offence as the <hi>Magistrats Law</hi> and <hi>authority?</hi> Sure he had at least as much, if not more authority in this point, then the Magistrat, especially as this <hi>Informer</hi> expones <hi>authority</hi> afterward from Acts 15. 28. yet that same practice, Lawfull in it self, and by the Apostle declared to be so, and accordingly enjoyned and authorized by him, must not be used in

this case of the offence, even of the weak and ignorant, but the Apostle himself, though thus declaring and, (may I say) authoring the lawness of the practice, declares he will never use nor take it up in this case of offence. I beseech him, was not the warrantabliness of this practice in it self by the Lords word, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things to be clean to the clean, and Pauls A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick declarator in this place, as valide to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, of indifferent, necessary to the users, as the command of our civil Rulers in relation to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice under debate, and a litle more, he having the mind of Christ, and being a Master builder of the Churches. Yet the offending of the weak, ignorant yea or wilfull, will in his Judgement cut short this liberty, and render the practice sinfull upon that ground. But moreover the instance of the brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will here bite and sting his cause and argument to death; for it was an eminent type of Christ, and reserved (and sure our <hi>Informer</hi> will say warrantably) as a signal monument of that rare typical cure of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stung by the fierie serpents in the wilderness, yet when the people were stumbled, and it became an occasion of their sinning and committing Idolatry, good Hezekiah brake it, called it <hi>Nehushtan,</hi> and is commended for it by the Spirit of God. Now in this mans principles the interposing of authority for its preservation was sufficient to keep it from being destroyed, though all Israel should have been never so much stumbled, and ensnared to Idolatry by it, but the keeping of this monument God would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with in this weighty case. Sure that which rendred the preservation of it highly provoking, and Hezekiahs breaking of it commendable, was its stumbling and ensnaring tendency and effects, whatever authority and acts might have interposed formerly for its preservation. Will the <hi>Informer</hi> say
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104445:329"/>
that Gideons ephod (which in his intention was only designd for a monument of that victory over the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites) was lawfully preserved when it became thus ensnaring as the brazen Serpent, or that the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was lawfully authorized in this case? surely he will not for shame assert this, and so the case is here; and he may see in these instances (if his eye be single) that a practice though in it self lawfull or indifferent, yet, when become offensive in its present circumstance and inductive to sin, cannot in that case be rendred warrantable by any Laws of the Magistrat.</p>

Cor. 8. Rom. 14.

Can the Magistrat by his Law embolden a mans conscience to sin, and yet neither the Magistrat sin himself, nor the man sin in obeying him? Amesius a better Casuist then he will tell him <hi>(de Consc. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Quest.</hi> 6. <hi>R.</hi> 6.) that <hi>nulla authoritas humana, vel tollere potest scandali rationem, ab eo quod alias esset scandalum, vel peccati rationem a scandalo dato.</hi> That is, <q>no humane authority can take away the nature of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal from that which otherwise were a scandal, or the nature and cause of sin from scandal given.</q> And his ground is very considerable, which doth confirme what <hi>I</hi> have now said. <hi>Nullus enim homo</hi> (saith he) <hi>potest vel charitati &amp; conscientiis nostris imperare. vel peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum scandali dati praestare.</hi> That is, <q>for no man can put imperious commands either upon charity or our consciences, or exeem from the hazard of scandal given.</q>

               <p>But now to fortify this raw &amp; ignorant assertion as to scandal, our <hi>Informer</hi> brings Act. 15. 28.<hi>—these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things—</hi>from which words of the councils sentence, he drawes ane argument thus, that <hi>though of themselves they were not necessary, but somtimes indifferent, yet by the Authority of the council they were made necessary for the good of the Church, so</hi> [he sayes] <hi>obedience to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity preponderats the not giving offence, as the greater duty of the two, as divines and Casuists shew, and in this case the man who thus obeyes gives no offence, but doth duty, and if any take it, its causeless on his part, and occasioned through the brothers weakness, so that its</hi> scandalum acceptum non datum, <hi>groundlesly taken but not given, and when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle forbids to use, our liberty to the offence of the weak, he speaks to those who were not determined by Authority.</hi> Ans.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104445:330"/>
What poor ignorant and incoherent reasoning is this, 1. Its a strange sottish, or rather popish Assertion, that the <hi>necessary things</hi> Acts. 15. 28. were made so <hi>by the councils authority:</hi> For the text is most express, that the Apostles enjoyned this upon weighty scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds, and <hi>what seemed good to the holy ghost</hi> (spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the word) as well as to them, so that the holy ghosts grounds and commands touching the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of love, and union in the Church, and the great rule of <hi>edification,</hi> and <hi>not stumbling the weak Iews,</hi> were the great and standing Scripture principles upon which this decree was grounded.</p>
               <p>Now to shew how our <hi>Informer</hi> takes the papists here by the hand in this glosse, let us hear Calvine upon the place<hi>—[praeter haec necessaria] Hujus vocis praetextu su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbe triumphant Papistae, quasi hominibus liceat ferre leges quae necessitatem conscientiis imponant—quia quod deccrnunt Apostoli necessario servandum esse pronuntiant—i. e.</hi> 
                  <q>the Papists triumph proudly upon pretext of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>his this place, as if men might make Laws imposing a necessity upon Consciences because what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles decree, they affirme, must be necessarly kept.—Then he adds, <hi>atqui expedita</hi> &amp;c. But the Answer is easy to such a foolish cavil (so he censures our New Casuist and his fellowes in this point) for this necessity was no longer vigent then there was hazard of dissolving union, so to speak properly it was an accidental or extrinsick necessity, which had place not in the thing it self, but in guarding of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence—which [saith he) is evident in the speedy lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside of this decree. Then he tells us, that when the contention ceased—Paul shewes that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is unclean, and again establishes this liberty Rom. 14: 14. And commands to eat freely what ever is sold.</q> Adding, that the papists in vain do snatch an occasion to bind consciences from this word
<q>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:104445:331"/>
and to conclude the Churches power to statute any thing beside the word of God. Telling us further, that from the word of God the Council drew this ground of exercising charity in matters indifferent. Then (saith he) <hi>in summa,</hi> the summ is, if charity be the bond of perfection, and the end of the Law, if Gods command be that the faithfull study mutual unity and concord, and that every one please his nighbour to edification, none is so rude who may not perceive, that what the Apostles here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is containd in the word of God.</q>—And at the close he tells us, <hi>Apostol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s ex verbi Dei sinibus mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me egredi.—</hi>
                  <q>That the Apostles would not step beyond the limits of the word of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But 2. This mans Babylonish tongue still wounds himself as well as the truth, for 1. he acknowlegeth that what the Apostles here decreed, <hi>was for the Good of the Church;</hi> which (if he understand any thing) he must needs take it according to the grounds laid down in this disquisition, specially that which the Apostle James proposes immediatly before his and the rest of ths Apostlee decision vers. 21. viz. <hi>that Moses had in every city, them that teach him, being read every Sabath day.</hi> So that it was needfull at that time upon the grounds of charity, union, and aedification, to beat with the weak Jews in abstaining from these things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by Gods Law, till the ceremonies were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably buryed. Hence it followes clearly that this abstinence was made <hi>necessary</hi> upon these <hi>weighty grounds</hi> at this time, and not by the authority of the council only. Neither was the matter enjoynd, of a thing indifferent, made necessary, by <hi>their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but upon these grounds, and for the great end of the <hi>Churches good,</hi> which he mentions, this absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence was at <hi>this time,</hi> and <hi>in this case necessary;</hi> And by the Apostles declared to be so upon divine warrand
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104445:331"/>
for what else will he make of that expression. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy ghost.</hi> Again, Paul and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had no power but to <hi>edification,</hi> nor any <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the faith</hi> of Gods people, and so acted nothing here <hi>pro arbitrio</hi> or <hi>imperio.</hi> So that their sentence, was only a declarator of Gods mindeanent that which was antecedaneously to their decree <hi>hic &amp; nnnc</hi> a necessary duty, although we deny not that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles decision was to have its own weight in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Churches obedience. 2. He brings this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to prove <hi>that obedience to authority will preponderat the not giving of offence.</hi> But so it is that the great ground of the Apostles decicision here is <hi>the guarding against the offence of the weak Iews,</hi> and obedience to this sentence was in not giving offence, and upon this very ground Christians were to abstain from these meats, whereas he foolishly distinguishes in this point betwixt obedience to authority, and not giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as distinct duties, and makes the <hi>first</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the <hi>second,</hi> in plain contradiction to the text, which makes <hi>the not giving offence,</hi> to be the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the foundation of this obedience.</p>

bour. And describing <hi>passive scandal,</hi> which is without sin upon the givers part, he sayes that this falls out, <hi>cum factum unius, est alteri occasio peccandi, praeter intentionem facientis, &amp; conditionem facti,</hi> that is <q>when the fact of one is the occasion of anothers sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, beside the intention of the doer, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the deed it self.</q> He draws not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription from <hi>the intention of the doer</hi> only, but from the <hi>condition of the deed it self,</hi> which if tending to the spiritual hurt of our neighbour, is still an active scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and no authority of men can alter its natur or remove its guilt, as we heard him before assert. <hi>Mr Durham</hi> on scandal, part. 1, chap 1. describeth scandal, that is taken only or passive offence, that it is such when no occasion is given, but when a man doeth that which is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>necessary,</hi> exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieing this by the Pharisees carping at Christs actions Matth. 15: 12. and by that of Prov. 4. 19. where the wicked are said to stumble at they know not what. Thus clearly asserting that the lawfulness of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, will not wholly lay the guilt on him that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes offence, unlesse it be also necessary. 4. The <hi>Informer</hi> cannot deny, that this <hi>necessity</hi> of the action, must be evinced from clear <hi>Scripture commands</hi> and cannot be rationally inferred either from the <hi>assertion of the practiser,</hi> or the <hi>commands of the Magistrat</hi> simply, or any supposed <hi>Ecclesiastick canon,</hi> since this would evert the Apostles reasoning on this head. So that he is obleidged to evince the necessity of this practice controverted from other grounds then he hath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or this charge stands good against him, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially since (as we have said) the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction which he mentions as to the free use of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats, was a greater <hi>authoritative determination;</hi> then any which he now alledges to render the practice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104445:333"/>
And if a practice lawful in it self, and corroborated by ane Apostolick precept enjoyning it, could not be lawful in the case of offence, farre lesse can the constitutions he mentions make this practice lawful in such a case. So that our Argument, <hi>a Scandalo,</hi> stands good against him upon this point, in answer to which he hath brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is contrary to Scripture, casuists, yea and himself.</p>
               <p>The charge which he after exhibites against us, <hi>of erecting separat meetings in the houses and fields—and of our being Schismaticks if ever the Christian Church had any,</hi> we let pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest of this mans petulant assertions, the grounds whereof we have examined and confuted. The people of God in obedience to Christs faithfull Ambassadours (by Prelats perjurious violence thrust from their watchtowers) assembling to hear the great Shepherds voice, erect no <hi>seperat meetings,</hi> but keep the assemblies of <hi>this Church</hi> driven by them to a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereof (if the Lord open not his and the rest of his tribe their eyes) they will bear the sin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for ever.</p>
               <p>The Doubter object next, [Christs preaching in privat houses and fields, and peoples hearing therein, inferring that so likewise may we.] This argument our <hi>Informer</hi> (according to his usual candor) disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we say not that in a setled peaceable state of the Church, Ministers may preach and people hear in this manner, but upon supposal of this Churches <hi>disturbed persecute condition</hi> by a party of prevailing backsliders, Ministers preaching and peoples hearing, is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table upon the formentioned grounds; both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters (upon whom our Prelats hands have been very heavy of a long time, yea (I may say) their litle finger thicker then their predecessours loins,)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104445:334"/>
sters and people being in this broken destroyd state of our Church chased, harassed, and denyed all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary places appointed for divine worship, nay scarce any place of residence in their native land free from the <hi>fulmina</hi> &amp; thunderbolts of Prelats mad rage. But what sayes he to this argument, he tells us 1. <hi>That tho Christ preached thus, yet it was not to separat from the Iewish Church, nor did he disowne the hearing of their teachers, but allowed to hear Scribes and Pharisees with a (proviso) to beware of their leaven—that he sent those who were miraculously heald to the Priests, and did not bid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne them.</hi> Ans. 1. Whatever be concluded as to Christs disowning, or seperating the people from the teachers of the Church of the Jews at that time (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Informer</hi> hath offered nothing which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a demonstration of what he affirmes, and his assertion tho granted will not fortify the conclusion he aimes at) yet this is certain and undenyable, (and in so far his Doubters parallel argument stands inviolable against him) viz. that our blessed Lord preacht after this manner which he condemns. Since he condemns <hi>in universum</hi> &amp; simply Presbyterian Ministers preaching, and peoples hearing them in this manner, abstracting from the disowning of Curats and their Ministry, so that this answer meets not the objection as levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his principles. And he cannot deny but that in so far as Christ and his Apostles were owned, their ordinary Jewish teachers were separat from and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, but he condemns all owning of Presbyterian Ministers, and withdrawing from Curats, as ingraind Schism and sinfull separation. This answer is the more forcible, if it be considered that our Lord had liberty of their Synagogues to preach in, yet he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently left them, and preacht in privat houses and in the fields, and therefore Presbyterian Ministers may use this liberty, whom (in a peice of cruelty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

that of the Scribes and Pharisees to Christ) they have banish't from pulpits. 2. As for our Lords not putting people to separat from that Church or the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof, we have already shown how far it is from his purpose, and what a wide consequenceit is, from a <hi>non-separation</hi> from the Jewish Church, and teachers tho corrupt, (while that legal dispensation stood, which was shortly to be removed, and the Gospel Ministry erected in its place) and from our Lords tollerance thereof as Gods ancient Ministry, though now corrupt, to which he was to put an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable close, to conclude that a people are to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne a faithfull Gospell Ministry and Church, in complyance with a number of destroying Innovators ejecting them, and razing a sworn Reformation, which all that Church are bound to defend. This is such a palpable inconsequence, as any may upon first view discover it. 3. There was (beside what is said) this reason in special, wherefore our Lord would not have the Jewish Ministry at first universally left, because he came as a Minister of the circumcision to confirm the promises made to the fathers; he was to come to the temple as the Kings Son and Lord of all the Prophets who went before him, the Law being to go forth from Zion, and the word from Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jesus came first to his own. Therefore the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Ministery and teaching, was to stand for a time to make this apparent, and as Christs great witness for his authority, and the Doctrine of the gospel, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their conviction or conversion; hence <hi>he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peald</hi> unto the Scriptures which they heard dayly read, and preacht, <hi>Search the Scriptures for they testify of me.</hi> And when he enjoynd the healed leper to go and shew himself to the Priest, it was to offer the Sacrifice which Moses commanded <hi>for a testimony unto them.</hi> So that to make the substituting of the Gospel to the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104445:335"/>
legal dispensation and ordinances apparent, and its Ministry to the Jewish Ministry and Priesthood, to which Christs death and resurrection only was to put a final period, it was necessary it should be own'd in some measure. And Christ could not wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne it without stopping a great part of his mediatory fulfilling of all righteousness, for he was as head of the circumcised people, and as of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, to obey the Judicial and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and therefore he duely attended the passover and all the solemn feasts, which could not subsist in their exercise, without the standing of that old Ministry; Now how far this is from our Question, and inferring the owning of Curats in our case, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the meanest capacity. What he sayes of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scribes and Pharisees, is already answered. But now this <hi>Informer</hi> will offer some special reasons of Christs-preaching after this manner, to cut short our argument here; the first is, <hi>Because he was to bring in the Doctrine of the gospel, and preach himself the true Mes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ah, which was needfull to be done, and because of the opposition of his doctrine by the Jewish teachers. Ans.</hi> 1. Altho he was to bring in the doctrine of the Gospel into the world, yet as he was sent first and immediatly to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and to exercise his Ministry toward them mainly (upon which ground at his first sending forth the Disciples, he commanded them to go to these lost sheep, not in the way of the gentiles) so he had the synagogues and Temple to preach in, and frequently did so; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing went to the fields with great multitudes, and to other places then these appointed for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and publick Worship; and therefore Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Ministers may do the like, who are denyed our Conformists Synagogues or ordinary places of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they being upon important grounds obliged
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104445:336"/>
(as our blessed Lord was) to officiat and bestirre themselves in the exercise of their Ministry. And therefore. 2. Since he reasons from the <hi>necessity of the Work</hi> which Christ was about, and the <hi>opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he met with therein from his enemies,</hi> these samegrounds pleads strongly for Presbyterian Ministers officiating in the manner contraverted, because the preaching of the gospel by Christs faithfull Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, was never <hi>more necessary,</hi> and never met with <hi>greater opposition</hi> from its enemies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon <hi>his own grounds</hi> it followes, that Ministers ought to embrace all occasions of preaching and in any place where they can have accesse. Sure he dare not restrict the <hi>necessity of the work,</hi> and the <hi>persecution,</hi> from which he infers the Lawfulness of preaching after that manner, to that <hi>particular necessity</hi> and persecution at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the first planting of the gospel, or affirm that these grounds may never again recur for legitimating of this practice, since thus he would condemn ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> first Reformers.</p>
               <p>Come we to the 2d Reason which is this, <hi>Christ was head of his whole Church, and was not to be limit in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his. Ministry as ordinary teachers, but might preach where and when he pleased, since all belonged to his Ministry, and that none will say that he is pastor of the whole Church, but the Pope, nor can any meer Man do what Christ did in every thing. But our meetings</hi> (he sayes) <hi>are in despite of the Law, and we add disobedience to our schism. Ans.</hi> 1. We shall easily acknowledge that all Christs actions are not imitable, such as those of <hi>divine power,</hi> as working of Miracles, and the actions of <hi>divine prerogative,</hi> as the taking of the ass without the owners liberty, the actings of his special <hi>Mediatory prerogative,</hi> such as the enditing of the scriptures, giving of his spirit, laying down his life, instituting Church officers, Col. 3. 16. Joh. 10. 15. Mat. 28. 18, 19. These are not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104445:336"/>
nor yet such actions as were meerly <hi>occasional,</hi> depending upon circumstances of time and place, as the unleavened bread, the time, and such like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his supper. But we say there are actions imitable, as 1. in general Christs exercise of graces, which have constant and moral grounds, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Christians for their imitation, every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians life (as such) ought to be an imitation of him the precious mirrour of grace, Mat. 11. 29. Learn of me for I am meek. &amp;c. Eph. 5. 2. Walk in love as Christ also hath loved us. Joh. 13. 15. I have given you an example that ye should doe as I have done. The christian must walk as he walked. 1. Joh. 2. 6. 2. In particular, Actions on Moral grounds, flowing from <hi>the relations</hi> wherein Christ stood, do oblige, and are examplary unto, <hi>those that are under such relations,</hi> viz. Christs subjection and obedience to his parents, and paying tribute to cesar, do exemplify children and subjects their duty as in that capacity; so his <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial acts</hi> and faithfull diligence therein, do exemplify Ministers duty. Now the question is, as to this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Christs preaching in this case, that is, not in the ordinary and authorized assemblies of that Church but in the fields, and in houses, <hi>whether the grounds of it will not sometimes recur, and oblige ordinary Ministers?</hi> for its <hi>ratio exempli</hi> we are to look unto, rather then the meer circumstances of the Individual act, as Chamier tells us, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 17. <hi>de Jejunijs.</hi> And for evincing this in our case our <hi>Informers</hi> own answer is sufficient, if we shall but suppose (which neither our <hi>Informer</hi> nor any of his fellows have ever been able to disprove) that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers are under a relation to this Church as her true Pastors, and under the obligation of our Lords commands to officiat accordingly. His grounds are <hi>the necessity of the work and the bitter persecution of</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:104445:337"/>
                  <hi>Christs enemies;</hi> both which grounds are still vigent in relation to Presbyterian Ministers as is said.</p>
               <p>For what he adds <hi>of Christs acting this as head of his Church, and not limit in the exercise of his Ministry, as ordinary Ministers, none of which is an universal postor.</hi> It is very insignificant here. For 1. every piece of Christs Ministry, his very teaching, and teaching in the temple, was as messenger of the Covenant, who was to come unto that temple, and in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of head of his Church, yet are examplary for Ministers duties according to their measure. 2. He dare not say, that our Lords preaching after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner instanced in the objection of his Doubter, or his preaching while fleeing from persecutors, was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded upon this ground, and did flow from no other cause and principle but this viz. that he was not limited in the way and exercise of his Ministry, for he hath already assigned other Reasons of this, viz. <hi>the necessity of the work, and his persecution</hi> simply conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, so that if he should assert this, his 2. answer would contradict his first: and besides, he will not deny, but that such as were not heads of the Church, and who were in an ordinary peacefull state thereof, limited in the exercise of their Ministry, did preach after this manner, for the officers of the Church of Jerusalem Acts. 8. in that scattering and persecution, went every where preaching the gospel. So did our first Reformers (not to stand upon that moral precept given to the Apostles, who were not heads of the Church, viz. when they persecut you in one city flee to another) and the <hi>Informer</hi> will not say that they were not to carry the gospel-message with them in this flight Now that which those who were not heads of the Church, but Ministers, yea and ordinary Ministers have done the parallel of and warrantably, surely that Christ did not upon any extraordinary ground now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104445:337"/>
But such is this way of preaching, Ergo &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In a word as its easily granted that ordinary Ministers are fixt and limit to their charges in a setled state of the Church, so he dare not deny, that a Churches distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed persecute condition will warrand their unfixt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating upon the grounds already given; and he should know that others then the <hi>Pope</hi> were <hi>universal pastours,</hi> and even in <hi>actu exercito,</hi> of the whole Church, viz. the Apostles as himself acknowledged, nor can he deny that ordinary Ministers are in <hi>actu promo</hi> related to the whole Church, as her Ministers given to her by Christ, and <hi>set in her.</hi> As for what he adds of our meetings, <hi>that they are against the Law,</hi> he knowes that all the Jews appointed that any who owned Christ, should be excommunicat. From the violence and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Law, himself infers our Lords, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating in the manner contraverted, and he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily make the application to our case, and answer himself.</p>
               <p>The Doubter thinks it hard [to be hindred by the Law from hearing the word of God and other parts of worship, or that Ministers be hindered to preach, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ans.</hi> 1. Granting that the Law did allow some to preach faithfully what saith this for their robbing so many thousands of the Lords people, of the Ministry of some hundreds of faithfull Ministers? will a piece of the Rulers duty in one point excuse their sin in twenty others, and loose the people from their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to duty towards Christs Ambassadours? This is new divinity. 2. The law allowes none to preach (in the manner he pleads for) but with a blot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104445:338"/>
in taking on the <hi>Prelats mark,</hi> and complying with a perjurious course of defection, and allowes none to deliver their message faithfully in relation to either the sins or duties of the time, which is far from allowing to preach in purity, and in this case we must rather adhere to Christs faithfull shepherds upon his command, tho cross to mens Law, then follow blind unfaithfull guides in obedience thereunto, and this upon that same ground of Acts 4. 19. which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But he sayes, <hi>that answer of the Apostles will no way quadrat with our case,</hi> why so? 1. <hi>Because the Apostles had an immediat extraordinary call from Christ to preach in his name, and so were not to be discharged by any power on earth. Ans.</hi> 1. That the Apostles answer suites our case, will be apparent when its considered, that our answer and Apology which we offer to our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, who do now accuse and persecute us upon this ground, is one with theirs, their grounds in their answer, compared with the context, are [that they are Christs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and witnesses, employed about the great gospel message, cloathed with his authority, and under the obligation of Christs commands lying upon them.] Now will not this quadrat with our case as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this answer, dare he say, that the Magistrats Laws can exauctorat a Minister of the gospel, or take away that ministerial authority which he received from Christ, might not thus the ministry be put out of the world; Dare he deny that he is a minister still notwithstanding of the Laws restraint, and standing under a ministerial Relation to the Church, as the Apostles were, and under commands and obligations consequently in order to the exercise of the ministry? can the Rulers meer <hi>prohibition</hi> loose either ministers their relation pastoral, or the obligations flowing therefrom?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:104445:338"/>
2. Altho the call of the Apostles was immediat and extraordinary, yet this will not prove that their ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer will not suite the ordinary and mediat call in such a case as theirs, when a minister is under a legal prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to preach: for first, we do not find that the Apostles did plead their <hi>extraordinary</hi> or <hi>immediat call</hi> mainly or only, if at all in this case, but their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial gospel call and message <hi>quatalis,</hi> the authority of the one, and the weight and importance of the other, in relation to all Ministers, are constant moral grounds bearing the conclusion of the same duty and apology as to them: since the substance of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick apology lyes in this, that they were Christs Ministers, cloathed with his commission to preach the gospel, which any faithfull Minister may plead in such a case. 2. Tho their call was immediat and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, upon which ground they were singularly out of the reach of the Rulers restraint as to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, yet they were so likewise as Christs messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ministers simply in a general sense, for <hi>majus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> minus</hi> &amp;c. 3. As the Apostles had their power immediatly from Christ and not from the Rulers, which is the great ground why they could not be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prohibit to preach, and would not submit their ministerial authority, its acts and exercise, to the Rulers disposal, especially the gospel-message being of so great importance, so there is derived from them a ministerial authority in the Church, independent in its nature and exercise upon the magistrat, as theirs was, tho the Apostles (as I said) had singular prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives beyond ordinary ministers, and in that respect were singularly beyond the reach of their restaint. Now this authority was exercised by the Church <hi>renitente Magistratu</hi> for several generations, upon the same ground of <hi>this independent spiritual power</hi> and the weight
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104445:339"/>
of the gospel-message which the Apostles did here plead;</p>
               <p>The <hi>Informer</hi> answers aly, <hi>that this prohibition tended to the absolute supressing of the gospel, and there was then no other way for propagating it through the world, but by their preaching, but now tho some be silenced, others are allowed to preach. Ans.</hi> 1. This piece of the apology for not obeying the Rulers mandat, is of his bold putting in, but nothing of it is in the text, viz. <hi>that there were no others to preach the gospel but they.</hi> Their Apology as I said is drawn from their authority, and message sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. 2 I ask him, could any one of the Apostles have submitted to this prohibition, upon an insinuation or assurance that the Magistrat would not hinder others to promote the gospel? if they could not, then he must grant that this anwer is naught, <hi>that the Apostles refused, because the prohibition tended to suppress the gospel:</hi> For the gospel was preacht and propagat, though one of them was a little after taken oft the stage, if he say that any one, or more of the Apostles would have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the prohibition upon thir terms, then. 1. He contradicts his first answer, <hi>that their extraordinary immediat call could not be discharged by any power on earth,</hi> and 2. He charges them with unfaithfulness to Christ in laying up his talents, and laying by his work upon mens command not to preach. Sure Christs command and commission tyed all his Apostles conjunctly and severally: Paul said, <hi>too to [me] if [I] preach not the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and one Apostles diligence, could not loose the obligation of the other, and excuse his negligence. 3. We have proved that there is no warrand from God for Rulers their immediat arbitrary discharging Christs Ambassadours to officiat, and consequently faithfull Ministers are not obliged to obeye. And upon the same ground that one apostle could not warrantably suffer the Magistrat to impose a silence upon him, be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104445:339"/>
cause others were permitted to preach, Its unlawfull for ordinary Ministers to be silent, because others are preaching, and much more when those who are preaching are declaring themselves unfaithfull, and destroying but not feeding. So that our <hi>Informer</hi> doth but mock God, if not blaspheme, while blessing him, <hi>that authority, is opposit to our disorders,</hi> not <hi>to the gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doubter next asks him [if the King and Laws can silence a Minister that he shall not preach the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.] He should have added, by <hi>his own proper eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite acts as King or Magistrat, or formally and immediatly.</hi> But this man must still shrewd himself in the mist and clouds of deceitful generals, and mould our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his own disguise, that his simple evasions may appear answers. Well, what sayes he to this doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His answer is, (I ommit his insignificant reflection) <hi>that Solomon thrust out Abiathar from the priesthood</hi> 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>which was a restraining his priestly power as to its actual exercise, to which he was bound to submit, so a King may discharge a Minister to exercise his Ministry within his dominions, which he must not counteract, suppose he think the King and law wrongs him, especially, when others do preach tho he be silent. Ans.</hi> This reason and instance is <hi>a baculo ad angulum,</hi> Solomon punisht Abiathar ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy for a capital treasonable crime, which deserved death, telling him (as the text saith) that he was a man of death, or one who deserved capital punishment, according to the nature of the hebrew phrase, which sentence of death Solomon (upon the grounds men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in that passage) did change into a sentence of banishment, and by this civil punishment did <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter</hi> put him from the exercise of his priestly office, which he could not in that case perform: Ergo he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and immediatly deposed him, and the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat may so immediatly and formally depose mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104445:340"/>
this is a consequence utterly unknown to all rules of Logick, or solid divinity. The Instance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed proves, that the Magistrat may civilly punish a Minister for crimes, and consequently cut him off from the exercise of his Ministry, but that he can <hi>simply and immediatly, or by proper elicit acts,</hi> discharge the exercise thereof, can no more be proved from this instance, then that the man who gives bad physick, or hurts the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters person, and <hi>eatenus</hi> stops the exercise of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial office, hath an authority to inhibit the exercise of his Ministry.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>Informers</hi> restriction, anent the Kings inhibiting a minister to preach <hi>in his dominions,</hi> 'tis a very poor and transparent sophistical cheat, for no man ever said that he can exercise any magistratical power upon those who are <hi>without his dominions,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministers or others. And thus should his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in Gods providence be streached over all the christian Church, he hath authority (by this court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divinity) to silence the gospel sound in a clap, and extinguish a gospel ministry when he pleaseth, and then this man would do well to ponder how this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists with the nature and designe of Christs great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his first ambassadours (his Apostles) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the gospel message, and unto all ministers untill the end of the world, and his promised presence accordingly; as also whether the Apostles, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ministers afterward, did warrantably counteract the Magistrats opposition in this exercise of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; and what our lords answer would have been, in case such an objection anent <hi>Princes discharging the exercise of their Ministry,</hi> had been offered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles at the first giving out and sealing of their great patent and commission <hi>to preach to all nations,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Lord would have told them that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission did not <hi>bind in that case.</hi> The <hi>Informer</hi> is afraid
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104445:340"/>
to set his foot on such slippery ground as to assert that the King can <hi>depose absolutely,</hi> but yet averres that he can restrain the <hi>actual exercise</hi> of the Ministerial office, and surely if this be granted (in that extent he pleads for) it will abundantly secure self-seeking polititians from the trouble of a faithful Gospel-Ministry, &amp; they will be content to part with this nicety of a simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing. But if, in the Judgment even of some of his Rabbies, whom I could name, the most formal ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall censures do amount to no more then this legal restraint of the exercise, he doth but pityfully resarciat his lapse, and mend the matter by this whimsey.</p>
               <p>As for what he adds of <hi>[Beza's</hi> letter to the non-Conformists in England, not to exercise their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry against the Queens authority and the Bishops.] The often mentioned difference betwixt the then State of that Church, and our present condition, doth quite invalidat his proof, since certainly in some cases the counteracting the Princes command as to the exercise of the Ministry, requires a very cautious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but had our case in its present circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and latitude as above delineat been propounded to Beza [touching the overturning the Reformation of this Church (so fully setled by civil and Ecclesiastick Authority, and confirmed by Oaths of all ranks) by Prelats and their adherents ejecting all faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who will not be subject to that course.] Sure Beza who (as we heard) requested John Knox never to let Prelacy be introduced into Scotland, and all faithfull Ministers to contend against it after it was cast out, would have judged Minsters obliged in this our case, especially after Prelacy is thus vowed against, to keep their possessions, to preach the gospel, and testify against such a wicked course, as well as it was the duty of our first Reformers to preach against the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104445:341"/>
will of the then Bishops and persecuters; Besides, its the Doctrine and principles of our Church, <hi>that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Magistrate nor Prelats censures can loose a Minister from the exercise of his Ministry;</hi> which is above cleared. So that our <hi>Informers</hi> great Diana, which he is all this time declaiming for, viz. The imposing of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute silence upon the true Pastors of this Church, that Conformists onely may be heard and ownd, doth so stoop and bow down, that the underpropings of his slender artifice, and poor mean pleadings, cannot prevent its precipice and ruine.</p>

And that Mr Durham on Rev. page 106, 107. thinks there is odds betwixt being a Minister of the Catholick Church, and a Catholick Minister of it, as the Apostles were and the Pope pretends viz. to have immediat access for the exercise in all places—that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> they are peculiarly delegated to such and such posts, But we have made our selves Ministers of all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the Countrey.</q> I answer, this doctrine cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not our principles nor practice in the least. For first, when we assert that a Minister is by election restricted to be ordinarly the Pastor of a flock, and especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legat, and fixt to such a post &amp; particular watchtower, it is not so to be understood, as if there could be nolaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exercise of his Ministry elsewhere: for first, this were flat independency &amp;c. 2. All (save they of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion) grant that the Minister receives no new <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> as to his Ministerial acts and officiating in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, but a new application only. Hence

in the 2d place, is to be understood of the Church her ordinary settled state under a settled Ministry but when there is a destroying enemy within her bosome wasting her, and the fathfull Ministry are put from their Watchtowers and posts, by a number of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Innovators, who are dissolving her union, and impeaching her Authority: In this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary case, Ministers more enlarged and unfixt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating, is no breach of this Rule; Because 1. In this case the Parochial constitution is impossible to be held, and God calls not to impossibilities, and yet his call to preach the Gospel stands and binds, and by consequence to preach to others then the Ministers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. The common rule will plead for this viz. <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitas non habet legem,</hi> which this <hi>Informer</hi> himself doth hold will in some cases warrand the laying by of that which otherwise were a duty; he knows what his inference is from Davids eating of the shew bread to keep from starving, and Paul, and those with him their casting their goods into the sea to preserve from perishing. So that of necessity he must admit this rule and answer, upon his own ground. 2. The reasons which did warrand our first Reformers offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in this manner (a practice which he dare not say that the authors mentioned, or any reformed divines do condemn) will warrand this our practice in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute state of our Church, it being clear that the case of Reformation is parallel to that of a Churches defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and persecution, in relation to this practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverted, as we cleard from Acts 8. 3. The same great end of the Churches <hi>greater good and edificaton,</hi> which warrands fixing of Ministers to their posts in a Churches setled peacefull state will warrand their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating more largely and at other posts, when put from their own in her disturbed, persecute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed coondition by a prevalent Schismatick, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding

party. The faithfull watchmen seing the city betrayed by a party of professed defendents, who are letting in the enemy, do their duty to the city best in resisting them and running to help. 4. If faithfull Ministers their necessary keeping their posts and the unlawfulness of exercising their Ministry any where else, were in this case asserted, then it would follow that a Minister standing in that relation to a disturbed and destroyed Church, and all his gifts and graces, were <hi>useless in that case,</hi> which notwithstanding are given for <hi>the good of the Church,</hi> but this is absurd; Shall not the weeping Church be taken by the hand by her true Sons, when she is wounded and her vail taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by smiting watchmen. 5. By our Principles the Prelatick party are Schismaticks who have already broke and overturned our Churches order, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Now this <hi>Informer</hi> will not deny, that in such a case, the Church may send forth her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to officiat among such backsliders and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, for their healing and recovery; he knowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground Mr <hi>Lightoun</hi> not long since, sent out some of his brethren to preach in the West of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Beside Mr <hi>Gillespie</hi> will tell him, <hi>Miscell. page</hi> 23. <hi>That a Schismatick Church hath no just right to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a sound Church, as to the calling or setling of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</hi> So that in our principles no Conformists are duely or lawfully called and settled. 6. Our divines do grant that in extraordinary cases, even <hi>the want of ordination it self</hi> will not hinder to officiat Ministerially but that there may be a necessity which will sustain and comport with the want of it. Mr <hi>Gillespy Misc. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>page</hi> 63. tells us, <q>that in extraordinary cases when ordination cannotbe had, and when there are none who have commission &amp; authority from God to ordain, then and there an inward call from God stirr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104445:343"/>
consent whom God makes willing, can make a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster authorized to ministerial acts—That at the first plantation of Churches, ordination may be wanting without making void the Ministry because ordination cannot be had.</q> And if necessity will plead this in relation to ordination it self, <hi>Ergo a fortiori</hi> this necessity of our Churches destroyed perturbed condition, may much more comport with ordained Ministers their more enlarged officiating for the help and recovery of a perishing remnant, by Wolves in sheeps cloathing.</p>
               <p>Next, this <hi>Informer</hi> going on in his nauseating repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, charges <hi>intrusion</hi> upon our Ministers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>what warrand they have to preach and administer Sacraments to those of another Ministers charge, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called nor desired by these Minsters.</hi> I answer, they have Gods call to preach the Gospel as Minsters of this Church, and as this call would warrand their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating in other parishes upon the lawfull Ministers desire or invitation in a settled serene state of our Church, so in this her ruined and destroyed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the same call abundantly warrands their helping of these congregations, and such poor Macedonians, who desire their help while under destroying Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, who have no lawfull call to be their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters from God or this Church.</p>
               <p>But here our <hi>Informer</hi> assaults us with a <hi>dilemma; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Presbyterian Ministers call is ordinary, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Ordinary they have none, since they are not invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ministers of the congregations to whom they preach, extraordinary they will not pretend unto.</hi> I Answer by a <hi>counterdilemma,</hi> and retort his argument thus, either the pretended Ministers of these congregations have an ordinary or extraordinary call to officiat therein, ordinary they have none according to the Doctrine, Reformation, and principles of this Church, being
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104445:343"/>
neither called by the people, nor ordained by the Presbyteries of this Church, if we speak of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality who are ordained and obtruded by the Prelats, upon these congregations where they officiat, and for those who were otherwise ordained and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, we have told him that by accepting presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from Patrons and collation from Prelats, they have renounced their Presbyterian call and ordination and the call of this Church consequently, and thus do fall under the same consideration with the rest; and for the exraordinary call neither the one nor the other, will pretend unto it. And when he answers this <hi>dilemma,</hi> and by the Scripture-rules, and the Principles, and reformation of this Church, (which the <hi>Informer</hi> hath not disproved, yea admits us to suppose in this question) justifies the Curats call to of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iciat in these congregations over which they assume an authority we shall produce ours as to this practice which he condemns. Beside, what answer will he give to such a <hi>dilemma</hi> in the mouth of Schismatick congregations, offered unto such Ministers as the Church sends from their own congregations to officiat among them? And whatever his answer be, it will suite our case. Then he tells us <hi>of acts of councils condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this encroachment,</hi> as he calls it, But when he shall exhibit a case parallel to ours, which these acts speak unto, we shall consider it. For what he adds of the <q>Aberdeen Doctors their charging the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ministers who preacht in their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with a practice repugnant to the Scripture</q> and Canons of ancient Councils, he should have done well to have produced these Scriptures which the Doctors alleaged: And for ancient Canons, I think all things in their case considered, it would be a hard task to produce these Canons stricking against that practice as it stood circumstantiat, considering their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104445:344"/>
Schismatick withstanding the Reformation of this Church, their Arminian principles, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding popish ceremonies which errors they had openly vented and obstinatly maintaind.</p>
               <p>His next charge <hi>of ordaining others to perpetuat our schism,</hi> is a manifest calumny, this true organick Church is by this practice, only propagating a lawfull pure Ministry in opposition to their destroying Schismatick course, the blessed fruits whereof, and its seals upon the hearts of the people of God, have been conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and we hope yet further will. And no less gross is that calumny which follows, <hi>anent our great mixt communions, and admission of ignorant vitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unto them, who</hi> (he sayes) <hi>by our way cannot be kept back,</hi> there being none admitted at any seasons of this nature (which have been very rare) but upon suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient testimonies from faithfull Ministers or elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships. But is he not ashamed to object this to us, whereof his party is so notoriously guilty, who are knowen to admit, yea call promiscuously, to fill their empty tables, (which tender souls dare not approach unto) both gross ignorants, and notoriously profane to the shame and scandal of Religion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that holy ordinance; our persuading people not to owne Conformists as the Ministers of this Church we hope doth now appear better grounded then all this <hi>Informers</hi> persuasives to the contrary. And that we have been in any measure succesfull in this, speaks out Gods purpose not to leave wholly our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried land.</p>
               <p>For that which he cites out of <hi>Baxters</hi> preface to the <hi>Cure of Church divisions</hi> anent <hi>the odiousness of Sacrifices presented to God, without love and reconciliation to breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and of making a peoples communion in worship, the badge and means of uncharitablness and divisions,</hi> we th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

worship, but an association with scandalous Schismaticks and backsliders in their wickedness, we think is no less dangerous and obstructive to reall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with God in duty; especially since God pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses our coming out from among such, and our being separat from the contagion of their sin, with this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>that he will receive us.</hi> And as there is a <hi>holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi> which we must associat with in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, so there is a <hi>congregation of evill doers</hi> which we must hate. Yea we have Davids pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency (as is before observed) to hate them with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred, and count them our enemies. But who can sufficiently admire these mens talk of <hi>unity and love</hi> who having first broken and divided this poor Church have been these so many years persecuting to the death, yea sweeming in the blood of the faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and professors therof because hey durst not joyn to their way, and conform to their supposed trifles and indifferencies.

               <p>But now his poor half proselyted Doubter confesses that [there is much truth in what he has heard from this sound <hi>Informer forsooth—</hi>And takes leave with a profest resolution to reflect upon what he has heard from him,] Whereupon he dismisses him with some of his healing advices, prefacing with an admonition to seek <hi>illumination from God.</hi> But had this man been serious in seeking this from God, he had not vented in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104445:345"/>
these trilling Dialogues such weak notions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches against Gods truth and people. But since his Doubter returns him no answer therunto, I shall make up his want and shortly offer my thoughts upon them. His first advice, is <hi>not to be too confident of our own opinion as undoubtedly right, but consider what he hath said in his three conferences. Ans.</hi> If it be truth which we hold, sure we most hold it <hi>by faith in a pure conscience,</hi> and not be <hi>wavering and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ossed children.</hi> We acknowledge not the Cartesian principle, and the popish doubting way as found divinity, and a confidence of truth is far from a <hi>self confidence.</hi> As for what is offered in his three dialogues, I hope it is sufficiently antidoted by what is said above, so that it needs not in the least demurr our persuasion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He will not have us think the matters of difference to be the substantialls of Relegion, since persons of both persuasions may keep love and fellowship without renting the Church and neglecting ordinances, because greater differences have been; and communion not broken thereby. Ans.</hi> If these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contraverted be not substantialls, why then have they made such a substantiall bloody contest for them <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>anquam pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> for so many years, and if communion must not be broken in a Church upon this account, why have they rent and overturned our Church, and persecute away so many godly Ministers and professors for these things, denying all fellowship with them in their worship, for adhering to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and disowning this course of conformity? had prelatists suffered Presbyterian Ministers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors to stand as they were in this Church, to enjoy their principles, and to follow their respective duties according to their stations, faithfull Ministers to preach, and Gods people to enjoy the fruits of their Ministry, he might with some colour have pretended to this desire of union and fellowship, but since pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104445:345"/>
have cast them out, and do so cruelly persecute them for adhering to their principles, and owning these duties, this pretence is nothing but deceitfull hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy. He adds, <hi>that the difference is but a matter of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and if we separat for this, we would have separat from all Churches since christianity began and if Christ held no comunion with a Church, where prelacy was, he hath then seldom had a Church, and hath been for many years a head without members. Ans.</hi> This is nothing but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed repetition of groundless assertions: for how proves he that our plea is a <hi>matter of government only?</hi> surely their course strikes at the whole of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as hath been cleared. Again, how proves he that we would have separat upon this ground from the Church for so long a time, tho it were granted that our plea were only a matter of government, since he hath not yet produced instances of such a prelacy as we have, in any Church. Besides, since the <hi>Informer</hi> pleads for prelacy upon pretended Apostolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and practices, and yet doth here vilify it unto a meer punctilio, and makes it such a sorry business as persons may come and go upon it at their pleasure, we may easily discover what nimble Sophisters, and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery fingered Gentlemen he and his fellows are as to the retaining and holding of divine institutions, and that they can easily expose them to sale, for obtaining easefull serenity and other worldly designs. Or how proves he that its the <hi>government of our Church</hi> which they have introduced? or that they are <hi>the Church?</hi> or that we are in this practice <hi>separating from our Church?</hi> Hath not Christ a mystical body in Scotland without prelats? or finally, how proves he that there is alike ground for Joyning to prelacy, introduced by an Apostat party, after it is cast out, and abjured by all, as there is for Joyning in fellowship with a Church continuing Long under that corruption, and not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104445:346"/>
and reformed from it. The Joyning with them in their worship, being demanded as a badge of our consent to prelacy it self and all the corruptions atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same.</p>

Ans.</hi> This charge lyes most directly home to himself, and those of his way. Let more then 20. years Law &amp; practice, in relation to the ruine of a faithfull remnant of Ministers and professors who adhere to the reformation and government of this Church, and their vows for promoting the same, discover what hath been the charity of our Prelatical party. Beside, whatever be our thoughts as to their state with God, and without judging their eternal condition, its no breach of charity to know such as are seducers from Gods way, to beware of sin, and the ensnarings of such seducers, for which we have so many scripture commands as we have heard, and the Judgment of discretion in relation to evils which we are to eshew, is not that uncharitable judging in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Lawfull and Indifferent, which is condemned, Rom. 14. 3, 4. for else we could not act in faith.

Divisions indeed among Gods people are sad, and have had sad effects, but union must be in <hi>truth and duty,</hi> and cemented with these bonds, since it is the <hi>unity of the spirit</hi> which we must seek Eph. 4. 3. and therefore not in a way of defection and Rebellion against God and in breaking his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is nothing else but a combination against him; It is in <hi>the Lord,</hi> that we must be of the <hi>same mind,</hi> Phil. 4 2. and Christ who prayed so enixly, for his disciples union, Joh. 17. 21. prayed also for their <hi>sanctification in and by the truth,</hi> 17. ver. and that they might be <hi>kept from the evill of the world,</hi> 15. ver. And the Apostle Paul who is so great a pleader for Love and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>would not give place by subjection</hi> to deceitfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>no not for an hour</hi> Gal. 2. 5. The best way to mantain union &amp; preserve the Gospel (which their dividing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating course of backsliding hath exposed to so much prevalency and reproach of Papists) is to keep our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments free of their defilements, &amp; to put away that <hi>accur sed thing</hi> which hath made us so weak before enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He advises his Doubter to acquaint himself with the writings of the old Non-conformists in England, such as <hi>Cartwright, Bradshaw, Ball,</hi> &amp;c. Who testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy against the Brownists for their separation from that Church (for which he sayes much more might have been alledged then for ours.) <hi>Ans.</hi> We acknowledge that these worthy men have done well upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that separation which they wrote against; But our case [anent a Church purely reformed from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of doctrine, worship, discipline and Government and under universal oaths of adherence to that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infested, encroached upon, and invaded by a party of Schismatick overturners of her reformation, standing in opposition to a faithful Ministry, and professors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them,] is so vastly discrepant from their case, [anent keeping up fellowship with a Church universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104445:347"/>
tainted with corruptions, from which she had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been purged,] that by no imaginable grounds, can a consequence be drawen from the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And any consequence relating to us, or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the pleadings of these Divines against the Brownists, will properly strike against his dividing party, who have gone out from the fellowship of this pure Church, to which they were Joyned, and did vow adherence to her constitution and reformation, yet notwithstansting by them thus miserably rent and destroyed for many years.</p>
               <p>As for these Rules of Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Cure of Church divisions,</hi> which this <hi>Informer</hi> doth afterward commend unto us, we are not much concerned in their explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or application, since they do not in the least-strike against what we maintain, therefore we shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run over them. For the first here mentioned, [anent not making communion with a Church stricker then Christ hath made it] when we disowne dividers and Schismaticks renting and destroying a pure Church, and introducing abjured innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we do not narrow these terms of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Christ hath given. For he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to withdraw from <hi>such as cause divisions and offences,</hi> contrary to our received ordinances, and not to have fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darkness, to turn away from Covenant-breakers; And its their dividing party who fall under the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this rule, who make complyance with abjured prelacy the terms of their communion, and so cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persecute all who will not conform to their course of backsliding. There is no doubt equal danger on the other extreme in making the terms of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>laxer</hi> then Christ hath appointed. For the 2 rule which he mentions [anent a due impression of the evill of division and discord, and the reasons and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104445:347"/>
of union.] I think indeed had this <hi>Informer</hi> and his party, kept up a Scripture impression of this, they had not for the <hi>punctilio's</hi> of their trifling Conformity, so miserably rent this poor Church, and overturn'd her Reformation. For the 3. [anent not engadging too far in a divided sect,] it reaches Conformists, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blow, who have so far engadged for Prelats and their Interest, that for many years it hath been the great work of our Laws (by the instigation of them, and their Rabbies) to root out all Ministers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of this Church, who do not conform, and owne this course of backsliding. Dare this petulant <hi>Informer</hi> call adherence to this Church, her sworn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, principles, and faithfull Ministry, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to a divided Sect.</hi> For the 4. [anent the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt a sound and sinfull zeal, and that we be suspicious of our Religious passions] we say, zeal for the Gospel, for keeping Covenant with God, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from popry and prelacy (which is the the Test of our zeal as stated in opposition to them) doth convincingly evidence its soundness. For the 5. [anent not being over tender of our repute, or impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of mens censures,] we say, to be tender of truth and duty, and our good name in maintaining it, which is as precious ointment, and to be tender of not offending and displeasing all who are thus tender, is nothing but a true and Gospel-tenderness. For the 6. [anent eshewing needless fellowship with the more censorious Christians] we say, we stand oblig'd to keep fellowship with all the godly in all duties, and this charge of <hi>over censoriousness</hi> we deny as to our plea against Conformists, neither hath he <hi>Informer</hi> yet made it good. For the 7. [that we lay not too much weight on doubtfull opinions, nor begin with them] we bless God that in this pure Church, Gods people have been taught the <hi>solid beginnings and first principles,</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:104445:348"/>
and do build on that foundation; But we have not so learned Christ, as to put into the Category of <hi>things doubtfull, breach of Covenant, abjur'd Prelacy,</hi> and a <hi>Schismatick sinfull complyance therewith,</hi> For the 8. [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent not admiring or favouring a preacher for his voice, affectionat utterance, &amp;c. Without solid understanding,] we say, Gods people with us have been helped not to regard mens speech, but their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And as they know Christ the great shepherd his truth, by his voice from them, accordingly as his sheep to follow them. For the 9. [anent not reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a good cause, because owned by bad men] we say, the cause we disowne is bad in it self, and we disowne the owners of this bad cause, upon this ground; And are confirmed in our disowning of it, by the fruits which we see the owning of it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in its supporters and abbetors, which are such as do warrand us according to our Lords command, to <hi>avoid and beware of them.</hi> For the 10. [not to follow the bad examples of Religious persons,] we bless the Lord we are taught to walk by the rule of Gods Word, not by examples of men, and not to follow even a Paul further then he is a follower of Christ. For the 11. [anent keeping an eye on the state of all Churches upon earth, and pondering how Christ keeps fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with them, lest while we think we separat only from these about us, we separat from almost all Churches] we say, that we have lookt upon our own Church deservedly, as among the purest and best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and by the same rule are concerned to keep up fellowship with her, as knowing that such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce fellowship with her, would renounce it with all Churches. And this we do with a due charity for all Reformed Churches, and whatever Churches do hold the foundation. But upon these grounds we are bound to disowne <hi>destroying Schismaticks,</hi> as are our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104445:348"/>
who have introduced abjured innovations contrary to her pure constitution and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have gone out from her fellowship, and by the same consequential reason, from the fellowship of all Churches. For the last rule which he mentions, [that we count it as comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be a martyr for love and peace by blind zealots, as for the faith by infidels] we say, that we owne no zeal which is not according to knowledge, and are contending for the union and reformation of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against a party of blind fiery zelots, for ane ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured hierarchy contrary to the Word of God and this Churches vows, in which honourable quarrel that many have suffered even to bonds, imprisonments, yea death it self, it is our Glory. As for what he adds [of the English nonconformists, <hi>their testyfing against separation, as a way which God never blessed with peace and holiness though they dissented from the Ceremonies]</hi> I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt, but that they would have put the same Character upon the practice of the Prelats and their followers, had they seen and known all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of our case. They dissenting from fellowship in the ceremonies, and <hi>eatenus</hi> from fellowship in the Worship, though that Church, had never been purged from them, how much more then are we concerned to disowne innovations introduced into this Church, after they have been cast out and vowed against. Suppose that Church, had been (as ours) Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in doctrine Worship, discipline and Government, and a party had risen up destroying that pure consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, contrary to all their vows, admitting none to fellowship without acknowledging of their wicked course, persecuting and casting out all Ministers and professors, who would not concur? And then let them tell us what these nonco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104445:349"/>
eshewed a contagion in communicating with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, they would have eshewed this piece of contagious conformity also. Especially the express vows of adherence to that supposed reformation in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very piece of it, and of disowning all recesses, all back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders, and of owning all adherers to these vows in prusuing the ends thereof, being taken in, and duely pondered.</p>
               <p>After the close of this Dialogue, our <hi>Informer</hi> will needs strengthen his plea in presenting unto us, by way of Apendix, some passages of the English Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, their <hi>Jus divinum Ministerij Anglicani,</hi> and likewise in Mr Rutherfoord his <hi>due right of Presbytery,</hi> anent the <hi>unwarrantableness of Separatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

However (altho upon the matter any seeming conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he might draw from them is answered, yet) we shall view them briefly, having premised (1.) That he supposes but hath not yet made good, the charge of a <hi>sinfull separation</hi> upon the people of God in this case, which we have shown to be more applicable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. 2. That the case of separation from <hi>that Church at that time</hi> because of her corruptions, is far wide from this case of our disowning Conformists now, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently all his citations will never come home to our purpose, because.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to separat from a Church upon the ground of corruptions which have been long setled in her; is very far distinct from this practice of disowning an

Innovating party introducing corruptions to the ruine of a pure Church, after they have been seen, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally cast out, which is the practice he now pleads for; a stop as to an advance in Reformation, is much different from backsliding in this case, and especially the joyning to a backsliding party who are not the true Church, is much different from adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a Church tho backslidden. Its a far different case not to leave the communion of a Church because of some corruptions, and not to joyn with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound party of a Church drawing back from her Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: So that upon a due consideration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, and Presbyterian principles, its evident that these Testimonies do levell against Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its a far different case to owne the Ministry of a corrupt Church wherin prelacy is universally owned, and wherein there hath been no other way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Ministry for many generations but by Prelacy: and to owne a party of Schismatick Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders introducing Prelacy over the belly of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church, and shutting out her faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, surely these Intruders are in this case the Brownists.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its a far different case to submit to a Ministry <hi>meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Episcopal,</hi> and to keep the Worship in a Church <hi>long under this Government,</hi> and to submit to an <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Erastian Ministry,</hi> and a Church Government <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally corrupt,</hi> deriving all its power from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian supremacy, and meer civil papacy, after it hath been eminently and universally disowned by that Church, and vowed against, Especially when a backsliding party only do thus usurp over the sound Ministry, and have ejected them, and this Erastian abomination is set up to raze this true spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104445:350"/>
of the Church once universally setled and owned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its a far different case, to submit to an Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ministry so far as pure, while Episcopacy is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally ownd, and no obligation is upon any to disowne it, further then its own corruption in that case will amount to and infer: and to owne and submit to an <hi>episcopal Erastian Government</hi> introduced by an Innovating party into a Presbyterian Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>her standing acts, solemn Oaths and vows univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally taken on by that Church against the same,</hi> while a faithfull Ministry, and the great part of the people are in Conscience of their vows contending against it. Surely this superinduced obligation requires a higher degree of zeal against that defection, and renders it the more hainous. The high places permitted to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and Solomon before the Temple was built, are censured in after times; greater light and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations do in this case cast the ballance.</p>
               <p>These considerations do clearly repell any argument which he would draw from his citations to our case. But now to view them, The English Presbyterians in that piece do first assert page 10. [that all in the same bounds most be under the care of the same Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and that these limits ought not to be brangled <hi>Ans.</hi> This shall be easily accorded, give us our beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Church-order and a lawfully called Ministry and this parochial order shall be observed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, state the question so that Hophni and Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, and the Pharisees Ministry could not be owned without partaking in their sin, then this man must needs grant, that Gods people were obliged to disowne them, and had disowned them.

5. (page 42, 43.) [Israel is called the people of the Lord, even after the Calves were set up at Dan and Bethel, and Cajaphas was own'd as high priest, though they came to the office by bribry and faction, and the highpriest had an hand in crucifying Christ.] <hi>Ans.</hi> The same reply and retortion recurs as formerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what will he say if we plead this for presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whom he will not call worse then these mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor will he say that our Presbyterian Church is worse then that Church. So that he must grant this will not reach his conclusion, till more be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and proved in this point. Again, tho God in his soveraign dispensation had not as yet cast off the ten tribes, having a faithfull remnant among them, yet I hope he will not from this plead for owning the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, or the Priests Ministry whom Jeroboam had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, and set up contrary to Gods institution, and for keeping up that wofull breach in Gods worship, and in Israel, which was therby promoted, and this is a fit emblem of their Innovating prelatick Ministry. Beside that the high priests were men in a considerable measure deciders and Interpreters of the civil Law, and might in that respect be owned. But however, it is (as we have said) bad arguing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with corruptions in that old dispensation and Ministry especially when drawing near an end, to the receiving of abjured corruptions into a Church which has been rid of them, and from a <hi>non-separating</hi> in the first case, to conclude against a <hi>non-union</hi> or non complyance in the second. And thus neither will Pauls carriage toward the high prist, Acts 23. plead for adhering to Curats upon the same grounds. For he will not say that Paul understood not his office in a spiritual sense to be now expired, and that he was not to be owned as a teacher, who was every way desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the truth of the gospel, and an enemy unto it.

Jackson thinks with sevral others, that Paul said, I <hi>knew not that he was the high priest</hi> &amp;c. ironically, it <q>being very improbable, that Paul knew not the high priest, and suppose it were so, he knew him to be a ruler as his own words discover, so that it was no excuse to say he knew not the high priest, because as a judge it was against the law to revile him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith Jackson upon Exod. 22. 28.) though they understood Paul as excusing himself, yet he</q> spoke by way of derision as disdaining he should be accounted Gods high-priest, who carryed so. <q>Which (saith he) is the more probable, when its conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how far he was from having any true right to that place and power to which he pretended, when Christ had abolished the legal priest hood.</q> Calvine on that place of the Acts sayes, Its not credible that Paul-gave him his wonted honour.<hi>—Cum abolita esset adventu Christi sacerdotij Majestas, &amp; secuta turpis prophanatio, Paulum quasi integra vigeret, solito honore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutum fuisse, qui tunc sub Pontificum titulo nullo jure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minabantur,</hi>

Hence the weight of their conclusion subjoyned, viz. that <hi>corruptions clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Gods ordinances null them not,</hi> is not laid upon this solely, nor <hi>positivly</hi> at all, even as a partial, but onely as a <hi>probable ground.</hi> And the conclusion it self when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, will never reach his designe as is above cleared. Again, admitting that Paul acknowledged his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential title, or <hi>jus in re</hi> as to a civil office and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration at that time, as it may well have its own weight in reference to the premised conclusion, civil rule, as such, being Gods ordinance, which is not made null by corruptions, so upon the the difference of civil from sacred rule this concession will not legitimat or infer an acknowledgment of the spiritual part of his administration.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen how well our <hi>Informer</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himself in his arguing from the English Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Let us next consider, how he reasons from Mr Rutherfoord in that peice forecited, if at least we may call that which he here offers a formal reasoning, since he offers not (as I said) any argument from these citations, but sure we will find that these passages will burn his fingers. In that piece [scil. Due right of presb. page 220. to 256.] There are several passages which this man takes hold of, as 1. [He asserts that separation from a true Church where the orthodox word is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and sacraments duely administrat, is unlawfull, and vindicats 2 Cor. 6.] <hi>Ans.</hi> This in Mr Rutherfoords sense will plead more for the Presbyterian Ministry &amp;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104445:352"/>
professors then for Conformists, whom he will not say that Mr Rutherfoord will look upon <hi>as our Church,</hi> in such a case as this, since (as we heard) he holds that in case of such a breach as we have now, the pure Church remains with the smaller stedfast number, and that the backsliders from truth and purity, tho the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n this sense we are to understand him when he sayes that this separation as to worship, will not infer an absolut separation, And his allowing <hi>non-union,</hi> where there is not sufficient cause of <hi>separation,</hi> in the case of purer to be joyned with, and his admitting a <hi>partial separation,</hi> because of a <hi>partial corruption</hi> of ordinances <hi>(Peacable plea page</hi> 121.) will much more plead for a <hi>total non-union</hi> in this our case; and I dare appeal this <hi>Informer</hi> if Mr Rutherfoords words <hi>(Peaceable plea page</hi> 122.) doth not suite our case and express such a sense therof as we have explaind; and if he would not have applyed that which follows unto our present prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick party, had he seen our Church in this posture and in her present circumstances, viz. <hi>we separat not from a true Church or her Lawfull Pastors, when we separat from hirelings and Idolshepherds, who will not go before us,</hi> and whether he would not have thought and called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists so? Thus (page 148. concl. 6.) he tells us, <hi>we may separat from the worship when we separat not from the Church.</hi> So that its evident, that in Mr Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords sense we separat not from the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, nor her worship, while withdrawing from Curats, in attending the Ministry of Christs faithfull ambassadours.</p>
               <p>In the Next place this <hi>Informer</hi> presents to us these passages further in that peice mentioned, viz. (page 233.) [the personal faults of others, are not sufficient ground for separation—That the disciples thought not the society unclean for Judas sin, though they

Unless he prove the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming party to be the true Church of Scotland, to which in this case we are obliged to adhere, or 2. If we can prove, that according to our Churches Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Presbyterian ministers and professors are the true organick Church of Scotland, though the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute smaller number (which according to Mr Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord is very easy, for he sayes that in case of defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, truth as life recools to the smaller hidden part, <hi>(Due right page</hi> 253.) In either case I say this will plead more appositly for adherence to Presbyterian Ministers and their Assemblies.</p>
               <p>Next, Mr Rutherfoords scope is to prove, <hi>that personal faults corrupt not the worship,</hi> which wee deny not, but as we have above cleared this falls utterly short of reaching his conclusion, as to the owning of Curats, untill he first prove his forementioned sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, wherein he begs the question, and this principle or assertion of Mr Rutherfoord will plead more strongly for not disowning Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters untill this <hi>Informer</hi> prove his suppositions, and disprove ours in this debate.</p>
               <p>In a word, the impertinency of all his citations here appears in this, that there is no reason whereby he can ward of this argument its reaching adherence to

Presbyterian Ministers, and inferring a conclusion of owning them, but it will either, first be retorted upon himself, or secondly, the universality of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the conclusion deduced there from, so limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as utterly to irritat his design; since he must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that there may be a Lawfull separation from a Ministry and ordinances, altho not polluted by personal scandals. And therefore this principle in every case will not infer a separation to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, far less a <hi>non union,</hi> and he must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that to argue the unlawfulness of a separation or non-union in every case, or meerly, from this ground [that there is no pollution of ordinances by the personal faults of Worshipers or administrators thereof] is a gross <hi>petitio principii &amp; ignoratio elenchi;</hi> and which his case, supposeth many things which are to be proved, as 1. That Conformists are this Church. 2. That this practice of disowning them as now cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiat, is properly a sinfull separation. 3. That Prelatists have the best right to officiat as Ministers in this Church. 4. That we have no other reasons for a non-union but this pretended pollution of ordinances, and that we stand obliged upon this supposition that the ordinances are not thus polluted, to joyn to them rather then Presbyterian Ministers. And since this principle will prove them all to be Schismaticks who disowne Presbyterian Ministers in preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it will follow therefrom that our <hi>Informer</hi> is in this pamphlet pleading for <hi>Schism,</hi> or else he must so limit this position, as thereby his conclusion against us shall be utterly cut off as is said.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he presents unto us that passage (page 254.) where he shews [That the godly in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land tho separating from Bishops and Ceremonies did not separat from that Church; and approves their doing so, and in keeping communion therwith
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104445:354"/>
in unquestionable duties, the contrary whereof he charges upon these separatists against whom he reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, telling us <hi>ibidem,</hi> that if a Church be incorrigible in a wicked conversation, and yet retain the true faith, its to be presumed that God hath some there to be saved,—that Christ himself is where his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are, and some union with him the head—that though a privat scandalous brother ought to be cast off, yet not an Orthodox Chuch.] <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Presbyterians have all this to plead for pleoples adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them, untill this <hi>Informer</hi> prove that the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick party are our nationall organick Church, which will be <hi>ad Kalendas Graecas.</hi> 2. Mr Rutherfoord all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long states his question as to separation, from a <hi>Church so and so polluted. Ergo</hi> he spaks not of <hi>a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick destroying Innovating party,</hi> or a separation from them rather then a sound Church contending against them, which would quite invert his scope and arguing, and the ground and <hi>hypothesis</hi> thereof. For I pose this man what if a party of acknowledged Innovators cast out the true Ministry, and should plead this passage of Mr Rutherfoords for their schism and the peoples adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, sure he would charge them with begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the question, as we do Consormists in this point, and would acknowledge that Mr Rutherfoord pleads nothing for them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Mr Rutherfoord sayes <hi>ib idem</hi> [We may sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat from the Lords supper where the bread is ador'd—and from baptism where the sign of the cross is—yet we are not to separat from the Church.] <hi>Ans.</hi> We may hence collect that in Mr Rutherfoords principles 1. We are to separat from all <hi>contagious Worship,</hi> tho not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly corrupt. 2. That this is no separation <hi>from the Church</hi> while there is a purer Church &amp; Ministry to be joyned with, and to which we were joynd. 3. That <hi>a fortiori</hi> a non-union unto, and disowning of a backsliding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104445:354"/>
                  <hi>who are not our Church,</hi> is warrantable because of their contagious corruptions, especially when (as is said) the opposition of that party to the true Church is so virulent. Mr Rutherfoord tells us there, that we separat not from the Church when we profess to <hi>hear the word,</hi> and allow <hi>the truth of Doctrine,</hi> and do not Presbyterian professors owne the true Doctrine of our Reformed Church, while hearing and and adhering unto her faithfull Pastors. Beside, Mr Rutherfoord tells us, that there may be cause of non-union where there is not sufficient cause of separation, as Paul sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat not from the Jews till they blasphemed, yet, saith he, there was no cause why people should joyn to that Church before that time, since they had the cleaner to joyn with viz. That of the Apostles—Ergo in case of a true Reformed Church her being divided, and rent by a backsliding destroying party opposing her Authority, union and purity, introducing Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into her, contrary to her Reformation and vows, and casting out her faithfull Ministry who dare not comply with their wicked course, a non-union to them and adherence rather to that faithfull Ministry contending against them, is no sinfull separation from the Church, nor a separation at all by Mr Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords doctrine. Sure the Presbyterian party are in our principles the cleanest Church, to whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr Rutherfoords allows to adhere. (page 253.)</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Informer</hi> presents us another passage in that same place to repell what is said, viz. that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts [there is no just cause to leave a less clean Church (if true) and to go to a purer, though one who is a member of no Church may joyn to that which he conceives purest.] <hi>Ans.</hi> This makes as little for him as any of the rest, for 1. He is still speaking of a Church, thus intirely less pure, in comparison of a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104445:355"/>
more pure. But blessed be God their prelatick impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, has not infected all our Church, their being 1000 of Ministers &amp; professors who adhere to the truth. This man will not say that this will plead for a peoples ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to a party of Schismatick backsliders Intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a pure Church, Introducing Innovations into her, and ejecting her faithfull Ministry as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists are now doing; which will be yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly clear, if we consider 2. that Mr Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord layes much weight upon this, that a <hi>man is already a member of that Church which is less pure,</hi> but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be <hi>hactenus</hi> members of, and on this ground under a prior obligation of adherence unto, a party of Innovators and backsliders, who are destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruining the pure Church, but in this case our prior obligation is in order to adherence to that pure Church and her faithfull Ministry, thus opposed as is said.</p>
               <p>But now at last our <hi>Informer</hi> who hath been hitherto silent as to any inference from his citations, drawes out a general conclusion from them, <hi>that in Mr Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords Iudgment and the English divines, neither the personal faults of Ministers, Nor real faults about the Worship (much less supposed only) will warrand a separation,</hi> which when admitted lifts not his cause one hair breadth off the dust, as is clear from what is said; since he hath proved none of these three, either 1. That they are the Church of Scotland to which we are bound to adhere according to the tenour and principles of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nor 2. That this practice of disowning them in this our case, is a sinfull separation. Or 3. that we disowne then meerly for personal scandals, or some corruption in Worship. Whereas we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that abstracting from both these, we have ground of disowning them as <hi>Schismatick Innovators</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Church; and himself must grant that there
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104445:355"/>
may be a non-union unto, yea a separation from <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ground lesly assuming the name of a Church,</hi> though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their personal faults do pollute the worship, nor the worship it self be <hi>simpliciter</hi> disowned, or else he must yeeld the cause when this is pleaded in behalf of Presbyterian Ministers, and for not separating from them: since it is upon this ground, that all along he pleads for people's disowning them, though he dare not say that the ordinances are polluted by their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed scandals.</p>
               <p>After this our <hi>Informer</hi> exhorts his Doubter, <hi>to try all things—and not to be ashamed to retract what is amiss, as Augustin wrote books of retractions and Ierom exhorted Ruffinus not to be ashamed to confess an error. Ans.</hi> I think indeed, we are to search all things by the rule of the word, and had he with a single heart and an eye to the God of truth, searched better, he had not obtruded upon Gods people (in defence of so bad a cause) such insignificant arguments for demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But why exhorted he not his Doubter <hi>to hold fast what is good,</hi> as well as to try all things? It is not fit to be ever learning, and fixe in nothing. And no doubt this latter part of that scripture precept, justifies our opposing their Innovations. But he pleads for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,</hi> and its no wonder to see men who have Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the casting aside such solemn Oaths and vows unto God, plead for <hi>retractions.</hi> But if he and his party retract not such monstrous retractions (the very naming whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof would have made Augustin and Jerom astonished) the wo threatned against perjury, backsliding, &amp; breach of Covenant is very near them. His concluding pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that <hi>God bless us with truth and peace,</hi> is good, and heartily accorded, and surely when our Jerusalem shall have this spiritual prosperity, peace, and truth (which this man pretends to pray for) within her walls, prelats and their wofull train and corrupt principles,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104445:356"/>
which have made such sad breaches in her walls, will be without them. And the prosperity of such as love her, will ruine her enemies.</p>
               <p>His Doubters Resolution <hi>[to hold fast what is good</hi> upon the proof of all things] makes up his lame advice. And having thus fortifyd the Knowledge of the <hi>serious Doubter</hi> in that which this man hath been <hi>misinforming</hi> him about, and antidoted this poyson, we pray that all the sincere enquirers for truth, may hold it fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the times errors and defection. The character of <hi>schism</hi> presented to us at the close of the pamphlet, is verifyed in the party he pleads for: since their proud usurpation of the name and authority of this Church, after they have thus rent and separat from her, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats this their schism to be <hi>superbiaeproles.</hi> And in their taking up such grosse unheard of principles anent Oaths, anent Magistracy &amp;c. to maintain and uphold this usurping hierarchy, they are like to fall under that other branch of the character of schism, that <hi>male perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verando fit haeresis.</hi> And because of the corruptions which it is like to be more &amp; more productive of, It may very probably become also <hi>mater haereseos.</hi> The Lord awake for judgement, and send a plentifull rain to water his in heritance, and revive his work in the admist of the years, and make his face to shine upon his sanctuary in these lands, which is disolat, for his names sake.</p>

I must here add, that its asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninishing to find this man pretending a <hi>principle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> for this undertaking, when his conscience could not but tell him, that both upon the poynt of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie, the Covenants, and separation also, he might have found all and more then he hath said fully answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that he pitifully snakes away from our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; dar not propose them in there genuin strength. Nay he doth not so much as offer fairly to state the question in any of these three great points which he pretends to inform us about, but confusedly shuffles them up for his own advantadge. And upon the point of the Covenant obligation, he poorly followes the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the <hi>Seasonable case,</hi> and some hints from the Surveyer without so much as offring any return unto what the Apologist hath long since repelyd unto them. If this was conscientious dealing let any Judge? and yet he is not ashamed to tell the world, <hi>that because Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie and the covenants are by people made the great grounds of separating, therefore he premised his two dialogues concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Episcopacie and the Covenants, to shew what a sandy ground they are for separation, if prelacie be found at least Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the Covenants in evry case not obligatorie,</hi> whereas he hath offered nothing either to prove prelacie lawful, or the Covenant not obligatorie, but what is by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall of the godly learned abundantly answered and fully bafled, sevrall of which (viz. the <hi>Apollogist,</hi> and <hi>jus divinum Ministery Anglican,</hi> he seems to have had before him in writeing these Dialogues, and yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he touch the answers of the Apologist to his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104445:358"/>
arguments anent the Covenant, nor dar he scan the pungent arguments of the London Ministers against prelacie, and likwise there answers to sevrall things which he has offered for it, and particularly there learned <hi>Appendix</hi> in the poynt of Antiquitie, which cuts the sinnews of all his tedious legend of testimonies, he durst not medle with. Beside It wold seem he hath seen Smectymnus upon this subject, whose learned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Episcopall plea as well from scripture as antiquity he passes over <hi>sicco pede.</hi> And as for Erastian prelacie, he offers not a jot indefence of it, though his conscience could tell him that this is one main poynt of our plea against him. So that suppose Episcopacie were <hi>in its self found Lawfull,</hi> as he sayes, yet if Erastian Episcopacie be found unlawfull, his cause and pleading is lame and lost.</p>
               <p>After this he would amuse his reader with a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Zanchie</hi> and another of <hi>Blondell</hi> which parts the hoofs of his page first as for Zanchie he cites a passage of his <hi>Obser: in suam ipsius confessionem cap.</hi> 25. <hi>aphor:</hi> 10. 11. wherein he saves first <hi>his faith is simply built upon the word of God, Next In some measure upon the commun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the antient Catholick Church, and that he beleeves what has been defyned by holy fathers gathered together in the name of the Lord—citra ullam Scripturae contradictionem that these things are from the Spirit of though not of the same authoritie with Scripture,</hi> then he adds that <hi>nothing is more certain from counsells Histories and writeings of the Fathers then these orders of Ministers of which he has been speaking to have been received into the Church, with her intire consent, and what is he to condemn what the whole Church has aproved.</hi> I answer, beside that he should have set doun these <hi>gradus Ministrorum</hi> which Zanchius speaks of, that his reader might have known what these degrees were, or whither they were prelatick degrees or not, which no doubt he would have done had he not found that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104445:358"/>
this would have marred his intent, (for which cause he doth not so much as offer to English any part of this or of the ensuing testimony) we say, first, that any who knowes Zanchies learning, and what the voice of the first and pure antiquity is, and how far from giving a testimony to the present <hi>Diocesian,</hi> much less the <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> prelat, of whom none can without extrem impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence assert that Zanchie is speaking, will esteem this perswasion [that the prelacy now existant with us hath the universall consent of all histories councills and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers] to be as far from the thoughts of Zanchie, as its necessary to prove his poynt 2. Zanchise ayes his faith simply and mainly leans upon <hi>the word of God,</hi> and so whatever the word is found to condemn (as we have proved it doth the present prelacie in many respects) Zanchie will make no bones to condemn it likwise, own it who will.</p>
               <p>The next passage he cites is of <hi>Blondell (Apoll. pag.</hi> 193.) who asserts that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>the Church hath full power to follow what is more decent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. Ans.</hi> 1. We have before cleard that with Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell their <hi>diocesian Prelat</hi> stands absolutly condemned in scripture, and in his principles is diametrally opposit to the <hi>divine Scripture Bishop,</hi> which evidently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his condemning the present Episcopacie with sole power of ordination and Jurisdiction,—much more the Erastian prelat, altering fundamentally the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104445:359"/>
it self, which he dar not say that Blondell ever dreamed of. So that though we should grant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this testimonie, that Blondell will befound to admitt a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and constant Moderator, which Its well knowen is the outmost length he goes, and that the Churches example and practice here anent may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, it falls utterly short of reaching the lest patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciny to his cause. 2. he cites 1 Cor 14. 40. anent alterable circumstances of order and decency, about which the Churches exercise of Christian prudence is convér<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, so that he must understand what he pleads for to be of that nature, but we have shewed upon the first Dialogue how far its contrary to Scripture &amp; reason to include a diocesian Bishop or Arch bishop within the compass of decencie and order there commanded, since decencie and order points only at circumstances of actions already commanded and circumstances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun to civil and sacred things. And this according to the generall rules of the word, so that none can think Blondell so sottish as to take in among these, the Diocesian or Erastian Bishop and Arch-Bishop. 3. Since the profest scope of Blondells learned Appology is to plead for <hi>sententia Hieronomi—</hi>which is that in Apostolick times <hi>communi concilio presbyterorum Ecelesiae gubernabantur,</hi> surely whatever Blondell may admitt as to the Churches libertie in relation to a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, yet the admission of the diocesian prelate with sole power of ordination and Jurisdiction (which this man pleads for) and much more the Erastian prelate, would evert both his hypothesis and scope. Again, he dare not deny that with Blondell the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, much more the Erastian, doth the very substantialls of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters divine power, which this learned author is in that piece pleading for. And in a word I dare pose this <hi>Informer,</hi> whither Blondell would not have thought a national Churches liberty in this point of Custome or alterable circumstances of decencie and order (even tho we should grant that he puts Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy among these) is tyed up and restrained, by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred solemn Oaths and vowes universally taken on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same; so that his cause is never a whit better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by these blind Testimonies which (as is said) he he durst not translate, as he professeth to doe in the rest of his citations, for the advantage of the unle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned.</p>
               <p>The assertion after subjovned by him <hi>viz. that the unlawfulness of Episcopacie was questioned by none of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients except Aerius, and rarely by any of the modern except some of our British divines, that antient and modern divines think that prelacie was the primitive Government left by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles]</hi> we have proved to be a manifest untruth. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when applyed to the prelacy existant with us; and that it is the consentient judgment of the far gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atest part, both of ancient and modern that there is no difference <hi>jure divino</hi> betwixt a Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter. And that our Prelats now in Scotland are as far different from the antient Bishops as east from West, so that no patrocinie can be drawen from the one to the other. That Blondell professes to vindicat Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom from that which he calls <hi>Aerianism,</hi> who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, taking Aerius opinion to be for the premised I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentitie of Bishop and Presbyter; since we have made it appear by Testimonies of the learned, that both Greek and Latine Fathers held this same opinion with Aerius. How he hath proved Episcopacie <hi>[to be the</hi>

                  <hi>Government which hath best warrand in the word, and hath continued without interruption for many years]</hi> we refer it to the reader to judge by what is above replyed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein we have made it appear, that as his pretended Scripture proofs for prelacy, and his answers to our Arguments against it, are most frivolous, so none of his pretended Testimonies from antiquitie doe reach his conclusion, nor any shadow of a patrocinie for our present Prelat now established, whom we have fully disproved from Scripture, both in his diocesian and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastian mould. What poor shaddowes for proofs doth this man grasp at Blondell thought the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> lawful, and its <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and good order. Ergo, he pleaded for the Diocesian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop with sole power of ordination and Jurisdiction, and a Bishop deriving all his power from the civil Magistrat as immediatly subject unto him, which is a very antilogical proof and a meer rop of sand.</p>
               <p>Lastly he mainly commends to his reader this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue anent separation <hi>[wherein he sayes all the reasons brought for it are propounded and answered without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which doth but alienat the minds. Ans.</hi> How poorly this man hath answered the true grounds of disowning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, or rather past them over, and how pityfully he all along begs the question in supposing what he hath to prove, we hope is made sufficiently appear to the Judicious and impartiall. As for passion, its true there is less of this in his Pamphlet then in some other of this stamp which his fellowes have flung out among the people, yet he hath his signal flashes of it <hi>[in Iustifying Dr Burnets parallel of nonconformists with Scribes and Pharisees, and in calling them as great and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seless Schismaticks as ever the Church had in any age,</hi> nay in his grosse malitious reflecting upon the sufferings of poor Innocents in this land, telling us under the covert
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104445:360"/>
of Cyprians words <hi>[that their in expiable sin of discord is not purged by their sufferings—that forsaking Christs Church, they cannot be martyres nor reign with him,]</hi> which, with what a tincture of malice it presents its self, let any judge. His conferences he sayes do bring water to quenchour flames, but they bring rather fewel to the fire, and wood and hay to uphold Babell. The Rabbies whom he pleads for have kindled our flames, and the best way to quench them Is to put these incendiaries to the door.</p>
               <p>Next he cites the preface of the <hi>Syntag. Confess. edit. Genev. [wherin the Church of Scotland is commended for her unity as well as purity of Doctrine,</hi> and then he cryes out <hi>O how have we lost our good name, and the staff of bonds is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the midst of us]</hi> but he should have been so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as to have told us that we are in the preface of that Syntagma commended for our <hi>reformed Presbyterian discipline</hi> as the great bond and cement of our unity, and the guard of our <hi>pure doctrine,</hi> and who have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this bond and sacred hedge I need not tell him, and what hath been the <hi>distress, confusion</hi> and <hi>desolation</hi> of our Church since it was broken, every one now sees; so that he might lament the loss of <hi>our good name</hi> upon this ground, and especially of our Integrity where he a true son and watchmen of this Church. The consequences of our sad divisions, through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and Schismatick intrusion of abjured perjured Prelats and their underlings have indeed hazarded the standing of Christs Kingdome among us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of Mark 3. 24. And the biting &amp; devouring wolves, the Prelats for whom he pleads have hazarded the consuming of Gods poor remnant Gal. 5. 19. Our Churches dissolution &amp; corruption, &amp; were he as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent this, as to preserve there worldly peace and sinfull union, he would have seen Prelacy to be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104445:361"/>
the <hi>Idol Iealousie,</hi> the wedge driven by the popish ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisans to divide and break this Church, and as the true cause of all our breaches to be removed in order to healing. The popish invasion doth indeed plead for union of the true Prorestant Church and interest against them, and consequently to hold out and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such arrant upholders and promoters of that Antichristian interest as Prelats have first and last been found and never more then now, since popry hath never more prevaild then since they were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished (by the confession even of our Rulers) and that without control. While they are enflaming the powers to the out most height of rage against poor Innocent nonconfomists, so that union with them who are at so palpable an union with Rome is not the unity of the spirit which is to be keep in the bond of Peace, and to be ownd by any that favour the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interest.</p>
               <p>The texts which he presents unto us upon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispeice of the Pamphlet will be found to rebound a deadly blow upon his cause. For that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For that of heb 10. 25. anent <hi>not forsaking the Assemblies,</hi> we blesse the Lord that such as are sorroufull for our Churches true Assemblies, and to whom this man and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes reproaches thereof are a burthen, have had the Assemblies of Christs ambassadours to attend, and that the great Master of Assemblies hath not wholly left them, but hath covered a table in the wildernes in this our Churches fli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The sentence next subjoyned <hi>viz opinionum varietas &amp; opinantium unitas non sunt asustata,</hi> doth highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon himself, and the party he pleads for, who doe persecut with fire and sword all who differ in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them in these things which they aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but <hi>tricae</hi> &amp; <hi>maters indifferent,</hi> so that in this they are <gap reason="foreign">

For us, we are chased out from them, and can be admitted to no union with them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we unit in there sin, which throw grace we are fixtly resolved against. His design <hi>[to quiet peoples minds, and setle them in more peace and unitie]</hi> is of it self to good to be presented as a porch here to such a shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered pasquill, and to be pretended to so bad a cause

&amp; in this place may be not unsuitably assimilated to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons <hi>ring of gold in a swines snout.</hi> No doubt solid peace and unitie is only to be found in Gods way, in keeping his Covenant and owning his Messengers of peace (whose feet have been beautiful even on these reproached mountains &amp; other places where Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple assembled, since they have his call and seal to preach the gospell) and not in following the foxes in a way of perjurie and breach of Covenant as this pamphleter would perswad.</p>

For Jerom doth thus clearly oppose to one another, the <hi>Dispositio Divina,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiae usus</hi> or custome in this passage, as two contrary and inconsistent things, thus he also reflects upon Christs institutions as at first practised by the Apostles before this change. p. 225. l. 17. r. no such delegation. p. 231. l. 17. r. the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent prince-like power of our Prelates, as Diocesian B. farre less their Erastian usurpations. p. 237, l. 8, 9, &amp;c. r. the ancient Bishops were not all sett over whole provinces, but city by city for the most part (yea several cities had more) who certainly were not Bishops in that sense, wherein we heard Theodoret and Oecomen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
