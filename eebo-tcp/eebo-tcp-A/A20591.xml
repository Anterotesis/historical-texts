         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne and neclect all

our owne ſecuritie for the tyme preſent, and yet if
any man would recken the courſe of this life paſt, hee
ſhoulde ſee in himſelfe greate cauſe to tremble at theſe
things: And alſo if wee doe conſider what great route of
euils doth beſet vs, and how many hath bene deſtroyed,
or what hurtes hath bene by Lightnings, Earthquakes,
Ground-openings, Fluddes, Tempeſtes of the Sea, great
Windes, Infections, Ayre, Warres, Mortalities, Plagues,
ſtraunge diſſeaſes and ſuch like, which things, Commets
doth commonly Prognoſticate to enſue. I ſuppoſe that
the remembraunce of ſuch daungers, ſhould make vs not
to be altogether careles of theſe tokens, threatning vnto
vs calamities for our vnthankefulnes, and therfore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
doth make light accoumpt of Earthquakes and
gleaming Starres: and is not moued with the ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
with the feare of Gods heauy diſpleaſure: the ſame
people doe alſo as lightly and as little regard their owne
conſciences and amendment of life. And now let vs beare
in mynde the fourth Starre, that was ſeene in <hi>Calabria,</hi>
which ſignifieth great alteration this yeere. 1587. and
<pb facs="tcp:16602:2"/>
that the world will not long indure, God make vs all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Doleta, a learned Aſtronomer doth write, and with hym
alſo doe agree, in wryting all the learned men in <hi>Grecia,

the Sunne ſhalbe couered with a <hi>Dragon,</hi> in the
Morning from fiue a Clocke vntill nine, and will ſhewe
forth as fire, and in this yere is thought to be great Fluds,
Windes; Tempeſtes and Earthquakes. I pray God defend
and keepe vs from the ſame, and giue vs grace to repent,
and beare in mynde the fearfull ſignes and tokens. For as
before the deſtruction of the firſt World, like ſignes and
tokens appeared, &amp; yet they would not turne from their
wickedneſſe, and ſo were drowned in the Flood. And as
before the deſtructions of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> appeared
like wonders, but they would not call to God for mercy,
and ſo were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed with Fire and Brimſtone. And that
goodly Citie <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for their abhomination was made
deſolate, and not one ſtone left vppon an other. Yet
now let all theſe ſignes and tokens cauſe ſpeedie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
