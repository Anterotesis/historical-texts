            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>entrance</hi> into the <hi>Island</hi> (for there is but one, and that about the <hi>South-south-east</hi> point thereof) is narrow, rockie and rugged; this they report (for thereis no end of such reports) to be the <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In this Island there was a little <hi>Church</hi> dedicated to S. <hi>Patricke</hi> called <hi>Reglis,</hi> covered with shingles, and being within the walls 40. foot long, and nine foot broad; out of this on the South side, an Arch did give entrance into a small <hi>Chappell,</hi> being ten foot wide, and fifteen foot long, the walls of both being two foot and a halfe thicke.</p>

            <p>Into this <hi>Cave,</hi> not promiscuously, but men by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and women by themselves, were admitted.

Neither doth <hi>M. Richard Ash</hi> take notice of any such thing (who was in that Island before <note n="m" place="margin">

            <p>In this Island of <hi>S.

the fire, part thereof was by a devout man snatehed out, and new set, which is that now extant. But this seemeth to be <hi>lately</hi> done, it not being above ten foot high, and about the thicknesse of a mans legge, which might happen by being too much scorcht with the fire; neither are the rest of any great growth.</p>
            <p>Between the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Cave</hi> there is a small ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of ground, and an <hi>heape of Stones,</hi> with a little <hi>stone-crosse,</hi> part broken, standing therein; and on the <hi>East-end</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> there is another <hi>heape,</hi> on which there was another <hi>crosse</hi> made of <hi>twigs interwoven:</hi> This is known by the name of <hi>S. Patricks Altar,</hi> on which there doth lye three peeces of a <hi>Bell,</hi> which they say, <hi>S. Patrick</hi> used to carrie in his hand. Here also was laid a certaine <hi>Knotty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> of some bignesse, hollow in the midst, like to the Nave of a wheele, out of which doe issue, as it were, naturall <hi>Spokes.</hi> This was shewed as a great rarity, being part (as some say) of <hi>that Serpents taile</hi> which we have before remembred.

It was also revealed to S. Patrick that a certaine place of Purgatorie was there, into which who so would descend, needed no other repentance for his sinne, neither should he feele any other Purgatory; whence many were never to returne, and they that did, must first continue there from morning to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next day; many therefore went in that never came backe.</hi> This is the 198. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and in the next, <note n="q" place="margin">ibid. cap. 119.</note> there is a <hi>Relation</hi> of one that did goe into <hi>S.

               <hi>S. Patrick went up into an high mountaine in Connaght called Chruaghan-aigle, on the top of which mountaine very many were accustomed to fast and watch, thinking they should never after enter into the gates of hell, which they think by the prayers and merits of S. Patrick to have been obtained from God. Some also who have slept there report, that they have endured most greivous torments, by which they conceive themselves to be purged from their sinnes; whence some of them call that place S. Patrick's Purgatory.</hi> Thus <hi>Iocelin.</hi> And who seeth not here two distinct places? the one in <hi>Vlster,</hi> that which we treate off; the other in <hi>Connaght,</hi> of which <hi>Iocelin;</hi> that in an <hi>Island</hi> within a lake, this <hi>on the top of a mountaine:</hi> So that it is most cleare, that <hi>Iocelin</hi> hath not one word of this <hi>great Purgatory;</hi> which also will seem most strange, he falling into a discourse of that other <hi>S.

               <hi>As it is most certaine that there was an extraordinary Purgatory found out by Patrick in Ireland: so it is also certaine, that Iocelin in his life doth either passe it over in silence, or butlightly glance at it,</hi> (a Glance rather than nothing.) But it is most certaine that it is not so much, and that more certaine than that <hi>that Purgatorie was found by Patrick.</hi> This is too plaine to be denied: and therefore, in the next place he doth confesse, or rather grant, and <hi>avoid it;</hi> for notwithstanding this, (saith he) <hi>Yet doe we not therefore think, that the Common Tradition of our owne Countrey-men and strangers concerning this Purgatory is thereby weakened;</hi> how common the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been since the time of <hi>Iocelin,</hi> I question not; but what Tradition was before, I cannot see, when as there was not any memory of it extant, for ought appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for more than 700. <hi>yeares</hi> after <hi>Patrick;</hi> it is true, that it did begin to be on foot about 45. <hi>yeares,</hi> or lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iocelin</hi> in <hi>Henry of Saltry</hi>'s time, but yet in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood as soone rejected as it was moved, which may well be gathered out of this our Authors silence: so that <hi>a plea</hi> of <hi>Tradition</hi> here will scarcely be admitted, or if it be, where is <hi>your Authors exactnesse</hi> you so much boast off? <hi>but notwithstanding,</hi> say you, <hi>we doe not think that Iocelin ought to be accounted the Author of an imperfect worke, when as we may excuse him sufficiently, and not incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously by that speech of Iohn spoken of our Lord, which may fitly be applyed to Patrick the Lords servant, saying, that there are many other things that Patrick did which are not written in this booke, made by Iocelin, for the causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred, in the expounding of that text of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59868:18"/>
and what are those reasons? <hi>Some yea many things he either knew not, or he wittingly omitted them, as being before known;</hi> but whether of these shall we sticke unto? to say <hi>Iocelin</hi> did not know of it, would too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the weaknesse of the cause: or if he did, yet would passe this by, making choice of sleighter matters (I doubt not) better knowne than this was, would question either his <hi>exactnesse,</hi> or blemish his <hi>Judgement</hi> too much; what then shall we say? heare then the last evasion. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, not without great probability doe we say, that Iocelin did not handle any thing of S. Patrick's Purgatory, in that book which he did write of the life of S. Patrick, because he was deceived by the opinions of others, who did think that it was not Patrick the Apostle, but another Patrick, both in time and dignitie to him inferior, that was the finder of this Purgatory.</hi> First then we have it here granted, and that with <hi>great probability,</hi> that <hi>Iocelin doth not write of any such thing.</hi> Next for the rest, we have onely confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent surmises, <hi>without any probabilitie</hi> at all, that <hi>Iocelin</hi> was misled by any such error to mistake the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and consequently to omit it selfe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we finde probabilities to the contrary: for whereas <hi>Iocelin</hi> doth not doubt to attribute to <hi>S.

               <hi>At this day among other places of punishment found by Patrick, there are two extant, being above others famous for pilgrimages; The one in Connaght, the other in Ulster. Of the first, which is placed on the top of a certaine craggie and steep mountaine, I will here repeat the words of Iocelin, on the top of this mountaine,</hi> &amp;c. the place before spoken off. So that we finde but one <hi>Author</hi> for both <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> Neither is there any that doth mislead us, but <hi>Roth</hi> onely, who would herein, if he could, deceive his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It would be therefore (by farre) the fairer course to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59868:18"/>
confesse what cannot well be denyed, then to think by forgeries and frivelous evasions to delude us.</p>
            <p>And this will yet seeme more strange, if we but looke back a little into the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Iocelin's</hi> writing. The first word that we heare of <hi>S. Patrick's Purgatory</hi> is in <hi>Henry of Saltry, anno</hi> 1140. (upwards of 700. yeares, as was said, after <hi>S. Patrick)</hi> in whose time the contention was great, and all meanes used for setting up the credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet notwithstanding all the <hi>noise</hi> and <hi>bustling</hi> that then was, it was as soone <hi>husht</hi> againe, and within 45. yeares after in the time of <hi>Iocelin</hi> buried in deep silence: so that either there was no such thing then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, or otherwise it was as too too ridiculous by <hi>Ioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> omitted. But I rather think the first, seeing he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no great choice of his matter, and standeth not much on examining the probabilitie of many things he hath written: wherein let me use <hi>Campion</hi> the <hi>Iesuits</hi> words, who (I know not on what grounds) thought that <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Cambrensis</hi> did omit to write of this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> whereas we know he did; yet will I make use of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thereupon, and may well apply the same to what now I have in hand. <hi>That</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Edm. Campion Jes. Hist. of Ireland. lib. 1. cap. 13.</note> 
               <hi>although a negative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be not invincible, yet considering the property of that man, and what a sort of trifles he taketh paines to justifie, it may serve for a vehement suspition, that the place was either then not found, or not miraculous.</hi> Thus <hi>Campion</hi> of <hi>Giraldus,</hi> and thus we of the rest.</p>
            <p>But from the <hi>Time,</hi> to come to the consideration of <hi>the thing it selfe;</hi> for as I have shewed it improbable, that in <hi>such learned times,</hi> among so many learned men, and of them some writing purposely of <hi>S. Patricks Life,</hi> the mention of this <hi>Purgatory</hi> should so passe as it hath, if it had then a being, as we are borne in hand: so will it seeme much more impossible, if the <hi>nature of the thing it selfe</hi> be looked into; for had it been a thing <hi>obscure,</hi> or of none account, it would be the lesse wonder that it should be forgotten; but being of all other things, <hi>that</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59868:19"/>
which is of greatest note, it could not be hid nor negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; nothing deserving to be more, or so much remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred as this. So <hi>O Sullevan</hi> writing of <hi>Ireland,</hi>

               <hi>There doth yet remaine that which of all the memorable things of Ireland is most memorable, of which I should have spoken in the first place, and that is S.

            <p>Neither will it serve to say, that this <hi>Purgatory</hi> was then in the <hi>Infancy</hi> therof, and not well known or frequented, so as much notice to be taken of it, at the least so much as in after times for to passe by, what before I touched; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it was supposed to be obtained by <hi>Patrick</hi> from God, for the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the whole Nation, and that it did worke that effect, by which <hi>all</hi> must have taken spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notice of it: we shall further find these men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that even in <hi>S.

               <hi>About this time,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Froissart Chanon of Chymay in the Earledeme of Heynault,</hi> as himselfe reporteth, <hi>came into England: He demanded of</hi> Sir <hi>William Lisle, who had beene with the King in Ireland</hi> (he meaneth <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>second) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Hole in Ireland, that is called Saint Patricks purgatory, if it were true that was sayd of it or not: Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that such an Hole there was, and that himselfe, and another Knight had beene there while the King lay at</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin; <hi>and sayd, they entred into the Hole, and were closed in it at the Sunne-set, and abode there all the night, and the next morning issued out againe at the Sunne-rising. Hee said that when hee and his fellow were entred, and past the Gate, that was called the Purgatorie of Saint Patricke, and that they were descended, and gone downe three or foure paces, as into a Cellar, a certaine hot vapour rose against them, and strake so into their heads, that they were faine to fit downe on the stayres which were of stone: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had sate there a season, they had great desire to sleepe, and so fell into a slu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I asked him if hee did see any strange thing or spectar there. Hee replyed, When I with my Companion had entred the dore of the Cave, which they commonly call aint Patricks Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and descending three or foure steps, so great and suddaine an heate we found in our heads, that we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to lay us downe on the stone stayres, where sitting, a great drowsinesse tooke us, so that we slept all the night; I enquired whether being in sleepe, they did know where they were: and what visions they saw: Hee answered, that he saw in his sleepe many phantasies and sights, and many other things which as it seemed to him are not wont to be seen by him lying in his bed. All this he affirmed to be true; but when as earely in the morning the dore was opened, and wee were come out, immediately all these fearefull things seene in our sleepe were quite forgotten.</hi> Thus he, so that 244. yeares since, we finde none of those reports of going into, I know not what places within this <hi>Cave,</hi> and tumbling in <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water and thousands of dangers:</hi> But for hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping this, <hi>one</hi> biddeth us not to looke so low, but rather to <hi>Saint Patricks time</hi> for these things. <note n="l" place="margin">Qui nostra memorià in hunc sese lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But in the first planting of Religion, (at which time Miracles are for the most part most frequent) it seemeth to me likely, that there used to appeare to those peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, many strange and terrible sights.</hi> It is but <hi>likely,</hi> you see, that it might be so in the <hi>first age</hi> of it, and if then it were so, and that that time might require that miracle for setling Christianitie, yet is it not now requisite: so that whatsoever it was in <hi>Saint Patricks time,</hi> it is confessed, that now no newes are to be found of <hi>Fire</hi> &amp; <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>such grievous Torments</hi> as wee are borne in hand to bee true, for the <hi>purging</hi> of those that goe into this <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> which if now vanished, how then are the pilgrims <hi>purged?</hi> And if they be not purged, why are they deluded as if they were?

               <hi>That because de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout men have resorted thither for penance, and reported at their returne strange visions of paine and blisse, and therefore they call it Purgatory.</hi> As if <hi>visions of joy and blisse,</hi> of <hi>torment and paine</hi> may be said to <hi>purge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now to shut up this first part of this discourse, we have seene, how into <hi>nothing</hi> this <hi>Purgatory</hi> is now shruncke and shriveled up: although esteemed <hi>vener able</hi> for the <hi>Author Saint Patricke,</hi> and <hi>religiously respected</hi> for it <hi>selfe,</hi> as being <hi>a Purgatory.</hi> But no <hi>Saint Patricke</hi> can wee finde to <hi>father</hi> it: And for the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> we see it turned to <hi>smoake;</hi> if we may say there is so much as <hi>smoake</hi> where no <hi>Fire is,</hi> for so is it heere; Therefore no <hi>purging,</hi> therefore no <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding all which; wonderfull it is to consider how much this fiction, (for so wee may now be bold to call it,) hath prevayled, that the <hi>whole world almost</hi> should bee so bewitched, as to bee <hi>deluded</hi> by so <hi>grosse</hi> an <hi>Imposture,</hi> and <hi>amazedly</hi> to runne, as it were <hi>Hoodwinked</hi> after it so farre as it did: and how farre it did so, is that which in the <hi>following Chapter,</hi> I purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>

Hence those <hi>Masses</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> for the <hi>soules</hi> departed, that they might bee eased, if not delivered of those paines.

After this I kissed them all and bade them farewell: So going into the <hi>Cave,</hi> after whom followed an <hi>English Knight,</hi> we were forbidden to discourse, on which they report death to be imposed: So the doore being locked, the <hi>Pryor</hi> with the people returned.</p>
                        <p>Now when I was shut in, and had taken notice of the greatnesse of the <hi>Cave,</hi> which I conceive to be about foure <hi>Elnes;</hi> I found the inner part thereof to turne, and extend it selfe a little to the left hand as I went in. Where I had troden, I found the ground under mee so weake and shaking that it seemed as though it could not beare a man; therefore fearing to fall into some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne depth, I did step backe, and having setled my selfe in the Catholike Faith, and being firme in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution I did cast my selfe on my knees to pray, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing there had beene no more to be done.</p>
                        <p>But about one houre after, I did begin to tremble everie joynt of me, to sweat and to be heartsicke, to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit also, as if I had beene in some long voyage at Sea. In which troubles I was overtaken with sleepe, but againe rowsed up with the noyse of a great <hi>Thunder,</hi> which was not heard by me alone, but of as many as were in the <hi>Island,</hi> with which they were the more astonished, in that it was a cleare and faire day.</p>
                        <p>The feare of which suddaine <hi>thunder</hi> was not over, when a new and greater terror seized on me, for scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was I awake when that I did slide downwards about <hi>six Elnes,</hi> with which suddaine fall notwithstanding that I were fully awakened and affrighted, yet did I not recover my selfe untill I had sayd those words the <hi>Pryor</hi> taught me, <hi>Christ thou Sonne of God, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>After which, I did perceive the <hi>Cave</hi> to be larger and higher, and the further I went (for now I went alone having lost my Companion) it was still more deepe and large; Neyther rested I untill I had entred into a place extreamely darke, and utterly destitute of any light: but the darkenesse soone passed.

                        <p>Being thus left alone, and casting in my minde all the dangers I was to run, suddainly followed a great noyse, greater than any warlike Tumults, which did pierce mine eares, when instantly a great and innumerable multitude of <hi>Devils</hi> in severall and horrible shapes did fill the <hi>Hall;</hi> All of them together saluted me, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting any manner of respects, <hi>Protesting that I was with great error and madnesse</hi> drawne on to descend in <hi>a place not to be frequented by the living:</hi> That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever such my boldnesse deserved death, yet had they

                           <p>The <hi>Bridge</hi> being passed &amp;, going forward &amp; praysing God, I did see a farre off high and well fortified walls, shut up with a <hi>gate</hi> seeming all of <hi>gold &amp; precious stones:</hi> But when I came nearer within <hi>two thousand paces of it,</hi> I might perceive the <hi>Gate</hi> to open, and found thence proceeding a most fragrant <hi>Odour,</hi> no lesse than if all the <hi>Spices</hi> in the world were burnt, I did also see comming to meet me an innumerable company of men in a curious <hi>order,</hi> clad in vestures of <hi>Golden palmes,</hi> &amp; carrying <hi>Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and burning <hi>Tapers:</hi> which blessed Company recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me with incredible joy and kindnesse, bringing me with them into that <hi>Pallace,</hi> praysing God with a most heavenly harmony.</p>
                           <p>Afterwards two <hi>Archbishops</hi> walking with me shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me the place, which surpassed all imagination: For first I was taken with the <hi>Largenesse of the soile,</hi> the bounds whereof could not bee seene, it being <hi>brighter than the Sunne,</hi> having greene <hi>fields</hi> and here and there adorned with pleasant <hi>Gardens,</hi> and many <hi>Trees</hi> placed in <hi>squares</hi> yeelding most pleasant fruit, and watered with pure <hi>Rivolets sliding by,</hi> with a pleasant <hi>murmure.</hi> The place was apparelled with fragrant <hi>flowers</hi> in curious knots, fife <hi>Arbours</hi> and <hi>walkes</hi> ingeniously layd out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the very aspect of the men much delighted mee, each like <hi>Religious men</hi> placed in their ranks, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with many dignities. There appeared in glory, <hi>Popes, Cardinals, Archbishops,</hi> and others innumerable according to their places which each carryed while they lived. There great Companies of <hi>Women</hi> sitting in their seates. It was pleasant to behold <hi>Men Crowned</hi>
                              <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59868:46"/>
like <hi>Kings,</hi> and shining brighter than <hi>starres:</hi> Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Merits</hi> excelling others in glory, as one starre doth another: All of them enjoyed great <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie and pleasure,</hi> not onely in themselves, but rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the happinesse of their fellowes, and receiving new content, that the <hi>infernall Spirits</hi> were overcome by me.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes they walked together <hi>two, three,</hi> or as they pleased together: <hi>Talking, Dancing, Singing</hi> alwayes, <hi>praysing</hi> IESVS their <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer:</hi> So that I could never thinke that any thing were more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired than this <hi>Happy place,</hi> eyther in respect of it <hi>selfe,</hi> or the sweetnesse of the <hi>smell,</hi> or the <hi>pleasant fruit,</hi> or <hi>delightfull Harmony</hi> or the <hi>varietie</hi> and <hi>excellencie of all things.</hi> Heere is no distemper of <hi>Heate</hi> or <hi>Cold,</hi> no <hi>sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> no <hi>perturbation</hi> of <hi>minde:</hi> lastly nothing but <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>tranquilitie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Being thus refreshed with the sweetnesse of the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>Archbishops</hi> spake thus unto me. This that earthly <hi>Paradise,</hi> whence our first Parents were expelled, having disobeyed the Command of God, by whose sinne wee also their <hi>posteritie</hi> were defiled, and cast out of Gods heritage, untill that great <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> of the <hi>Eternall Father</hi> tooke upon him <hi>humane Nature,</hi> and <hi>was made MAN</hi> of the VIRGIN MARY, and expiated the <hi>punishment</hi> due for that <hi>sinne</hi> of our <hi>first Parents. He himselfe</hi> being <hi>without any spot of sinne,</hi> and among other <hi>Sacraments</hi> hee did iustitute <hi>Baptisme,</hi> by which we are washed from the spot of <hi>Originall sinee;</hi> But because through our frayltie we fall often, that we should not everlastingly perish, he ordayned also the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of <hi>Penance:</hi> by which if wee doe not satisfie for our sinnes in this life, hee hath further appointed a <hi>Purgatory</hi> after, as thou now seest. Yet herein also is this <hi>helpe</hi> afforded us, that the more carefull they that are alive are of us, in their prayers for us, the sooner are wee delivered from these torments, or at the least the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59868:47"/>
paines made easier which we suffer, and when any one is freed out of prison, he is met and entertayned in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as thou hast beene.</p>
                           <p>After this the <hi>Archbishops</hi> brought me up to an <hi>high Mountaine,</hi> whence they commanded me to looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, which seemed to mee most pleasing to the eye, being of <hi>a Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> colour. Then they: <hi>This is the Gate of Heaven,</hi> whence is sent downe to us that <hi>Heavenly Manna,</hi> the meate which the Lord hath appointed for his <hi>Elect,</hi> sweeter than any <hi>Nectar</hi> or <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosia,</hi> which words scarcely ended a great <hi>splendor like a Flame descended, filling all the place,</hi> whose beames stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into mine head, I found an incredible sweetnesse in my bowels, and in my <hi>minde</hi> a greater <hi>joy</hi> than can be expressed.</p>
                           <p>Then the <hi>Archbishops: Thou seest what felicitie the just enjoy, and what calamities abide the wicked. It is now time that thou returne againe into the world:</hi> where <hi>see that thou order the rest of thy life, that thou mayest obtaine blessednesse: Nothing shall hurt thee in thy returne, or cast the least feare into thee:</hi> So they brought me out of the <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Paradise,</hi> I being very unwilling, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding teares for griefe.</p>

               <hi>King of France, there succeeded in the yeare 1328. Phillip of Valois,</hi> to whom in <hi>England Edward the third was Contemporary,</hi> this <hi>Edward</hi> began his Reigne <hi>anno</hi> 1326. two yeares before, and dyed in the <hi>fifty first</hi> yeare of his Reigne. To him succeeded <hi>Richard the second</hi> here spoken off: And in a Parliament held <hi>anno</hi> 1385. which was the <hi>ninth</hi> year of <hi>Richards</hi> Reigne, <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn Stow Chron.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59868:56"/>
was said to be: for <hi>from the French King he brought letters to Richard, and from Richard to the Earle of March then Deputy:</hi> But deducting <hi>two yeares</hi> from the <hi>fifty and one yeares</hi> of <hi>Edward the third,</hi> the remaine is <hi>fortie nine,</hi> to which adde <hi>nine yeares</hi> of <hi>Richards</hi> Reigne, at which time the Earle of <hi>March</hi> was <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> it maketh up <hi>fifty and eight</hi> yeares, so that by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation this Pilgrimage must have beene 58. <hi>yeares</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this yeare of <hi>Richard,</hi> and as many before the <hi>Earle of March;</hi> for so long is there between the yeare 1328. &amp; 1386. The time of his being <hi>Deputy,</hi> and how these things will hang together, I see not.</p>
            <p>Neither can this be supposed to be such a <hi>mistake,</hi> as that the <hi>figures</hi> might be mis printed 1328. for 1386. for in the Margent of that <hi>Legend</hi> the figures are 1328. but in the body of the Discourse it is thus at large; <note n="d" place="margin">Prosiciscor anno post ortu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Domini, vigesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo octavo su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra millessimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trecentessimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Philip.

               <hi>I did set forward in the yeare after the birth of our Lord, One thousand three hundred twenty and eight.</hi> And the same Author in another booke set out since relating the same story, hath it in the same words at large, <note n="e" place="margin">Anno Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni milessimo trecentessino octavo. <hi>Philip.

               <hi>In the yeare one thousand three hundred twenty and eight,</hi> not in figures.</p>
            <p>But it is yet more inconsistent. For <hi>Richard</hi> King of England, is said to be Sonne in Law to the then <hi>French King,</hi> unto whom Letters recommendatory are brought by the <hi>Viscount</hi> from his Father in Law. True it is that <hi>Richard</hi> was affianced unto <hi>Isabell</hi> daughter of <hi>Charles the sixt of France,</hi> but that was so farre from being in the yeare <hi>One thousand three hundred twentie and eight,</hi> that is was in <hi>the year one thousand three hundred ninty six</hi> that is <hi>sixty and eight</hi> years after. Neither could it be when the Earle of <hi>March</hi> was Deputie of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was about the yeare <hi>One thousand three hundred eightie and five, nine</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> yeares before: so that either <hi>Richard</hi> was not Son in Law to the <hi>French King,</hi> or the Earle of <hi>March</hi> was not <hi>Deputy,</hi> when the <hi>Viscount</hi> came into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Neither is it lesse absurd which is added, <hi>That
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59868:56"/>
the Earle of March, the Deputy having received the King and Queene of Englands letters, did honourably receive him.</hi> For what Letters could the <hi>Queen</hi> write? shee was but <hi>seven years old,</hi> when he was (as I said) affianced to <hi>Richard:</hi> and not full <hi>twelve,</hi> when by the Lord <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Piercy</hi> she was brought backe into France after <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> death. Neither could she write to the <hi>Earle of March</hi> being Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> unlesse we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her to have written <hi>three or foure yeares</hi> before she was borne.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>foolishly</hi> is the <hi>Earle of March</hi> made to be <hi>Richards brothers Sonne, Richard</hi> having no <hi>Brother,</hi> he being the sole surviving Sonne of <hi>Edward the black Prince:</hi> And <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> being the great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child of <hi>Edward the Third</hi> descended from <hi>Philip</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lionell,</hi> third sonne of <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> which <hi>Lionell</hi> was brother to that <hi>Edward the black Prince,</hi> and <hi>Uncle to Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that considering this Masse of absurdities from first to last, any one I suppose may well guesse how false this <hi>Legend</hi> is: and this Imposture may give just cause to suspect this and all others of the like Fables. But I much wonder that the translator <hi>O Sullevan,</hi> whose faculty was singular that way, did not helpe out the matter better than he hath done: but either he saw it not, or if he did, he thought it dangerous to stirre in it, and to raise up any doubts, supposing it might as well passe after, as hitherto it had without discovery; thinking it may be that none would so farre question it.</p>
            <p>Neither could <hi>O Sullevan</hi> be so simple, as to conceive such a childish dreame could passe without some obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: therefore to prevent it, he laboureth to cast a mist before his Readers eyes. <hi>If this History,</hi> saith he, <hi>be in any thing,</hi> which we have shewed in many things, if not in all, <hi>hard to be beleeved;</hi> what then? <hi>Let him that desireth to be satisfied reade</hi> Dionysius Carthusianus, <hi>who reporteth like Histories of others who returned from this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59868:57"/>
Purgatory.</hi> But what are like Histories to this? what if they be as false as this? But <hi>Dionysius,</hi> saith he, <hi>doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the matter at large, answering all Arguments and doubts that can be made against it.</hi> This indeed is to some purpose if so it prove: but I rather suspect this to be <hi>O Sullevans</hi> cunning to direct the Reader, and take him off from prying too neare into that of the Viscount, yet least we may seeme to prejudicate him; let us heare what <hi>Dionysius</hi> doth say to this purpose.</p>
            <p>First (saith he) <hi>Dionysius confirmeth this by the like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> He indeed among other Histories, proving that <hi>Soules departed are purged in such flames,</hi> giveth us one of <hi>Tondall an Irish Knight,</hi> who lived about <hi>Henry of Saltry's dayes.</hi>

               <hi>He (Balaeus</hi> speaking of that <hi>Henry) flourished then when Tondall the Carthusian in Ireland being revived returned to his owne from Purgatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting visions;</hi> calling him a <hi>Carthusian,</hi> whom in others we reade a <hi>Knight:</hi> it may be as <hi>Owen</hi> the Knight putting himselfe into the <hi>Cistercian Order,</hi> so he into the <hi>Carthusians.</hi> Neither were they farre distant from each other; both <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Tondall</hi> being in K. <hi>Stevens</hi> dayes, this last being about the twelfth yeare of his Reigne, both which administred abundant matter for <hi>Henry</hi> to write.</p>

               <hi>Tondall</hi> is by an Angell conducted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59868:57"/>
into Purgatory, where it saw many strange things, among the rest, <hi>a beast of incredible greatnesse,</hi> which may easily be believed; <hi>whose mouth seemed capable of nine thousand armed men,</hi> just nine thousand, <hi>within whom were many thousands of men and women grievously tormented,</hi> this was a thing not observed by <hi>Owen</hi> the Knight, or that our <hi>Viscount</hi> (for this Purgatory is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to these great Titles of <hi>Viscounts</hi> and <hi>Knights</hi> for the upholding of the credit of it) but to goe on. This Soule of <hi>Tondall</hi> is brought to a place, <hi>where over a lake there was a bridge two miles long, and but one palme broad, full of sharpe iron nailes, under this bridge there was a large and tempestuous Lake, in which were terrible beasts roaring, and desiring nothing more than to devoure Soules.</hi> Then the Angell that did conduct this soule, said to it; <hi>Thou must goe over that bridge, neither shalt thou goe empty, but must leade over an untamed cow which thou didst steale from thy God-father,</hi> for which good service it may be he was knighted. <hi>Then said the Soule. How I can I, miserable that I am, doe this in such danger, and where I cannot stand?</hi> how ridiculous? surely the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor forgetting he was discoursing of a soule, but <hi>the Soule seeing that the thing must be done, began to draw and struggle with the Cow, going therewith upon the bridge; for when the Soule stood, the Cow was downe, and when it was up, the Soule fell downe; so by turnes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times up and sometimes downe, untill they came to the midst of the bridge,</hi> &amp;c. whom we meane not to follow.

Lastly, as before was shewed, this onely delay and keeping souls from Glory, which is cal'd the punishment of losse, doth in them exceed all the paines of this present life: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Soules have not the beatificall fruition of God in this earthly Paradise, then are they in most grievous paine.</hi> Hitherto that <hi>Objection</hi> which seemeth to me at once both to strike wholly at that <hi>Paradise,</hi> as a thing utterly unusefull, and tacitely also to overthrow <hi>Purgatory</hi> it selfe; for the use of Purgatory is, <hi>that satisfaction may be made for the punishment of sinne, not for the guilt.</hi>

               <hi>It nothing hindreth</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that in that place cited</hi> Vincentius Belluacensis <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the said History for this cause principally, [That Soules freed from Purgatory doe not immediately fly into Heaven: but remaine for some time in the terrestriall Paradise, as in a middle place of rest, and that after at the appointed time, they goe into their Countrey] for there is none that I could read, who have written of this thing, that make this to be a Purgatory for Soules separated from their bodies, which should being purged presently fly into Heaven. But they say that it is a Purgatory for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who being truely penitent, and entring thereinto; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering also the grievous paines thereof, either by a reall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59868:61"/>
passion or imaginary apprehension, they shall be purged from all the punishments due to their sinnes. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as infinite others in this life doe satisfie for the paines which their sinnes deserve, either by fasting, or other works of Penance, or by application of Indulgences: who, if they shall not commit new sins, and should so goe out of the world, they fly immediately into heaven, without passing through any other Purgatory: which opinion is so probable and catholike, that it cannot be accused of any error, if not by him who is herein ignorant.</hi> Thus <hi>Pennottus,</hi> whereby it seemeth that <hi>Antoninus</hi> needed not so farre to have troubled himselfe to prove <hi>S. Patricks Purgatory to be onely for the living, and not for the Soules separated from their bodies.</hi> And as little need had <hi>Pennottus</hi> to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so much paines for it as he: yet not as he would have it, because none ever opposed it; and therefore was it wisely done of him to restraine it to <hi>his owne Reading:</hi> for we finde <hi>O Sullevan</hi> mainely contending for it, and indeed the very relations of <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> thither import no lesse; For if they make <hi>S. Patricks Purgatory</hi> to be onely the <hi>Cave,</hi> on <hi>first Entrance,</hi> I suppose they will finde very few that will say, <hi>That</hi> to be the place of <hi>Torments,</hi> expiating the punishment of sinne: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pilgrims were driven to goe much further into (I know not what) places of paine &amp; torture, and there also to have suffered corporally such punishments, as were thought sufficient for to purge them; where I hope they will not say that these infinite numbers seene there tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, were all <hi>living men,</hi> but rather <hi>soules separated from their bodies;</hi> how then is it onely for the living? but in respect of <hi>Vincentius,</hi> both <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Pennottus</hi> might have spared their labour as unnecessary: <hi>Vincentius</hi> as was said, wholly opposing <hi>the staying of Soules in the terrestriall Paradise after they be freed from Purgatorie:</hi> and what else doth <hi>Pennotus</hi> conclude here? but at last he joyneth hands with him adding further, that if men in this world satisfying for their sinnes by fasting, or
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59868:61"/>
other works of penance; or having the benefit of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies should immediately dye without committing new sinnes, they immediately fly into Heaven; without passing through any Purgatory, or staying in the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall Paradise, which must be if they passe forthwith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. And this he sheweth to be the Catholike and soundest opinion, being without any error, not to be contradicted, but by ignorant men: what then shall we judge of those <hi>Archbishops</hi> in Paradise who taught the contrary? Shall we accuse them of ignorance? or thinke their opinion neither <hi>probable</hi> nor <hi>Catholike;</hi> if we did it were no more than could well be justified. And of what use should that Earthly Paradise be, for receiving Soules purged; for if Soules be purged, by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like opinion, they fly immediately into Heaven in the instant of their death, why not then as well being fully purged, as they say they are, in Purgatory? which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if they will allow with <hi>Vincentius,</hi> which also none but ignorant men will contradict, saith <hi>Pennotus,</hi> That <hi>Paradise</hi> must vanish, and all the dreames and Fables thereof must be foolish, fantasticall, and all to be rejected, and with it, those fictions and pilgrimages before spoken must also of necessity fall with it to the ground, as <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> thence justly concluded.</p>
            <p>Hitherto have we heard onely one <hi>Objection</hi> made against this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the <hi>Legends</hi> of it: whereunto <hi>O Sullevan</hi> promised we should have received full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from <hi>Dionysius,</hi> but if this be too hard, what doth he then say to the rest? many other doubts are moved to him: to which he ingeniously confesseth himselfe unable to answer, professing himselfe more desirous to be taught by others than to teach.

            <p>To conclude then; as in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the <hi>Reverence</hi> gained to this <hi>Purgatory</hi> did first proceed from him, who was supposed the <hi>Author</hi> of it, <hi>S. Patricke;</hi> and yet with what uncertainty that could
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59868:65"/>
be beleeved was there shewed, so here we finde it much more esteemed for it selfe, out of the opinion of the strange effects of it, (Certainely strange if true) and that accompanied with so many strange sights, as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be seene: both strong motives to satisfie either <hi>Curiosity</hi> and <hi>Devotion;</hi> all which granted, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was it to finde it so much looked after, and so much flocked unto from farre and neare. And yet with what foppery? with how many contradictions? with how great an heap of absurdities this was followed? hath been in this Chapter considered.</p>
            <p>So that again and again I say it, it cannot be sufficiently admired, that not onely the multitude, but men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise rationall and learned, should be so drawn on, as to relish and digest such grosse Fables and Fooleries, and still to reverence so poore and base a thing as this <hi>Cave</hi> is: as if men were resolved to be missed; or <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 18. 2 Thess. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Not receiving the love of the Truth, but holding it in unrighteousnesse, God justly sending such strong delusions that should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet cannot we judge thus of all; as if all of them had purposely shut their eyes, and captivated their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so to be led on blind-foulded, and against <hi>Reason</hi> to beleeve all reports concerning it. For it cannot be thought, that in so long a time and among so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Pilgrims, there being so many eyes to pry into it, it should be possible but that some more ingenious than others should at last discover the Imposture. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as this <hi>Purgatory</hi> did grow to that great height: so did it groane under its own burthen, being first discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to some <hi>few,</hi> after to <hi>all;</hi> and lastly, (and that more than once) deservedly demolished. Of all which more fully in the following Chapter.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>How this Purgatory did begin to decline, and fall from its esteeme, being first suspected, and found Fabulous, and lastly quite demolished.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly sought after the <hi>beginning of</hi> this <hi>Purgatory,</hi> And after observed the <hi>Rising</hi> and <hi>increasing</hi> of it; <hi>Order</hi> now leadeth to take notice of its <hi>continuance:</hi> which if we should begin with the <hi>Time of Saint Patrickes converting this Kingdome</hi> Anno 432. (unto which it is commonly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) with a supposed continuance thereof untill the yeare one thousand sixe hundred thirtie two, the peryod of its dissolution; It would make up a computation of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand two hundred yeares. A time surely wonderfull (if true) for so grosse an Imposture to stand without disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, even potent States having suffered many alterations in a shorter time; and among others, none more than this Kingdome of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which also maketh the matter yet more strange, that this <hi>Cave</hi> should notwithstanding subsist a midst so many combustions: But hee that shall observe the severall passages, shall finde it to have its sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible declinings: and that, as it did please God to open the eyes of men, and to disperse the mists of ignorance: So that now by the full Sun-shine of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> it is quite vanished without any memoriall, which is the thing we are next to search after.</p>
            <p>Neyther must the matter be so taken, as if all this were done in an instant; but as it did rise, so fell it by certaine steps and degrees: Yea the very rising not being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tottering, and its progresse followed with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all staggering, which notwithstanding it be evident out of what is before declared, yet for the more cleare mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation thereof, I shall reduce all that hath beene said unto these three heads, wherein as it were in one view,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59868:66"/>
the rising and falling thereof may at once be apparant.</p>
            <p>The first step was out of the beliefe of having the <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of it, from <hi>Saint Patricke</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> of the <hi>Irish,</hi> as being a meanes of the <hi>conversion</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> Which were it true, deserved much of that respect and flooking unto it which hath beene afforded it, and as a memorable and ancient monument and memoriall thereof ought it still to be preserved. But this hath fayled it. <hi>Saint Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickes age</hi> would not owne it, neyther had it a name for many ages, even seven hundred yeares after. And when in the yeare one thousand one hundred and forty it began to peepe up, it would not be acknowledged by some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons of that time, by whom <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Saltry</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to bee informed of it, whereas his <hi>Relators</hi> for it spake but by heare-say; and so weake was the report, that howsoever it seemed then to get head, yet within fortie five yeares it is husht againe, and no more newes for a while heard of it; I meane in <hi>Iocelines times,</hi> in the yeare one thousand one hundred eighty five, of which before at large.</p>
            <p>Secondly it having notwithstanding these rubs againe recovered its motion, and gained a <hi>Name</hi>

               <hi>Truely</hi> (faith he) <hi>not withstanding that Bonaventure</hi> in 4. dist. 20. par. 1. quaest: ult. <hi>suspecteth all, reported of the said Purgatory to be fabulous, yet he saith that S. Patrick obtained that one should be punished in a certaine place of the earth, out of which it was fabulously reported that Purgatory was there.</hi> This you see is confessed, but <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nottus</hi> his glosse followeth. <hi>Where</hi> (saith he) <hi>you see that the holy Doctor denieth not but that S. Patrick might obtaine, that one might be purged in that place: But onely he rejecteth that Fable of those, who affirme that Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was there, as justly it was to be rejected: for they that spake of S. Patricks Purgatory, say not that it is a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of Soules, wherein they, by the ordinary appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, are purged in the life to come; but to be a speciall Purgatory for the living, in which men even in this life being truely penitent, may by the speciall favour of God, satisfie the punishments due to their sinnes.</hi> Where, what <hi>Bonaventure</hi> speaketh only <hi>on report,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging his own Iudgement, <hi>Pennottus</hi> delivereth <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,</hi> as if the Doctor hath granted it, <hi>that one should be so purged.</hi> Neither is the word (as <hi>Pennottus</hi> would have it) <hi>purged,</hi> but <hi>punished;</hi> agreeing better with that of <hi>Cambrensis</hi> before: that <hi>S. Patrick</hi> made request to satisfie them who denyed the <hi>paines of Hell,</hi> and that God would grant some <hi>visible demonstration</hi> thereof to that people. Neither was that such as was to continue in all ages; But as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> here terminating it in some one person, who was so to be punished, as an example to others: Neither is this so confidently delivered by the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59868:67"/>
Doctor, as if it were done, but (as <hi>Pennottus</hi> relateth it) that such a thing might be done; and if it were granted to be done; a <hi>particular fact</hi> would be farre short for a <hi>perpetuall establishment</hi> of it for a <hi>place of penance,</hi> much lesse for a <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And for <hi>Pennottus</hi> his evasion, <hi>that the Doctor did therefore reject all this as a Fable, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that it was meant, that the Purgatory of Soules was there, where they say S. Patricks Purgatory is:</hi> which <hi>Pennottus</hi> saith, none doth affirme. <hi>First,</hi> we have no cause to thinke the Doctor so to have imagined, but rather that <hi>no Purgatory</hi> was there, for the question is of one certaine man then living, whom <hi>S. Patrick</hi> is reported to have had punished in a certaine place in the earth. Next <hi>Pennottus</hi> doth say no more here; then what he saith of <hi>Vincentius</hi> in the same case, of which before: for that the <hi>Purgatory of Soules</hi> is <hi>under</hi> or <hi>within the Cave,</hi> hath been shewed to have been a received opinion among his Authors, <note n="i" place="margin">Supra pag. 108.

               <hi>The Denne of S.

I sent to search for the said Boate, which was found and brought unto me.

I caused to land some men upon a little Island where Fryars doe inhabit neare unto the other Island which is called</hi> S.

All the fore said number of persons, I have caused to be put safe to shore: which was done without any kinde of violence: For seeing the Priests and Fryars had left the Islland; and carryed with them all manner of Provision and goods that therein was, the people were willing and desirous to be put on shore. The which being done, I did cause the Boate, which was the safeguarde of the Island to be drawne on shore, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the same unto the friends and servants of one</hi> Master Magrath, <hi>unto whom the Boate, Island and Countrie doth belong, and told them that it was your Lordships directions, that the same should not bee med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withall, nor the Island any more frequented untill his Majesties pleasure were further knowne; And that your Lordships would signifie the same more at large. All things being thus fairely done, I hope your Lordships will not dislike that I adventured my selfe alone to doe that which was trusted unto me and others. And I am well assured if I had slipt that occasion, your intentions should not have beene executed. So humbly desiring to

be excused for what is done amisse, I take leave, and will ever remaine.</hi>

                     <hi>From them I received answer, that they might well come alone, but could get none to accompany them, or any labourer or tooles upon any tearmes: And that an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were not able to execute the Commission in a fortnight; notwithstanding whereof, I required them againe to keepe the day, and assured them howsoever that I my selfe would be present, and accordingly I came to the place appointed the 24. day, with some twenty able men in my company any well armed: and brought with us all sorts of tooles fitting for the service.</hi>

                     <hi>on the other side came no better accompanied, than with one serving man; and shewed himselfe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unwilling, and refused to enter the Island. I had many discouragements my selfe. For first I was forced on a rainy day, on a bleake place without any shelter to horse or man, three houres before we could have the Boate. The winde in the meane time did rise, and there was none could take in hand to guide the Boate through dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rockes lying betweene the maine and the Island. Againe we were certified that we might be hardly put to it for fault of victuals, if we tooke them not in with our selves: for the winde would sometimes blow ten dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so strong, that no Boate durst venture to goe out or in; notwithstanding all which discouragements, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to goe in without victuals, and stayed in the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land till the service was done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first thing I searched diligently after, was the</hi> Cave, <hi>wherein I remembred your Grace enjoyned me to digge to the very foundations, and leave no corner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought, and so I did: I caused to digge about it on all sides, till I came to the Rocke, but found no appearance of any secret passage, eyther to the</hi> Chappell <hi>or to the</hi> Lough: <hi>neyther would the nature of the ground suffer it, in a word this</hi> Cave <hi>was a poore beggerly hole, made with some stones, layd together with mens hands without any great Art: and after covered with Earth, such as husbandmen make to keepe a few Hogs from the raine.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>When I could finde nothing there, I undermined the</hi> Chappell, <hi>which was well covered with shingles, and brought all downe together. Then wee brake downe the</hi> Circles <hi>and</hi> Saints Beds, <hi>which were like so many Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and so pulled downe some great Irish houses. Thus
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59868:75"/>
when I had defaced all saving one Irish house: I came out of the Island my selfe, &amp; left one halfe of my men behind to pull that downe also so soone as they should see me lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not sooner; lest if by a storme we were driven backe, wee might want a place to shelter us.</hi>

But that I doe not much stand upon, in regard I have obeyed the Command of the State, and punctually also done what your Grace did enjoyne: whose directions I shall be ever ready to follow, and shall ever remaine.</hi>

Here then we see the truth of those relations of men passing <hi>through this Cave into Purgatory, Hell, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:</hi> See how much the report of the <hi>Viscount</hi> (of which before) deserveth credit, <hi>That in the Cave the ground was so unsound and shaking, that it seemed unable to beare a man;</hi> and that therefore <hi>he stept backe, fearing to fall into some unexpected depth and abysse.</hi> Whereas the place is <hi>Rockie</hi> not <hi>Boggie.</hi> If this be not the same place, why are men borne in hand that it is?
