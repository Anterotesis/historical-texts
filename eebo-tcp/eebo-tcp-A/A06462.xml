            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey say, it is a point of
a prowde vanitie, or a
stubburne foly, to kepe
sure and certaine, what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>someuer
is ons sayde,
always, it semeth not to wise men,
that a promis shulde be sticked by,
in as moche there maye chaunce
greater causes to breke a promys,
then the reasons be, why promisse
shulde be performed. As if I haue
sayd, that I wyll suppe with you:
hit is not inoughe to bynde me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
all chaunces. I may fall
sycke, I may haue at home some
necessary impediment, the wether
may so fal, that it is no going out,
many casualties may happen, that
were not in mynde, whan such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysse
was made. Wherfore wyse
men say, in all makyng of promes,
there be euer vnderstonde some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
<pb facs="tcp:22915:3"/>
exceptions, such as be these:
If I can, If I maye, If it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
If no greater cause hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to let me. By the whiche excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
a promes neuer byndeth a
man ferther, than is accordinge to
be obserued and kepte.</p>
            <p>¶If I thought (my frende Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Walker) that you wold take myne
excuse by the sayde exceptions, I
wold rather by them escape my pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>messe,
that I haue made to you,
than I wold fulfyl it. For whan I
sodenlye agreed to your requeste,
that was to haue me write to you
the way of dyenge well: I consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derid
not at that tyme, what the
thynge was. After I percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
more difficulte in it, then was
mete for my poore witte, specially
beynge (as you maye see me) other
wise occupied, in such studies as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22915:3"/>
appertayne to my leasure: and of
shortly this lesson to lerne the way
of dyenge well, hath nede to haue
a mayster, the whiche knowethe
both what our life is, and what the
losse of the same is. Nor no man
in mynde can effectuously teache
the way to dye well, excepte he be
one that knoweth the way to lyue
wel. And plainely the mater requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a philosophers stomake and a
sadde. For suche a one as Marcus
Cato was, were a man mete to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trete
this thynge: he knewe what
valure ley in deathe, the whiche he
sought bothe with swerde, and his
nayles, tearynge out his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles.</p>
            <p>¶I wolde thynke a Catulus or
a Mercula shoulde speake lustely
to you of dethe, seinge they shewed
theyr couragious harte nothynge
<pb facs="tcp:22915:4"/>
to esteme life, when the time requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
eyther to dye with honour, or
to lyue with shame. These men
and suche other wolde shewe you
the waye to go to deathe, longe be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
death came to you. But none
of all the paynymes canne eyther
with worde or with ensamples of
theyr actes declare this thynge so
trewly and effectually, as may he
that is exercised in Christes philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophye,
a Paule, or a Peter, or a
Hierom shulde here in speke more
lyuely, than al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> subtyl clerkes of
the olde grekes. Yet to me, for my
parte, it is an harde thyng, eyther
to play with you one of this sorte,
or of that sorte. It passeth my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to speake to you eyther lyke
Socrates, or lyke Chrysostome.
So that if the sayde exceptions be
with you admittid in a promis ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kynge,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22915:4"/>
I may trewely denye you
the performaunce of, my graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge,
in as moche when I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
you this thynge, there was vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstandyd,
if I coulde, &amp; if it were
conuenient: I nother can well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
this waye of dyenge, nor yet
me thynke, it is not conuenient for
me, lyuyng in this commen course
of the worldely folke, to speake of
deth so ernestly, as a monke of the
Charter house shoulde and myght
do. But by cause I knowe your
importune desire, to be so set vpon
this thyng, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nedes you wyll haue
me say somewhat herein: I wyll
praye you so to rede me, as the tale
not onely to be wrytten of me for
you, but that I my selfe am also
an auditor of the same, and as mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
shall I enforce to folowe the
counsayle, that in my sayenge I
<pb facs="tcp:22915:5"/>
aduyse you, as thoughe the hole
worke pertayned only to my selfe.
Wherin take this note for your
comfortes, that I write nothynge
to you, that I wyshe not were in
my owne power to execute. Thus
I with you, and you with me both
of vs fast yoked to gethers, let vs
endeuour our selfes to be in dede
suche men as we commende and
prayse. For as it is shame to speke
one thinge and to thinke an other,
so it is a more shame to write holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and to lyue worldlye. And as
great a rebuke there is in him that
can here and praise good sayinges
but doo there after he wyll not.</p>
            <p>Now than let vs not speke only of
the way to dye well, but in effecte
let vs indeuer our mindes to haue
the frute of this lesson, to make in
dede a good ende of our lyfe. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22915:5"/>
here nowe withoute any ferther
proces I wyll begynne to pay you
my dette, and shortelye you shall
knowe my mynde howe you maye
dye well.</p>
            <p>¶As I was bethynkynge me, to
wryte some thyng of this mater to
the satisfyinge of your desyre, I
torned a boke, where my memorie
gaue me, to be a story of one called
Canius, that lyued vnder the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante
Caligula Cesar. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
beside his hye lernyng was a
man of a great spirite, the whiche
he wel declared in the maner of ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
his deth. It chansed hym to
falle out for a certayne cause with
the sayde tyrante, and many sore
wordes were betwene them: at the
laste whan the tone was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
from the tother, this empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in his fierse ire sayde: Well
<pb facs="tcp:22915:6"/>
thou fole, make mery if thou wylt,
for I haue poynted the within few
dayes to be slayne. Therat Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
turned him with lowe courtesy
and sayd: My most gentill prince
I hartely thanke you.</p>
            <p>¶This answere came from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
stomacke, whereby he shewed
the mad ragis of the cruell tyrant
to be so ferre intollerable, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hym dethe was to be reckened
for a benefit and a good tourne:
wherfore he thanked hym for his
offer, as for a specyall rewarde.
And great merueil men had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this Philosopher, howe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he was after this tyrantes thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenynge.
There were .x. dayes gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of respite, before he shuld dye,
the whiche tyme he so passed, that
he neuer semed to be in lesse care,
nor to haue his mynde in better
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22915:6"/>
quietnes.</p>
            <p>¶Whan the daye came of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
the kinges geyler &amp; hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne
wente abowte the towne
with a greatte companye of them
that shoulde suffer death, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
passing by this Canius house,
they called hym to be broughte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
forth amongest the other, at the
whiche tyme Canius was play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
atte the chestes with one of
his companions, and hearynge
theym make haaste, he rose and
telled his men, sayinge to his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panion:
Loke nowe that after my
deathe you lye not, nor make no
false crakes, that you haue wonne
this game. There with also he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenid
to the gailer and sayde: I
pray you bere witnes, that I haue
one man in this game more than
my felowe hath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22915:7"/>
¶In this wyse this philosopher
playde with deathe, and shorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his quiete harte gaue a foule
checke mate to the tyrantes cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
he shewed hym selfe to be in
spirite as farre aboue all kynges
violente power, as these myghtye
princes thynke to haue a stronge
dominon ouer all theyr subiectes.
The frendis and familiars of this
philosopher were very sorowfull,
bewaylynge the losse of suche a
man, to whome: what meane you
quod he? Why be you sadde?</p>
            <p>Why mourne you for me? Is hit
not your study to knowe, whether
the soule of man be mortall or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalle?
The trouthe of this
harde question I nowe shal lerne:
and nowe shall I see the trouthe
of all our dowtes of heuen and
of god.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:22915:7"/>
¶Thus talkynge with his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
he came to the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and there a lyttell, whylest
other were hedded, he stode styll in
a musynge dumpte. What thinke
you now good Canius, quod one
of his frendes? Whervpon nowe
muse you so ernestly? Mary (quod
he) I haue determynedde with my
selfe to marke wel, whether in this
short pange of death my soule shal
perceyue and feele, that he goeth
oute of my body. This poynte I
fully entende to take hede of: and
if I can, I wyll surely brynge you
and the reste of my felowes word,
what I felte, and what is the state
of our soules.</p>
            <p>¶Here was a wonderful caulme
stomake in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myddest of so stormy
a tempest, this mans mynde was
worthye of an euer lastynge lyfe,
<pb facs="tcp:22915:8"/>
that was not onely to the deathe
studious of knowlege, but also in
the selfe death founde occasion of
lernynge. It was not possyble
for any mannes mynde to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his studye longer, or to a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poynte than this noble philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
dyd.</p>
            <p>¶This story and certayne other
lyke, maken me often to reason
with my selfe, what a strength of
knowlege is in mannes brayne, to
serche and to fynde by hym selfe
the truthe, if he enforce his wittes
to lerne. For this Canius &amp; many
other were not taught of Christe,
as we now be, they had not the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of faythe, the whiche shewe
the vndoubtefulle waie to come
to the perfyghte knowelege of all
preuy misteres, they were not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forted
with the preachyng of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22915:8"/>
sonne to sette lyttel by this life
as we nowe be. They were not
plucked to conceyue a loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
aboue nature: as the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
draweth vs from this worlde
to the beholding of an other place,
wher vertu receiueth her crowne.
Wherfore to me hit is no smalle
cause of marueiling, when I here
suche ensamples of naturall men,
that by them selfe coulde in suche
a maner rise aboue theyr nature,
in settynge lyttell by that thynge,
that naturallye euerye creature
mooste abhorreth and feareth (for
deathe is the thynge that in this
worlde by nature is made mooste
doubtfull, moste terrible, most hey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nous,
and most worthy to be fered,
to be eschewed, and by al meanes,

can be no gladnes, excepte therbe
a full truste of opteynynge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
of vertue, partelye by the
truste and fayth of a good mynde,
partely by the mercye of god, that
fulfilleth euer our insufficiency, yf

where our power lacketh,
if hit so be that our soules appere
before him in an apparell mete for

requireth a perfecte faith, and an

            <p>The mercye of god neuer failethe

hym, that fully trusteth in it: But
a full truste, can not be withoute

maye stur vp and quycken in

a chereful harte, beset with fayth,
hope, and charitie, taketh no pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifulnes
in the remembraunce of
deathe, but rather it reioysethe to
remembre, that by deathe it shall
passe to lyfe, neuer more to dye.</p>
            <p>Wherfore to dye well euer, is to
dye gladly, eyther to be ridde from
the bondes of this prison, or to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
the lybertye of heuen: bothe

euer deth is a sorowfull thynge to
the yuell lyuer, by cause he hathe
nothynge to laye before the mercy

by the feare of deathe, the tother
by the loue of this lyfe. The tone
of these foloweth the tother. For
he that loueth this lyfe, feareth to
<pb facs="tcp:22915:14"/>
dye: and he that fearethe to dye,
loueth this lyfe. Yet we may speke
of eche parte by him selfe, and first
lette vs assaye the greatteste, the
whiche is the feare of death: than
nexte after we will come to the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the which is the loue of this
lyfe. If these two blockes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of our stomakes, we shall
fynde an easye and a playne waye
to the ende of our pourpose. For
who someuer nother fereth to die,
nor loueth to tary in this lyfe, he
is redye alwaye to dye gladdely.
But to performe my promis, lette
me say somwhat of the sayde feare
and loue.</p>
            <p>¶Fyrste and chefely the feare of
death takethe awaye all gladnesse
of dyinge, and therby after myne
opinyon, no man that dyeth fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
can dye well: so that to lerne
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22915:14"/>
the waye of dyenge well we muste
lerne the way to die without feare.
And yet howe I shulde proue, that
death is not to be feared, I canne
not well telle, seinge the hole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of nature sheweth, that of all
thynges death is moost fearefull:
and to reason ageynste nature, it
were parauenture not soo harde
as vaine. For what canne reason
preuayle, if nature resiste? It is a
thynge to farre aboue mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to stryue or to wrastelle with
nature, her strengthe passeth the
myghte of our wyll, what helpe
someuer we take of reason or of
auctoritie: nother counsayle nor
commandement hath place, where
nature dothe her vttermooste. It
is none excuse to saye, that menne
feare deathe bycause they be lothe
to leaue the commodities of this
<pb facs="tcp:22915:15"/>
lyfe, or by cause they feare the thre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teninges
of purgatorie and of hel,
or els bycause they thynke apon
the sore paineful panges, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be in the tyme of deathe. Nay
these thinges make not chefely the
feare of dying, it may well be that
of suche thynges the feare is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
and made more fulle, but
there is a feare byfore and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde
all these thynges, the whiche
feare nature (I say) gyueth, as it
is wel sene in yonge chyldern, that
haue no remembraunce nother of
this lyfe, nor of the deadely pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
nor of heuen, purgatorye, or
helle. Whan we in sport threten to
caste them heedlynge out at some
hye wyndowe, they quake, trym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ware pale, shewyng playn
and euident tokens of a naturall
feare towarde dethe. And though
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22915:15"/>
by lernynge, or by a curragious
mynde, somme fewe amongest vs,
seme lyttell or nothynge to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with dethe: yet thensample of
these fewe can not take awaye the
trouthe, that nature in all the reste
worketh. For howe many be there
that onely to eschewe deathe suffre
all wretchednes, all beggarie, all
payne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in pyckynge vp crommes
of nouryshement to abyde a while
in this lyght: And the more sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that men for the moste parte
feare to dye, the greatter proffe
there is, that suche extreme poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of fere agaynst all shame shuld
not in so many daily appere, whan
dethe approcheth, onles by nature
some iuste feare were of the same.
For as the excesse of feare cometh
by weakenes of harte and lacke of
stomake, the which is worthy to be
<pb facs="tcp:22915:16"/>
rebuked for shamefull cowardnes:
so there is a meane measure offere
in dethe, that may be reckened ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and iuste, bycause nature ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it necessary.</p>
            <p>Loke you howe bothe olde and
newe stories kepe in memory their
names that appered to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare: as who saye, it is to be
wrytten for a wonder and lyke to
a myracle, beinge a thynge besyde
the course of nature, to here of a
man that can in deathe ouer come
the passion of feare, as we wonder
to here of some that lyue withoute
sustinance of meate or of drynke.
Bycause I saye hit is a naturalle
thinge to feare dethe, we greattely
meruayle of them that feare it not.
Yet reason saythe, we shoulde not
feare that thynge, the whiche we
know not, &amp; only yuel is worthy to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22915:16"/>
be feared. But seinge we knowe
not dethe, we may well by reason
doubt, whether it be yuell or good.
And nowe before we speake anye
more of feare, let vs a lyttell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder
dethe by it selfe, what thyng
it is of his owne nature, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

than departeth the soule from

soule by hym selfe that goeth from

not gyuen to any creature lyuyng

<pb facs="tcp:22915:18"/>
wyl, that nothynge in this worlde

the which soule bringeth with him
the vse of reason, a thynge that

hathe thus made vs to be in

thus teache vs, yet besyde reason
we be herein better instructed by

nowe we can not doubt, that in vs

se, not onely by reason, but moche
better by belefe, that the ymage of
god in vs is perpetuall &amp; can not
not feale any corruption, oneles
suche as our frowarde wyll maye

But lette vs comme to our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</p>
            <p>¶To speake of this bodyly deth
we nowe haue a greatte fordell in
comparison of some olde clerkes,
that were in doubte, whither there
was in man any soule besyde lyfe,
more than is in an horse or a gose.
They were in doubt whether any
thynge of manne remayned after
dethe, that myght fele or perceyue
eyther ioy or peyne. For as to the
faynyng poetes, that spake of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
gardins for good spirites,
and of dyuers sore turmentes for
vngracious sowles after this life,
most part of the olde clerkes gaue
no maner of credence: and they
that beleued other an heuen or an
hell, to be ordeyned for mens sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
yet they so beleued, that moch
doubtfulnes was in theyr belefe,
<pb facs="tcp:22915:19"/>
in asmoch as their reason suffised
not to fynde oute the certeyntie of
goddis workes. From the whiche
doubtis the vnfallible doctrine of
Christe hath now delyuered vs al,
so that as many as wyll gyue eare
to the voyce of god, they can not
mistruste their knowlege, but that
without question bothe we haue a
soule, and the same soule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
a thynge that neyther in
this worlde nor out of this worlde
can peryshe or feale any poynte of
deth, to lacke by the same any iote
of his beinge. I saye oure soules
contynually without ende shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore

it semeth true, that death conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of dyinge wel or dying yuell, or of
a good deathe or an yuel death: it
is not deathe by it selfe that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, but rather the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the maner, the fashyon, the
cause of deathe, or that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
death, or that foloweth dethe.
These be the thynges that gyueth
and taketh this name of goodnes
<pb facs="tcp:22915:21"/>
or yuelnes, As to saye that death
is good, by cause hit endethe this
synnefull lyfe, and is the meane to
passe frome this worlde to heuen:
or els when we saye, that Iudas
dyed an yuel death, it is not ment
that the departing of Iudas soule
from the bodye was yuell, but the
maner of his dyeng, was the yuel
thynge, his cursed desperation, his
dampnable mystruste of goddes
mercye, his dispitefull refusynge
grace, made his deathe yuell. The
two theues, he at the ryght hand,
and he at the lefte, bothe dyed one
kynde of deathe, bothe nayled to
crosses, both worthy for their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paces:
yet it is trouthe, that the
tone died wel in a good deth, the to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
dyed naught in an yuel deth,
not for the dethe by it selfe, wherin
was no difference, but for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22915:21"/>
of their .ii. myndes in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
of deathe. The tone repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
hym, and asked mercy, wherof
he died graciously, the tother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynued
in his blasphemynge god,
the whiche stubburne stomacke in
synne caused hym to dye vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously.
It is a thynge that folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
dethe, and is not in dethe it
selfe, whervpon we loke, when we
iuge to be a good ende or an yuel.
For by the maner of hym that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
we coniecture the state and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the soule: the whiche yf
we fynd in our fantasie to be in an
yuelle case, as in the daunger of
goddis curse, we call deathe yuel,
wherby the soule passed to come to
suche sorowe. And contrarye, yf
we thynke the soule to be in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of god, or to be redye to take
mercy, we call deth good, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:22915:22"/>
conueyde the soule to his blys.
So that by it selfe deathe remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
indifferent to be iudged of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
considerations, other a good
ende or an yuel ende.</p>
            <p>¶Nowe than we may here say, he
that feareth deathe,<note place="margin">o feare ath.</note> sheweth hym
selfe to be in doubte of his soules
state, or els to be certayne that his
soule is in goddis curse. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ferefull mynde is in them that
haue so passed this presente lyfe,
that eyther they haue doone no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge,
wherby they may hope to
be rewarded in heuen: or els they
haue done so vngratiously, that
they can haue no trust of escaping
damnable punyshement, specially
yf he be a christened man. For yf
he be not christened, and feareth to
dye, he declareth hym selfe to haue
none hygher thought of lyfe, than
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22915:22"/>
the dumbe beastes haue, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
make by the lawe of nature so
moche of their lyfes, that they can
mynde nothynge besyde, and the

flye and feare deathe, as the
worste thynge that can happen to
their state: but a man dothe hym
selfe to moch wronge, if he thynke
hym selfe in no better condicion
than be these beastes. It is not in
the dyuels power to do manne so
great hurte as this false imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

he is to haue in hym the power of

death is feared? Let it be the
workynge of nature, yet I see not
but the strength of mannes minde
fully fastened in fayth, may victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousely
ouer come all this feare,
as we fynde manye ensamples of
men that so haue done, not onelye
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22915:23"/>
of theym that haue benne helped
with faith, but also of many pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymes,
the whiche toke a courage
to dispise deathe, only of a mighty
and valiant minde to haue reason
subdewe in them the power of all
affects.</p>
            <p>¶I fynde, a lernedde paynyme
wrote that we shoulde nother care
for lyfe by it selfe, nor yet for death
by it selfe. He sayth that we shulde
care to lyue well and to dye well,
and let lyfe and deathe passe with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
care. For lyfe is not good, but
to lyue well is good.</p>
            <p>¶If paynymes haue this ryghte
consideration of lyfe and of death,
what shame is hit for Christened
men to care for death? seing Christ
whose wordes can not but be true,
so vehemently forbyddeth vs the
same, that paynymes sawe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:22915:24"/>
to be done. Ageyne, seyng this
death is so common a thynge day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our syghte, why shoulde we
we feare it. Thinges that syldom
chanse may sturre vp by their rare<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
great feare: thynges that be
euer at hande shulde by theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylartytie
and custome nousel vs
to sette lyttell by theym. Farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
he that feareth death coming
to hym, wolde feare by lykelyhode
deathe, if hit coulde be with hym,
when deathe is suche a thynge,
that other it is not yet come, or els
it is paste. For no man can saye,
that deathe is presente. So this
feare can neuer be ioyned with the
thynge that is feared. Ageyne that
thynge that euerye man maye do,
no man lightly doeth, that thinge
that no man canne helpe hym selfe
in, that for the most parte all men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22915:24"/>
do. No man almooste studyeth or
careth howe well he may lyue, but
how longe he may lyue euery man
museth, when the trouth is, that it
myghte of all men be opteyned to
lyue well, and no man can further
hymselfe to lyue longe. A lyke fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
is in our remembraunce
of deathe, we busilye labour and
enforce to dreame of deathe, the
whiche thynge we can not do: we
myghte fynde the waye to dye wel,
and this thynge we wyll not doo.
This madnes Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I truste, you
wyll put of, and feare not deathe,
the whiche you canne not escape:
But feare an yuell death, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
you may flye.</p>
            <p>¶Amonge manye commodytes
of deathe I reken one chefely to be
sette by, that it is good to dye wel,
to escape therby thoccasion of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
<pb facs="tcp:22915:25"/>
yuell, and surelye he dyethe
well, that for suche an intente ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
death gladly.</p>
            <p>¶More ouer consider you well,
and you shall see, that in hym the
whiche is curious to lyue, fortune
hath a great rule, but in hym that
can dye gladdely, fortune hath no
power. And what a wretchednes
it is to be vnder fortunes vanitie,
I reporte me to them, whome we
beholde dayly diuersely vexed as
well with immoderate lustes of to
moche welthe, as with passynge
sorowes of to moche trouble.</p>
            <p>Therfore to be oute of fortunes
thraldome sette lyttell by this lyfe,
that is to say, feare not deathe.</p>
            <p>¶It pleased me to rede a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms
opinion, that sayd, He is as
foolyshe that feareth deathe, as he
that feareth to be olde. For as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22915:25"/>
yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge age folowith the old: so af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
old age streight foloweth deth.
And a madde mans poynte it is to
feare dethe, seinge thinges vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne,
the whiche may chance and
may not chance, be onely worthye
of feare, but thinges certeyn with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
doubte commynge, muste be
loked for, not feared. The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of deathes commyng is equall
and without remedy, so that other
to complayne, or to flye at deathe
hit is a playne madnes. For who
can complayne to be in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
in the whiche indifferently al
men of this worlde be?</p>
            <p>¶And agayne yf the payne of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
were a thinge to make death
fearefull, fyrst it shulde be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
to remembre, that after the
peyne of deathe, there shall be no
more peyne, and as Epicure saith,
<pb facs="tcp:22915:26"/>
If it be an extreme soore payne, it
is shorte. For no vehement peyne
can be longe. This were inoughe
to make death not moche to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for. Euery way deth is a thing
neuer to be feared of a wyse man,
and neuer to be out of mynd both
with good men and wyse men.</p>
            <p>And as for the feare of death were
not he (I pray you) a starke foole,
that wold wepe and wayle bicause
he was not born to this lyfe a thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sande
yeres agoo? no lesse a foole
is he who so euer soro with bicause
he can not lyue a thousande yeres
to come. For these .ii. sayinges be
euen and equally true: you were
not, you shall not be. So that one
mynde shulde be in vs, as well to
remembre we shall not be, as to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membre
we ones were not. It is
no newe thyng to dye, our fathers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:22915:26"/>
our grantfathers, our great fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
be gone the way, that both we
shal go, and al that folow vs must
come the same.</p>
            <p>¶More ouer in as moche no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
wyt, craft, nor diligence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth
to escape dethe, no power,
no ryches, no auctoritie helpeth,

it is vayne for vs to flye or to ron

the bloude of so may sayntes haue
witnessed the same: and the diuels
with all the damned spirites, soo
surely beleue the trouthe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
teachynge, that they trymble
and quake thereat. Be not moued
with the common ensample of the

the trouth, and thinke al the world
false, where Christes sayinge agre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth

If it were possible, that you sawe

ageynste them all beleue the sonne

Christe sayth, the place of honour

that is not both shame,
and also may be cause of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualle

in as moche Christe saythe,
that of them be taken many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimenntes
and lettes to enter
into the sure quietnes of blessed

christe sayth, here is not your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

therfore hence. This is to saye be
wyllynge to forsake this straunge
countray. And seinge the waye to
your homewarde lyeth by deathe,
take a couragious stomake to die,
and dye gladly, that you may dye
well. Beleue I say Christe, &amp; you
shall thynke it paynefull to be in

the heuenly ioyes, whervpon wyll

of deathe, by the whiche you shall
departe frome your peyne to that
ioye, the whiche you desyre. And
hereof is made a glad dyinge, the
whiche I styl name a good dieng.
Thus if we canne take this feare
awaye we be well forwarde, and
herof wyll easyly insue the reste,
that is to dye gladlye. It is a true
sayinge, that who so euer feareth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22915:32"/>

if it be tru, that the thinges of this

no man can dout, that beleueth
Christe, whom if you thynke to be
god, you muste also thinke it all
trouth that he saith. It can not be
otherwise then Christe testifieth,
whose preching euer exhorteth vs

more (sayth our master Christ)
if we tourned all our care to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
we shulde not be destitute
of such thinges as necessarily this
present lyfe nedeth. And where
<pb facs="tcp:22915:35"/>
Christe so streytly commaundeth
almes dedes, sayinge, that who so
euer helpeth not a pore man in his
nede, he wil not helpe him nor yet
knowe him at the fearefull day of
dome, in so moche that it pleaseth
Christ to say, that euery pore man
representeth the person of goddes
son, so that he that regardeth not a
pore man, despiseth the son of god.
In this doctryne what thynke
you? Whether dothe Christe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
almes deades for the
poore mans sake, that shulde take
almes, or for the ryche mans sake,
that shoulde gyue almes? In ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
almes I fynde no vertue,
and nedes it is a thynge partey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
to vertue, that Christ wolde
haue done. Therfore surely it is
for the ryche mans sake. For it is
Christes lesson, that techeth vs to

all this worlde to folowe
Christe: the whiche beddeth the
ryche man, that wyll be perfecte,
to go &amp; sell al that he hath, &amp; deale
all to poore men. For as harde a
thynge it is to plucke through the

and fynally death in this

deathe in goddes reygne. In this
tenor and key sowneth al our holy

it is inough to proue to a Christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
