         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
JAMES
Earl of PERTH, Lord High Chancellor
of Scotland.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Could not ſlip this opportunity to teſtifie my Loyalty to my King, and
my Gratitude to you, being, ſo zealouſly, enflam'd with Both, that
I needed but the leaſt hint of an Occaſion wherein to let them Flaſh
out.</p>
            <p>And for the Firſt; as I bleſs God that I Derive my Extract from
a Father whoſe eminent Loyalty to the Royal Family, expoſ'd him not a
little to the cruelty of the late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, and made him no ſmall ſharer in
thoſe Loſſes and Sufferings which were then the common Fate of all good
men; So I do, that being Educated by him in thoſe Principles, which
were ſo dear to himſelf, I have never underſtood what it was to entertain
the very remoteſt liking to Traitors and Rebellion, whatſoever was the
pretended Account whereupon they were engaged; but have always deteſted
them as the greateſt Plagues and Calamities of Humane Nature, as well
as Society. Wherefore being no leſs prompted by my Inclination, than
oblig'd by my Duty, to Preach the following Sermon, not only to thoſe
of that Congregation which God and the King has entruſted to my Care,
but alſo before ſo conſiderable an auditory as the whole Gentlemen of <hi>Selkirk</hi>
and <hi>Peebles</hi> Shires, whoſe Loyalty had brought together for His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Service, I thought it would not be amiſs, ſhould I likewiſe ſpread
it over the whole Nation, eſpecially in this Juncture, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and Loyal Reſentments which is raiſ'd in its first Auditors, might
poſſibly become as Univerſal, as in them they were Great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103805:3"/>
But, My Lord, What ſhall I ſay, as to the latter? How ſhall I exs<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſs
my Gratitude for ſuch a tranſcendent Goodneſs as Your Lordſhip ha
been pleas'd to vouchafe toward me, whereby I muſt not only one to You
all that I have, but whatever I ſhall have? But remembring that it
was propagated even ſo far, as, upon my firſt aiming to ſignifie the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
acknowledgements, I could either frame, or harbour, to tell me, That
<hi>to ſay nothing, was the beſt way to ſay all,</hi> I ſhall not now break a
Silence, which was then ſo obligingly enjoyn'd, and which never can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be broke without too much injuring what can no otherwiſe be fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
but by It.</p>
            <p>Only I muſt begg the pardon to ſay, that as never King had a more
entirely Loyal and Devoted Chancellor to his Service, as never Church
or Church men had a more zealous and constant Friend, and as never
Learning or Scholars had a braver and more noble Patron, or a greater
Scholar to be ſuch unto them, than all have in Your Lordſhip; So ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Patron had or ſhall have a more ambitiouſly grateful Dependent, than
You have in</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XX. Ver. V.</bibl>
               <q>We will rejoyce in thy Salvation.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THo this Day, has loſt one half of that bleſſed Cauſe, which
at firſt compoſ'd the reaſon of its Solemnity; and tho there
is nothing which can ſo ſenſibly revive in us the memory of
<hi>Charles the Second</hi> (were it poſſible for us wholly to forget him) but
what likewiſe ought to plunge us in Howlings and Regrets ſo vaſt,
as not to be capable of being exceeded, but by that fatal Deprivation
of the beſt of Kings for which they were poured forth: Yet there is
ſtill ſo much remaining for engaging us to celebrate it with the higheſt
Extaſies and Tranſports, that to commence our acknowledgments
with any thing of a contrary ſtrain, were equally to be <hi>impertinent</hi> to
it, and <hi>injurieus</hi> to our own ſelves, by diſturbing thoſe Reſentments
of our Felicity, which at once <hi>creats</hi> and <hi>teſtifies</hi> it, with the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
allay of any ſad or mournful Reflection. And indeed that
after the woful and barbarous Uſage of the <hi>First Charles,</hi> and after
the cruel Exile and Baniſhment of the <hi>Second,</hi> the Royal Race of
the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> under whoſe Government we had been ſo long Happy,
ſhould have been reſtor'd again to its Native Right, and inſtall'd upon
that Throne whence it had been ſo unjuſtly tumbled down, cannot
but be as <hi>perpetual,</hi> as <hi>tranſcendent</hi> an Occaſion for our loudeſt Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
and Rejoycings while there is One of It to continue our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Happineſs by Ruling over us, and that, I hope, ſhall be,
while the <hi>Sun rules by day, and the Moon by night in the Firmament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when all our former Miſeries are not only ſo entirely extinguiſht
by that bleſſed Reſtoration, that nothing but our own Wickedneſs and
Folly can poſſibly make us repeat them; but when alſo the mercy and
felicity of it is ſo advantagiouſly lengthened out unto us in the happy
Acceſſion of our preſent Great Monarch to the Crown of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as to deaden in us the feeling and ſenſe of a loſs ſuſtain'd by the
removal of his late Deareſt Brother, of ever bleſſed and glorious
Memory, which <hi>otherwiſe</hi> had been unſupportable beyond all the
Sufferings wherewith our moſt reſolute Conſtancy could have been
ſhoked or aſſaulted, and had certainly overwhelm'd us with Sorrows
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103805:4"/>
as exceſſive and unconſolable, as our foregoing Bleſſings in ſo Good
a King were great and ſurpaſſing; When, I ſay, we find ſuch ineſtimable
Advantages flowing to us from the Reſtoration, what meaſures, what
heights of Joyfulneſs, what ſoarings of Exultation, or raviſhments of
Gratitude, and triumphant Exclamations can be ſufficient to expreſs
and ſolemnize the never to be forgotten happineſs of this Day? This
is our Salvation, and thus will we Rejoyce in it. <hi>We will rejoyce in
thy Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the better to enhanſe and raiſe its excellency, and ſo to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
our intenſeſt degrees of rejoycing becauſe of it, let us caſt back
a view upon that wretched and diſaſtruous Schene whereupon all
thoſe Miſeries and Calamities were acted, which did ſo heavily ly
upon us in that execrable Rebellion, and thoſe ſaddeſt Troubles that
immediatly went before it. And who is there among us who knows
not that our Afflictions did ſo cloſly beſiedge us on all hands, that
whether we lookt on the Publick, or on our own privat Concerns,
there was nothing to be diſcovered but what ſeem'd to vy the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruouſneſs
and cruelty of thoſe who uſurpt over both, againſt the
utmoſt paſſiveneſs and capacity of being injur'd that either of them
was indu'd withall?</p>
            <p>Was not the Church, alas! violated in its Purity and Glory by
the moſt ſacrilegious Intruders that ever durſt enter the threſholds
of ſo holy a place? when not only its beſt and moſt Primitive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was aboliſhed, and it ſelf ſubjected to the baſeſt Anarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Model of inſolent and confounding Preſbytery, wherein a medley
of imperious Clergy-men and whining Laicks metamorphoſ'd all things
belonging to its Diſcipline and Worſhip into as much a Chaos as was
the mungrel compoſure of their own ſelves: but alſo when we had
the moſt eſſential parts of our Devotion and Religion turn'd out of
doors, and it became <hi>Schiſm</hi> to pray to Chriſt in thoſe prevailing
words which himſelf did preſcribe, and <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> to ſing
Praiſes to the Trinity in that ſhort Stanza of Hallelujahs which the
firſt Ages of Chriſtianity brought in uſe, and <hi>Hereſie</hi> to profeſs the
Faith of our Redeemer in that ſacred Form of Belief which his own
Apoſtles did bequeath to the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>And was not the State likewiſe brought under no leſs diſmal a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103805:4"/>
when <hi>the Anointed of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the breath of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils,</hi>
was loaded with all the Affronts and Indignities that Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it ſelf could either <hi>deſerve</hi> or <hi>inflict;</hi> when his ſacred Perſon was
baffled under the Banners of his pretended Authority, and it was not
enough to have raiſ'd an inteſtine and Civil War within the very
bowels of his Kingdoms, unleſs to juſtifie that, and to ſecure the
greateſt Crime with another as great, there was one engender'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>thoſe two</hi> alſo; when he was dragg'd and hurried from Priſon
to Priſon, and at laſt brought upon a Scaffold to tranſcribe the fate
of the King of Kings, and be a ſecond Inſtance how patient Heaven
could be at the calamities of oppreſſ'd Innocence, and how malitious
Hell in the perſecuting of it. What eyes can refrain from guſhing
out in Tears at the ſad remembrance of ſo horrid a Tragedy, which
I am ſure cannot be more deplor'd by us, than it is now tormenting to
thoſe miſerable Wretches who were the deſperat Actors of it? And
who can but abhor and deteſt thoſe miſchievous Methods and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which by a natural and immediat conſequence carried along
that Ax, that damnable Ax, by which it was executed?</p>
            <p>But this was not all. For after thoſe inhumane and butchering
Uſurpers had aſſaſſinated the Father, and thruſt out the Children,
that they might poſſeſs the Inheritance themſelves, was not the Royal
Line it ſelf rendered the moſt criminal and treaſonable thing that
their Laws were levelled againſt? And was not a price ſet upon thoſe
Heads which were deſtin'd for Crowns; and every covetous or dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Villain prompted to ſpill that precious Blood, whoſe ſacredneſs
would have heightned Murther with the dreadfulleſt Acceſſion of
Sacriledge and Parricide too? And were not the Royal Brothers,
both whom Providence has thought fit to reward with the Imperial
Crowns of theſe Kingdoms, no doubt for their Chriſtian and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Deportment during the time of their Afflictions, were they
not, I ſay, forc'd out of their own Dominions, as well as out of
their Rights, and made to wander abroad, tho to the glory, yet to
the eternal ſhame and diſgrace of our <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> The firſt, that
thereby all the World ſaw it honoured with two ſuch Brothers as
each deſerv'd rather to ſway the Scepter of the whole Univerſe,
than that of ſo ſmall a Corner of it; and the latter, that it beheld that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103805:5"/>
two ſuch Nations, who know how to prize and value every thing
elſe, were yet ſo pitifully blinded, as not to beſtow their Regard
where the greateſt Merit was to attract it?</p>
            <p>Now what can be imagin'd after all this to aggravate the Miſery
of a People, or gradually to improve their Diſaſters into a more
wretched height? yet there is one circumſtance more. For all this
was done by a ſort of Creatures whoſe abject and muſhrome extract
was equal to nothing beſide, but the virulence and inſolence of their
Temper. Things that were the very Sediment and Ferulency of
Mankind, and the very Gall and Bitterneſs of it too. That wrapt
the Shape of Man, and Shew of Religion forſooth about the moſt
horrid Villanies and Crimes, and thus reverſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> method of
covering their Tabernacle with the Skins of Beaſts and Goats, by
ſhrouding the moſt Bruitiſh Natures and Vices with a Humane
Form, and a Pretext of Conſcience too. Who made Shams of God
Almighty, and turn'd Religion to be the great Stickler for Intereſt,
and truckling Wheedle of all but ſuch as wrought behind its Curtain.</p>
            <p>And having thus ſerv'd themſelves of whatever was Sacred, they
played the like Tricks with what was Civil too. For all thoſe Laws
that ſuited not their wicked Deſigns, theſe they cancell'd and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated:
and when they wanted any to give them ſomething of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and ſhadow for perpetrating their Miſchief, then they made
them. And to make things Crimes by a ſubſequent Law which were
committed in Innocence, and then annull that Law when it had done
their turn, was as peculiar to their Government, as their Humours
were to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Was there ever any People more grievouſly, even ſurrounded
with Miſery and Reproach? Or could any Nation have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
by its greateſt Enemies into a more lamentable Condition, or
rendered more the contempt, and hiſſing, and mockery of the whole
Earth, yea the <hi>Aceldama,</hi> the field of Blood and Deſolation of it
alſo?</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we think when to all this yet there was added one
degree further of what brought up our ruine to ſo ſtupendious an
aſcent? For however <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d</hi> and <hi>infamous</hi> it had been to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
drudg'd under thoſe abominable Rebels, who at firſt took hold
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103805:5"/>
of the Supreme Power, and thus been enſlav'd to a damn'd Pack of
the moſt Tyrannous and Perfidious Raſcals that ever lifted up hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
face to eye the Sun in his; Yet even that ſtate, tho the worſt
that could readily have either befallen us, or been dream'd of, had
been infinitely preferable unto what did follow it ere all was done,
and <hi>iniquity brought to an end.</hi> And none will doubt of this who can
but reflect what ſad viciſſitudes and alterations that new form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which nothing leſs than Atheiſm Blinded with Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
could have introduc'd, was neceſſarily obnoxious to, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
did undergo. For after that curſed <hi>Oliver,</hi> whom Providence
only permitted to triumph ſo long, that he might ſufficiently fill up
the Cup of his Abominations, and at laſt tumble into Hell overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with the weight of his Villanies; after that deteſtable Traitor,
I ſay, was gone, what Confuſions and Devaſtations did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
ariſe, as if our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Soil had been ſown with ſo many <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
Teeth, when the ugly Carcaſe of that Incarnate Wretch dropt
into it. And had not the Bowels of Divine Compaſſion at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to yern upon us, and to deliver us from that deluge of fury which
was a breaking out, our caſe had been as far beyond that of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianitiſh</hi>
Hoſt, when every mans Sword was at his Neighbours Breaſt,
or <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s imaginary State of Nature, wherein an univerſal fear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
to a reſembling War, as <hi>theſe</hi> are, the little Marſhallings of ſome
Ants upon the eaſie riſing of a Mole-hill.</p>
            <p>Neither could it poſſibly have been otherwiſe. For, beſide that
ſad experience had taught all men in the preceeding Reign of the
Uſurper; what it was to truſt any that could be no other but
ſuch an one too, with ſo edg'd a Tool, as the Supreme Power
is, and ſo had made them become warry how they reſigned their
ſhare of it; how could any, not wholly ſunk in the vileſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
and abjectneſſe, brook to have his neck trampled upon by ſuch
an one, as himſelf did <hi>equal,</hi> if not <hi>better,</hi> at leaſt to whom he could
have no other obligation to be ſubject, but that he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſo much force, nor oppreſs ſo irreſiſtably, as the other could.
And when the Supreme Management of Affairs was not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
enough ſetled in any ones hands, that the greateſt miſeries and
embroilments ſhould have then enſued, would have been ſo far from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103805:6"/>
looking like any thing of wonder, that the contrary had been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the vaſteſt one next to the impoſſibility of any at all.</p>
            <p>Thus it was that the Publick groan'd under the violence and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of that fatal Rebellion. And we cannot gueſs ſhrewdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we cannot but be aſſur'd, that then all private mens Fortunes
and Lives were at the beck of its mercy likewiſe: the one being the
neceſſary reſult of the other; ſo that I need not inſiſt any more upon
it.</p>
            <p>It was then from ſuch a comfortleſs eſtate that the Reſtauration of
the Royal Family to their ancient Rights and Prerogatives did reſcue
us. And tho there had been nothing elſe in that King, who was
reſtored again to the Throne of his Anceſtors, to recommend him,
but that he was Veſted with the true Title to be ſo; Yet we had
had all manner of reaſon to reſent ſuch a bleſſing with the higheſt
degrees of Gratitude and exuitancy. And the removing of that one
curſe, <hi>of having ſervants ruling over us,</hi> had been motive enough for
influencing us ſtill to remember with proportionable reflections the
Honour at leaſt, which with him was reſtor'd unto us upon this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
day.</p>
            <p>But when it was ſo Good and Gracious a King, as our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
was, that put an end to all thoſe lamentable troubles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions;
When it was a King who was as tender of his Subjects inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
as of his Own, and made no other advantage of his Power and
Dignity ſo much as to advance the good and welfare of his People &amp;
to perpetuat to them all thoſe Bleſſings that ever any Nations were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of; and ſo, when with him both Peace and Plenty, both our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and our Liberties nay and an Indemnity to all our Crimes too, did
return unto us, and he had no ſooner mounted that Throne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Right was as great, as were his Inclinations towards us, but he
heap'd equal Loads of Felicity upon us, unto thoſe of Miſery which
the Uſurpati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n had done before; What can be thought any wayes
capable to reſemble ſuch an Accumulation of Happineſs for expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the ſenſe we ought to have of it?</p>
            <p>And now it having pleaſ'd the Divine Majeſty to take unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that Glorious Monarch, and to beſtow upon him an Heavenly
Crown, for having ſo well employed the Prerogatives of one that was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103805:6"/>
Earthly; nothing could have more engaged either our Wonder, or
our Gratitude, than ſo to propogate the advantage of the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to exalt One upon his Throne, who might <hi>only not equal,</hi>
becauſe he did <hi>rather excell</hi> Him in all thoſe Royal Induements for
which He was ſo much the Object both of his Peoples Love and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
and ſo to give us an evidence that beyond the <hi>Superlative</hi>
Qualifications of the One, there was <hi>ſome kind</hi> of Tranſcendency to
be allowed the Other, at leaſt upon the account of that Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which in any but himſelf alone had been altogether impoſſible:
And without the leaſt imputation of flattery, I may undoubtedly ſay,
that both theſe, our Aſtoniſhment and Thankfulneſs, I mean, ought
to be fill'd to the higheſt pitch by the happineſs wherewith Heaven
has now bleſt us, in giving us a King, whom we are bound to eſteem
more for his being Brother to our Former, rather in his Vertues,
than in his Blood. It were, I know, too much preſumption for me
to attempt the Character of a Prince, whoſe only One is, that he is
above All. Neither ſhall I dare to meddle with the drawing ſuch
a Pourtracture wherein the greateſt Maſter would but bungle at his
beſt.</p>
            <p>Only I muſt tell you that we have a King whoſe Education gave
him to underſtand the ſtate of Humane Affairs at a more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
rate, than ordinarily the breeding of ſuch as are born for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
can poſſibly yield. Since he was not train'd up amidſt the ſoft
and tempting pleaſures of an enticeing Court, which uſe to bewitch
the moſt of Princes ſo, as to divert their thoughts from theſe ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reflections that ſhould teach them that tho <hi>they be gods, yet they
muſt die like men;</hi> and ſo to deprive them of having thoſe juſt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they ought to entertain, both of Themſelves, and Thoſe whom
Providence has plac'd below them. But he was brought up in the
School of Affliction, and made to purſue his Fortune by thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which rather uſe to <hi>acquire,</hi> than <hi>inherite</hi> a Crown.</p>
            <p>Nay, we have a King who to the benefite of his Education, has
alſo had that no leſs extraordinary <hi>one</hi> of being ſo long a Subject to as
great a King as ever the World ſaw, before his own ſelf who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; and ſo, who cannot but on the one hand have learn'd all
the Arts and Maximes of Government from ſo glorious an Example.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103805:7"/>
and on the other what are Inclinations and Intereſts of a Subject
from his own late and wonted condition. And beſides theſe two
there could not be any other thing more conducive to fit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
him for being ſuch a King as by no common conjunction
might, and I am perſwaded will, reconcile <hi>le Bon</hi> and <hi>le Grand,</hi> the
being <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Great,</hi> together.</p>
            <p>And from what of his Reign has paſt already we cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to our ſelves that few men have ever made better uſe of their
own moſt proportionable advantages, than he has of his. For was
there ever a King that entered upon the Theatre of Empire with
more gracious and glorious Beginnings than he has? Has he not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
prevented our Wiſhes, and out-done our Hopes; and ſo far
concurr'd to grant us all that our hearts could in Reaſon deſire, that
we have, and can only have our ſelves to blame, if our happineſs be
not as vaſt, as his Zeal to promote it is ſo. Did he not ſecure to us
our Proteſtant Religion in this his firſt Parliament by an Act more
great than all that were paſt by his Predeceſſors, at leaſt upon this
ſcore that it includes whatever they have done, and palpably ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts
that if more had been poſſible, it would have done that alſo.
And to enhance this, if it be capable of being ſo, did he not all this,
even before he receiv'd our dutiful Declaration of his Authority, and
acknowledgements of his Goodneſs: Thereby to let all the World
know that he was much more concerned for what did moſtly concern
us, than what upon any other account carried a nearer relation to his
own ſelf. Were there ever greater endearments from a King to his
Subjects? or rather is it imaginable how there could be any greater,
or any beſides themſelves but ſo great?</p>
            <p>But has he not likewiſe given us more than ſufficient aſſurance in
his Gracious Letter that as <hi>nothing has a greater tendency to ſecure our
Priviledges and Properties, than the aggrandizing of his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
ſo he propoſes no other end for maintaining it in its greateſt
lustre, than to be the more enabled to defend and protect our Religion as
eſtabliſhed by Law, and all our Rights and Properties.</hi> Words ſure that
ought to be as <hi>eternal,</hi> as they are <hi>obliging;</hi> and which ought to
be engrav'd as indelibly upon all our Hearts as they would, were
they where they ſhould be upon the hardeſt Porphyries and Marbles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103805:7"/>
And let not any envious or embittered Spirit go about to rob us
of the full ſatisfaction which cannot but redound to us from ſuch ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
vouchſafemnts, providing we will not be more injurious to our
own Intereſt, than to that beſt of Princes who contributes ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to advance it; let them not, I ſay, evacuate to us ſuch a bleſſing,
by their wicked and baſe Detractions and Surmiſes, as if all this were
done with the greater Artifice, the more inevitably to ſupplant us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
For as Hell could not ſuggeſt any thing more <hi>malitious,</hi>
ſo neither could it what would be but near ſo groſs or effronted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
when it is aim'd againſt a Prince whoſe Perſonal Excellencies
have been as yet ſo little queſtionable by any that ever knew him,
that even his moſt inveterate Enemies, not kowing where elſe to fix,
have been hitherto forc'd to draw Impeachments from his very Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
when they were to caſt their uglieſt Slanders upon him. So
that now to inſinuate any thing of him which would bring his Vertue
upon the Stage, cannot but look, as on the one ſide, the deſperate
Effort of forlorn Wickedneſs, ſo on the other, the moſt impudent
and unworthy Attempt that even That was ever ſtraitned unto.</p>
            <p>But there are two of his Properties, for which he is at once the
Example and Darling of all good and generous men, that ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly
baffle and confute all ſuch calumnious and traiterous aſperſions,
that it may be reaſonably doubted, whether all thoſe who either
hint at, or give ear to them, do more endeavour to reconcile the
greateſt inconſiſtency with one another, or to impoſe upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in ſpight of the cleareſt Convictions to the contrary: and theſe
are his Reſolution, and his Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>firſt,</hi> He has been from his Infancy, known to excel in
in it ſo ſingularly, that as never Man ſhew himſelf more gallant and
brave, than he has done in the greateſt exigencies and dangers, when
it appeared to be in his very Element, to ſtand undaunted amidſt
Thunder and Smoak, and all thoſe dreadfulleſt hazards, which could
either have terrified or affrighted all who were no more but mortal;
So has never Man yet been able to tax him for compaſſing any of his
Deſigns, by ſuch undue or unjuſtifiable Means, as he would not
have publickly avowed, before ever he undertook the atchievment
of them: His amoition never having carried him toward that,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103805:8"/>
which his Heart did not furniſh him with ſufficient courage; ſo to
purſue, as not to be affrayed of owning it, ſo ſoon as ever he thought
upon acquiring it. And indeed where there is ſo little fear, and ſo
much greatneſs of Mind, 'tis not poſſible that any thing can at once
be reſolv'd, and yet need to be purchaſ'd by ſome ſiniſtruous or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening
ways too; Since to <hi>propoſe,</hi> and to <hi>dare</hi> it, is the verieſt ſame
thing. And for a valiant and reſolute man not to act above board,
were as great a Paradox even in Nature, as for any to do ſo is one in
Morality. Now the matter of Fact of this being Irrefragable beyond
all manner of ſuſpition, the Inference which iſſues from it, as to our
preſent purpoſe, is ſo palpably evident too, that the formality of a
Deduction would be no leſs impertinent, than it is needleſs.</p>
            <p>But if his reſolution be great, ſure his ingenuity is no leſs; not only
becauſe the one is the neceſſary Product and Conſequent of
the other, ſo that there was never a <hi>Diſsembler</hi> who was not a <hi>Coward</hi>
before; But alſo becauſe all the World has particularly obſerv'd in
him the ſtrickeſt niceneſs in adhering to his Word, that Honeſty it
ſelf could aſſume. Neither could this have been ſo univerſally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed,
and talkt of, if it had not been proportionably as exceſſive in
him, as it is too far from being ſo in the moſt of men beſide: Things
that either are not, or yet are vulgar and common, not happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
readily to gain ſo much credite and repute in the World.</p>
            <p>But when that obliging Force which lies in the Word of a King,
and a King ſpeaking to his Parliament too, comes as an acceſſion to
engage the ſincerity of his Intention unto it, ſhall it therefore be
jealouſ'd what he has condeſcended to aſcertain us of, becauſe of that
redoubled Tye wherewith it is Twiſted, like a <hi>threefold cord that
cannot be broken?</hi> Shall his Word when he was not a King be ſo
univerſally Truſted to, and Confided in, that the moſt of Kings
Laws could not afford half the Security; and ſhall his Royal Word
now when he is a King become more uncertain than the moſt of mens
ordinary Aſſeverations uſe to be? No, no. Theſe are contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
not more prejudicial to his Honour and our Allegiance, than
ſhamefull and ridiculous in themſelves.</p>
            <p>And therefore let us at leaſt vye our own being good to our ſelves,
with his being ſo to us, by firmly believing what He has ſo ſolemnly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103805:8"/>
ſet his Scepter to; Since to do otherwiſe were the moſt infallible
way to bring that upon us, which then we were ſo fondly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of, as thereby to be guilty of that, which on any other occaſion
we would condemn moſt. And the truth is, were it poſſible to tempt
and provock him to be unjuſt to his own ſelf, by recalling that Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Word which He has fully engaged (which bleſt be God all the
malice and enmity of his Enemies can never be able to do) he could
not think he were ſo to us, did he once think that we repoſ'd not
that entire confidence in what he has done which it deſerves; ſince
whoever Diſtruſts, has thereby forefeited all pretence of obligation
upon Him that gave His <hi>Parol,</hi> and formerly renunced his Right in
ſuch a Security, by thus virtually refuſing to take it. And all the
end for which one paſſes his Word, being to aſſure the other that
he ſhall not be cheated, he keeps it very punctually to him, that
lays no hold nor ſtreſs upon it, tho he ſhould act quite contrary to
what it had promiſed; becauſe then the other would not be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſeing he cannot be ſaid to be ſo, who never expected to be dealt
otherwiſe with. So that whoever will be ſo <hi>wicked</hi> as to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
what has the Royal Aſſent to procure it Authority, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to be ſo <hi>mad</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> too, as to do all that in him lyes to
cancel the Obligation that is on the Kings ſide of it alſo, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Affairs unto that ſame poſture wherein they were, before ſuch
a poſitive engagement made any alteration in them.</p>
            <p>Now when it is ſo manifeſt, that all things concur to make us as
happy Subjects as it is poſſible for us to be while we have no other
King but that of Heaven; our preſent One on Earth having not
only bleſt us with all that we are capable to receive from him, but
being alſo ſuch of himſelf, as cannot but continue them always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us ſo long as Almighty God in mercy does allows us him (and
may that be while he be the oldeſt King, that ever ſat upon any of
thoſe Thrones which he adorns); ſhall we not gratefully rejoyce
in that Salvation, which at firſt was wrought in the happy Return
of the Royal Family, to the Poſſeſſion of their Ancient Rights, and
is now renewed to us by the glorious Succeſſion of our Great <hi>JAMES</hi>
the Seventh, to the Crowns of theſe Realms? This, th's certainly
is ſo bleſſed an effect of the Reſtoration yet laſting unto us, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103805:9"/>
while we enjoy it, unleſs we would affect to be the moſt monſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Wretches that ever trode upon the Earth, &amp; to combine the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ingratitude, with the higheſt folly and madneſs, it is quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
but we muſt now ſhew our ſelves truely and heartily, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the great and unſpeakable Mercies thereof; but <hi>we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in this ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that ſuch felicities ought to make the deepeſt impreſſions of
gratitude upon us, is ſo certain, and ſo acknowledged a Truth,
that it could not but be very ſuperfluous to enlarge any further upon
it. The only fear is, that we think not of them what they really
are, but thorow ſome Rebellious or Fanatick impatiency, at the
preſent conſtitution of things, look upon that as our Miſery and
Wretchedneſs, which is ſo much the contrary, that it could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be more ſo. And had not our late Treaſons and Conſpiracies, but
eſpecially the preſent riſing in Arms, againſt the Intereſt and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this Nation, as well as againſt Him who Reigns over it, made
it too notorious to the whole World, at what Rate many amongſt
us do value that which all honeſt and good men account to be
their greateſt honour and bleſſing, I ſhould not have ſeem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſo ill of my Nation, as in the leaſt to have inſinuated that any
ſuch degenerate things were ever nurſt up in its Air. But it being
too palpable now to be capable of being huddled, nay, theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
publiſhing their <hi>ſhame,</hi> and their <hi>guilt</hi> together, in their volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Manifeſto's, 'tis neceſſary that we likewiſe brand them upon all
occaſions, as the moſt <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian</hi> Monſters that ever
infeſted any People. Were it not that I will neither encroach too
much upon your patience, nor proſtitute my pains upon ſuch Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and wildeſt Miſcreants, I ſhould eaſily make good this charge
againſt them upon both theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>But I would fain know what it is that really they would be at,
if they can but tell ſo much themſelves Is Monarchy their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?
That perhaps ſhall be mine too, after once I have ſeen that it
has done as much miſchief in as ſhort time, as what brought it under,
did. But being fully perſwaded that I ſhall never ſee That, So I have
no fears ever to be guilty of This. Nay it is not poſſible that it can
arrive; ſince at leaſt amidſt all the miſeries, which in that caſe were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103805:9"/>
incumbent, this one comfort would remain, that it was a King
who did Inflict them; And who has but a Soul within him, who
would not rather chooſe to be trode under a Kings Foot, than
the ugly hoove of every pitiful Aſs?</p>
            <p>But I defie the greateſt Republican ever to afford me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Plenty and Happineſs which was enjoyed under a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
parallel to that which we appeal to of theſe five and
twenty years laſt bygone, which were effluxt under our Monarch;
whoſe Subjects had wallowed in ſuch unmixt, uninterrupted Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities,
as had almoſt made them forget they were Earthly, had
not ſome factious deviliſh Male-contents, kept them in mind of
the contrary by thoſe Diſturbances and Rubbs which they threw in
their Road. Theſe are Arguments which our own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
furniſhes us withal, and therefore cannot but be as <hi>obvious,</hi>
as <hi>unanſwerable:</hi> And upon that head I ſhall not make uſe of any
other.</p>
            <p>Only let me yet ask this one queſtion, Who is it that has any
conſiderable fortune and intereſt to be concerned in, and has
his wits too, who would condeſcend to run all at the riſque,
and adventure of a new revolution like to that whoſe ſad effects
I ſhortly Deſcribed in the beginning of this Diſcourſe? And that
no change were poſſible, but what would as exactly copy out
the former, as <hi>face anſwers face in the water,</hi> is ſo undenyably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that I dare refer it to the pretended Earl himſelf to draw us
but any probable Scheme, how things could be prevented from
running into the ſame Channel. It matters not much therefore
what all thoſe can ſay, whoſe deſperat condition is ſuch, that
whatever Reelings happen, it is impoſſible they can be worſe than
they are; and it is not ſo that they may be better: For all kind
of variety pleaſes where there is ſomething expected, but nothing
to be loſt. And I doubt not to averr that, bating thoſe unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vertigo's of ſome giddy and ignorant people, this is chiefly
at the bottom of all theſe ſtirrs, which ſo much allarm us. And
had not the Earl juſtly incurr'd the ſevereſt Cenſures of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government we ſhould have had no man, either more boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103805:10"/>
of his Loyalty, or ſooner in the Fields againſt all its Enemies,
than he. So that all the other pretexts are, and <hi>muſt</hi> be held
forth upon deſign to take with ſilly people who are ſoon ſet agogg,
and uſe not much to look beyond the outmoſt appearance and
ſurface of things.</p>
            <p>O but the Proteſtant Religion is in hazard, and juſt in St.
<hi>Peters</hi> circumſtances, even ſinking down, and ready to periſh, if
ſome powerful hand lend it not help to ſupport it. This is truely
the main clamour which breeds us ſo much noiſe; there being
a generation of ſneaking Yelpers, whoſe hollow Mouths have at
once profan'd theſe bleſſed words, and almoſt deafned us. And
before I go any further I muſt tell them that as this Plea is not
peculiar to them, ſo it is too much ſuperannuated now to take in
an Age wherein Folks Eyes are a little more open'd that they were
wont to be: and as there has been a long time ago thoſe who
upon the leaſt touch howl'd always furiouſly out, <hi>The Temple of
the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> ſo whoever gave any heed to
them render'd it puzling to be diſtinguiſht whether themſelves were
greater Fools, or they greater Knaves; ſince all the Villany and
Wickedneſs imaginable has been abetted under the Vizorn of
Religion, by ſome one Mountebank of it or other; neither has
Rebellion eſpecially ever been beholden more to any thing for
gaining its Partiſans than to a lugubrious viſage and ſniveling
Tone which uſ'd to work upon the Vulgar, in ſtead of Godlineſs
and Devotion.</p>
            <p>But briefly to anſwer this Cavil, or rather Calumny, Is it not
conſpicuous as the Noon-day, from what I have ſhown already,
that we have all the Security for our Religion, not only that in
Reaſon we can demand, but even that is poſſible to be given us?
And what more is it that theſe People would have? Truely I
cannot gueſs, unleſs it be the Kings Head (which God preſerve
from their Mercy) for that was the thing which was meant by the
ſecuring of Religion about fourty Years ſince: and we cannot
dream what elſe that Language ſignifies now, when Invention it
ſelf could not contrive beyond what is done already to ſatisfie us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:103805:10"/>
But alas! that were ſo very wretched an expedient for ſuch an
end, that, as I ſhew before what befell our Religion in the late
Troubles, ſo were theſe repeated, there would be no Remedy for it,
but it behov'd a ſecond time to demonſtrate to the World, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
plauſible pretence Rebellion carries before it, as if it were
only reſorted unto for the maintaining of Religion, yet after it has
ſerved its turn it never fails to prove as treacherous even unto
That, as it was unto him againſt whom it aroſe. And how is it
poſſible that theſe can have any true Zeal for Religion who ſtand
not to violate its moſt ſacred and fundamental commands, and
make uſe of it for no other end than to be a Stale and Wheedle
for promoting the moſt wicked Practices and Deſigns that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Villany can prompt men unto; as all Rebels and Traitors of
neceſſity muſt do: that which gives them the denomination being
in its very conſtitution and eſſence as <hi>the ſin of Witchcraft,</hi> and to
be rewarded with no leſs than <hi>Damnation</hi> both here and hereafter.
So that let them ſigh and talk as they will, I had rather my Religion
were entruſted for its ſafety unto any man alive, providing he had
any himſelf at all, than unto ſuch a one as by his being guilty of
Rebellion had rendered himſelf equally unworthy to be relyed
upon, and to defend what he cannot but offer to aſſiſt without all
his Weapons recoil moſt fatally into its boſom.</p>
            <p>But now let it be granted that our Proteſtant Religion is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
(which for Argument ſake may), yet I ſhould be content
to learn whether or not they pretend to be Chriſtians who thus
put themſelves in array for protecting it? ſure, if they be, they are
the worſt that ever durſt meddle with that holy Name: either the
worſt verſt in its nature and genius, or the worſt accuſtomed to
yield it obedience, that ever men were. I had but lately an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to
ſhew from this Pulpit how much Chriſtianity is expreſs
againſt the taking up of Arms to reſiſt the Supream Authority, and
that upon any pretext whatſoever, whether of Religion, or any
other thing; and therefore I ſhall not now embark my ſelf into
that Theme. But this I would gladly be reſolv'd of, where ſuch
a Tenent, as that of Reſiſtance, would at laſt take a ſtop? For let
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103805:11"/>
us ſuppoſe that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſhould prevail (as God forbid),
were there not as good ground, and as much reaſon for the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi>
to take up Arms againſt them, and by their own example
to make their Swords cut out a way for their Religion, as there
was for them to riſe up againſt the Adherers to <hi>Epiſcopacy?</hi> And
when the <hi>Independents</hi> had got the uppermoſt, might not the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi>
follow the ſame method with them; and the <hi>Familiſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and ſo on <hi>in infinitum.</hi> For Religion is
ſtill the Plea, and every one is to be Judge for himſelf. Neither
is there any difficulty in all this, but how to gather together Force
enough to be able to overcome; for if that were once had, there
were no more to do but for all to fall on. And if this be not all
one with <hi>Hobbs's Fancied State of Nature,</hi> only putting in the word
<hi>Religion,</hi> for that of <hi>Right;</hi> and if the ſame Miſchiefs and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
would not equally follow from both; I appeal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
even of thoſe againſt whom I am ſpeaking, ſo that they
have not ſtiffled them for good and all. And that ever Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would allow that it ſelf was the great Firebrand and Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the World, were ſo very odd to imagine, that nothing could
be more ſo, were it not that any did ever yet really believe
it.</p>
            <p>Neither ſhall they ever be able to produce the leaſt <hi>Iotta</hi> of
Scripture to vouch their aſſertion; unleſs it be that of <hi>Luke, Think
ye that I am come to ſend peace on the earth,</hi> &amp;c. Where the viſible
miſtake of a <hi>Command</hi> for a <hi>Propheſie,</hi> were far more pardonable
than any other application they uſe to make of the Word of God.
It is true we are commanded to <hi>obey God rather than man;</hi> but
when theſe interferr, are we not commanded likewiſe to <hi>ſuffer for
righteouſneſs ſake?</hi> Never one Syllable is to be found for taking up
Arms, and compelling the lawful Magiſtrate to preſcribe us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what we think GOD has done ſo too. So that there is
a clear midſt betwixt theſe two, of refuſing to obey an unlawful
command, and forcing that to be retracted by the power of Arms,
to wit, the ſuffering patiently for Conſcience ſake. An harſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
indeed to Fleſh and Blood, but that is which we muſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103805:11"/>
if we will be Chriſts Diſciples, or have any part in him.</p>
            <p>And it is further obſervable that the true Religion may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
with the greateſt conſonancy to all this, maugre the
fierceſt Perſecution that ever attempted to ruine and overturn it.
For it being only ſeated in the Mind, and <hi>this</hi> not being capable
to be vanquiſht by all the external force that can aſſault it, ſince
one may alwayes think as he pleaſes, do what any body elſe can,
all the cruelties and tortures that malice could invent needs never
conſtrain any man out of that which he has ſo entirely in his
own power, that without his leave it can never be wreſted from
him. It is but to defend <hi>themſelves</hi> therefore, and not their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that ſo much adoe, and ſuch a buſtle is made. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has but Fortitude and Chriſtianity enough to expoſe and
adventure the <hi>firſt,</hi> cannot be in great ſtrait about the ſecurity of
the <hi>latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I wiſh that it were ſeriouſly laid to heart upon what Forge
this miſchievous Doctrine was at firſt hammered out. It is true,
it came to <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Geneva,</hi> but it is as true that <hi>Geneva</hi>
brought it from farther South; and tho it ſeem'd even ambitious
of the moſt Diametrical Oppoſition to <hi>Rome</hi> that the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſtianity to both could allow, yet it ſtuck not to borrow
from thence a policy which had for a long time prov'd ſo very
ſucceſsful there.</p>
            <p>'Tis true our modern Papiſts, eſpecially in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi>
are aſham'd now to own what brought their Holy Father to the
higheſt top of ſuch a Pinacle of Grandure; being in that but too
openly ungrateful to what has ſerv'd them ſo abundantly or rather
prodigiouſly well. But pretend what they will, I know that
things go otherwiſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Inquiſition were as <hi>inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or one who would but ſmatter out any thing to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as it would be <hi>enrag'd</hi> againſt him, were he once but within
its Clutches. And tho I made it greatly my buſineſs when I was
there to learn out what was the opinion of the place concerning
ſuch a Doctrine, yet I can avowedly ſay, that of all I ſpoke with
anent it, I never fell upon one, who either did not frankly ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103805:12"/>
to me, that it was <hi>de fide</hi> there, that Heretick Kings
ought to be Excommunicated, and expell'd their Thrones; or
elſe did not decline the giving his judgement in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
which he was ſenſible was ſo vaſtly tickliſh and nice to be
medled with; thereby inſinuating as much as that he durſt not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any thing contrary to the Court verdict. But what can be
more clear, than their Writings againſt <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Widringtoun,</hi>
and their kindeſt hugging of <hi>Marriana</hi> and <hi>Sanctarella</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
to evidence what I am alledging? And ſo while our Rebels and
Fanaticks make ſuch a clutter upon pretence of keeping out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
they are as great Papiſts themſelves, and ſure as dangerous
too, as thoſe whom they are ſo eager againſt, at leaſt in one no
leſs eſſential a point, than the Infallibility, or Tranſubſtantiation
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus leaving them to themſelves, as it ſeems God hath done
already, let me now in one word addreſs my ſelf to you who are
preſent, beſeeching you that as you value the credit and glory of
our Nation; and as you tender your own intereſt and felicity,
you would ſeriouſly lay to heart what I have been diſcourſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. And methinks I may ſay in <hi>Moſes</hi> his words <hi>(Deut.</hi> 30:
15, and 19.) <hi>See I have ſet before you this day, life and good, and
death and evil; I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt
you, that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing;
therefore chooſe life, that both ye and your ſeed may live.</hi> I have
ſet before you the miſerable and wretched eſtate wherein theſe
poor Nations were involv'd during the late Rebellion; and I have
likewiſe ſet before you what has been the vaſt and ineſtimable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the Reſtoration of the Royal Family, and eſpecially
what are our happieſt bleſſings in our preſent Great King; and if
neither the formidable Aſpect which appears on the one hand can
fright you, nor the beautiful and raviſhing countenance of things
on the other can allure you; but that in ſpight of both you will
chooſe curſing and death and ruine, then you'l have only your
ſelves to thank for the event of the preference, and I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
my Soul from the guilt of your Blood. Alas! ſhall any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103805:12"/>
be ſo madly infatuated as ſo ſoon after our late Troubles to run
again into the like deſtruction, when to all the other miſeries of
it, there would this one be added too, that there were not even
that of an excuſe for it which was before, becauſe now the ſad
and fatal conſequences of Rebellion are ſo manifeſtly known, and
ſo freſh and recent in our memories likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore be ſo conſiderate of every thing that can make
us to be ſo, and ſo ſenſible of the preſent happy eſtate wherewith
God Almighty has to the <hi>wonder</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> of the whole earth moſt
graciouſly bleſt us, as thorow the fulleſt tranſports of reſentment
to ſhout aloud in the words of my Text, and in the higheſt rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of gratitude cry out, <hi>We will rejoyce in thy ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is the Salvation of God: his Providence having
all along appear'd ſo ſignally in the management of it, that had
there not been any other argument to evince the Beeing of ſuch a
Supream Government over all the Actions and Deſtinies of Men,
yet it would have ſufficiently done it. It is therefore unto God
eſpecially that we ſhould be thankful, it is to his Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Mercy that we ſhould acknowledge the Debt of ſuch
Bleſſings; and ſo we ſhould improve them every one at that rate
as may beſt ſerve to advance his Glory, and thoſe great Deſigns
and Ends which he propoſ'd to himſelf in the beſtowal of them;
which undoubtedly were, that we might be dutiful and loyal to
his Vicegerent whom he has ſo viſibly ſet over us, and lead a
<hi>quiet and peaceable life under him in all Godlineſs and Honeſty;</hi> that
being <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> here, we may be eternally Happy and
Bleſſed hereafter. Now unto the great <hi>King of kings, and Lord
of lords, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, be all praiſe, power,
honour, glory, and dominion, now and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
