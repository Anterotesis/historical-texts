         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis returns my Thanks, for the Favour of your laſt,
and <hi>candid</hi> Acknowledgment, that I had reaſon in
affirming, <q>the <hi>Sword</hi> would continue to halt it on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s and <hi>Pinner's-Hall,</hi> as long as this
was <hi>Mayor;</hi> for now you were come over to my Opinion,
and ſaw it would not only be ſo, but that his <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> finding
the <hi>Ice</hi> thus broken, would, probably, follow in the ſame <hi>Track,</hi>
or otherwiſe improve the Affront to our <hi>old Eſtabliſhments,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the ſeveral <hi>Factions,</hi> which plac'd him in the <hi>Chair,</hi> ſhould
think fit to direct: Hereupon you deſire me to communicate what I
know in reference to the <hi>Dutch Toleration,</hi> (whereof you have
heard ſeveral hints in our private Converſe) and how it comes
to paſs, that the many <hi>differing Perſwaſions</hi> amongſt them enjoy
their <hi>Liberty</hi> with a continued <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quiet,</hi> whereas ours are
always <hi>reſtleſs</hi> and <hi>encroaching,</hi> every day <hi>graſping</hi> at more, and
ſeem ſtill diſſatisfied unleſs they can <hi>engroſs</hi> all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, Sir, it was to my no little ſurprize, when laſt in Town,
to find your ſelf, and ſome other Friends, ſo poſitive, that a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand</hi>
from the <hi>Court of Aldermen,</hi> and ſome by-<hi>Reflections</hi> in an
Higher <hi>Court,</hi> would ſtifle their Delign, or make them give it over,
which I perceived was deeper laid, and had greater <hi>Encouragements,</hi>
than any of you did then imagine; yet ſure this you muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>v'd, that 'tis very rare to find thoſe <hi>Parties</hi> doing their buſineſs
by halves; whatever <hi>Lights</hi> they may pretend to, there is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Argument to prove them <hi>Children of this World,</hi> being ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi>
that is, <hi>cunning,</hi> in their <hi>Generations.</hi> No People carry on their
<hi>Projects</hi> with greater <hi>Intrigue,</hi> nor more nicely obſerve the ſeveral
<hi>ſteps</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> by which they muſt be accompliſhed: Their <hi>Legal
Indulgence,</hi> as it was a great Point gain'd, ſo the timing of it was
very <hi>critical;</hi> for, being in the heat of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> there might
be ſeveral <hi>Caſus omiſſi,</hi> which upon farther Debate would have
been better conſidered; particularly, I queſtion very much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any <hi>Diſſenter</hi> would have been allow'd going to the <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
during his <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> eſpecially to carry the <hi>Inſignia</hi> thither;
the former of which hath been all along practis'd in ſeveral <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
throughout the Kingdom; and, doubtleſs, the <hi>Preſident</hi>
your <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> has ſet, will be <hi>Ap'd</hi> by ſeveral of his <hi>Brethren</hi>
in other Places: (notwithſtanding, as the Act runs at preſent, 'tis
a <hi>Moot Caſe</hi> among the Gentlemen of the <hi>Long Robe,</hi> whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
thereby) But that your <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> may not have the
ſole <hi>Honour</hi> of the firſt Attempt, at leaſt, that was done the Firſt
Year of their <hi>Indulgence,</hi> at a <hi>Corporation</hi> in my Neighbourhood,
where an old <hi>Zealot</hi> of the 41 <hi>Cauſe</hi> (brought in perhaps for that
purpoſe) would needs have the <hi>Mace</hi> attend him to the <hi>Barn;</hi> but
the honeſty, or as they term'd it, obſtinacy of the <hi>Officers,</hi> the
<hi>Serjeants,</hi> would not comply, and ſo he went without it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
Indeed, when one of the ſame Stamp was in courſe to be
choſen, the <hi>Company</hi> capitulated, that however the <hi>Mayor</hi> might
take his liberty, the <hi>Mace</hi> ſhould be confin'd to <hi>Church;</hi> which ſome
thought a little hard on the <hi>Mace</hi>'s ſide, ſince 'twas believ'd every
whit as <hi>tender-conſcienc'd</hi> as the Man who follow'd it.</p>
            <p>But, to return to our purpoſe, you ſee how their Affairs ſtand
at preſent, and how little they ſcruple ſtretching to the utmoſt any
<hi>Liberty</hi> which is indulg'd them, whereof now they have a fair
Proſpect to make a greater enlargement; for you know next Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a New <hi>Parliament</hi> will come in courſe; and they are ſo far from
being <hi>ignorant</hi> thereof, or <hi>idle</hi> thereupon, as 'tis hard for a Perſon
of your <hi>undeſigning Integrity,</hi> to imagine how earneſtly they already
ſtickle to carry on their Point in that <hi>Critical Juncture, leave never
a Stone unturn'd,</hi> are tampering with all <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and in all <hi>Places,</hi>
to get confiding Members choſen, ſuch <hi>Root and Branch</hi>-men, as
ſhall effectually carry on the <hi>Work of the Lord,</hi> and once more eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the <hi>Good Old Cauſe;</hi> and then let the <hi>State</hi> look to it as well
as the <hi>Church,</hi> for 'tis hard to reſolve whether ſuffer'd moſt from

               </gap> 
               <hi>Conſciences,</hi> is not the ſole,
nor main thing they aim at; for then would they preſs no farther,
that being confirm'd to them by <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment,</hi> to all Intents
and Purpoſes imaginable; But to be dabbling in the <hi>Government,</hi>
is as natural to them as <hi>Water</hi> to a <hi>Fiſh;</hi> and if they may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the <hi>Royalty,</hi> and <hi>controll</hi> at Pleaſure, preſcribe who are <hi>worthy
Men,</hi> and <hi>Men worthy,</hi> thoſe Waters will be always troubled, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
free from <hi>foul Weather,</hi> and <hi>Storms:</hi> Nay, farther to remark,
how ſcandalouſly they proſtitute their <hi>Spiritual Liberty,</hi> their <hi>Right</hi>
of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to obtrude themſelves upon the <hi>Temporal</hi> Power, their
double dealing, playing <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>looſe</hi> with our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
is an irrefragable Argument. Formerly, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (to
uſe their great <hi>Patriarch's J. O</hi>'s Words) <hi>was a meer Antichriſtian
Encroachment upon the Inheritance of Chriſt, all her Darling-Errors,
Stones of the</hi> Old Babel; <hi>and therefore by no means to be communicated
with: The Faithful of the Lord muſt not touch ſuch defiled Garments;</hi>
and this indeed was the common <hi>Cant</hi> of them all, for ſome ſcore
of Years together: Yet now we ſee to ſerve a <hi>State</hi>-turn, or rather
<hi>overturn the State,</hi> the Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> goes down as glib with them
as the <hi>Covenant</hi> of old; there is no Scruple, when the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd:
In the mean while, I dare engage, that if this next <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
they can make a Party prevalent enough to repeal the <hi>Teſt,</hi>
as they have already cancell'd the other <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their <hi>Old Invectives,</hi> Our <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſhall be <hi>Reprobated as
an Anti-chriſtian Rite, and all Communion with our Church ſinful and
abominable.</hi> Now here, if they would give me leave to expoſtulate
a little, I would deſire them to conſider, whether any thing can
bring a greater reproach upon <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi>
of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than ſuch vain <hi>Tergiverſations</hi> as theſe? Such <hi>Linſy
Woolſy Conſciences?</hi> Such <hi>profane Halters between God and Baal?</hi> Can
we imagine there ſhould be any thing more in all theſe <hi>Mockeries,</hi>
than a <hi>ſordid Intereſt, ſpiteful Revenge,</hi> or <hi>popular Humour?</hi> To be
cry'd up by the Factions, and make ſomething of a Figure amongſt
the <hi>Mob-Sectaries,</hi> which they deſpair'd of obtaining from Men of
<hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi> This indeed is not exactly the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but the little difference is for the worſe, being ſo <hi>hot,</hi> where
they need not be ſo much as <hi>lukewarm,</hi> and leſs than ſo, where they
ſhould expreſs a <hi>religious</hi> Fervour: And ſince <hi>Almighty God</hi> threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
to <hi>ſpew the former out of his Mouth,</hi> I fear his Bleſſings may be
the leſs, if theſe others be not <hi>ſpew'd out of the Government.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal and unlimited,</hi> it has
fallen a Prey to the undermining Stratagems of that <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
upon all <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> whatſoever, as will hereafter appear.
For your fuller ſatisfaction therefore, I ſhall give you an Account
of the <hi>Dutch Toleration;</hi> as likewiſe how hard it will be to bring
us to that <hi>Model,</hi> and yet ſhew you 'tis that alone can do our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs:
All other <hi>Courſes</hi> will be much more <hi>unpracticable,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe,</hi>
and multiply thoſe <hi>Diſtractions</hi> which we deſign'd to prevent.
And that you may give the greater Credit to what I ſhall ſay herein,
it ſhall not depend upon my ſole <hi>Authority</hi> (though it was my chief
Enquiry during ſome Years abode there) but have the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>'s <hi>Obſervations</hi> upon thoſe <hi>Provinces;</hi>
which, as I think it was the firſt, ſo 'tis, generally believed, the
exacteſt Piece we have had from that <hi>Ingenious Gentleman;</hi> Clear
Matter of Fact, without that partiality and by reſpect, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times is not avoided by ſuch as pretend moſt thereunto.</p>
            <p>Now what makes it ſeem more difficult and unpracticable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, than them, is, That the <hi>Conſtitution of their Government,</hi>
and <hi>Temper of their People,</hi> will be found better adapted thereunto,
with ſome other Advantages of leſſer Moments: All which take,
as follows.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then the <hi>Conſtitution of Their Government</hi> ſeems better
<hi>adapted</hi> thereunto: To which purpoſe, I muſt let you know, that
however thoſe <hi>Provinces</hi> are given out to be a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41347:4"/>
               <hi>Free State,</hi> with ſuch other ſwelling <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Liberty, Priviledges,</hi> &amp;c.
as if the People had the ſole <hi>Controll,</hi> the <hi>Dernier Reſort,</hi> in all <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Determinations (and ſo indeed it was in thoſe little <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that great one of <hi>Rome,</hi> where no Laws could
be enacted, nor <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> choſen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by their Conſent) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Enquiry it will appear quite otherwiſe; the <hi>Populace,</hi> the
<hi>Burghers,</hi> have no more to do in the Government, than you and I,
if we dwelt, or but ſojourn'd amongſt them: 'Tis the exacteſt <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy</hi>
that is this day, or perhaps ever was in the World, where
the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of every <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> are as abſolute as any
<hi>Prince in Chriſtendom:</hi> Enact Laws, levy Taxes, chuſe one another
into the ſeveral Offices of <hi>Government,</hi> and upon a <hi>Vacancy</hi> (which
ſeldom happens, but by death) elect another to fill up their number,
without any controll, but from their <hi>Stadtholder,</hi> who hath a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Voice, or ſomewhat like it in all their <hi>Elections;</hi> and tho' a
reaſonable Check, is what their <hi>Hogan Moganſhips</hi> have been moſt

the <hi>Seven Provinces;</hi> 
               <q>and tells you, the <hi>Government</hi> of that <hi>City</hi> is
in the ſole management of <hi>Thirty ſix Perſons,</hi> whom he <hi>calls Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi>
and ſaith, indeed, they were formerly choſen by the Voices
of the <hi>Richer Burghers,</hi> or <hi>Freemen</hi> of the <hi>City;</hi> who, upon the
death of a <hi>Senator,</hi> met together either in a <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Market,</hi> or
ſome other Place, ſpacious enough to receive their Numbers,
and there made an <hi>Election</hi> of the Perſon to ſucceed, by a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority</hi>
of <hi>Voices.</hi> But about One hundred and thirty, or forty,
Years agoe, when the <hi>Towns</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> began to encreaſe in
Circuit and People, ſo as theſe frequent Aſſemblies grew into
danger of <hi>Tumult</hi> and <hi>Diſorders,</hi> upon every occaſion, by reaſon
of their <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Contentions:</hi> This <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Senators,</hi> came
by the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the <hi>Burghers</hi> in one of their General <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi>
to be devolv'd forever upon the ſtanding <hi>Senate</hi> for that
time; ſo that ever ſince when any of their Number dies, a new
one is choſen by the reſt of the <hi>Senate,</hi> without any interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the other Burghers, which makes the <hi>Government</hi> a ſort
of <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> and very different from a <hi>popular Government,</hi> as it
is generally eſteemed by thoſe, who paſſing, or living in theſe
Countries, content themſelves with common Obſervations, or
Inquiries. And this <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the <hi>Burghers</hi> either was agreed
upon, or followed, by General Conſent, or Example, about
the ſame time, in all the Towns of the <hi>Province,</hi> tho' with ſome

               </q> Thus far the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Gentleman;</hi> whereto I muſt farther add, that theſe <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
both here, and in all other <hi>Towns,</hi> are of the ſame <hi>Communion,</hi>
as to the <hi>Publick</hi> Exerciſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> which, after ſome Debates,
and Alterations, upon their <hi>Defection</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> was fix'd upon
the <hi>Geneva</hi>-Model, with an Allay of <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> the better to
keep under the Inſolency of their <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> ſo troubleſome elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
'Tis not of much moment to tell you farther, that as theſe
<hi>Senators</hi> marry generally into one anothers <hi>Families,</hi> ſo they keep
the <hi>Government,</hi> for the moſt part, amongſt themſelves, the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
with other <hi>Relations,</hi> coming in, and gradually aſcending, if
capable of it; which nevertheleſs being faithfully diſcharg'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Partiality, Avarice,</hi> or any other ſuch by-reſpects, the People
ſeem no ways diſſatisfied therewith.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is a ſmall <hi>Scratch</hi> of the Preſent Eſtabliſhment of that
People, which I ſhall farther confirm to you, upon the Authority
of the preſent <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Sarum;</hi> who, ſpeaking of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
how they got their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and how they maintain'd

            <p>The high-flown <hi>Demagogues</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> I know, will cenſure

            <p>Now, Sir, to come to the <hi>diſparity,</hi> in reference to our ſelves,
none of this is done, or muſt be thought off amongſt us, as to the
whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Government;</hi> which, though a <hi>Free Monarchy,</hi> is
ſo, well temper'd, as we ſee every <hi>Subject</hi> own'd to have more <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
than under a <hi>Free State:</hi> 'Tis pity it ſhould be ſo much abuſed;
yet ſince it is ſo, might there not be ſome <hi>Abridgment</hi> as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons, without the leaſt Infraction upon the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
an Exchange of <hi>Temporal</hi> for a <hi>Spiritual Liberty?</hi> They that
will have a New <hi>Religion,</hi> let them live according to this New
<hi>Model</hi> of our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and forbear meddling in <hi>Civil</hi> Concerns;
otherwiſe I cannot ſee how the <hi>Old Eſtabliſhment</hi> ſhould be long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held:
For whilſt the <hi>Tolerated Parties</hi> are free to <hi>Vote,</hi> and put in
their Claims to all <hi>Publick Adminiſtrations,</hi> all <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Honour,
Truſt,</hi> or <hi>Profit,</hi> they may carry things as they pleaſe; what tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
their <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Importunity, Cabals</hi> and <hi>Clamours, Libels</hi> and

People: No man of Sence will attempt it; for tho' they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

of Government, Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt
<hi>Ephraim;</hi> yet the <hi>Judah</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is the united Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of all their Spites, and what they ſtudy moſt implacably to
ſupplant and deſtroy: And if we reflect how many or them, in
the late Reign, comply'd with the <hi>Diſpenſing</hi> Power, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded
all thoſe Laws, which the Nation, for above an hundred
years ſucceſſively, had compil'd to ſecure the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi>
there needs no Window into any of their Breaſts, (as a leading
<hi>Holder-forth</hi> then wiſh'd in an <hi>Addreſs) to diſcover the Reality of their
Intentions.</hi> 'Tis too clear from thence, and all their other Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the only <hi>Popery</hi> they have a Pique
againſt; and can confederate with that which is really ſo, nay,
<hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> to effect its Ruine. In my Judgment, therefore, It
would be a very reaſonable, and neceſſary <hi>Teſt,</hi> (and, I fancy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the truly conſcious <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to a very ſmall number) to try
the ſincerity of their <hi>Intentions,</hi> and ſteadineſs of their <hi>Principles,</hi>

let the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſee, he was averſe to nothing which might, tend
to a <hi>Settlement,</hi> or propounded it from a Friend, whoſe Head hath
been always pregnant with <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> and <hi>Toleration-Projects:</hi>
Or, perhaps, to humour ſome great Men at the <hi>Helm,</hi> who about
that time ſtickled very much for a <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> upon
what Deſign, as every Eye then diſcover'd, ſo, I fear, in ſpite of
all Endeavours to the contrary, that Deſign will be ever concern'd
therein, and advanc'd thereby; I ſay, upon whatever Account it
was, this <hi>Reverend Worthy</hi> Perſon, in his <hi>Preface,</hi> makes a ſhort
<hi>Eſſay</hi> as to a <hi>Toleration,</hi> laying down ſuch <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> and <hi>Limitations,</hi>
as are requiſite to prevent the Miſchiefs of an unlimited <hi>Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
which he ſaith <hi>would certainly bring Confuſion amongſt us, and in

Congregation they are of; and enter their Names before ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners

more, (tho' there be ſeveral others tending to the ſame purpoſe)
but only appeal whether you, or any Man elſe of ſober Sence,
muſt not acknowledge theſe to be highly reaſonable, and abſolutely
neceſſary; that we may know what Men are, and where to have
them. In <hi>Martial-Law,</hi> none are more ſeverely proceeded againſt,
than ſuch as fly from their own, or are taken as <hi>Spies</hi> in the Enemies
<hi>Camp;</hi> yet we muſt ſuffer theſe Enemies of our Church, tho' they
have been all along in the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Service, to enter our <hi>Line</hi> at
pleaſure, take our <hi>Word,</hi> our <hi>Teſt,</hi> and <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that they may
be the better qualified to work our Ruine; nay, are ſo ſtupidly
ſenceleſs, as not only to let them alone, but entertain and careſs
them as Friends: Juſt thus the <hi>Amalakites</hi> ſerv'd <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and we
know how highly Almighty <hi>God</hi> was incenſed thereat, and what
the People ſuffer'd thereby. But not to ramble too far, or be
thought too much concern'd upon the <hi>Church</hi>-Account, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
our <hi>Government</hi> in General, whether it can be ſo well ſecur'd
by ſuch an <hi>Hodge-podge</hi> of Perſwaſions, who will be continually
pulling ſeveral ways, and aiming at ſeveral Intereſts, as the <hi>Low
Countries,</hi> where a few underſtanding Men <hi>Act</hi> unanimouſly for the
<hi>Publick Welfare,</hi> without any by-Regards, or <hi>Factious Deſigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, What I mentioned, in the next place, by way of
<hi>Diſparity,</hi> as likely to make a <hi>Toleration</hi> leſs feaſable amongſt us,
than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> is the <hi>different Temper</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> of the Two
<hi>Nations:</hi> They are a <hi>ſerious,</hi> and <hi>thoughtful</hi> People, wholly intent
upon their own private Concerns, and very induſtrious in all their
particular <hi>Callings;</hi> frugal and parſimonious to the utmoſt; truly
ſpeaking, neceſſitated thereunto, by reaſon of the many and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<hi>Impoſts</hi> laid upon them, which no People under Heaven ſo
contentedly bear, nor ſo indefatigably wade through, being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſatisfied with the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> of their <hi>Governours,</hi>
and highly tranſported with an imaginary Conceit of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which
no body can ſee into, or underſtand, but themſelves: So that, as
the forementioned <hi>Gentleman</hi> obſerves, <hi>All Appetites and Paſſions
ſeem to run lower here, than in other Countries.</hi> I am ſure they do not
run ſo low in ours, which, on the contrary, is too <hi>ſanguine</hi> to be
ſettled as it ought; for, to paſs by that old Charge of <hi>Rex Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi>
the <hi>Engliſh good Nature</hi> was ſo ſtrongly ſowr'd by our late
Times of <hi>Libertiniſm,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> Men contracted ſuch a habit
of <hi>Self-conceit, Oppoſition,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> were ſo totally given
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41347:7"/>
over to a perverſe <hi>Enthuſiaſtical</hi> Spirit; and for ſo long a time, as
now indeed it may be look'd upon, next to impoſſible, abſolutely
to <hi>conjure</hi> it down; yet doubtleſs it ought to be confin'd to its own
home, the <hi>melancholy Tombs</hi> of their reſtleſs unquiet Thoughts, and
not wander up and down the World, to poſſeſs others with the
<hi>Legions</hi> of ſuch <hi>Frenzies;</hi> which, if let alone, will certainly be; for
'tis a <hi>Peſtilent</hi> Infection, and without due Caution ſpreads like the
<hi>Plague.</hi> And that this unhappy Diſpoſition began from the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration-Fraternity,</hi>
and is much more incident to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than
<hi>Dutch</hi> Temper, take this ſingle <hi>Inſtance:</hi> There were more <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
Conteſts,</hi> and <hi>Quarrels,</hi> amongſt the few <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and
other <hi>Independent Sectaries,</hi> which reſorted thither the latter end of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth's,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's time, and ſo on, than
among the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation ever ſince they <hi>Reform'd:</hi> Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
what impertinent <hi>Controverſies</hi> aroſe between them,
even to the Colour of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Ephod,</hi> whether it were <hi>Blew,</hi> or a
<hi>Sea-green,</hi> which made an irreconcilable difference between their
<hi>Paſtors,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Flocks</hi> divided.</p>
            <p>Once indeed there was a <hi>Controverſie</hi> amongſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> about
ſome <hi>School</hi>-Points (and I think that the only Inſtance can be given)
which roſe to a great height; but then you muſt know it was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
principally by two great <hi>State-Factions,</hi> wherein moſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
eſpecially of the <hi>Geneva</hi>-cut, are too eaſily made <hi>Properties:</hi>
In this, to be ſure, they ſerv'd themſelves to purpoſe; for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by <hi>Power,</hi> what they could not get by <hi>Argument,</hi> one Party
became <hi>Judge</hi> of the other, and thruſt them down amongſt the
ſeveral <hi>Herds</hi> of <hi>Tolerated Diſſenters.</hi> And here give me leave to
obſerve a farther Evidence of the peaceable Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of thoſe People; for tho' the <hi>ableſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>learned</hi> in their
<hi>Government,</hi> have all along laugh'd at the <hi>Stoical Fatality</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation-Rigours</hi>
of their Divines, and known what hard meaſure
the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> had met withal; yet never thought
it worth while to have the Debate reviv'd, which might only
revive new <hi>Exaſperations</hi> about inſignificant <hi>Opinions;</hi> or, as I find
it expreſs'd in a late Poem, <hi>for Points by neither Party underſtood.</hi>
On the other ſide, to return home, how differently have theſe
Diſputes been manag'd amongſt us, and how vexatiouſly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued?
<hi>Arminian and Papiſt,</hi> paſs'd a long time for Terms <hi>ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;</hi>
which not only the <hi>Pulpit-Beautifeus,</hi> but ſeveral <hi>Grandees</hi> of
the <hi>Houſe,</hi> maliciouſly apply'd to every <hi>Orthodox Divine,</hi> and indeed
all others, who would not go along with them in thoſe curſed
<hi>Deſolations</hi> they then brought upon <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> which having
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41347:7"/>
wretchedly effected, how did the <hi>Religious Brawl</hi> multiply upon
their Hands? With what implacable Enmity, did the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
and <hi>Independant</hi> proſecute each other? And how violent in their
ſeveral ways, both againſt them, and one another, were the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Spawn of <hi>Equivocal Sects,</hi> which like the overflowing <hi>Nile,</hi>
their <hi>Deluge</hi> of Miſchief ſo fatally produc'd? Inſomuch, as when
<hi>Cromwel</hi> had beſtrid the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and ſet himſelf in the
<hi>Saddle,</hi> he was preſum'd to connive at ſeveral <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England-Congregations,</hi>
both in <hi>Publick Pariſhes,</hi> and <hi>Private Aſſemblies,</hi> in
ſpite to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other <hi>Sectaries,</hi> whom he dreaded
as much as the <hi>Loyal Party;</hi> and did, with reaſon, expect they
ſhould improve thoſe <hi>Calumnies,</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt him,
whereof he had been the grand Promoter againſt their <hi>Righful</hi>
and <hi>Lawful King;</hi> and ſo he found it to his End, which that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
and vexation he met with from <hi>Fanaticks</hi> of all ſorts, and
in all Places, <hi>City, Country,</hi> but eſpecially his <hi>Army,</hi> was preſum'd
to haſten.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, when the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power, the other day, thought
fit to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> them an <hi>Indulgence,</hi> there was a Project ſet on-foot
to make <hi>Two Sticks one,</hi> (to uſe their own <hi>Canting Terms</hi>) and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Propoſals laid down in order thereunto; yet we find them
ſtill ſeparated from one another, and the ſeveral Parties, upon
every little occaſion, dividing among themſelves, tho' much Art
is uſed to ſmother and conceal it: At the beſt, it was but a Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
a <hi>Cord</hi> of <hi>Vanity,</hi> which bound them together, and it held
accordingly; neither can you expect otherwiſe, upon conſideration
of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> which that great <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker</hi> aſſigns of thoſe <hi>Diviſions,</hi>
the <hi>Root from whence their Diſcords ſpring: Come they not hence, even
of our Luſts? Whatever you find to have been the Cauſe of them,</hi>

Spiritual Pride, or a Contentious Diſpoſition, or an Affectation of
Singularity, or Error of Opinion, or Admiration of Mens Perſons, or
a Sowrneſs of Spirit, or an Ambition of drawing Diſciples after us:
Let the Cauſe be what it will, it muſt be remov'd,</hi> &amp;c. All which is
ſooner ſaid than done; ſuch <hi>Pecadillo's,</hi> and of ſo <hi>long</hi> Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
are not eaſily diſlodg'd: Although he might as well have

Now, Sir, whatever Cenſure I may incur from others, my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
is to your ſelf, whether the Account here given of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be any other, than what their daily Practices do ſadly; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41347:8"/>
And if left to their own Culture, and Ingenuity, any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
they ſhould reform? 'Tis grown as cuſtomary, as habitual
with them, to <hi>thwart, contradict,</hi> and <hi>oppoſe,</hi> as with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to <hi>live
quietly,</hi> and <hi>mind their own buſineſs:</hi> From which Diſpoſition of theirs,
I may continue the Diſparity, and obſerve,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How their conſtant <hi>application</hi> to Buſineſs and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
afford them no time to <hi>dream</hi> of <hi>New Lights,</hi> or trouble
themſelves about any other Perſwaſion, as to <hi>Religion,</hi> than what
they were brought up in; For, as at their firſt <hi>Eſtabliſhment,</hi> there
were <hi>Three</hi> predominant Way of Opinion, (I won't ſay Doctrine)
and Worſhip, which they had then Reform'd themſelves into,
<hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> ſo the <hi>Toleration</hi> more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
extended to them, and has been generally continued down
in the ſame Families, from <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Children</hi> ever ſince; neither
is it ſo uſual with them to <hi>flitt up and down,</hi> from one <hi>Maggotty
Perſwaſion</hi> to another, as among us. Thoſe upſtart puny Sects,
which aroſe of later Days, are moſtly Foreign, and moſtly from
<hi>England</hi> too, as the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> firſt, the <hi>Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
after them, then <hi>Quakers, Muggletonians,</hi> and what not?
Who have, prevail'd with ſome of the Natives to be as fooliſh and
mad as themſelves, but not many; and, perhaps, had they been
kept to the ſame Thoughtfulneſs at home for Bread, and all other
Neceſſaries of Life, would not have ſo wantonly gone <hi>a-Whoring
with their own Inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the like reaſon may be given, that there are not ſo many
<hi>Libertines, Atheiſtical, Profane Perſons,</hi> as in many other Parts,
where all <hi>Religions</hi> are <hi>Tolerated:</hi> It cannot ſeem ſtrange there ſhould
be ſome without any; and that there are not more, ſhall not be
attributed ſo much to their <hi>Vertue</hi> as <hi>Neceſſity:</hi> For not only their
<hi>Mechanicks</hi> and <hi>Tradeſmen,</hi> but Perſons of the beſt <hi>Quality,</hi> are
oblig'd to the like Care and Induſtry, as to the Concerns of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life. The Ground on which their many populous Cities
ſtand, is of ſmall Compaſs; and the <hi>Rents</hi> of that little <hi>Land</hi> they
have, are very low, not able to maintain any one in the Port of
a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> (that is, an <hi>Idleman,</hi> which is their Term for that
degree) whereof as there are few <hi>Ancient Families</hi> amongſt them,
ſo the Children of thoſe that are, as likewiſe of their <hi>Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi>
and <hi>Rich Merchants,</hi> are conſtantly brought up to ſome
<hi>Imployment, Military</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> with an <hi>Education</hi> agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
which, together with their Natural Diſpoſition, keeps their
Thoughts <hi>fix'd</hi> upon things really <hi>advantageous;</hi> and ſo you ſhall
generally find them very <hi>intent</hi> upon their <hi>Deſigns,</hi> and <hi>aſſiduous</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41347:8"/>
in their <hi>Application.</hi> Will you give me leave to apply this and
obſerve how oppoſite their Courſe is to that of our <hi>Mercurial Wits,</hi>
who being born to great <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and valued for the great Worth
of thoſe <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> which rais'd them, as if nothing elſe were
wanting which ſhould recommend them to the World, think
themſelves above any ſerious <hi>Application,</hi> either as to Buſineſs, or
Knowledge. I need not tell you now little, or no, <hi>Education</hi> our
<hi>young Maſter</hi> has from his very Cradle; how careful the good
<hi>Lady-Mother</hi> is, he ſhould not be kept in too much at <hi>School;</hi> what
a fruitleſs Figure he makes in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity;</hi> and when he comes
up to the <hi>Extravagancies</hi> of the Town, is as much for living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>ſober Sence,</hi> as our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> above <hi>Ordinances.</hi> God forbid
this ſhould be a <hi>General Rule;</hi> yet it could be wiſh'd there were more
<hi>Exceptions,</hi> than daily Experience will permit us; to obſerve: <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Life,</hi> tho' not ſo much clamour'd for, is as much in Vogue
as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the one doubtleſs conſequent of the
other: For the practical <hi>Atheiſt</hi> hath been ever thought to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Speculation;</hi> and when Men are left free to all <hi>Religions,</hi>
that is the proper time to ſet up for none. I remember, during
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> the <hi>Leviathan-Doctrine</hi> was firſt ſtarted; and
as ſome <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of too good Parts, unleſs better employ'd, were
induſtrious to cultivate and improve it, ſo many of our <hi>Airy
Sparks</hi> about <hi>Town,</hi> and elſewhere, became their <hi>ſordid Imitators:</hi>
Nothing would go down with them, but a <hi>State of War,</hi> with a
total Abolition of all <hi>difference between Good and Evil, Right and
Wrong.</hi> Now, whether it was their being <hi>weary,</hi> or <hi>aſham'd,</hi> of
ſuch unreaſonable <hi>Notions,</hi> or an affectation of <hi>Novelty,</hi> the delight
of <hi>vain Minds, Deiſm</hi> ſeems to have ſuperſeded that, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
at preſent the Darling-Subject of every young <hi>Libertine</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
who will preſume to expoſe, and run down <hi>Reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
with all Confidence imaginable, altho' the little <hi>Impertinent</hi>
never thought a ſober hour in its life; and underſtands the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi>
of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> no farther, than that his own <hi>Brains</hi>
are in a <hi>continual Hurry:</hi> Not but that theſe <hi>Engines</hi> too are ſet on

ſhall we place them? They have the ſame <hi>Plea</hi> to be conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

being able to vie, in either Particular, with any of their differing
<hi>Factions,</hi> and, for ought I ſee, in a ſhort time, may outdo them
all; ſince daily Experience aſſures us 'tis the laſt reſult of <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Zeal;</hi> for being <hi>over-heated,</hi> and <hi>weary,</hi> with running its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Courſes</hi> of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> it ſits down in the end, and
centres here. And yet, all this while, the reſt will not ſee what
a fine Thread they have ſpun for themſelves, as well as us;
whilſt the one are undermining the <hi>Church of England,</hi> theſe others
are doing the ſame to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> Altho', to ſpeak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
the <hi>Latitude</hi> ſome <hi>Divines</hi> have taken, as to the <hi>Socinian,</hi>
and other Points of like Nature, muſt be acknowledg'd not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
conducing to this Grand <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> ſo readily will <hi>Corrupt Minds</hi>
improve bad <hi>Principles,</hi> deny thoſe <hi>Myſteries</hi> by wholeſale, which
ſome Mens <hi>raſh</hi> and <hi>nice Enquiries</hi> had made more perplex'd and
intricate, than the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of True <hi>Religion</hi> ſtands in need of,
or did ever deſign. And this, Sir, is the reſult of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited
Toleration;</hi> which going on at this rate, (unleſs the <hi>Pater Noſter</hi>
Men interpoſe their <hi>Inquiſition</hi>) muſt neceſſarily <hi>end</hi> in a <hi>Sit anima mea
cum Philoſophis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another thing which makes the <hi>Dutch Toleration</hi> ſit
the more <hi>eaſie,</hi> is, That Their <hi>Government</hi> is moſt <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>

Yet that we are under theſe very Circumſtances, I need not tell

there is little of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Truſt</hi> in the ordinary Tranſactions of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life:</hi> Our <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> is in a very precarious Condition,
what with the <hi>Latitude</hi> of their new Notions, and the advantage to
be taken from the <hi>Perplexity,</hi> the <hi>Niceties</hi> of our <hi>Laws,</hi> with the
little <hi>Tricks</hi> of Practice, ſo ſhamefully now a-days <hi>alla-mode,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigning
<hi>Integrity</hi> can ſcarce tell whom to truſt, and is frequently
at a loſs, either to <hi>recover Right,</hi> or <hi>repel Wrong:</hi> Neither will it be
ever otherwiſe, as long as ſo many <hi>Law-jobbing Make-bates</hi> are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to ſwarm in every <hi>County</hi> throughout the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Were
<hi>Grievances</hi> to be <hi>redreſs'd</hi> by their Malignity and <hi>epidemick</hi> Contagion,
I know no one thing ſooner to be conſider'd; that it is otherwiſe,
you and I cannot help. In ſhort, Sir, a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>Regular Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Laws,</hi> is the Life and Soul of any <hi>Government.</hi> Take theſe
two different Inſtances: In the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> we find the
<hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> ſolely eſtabliſh'd, with the <hi>Rigour,</hi> tho' not
the Name, of that <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> which was the moſt plauſible
<hi>Plea</hi> for their firſt <hi>Defection:</hi> On the other ſide, in <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
there is a general <hi>Toleration;</hi> both which, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of
the one, and <hi>Indulgence</hi> of the other, are ſupported, and kept up,
by a vigorous Execution of ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> as were thought moſt proper
thereunto; and if either, the latter are the more exact and ſevere,
by reaſon it is ſo natural for different <hi>Opinions</hi> to claſh with, and
<hi>thwart</hi> each other; ſo far are they from admitting them into the
<hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> giving the leaſt way to <hi>New Lights,</hi> and <hi>Fanciful Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſms</hi>
there, as well knowing ſuch a <hi>Freedom</hi> is enough to make any
<hi>Government</hi> as <hi>monſtrous</hi> as that <hi>Picture,</hi> which had an <hi>Hanc Populus</hi>
affix'd.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I ſhall only add farther, that the <hi>Dutch Toleration</hi> was
eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> when Men had a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and unfeigned <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Truth of Religion, deſired nothing
more than to have her <hi>free'd</hi> from <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> ſuch
ſpurious <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and burthenſome <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as ruſt of Time,
neglect of Enquiry, and, above all, the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of <hi>Papal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
had impos'd upon the World, and for ſeveral <hi>Centuries</hi> together
made paſs for <hi>Catholick.</hi> Now, altho' this <hi>Zeal</hi> was not always <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Knowledge,</hi> the different, and, in ſome Places, not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
<hi>Methods</hi> which were taken, did much <hi>obſtruct,</hi> ay, and <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi>
ſo good an Undertaking; yet the maint Point being gain'd in
ſhaking off the <hi>Roman Yoke,</hi> whether out of <hi>Intereſt, Prudence,</hi> or
<hi>Piety,</hi> I ſhall not determine, Men generally ſat down abundantly

a juncture for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> Provinces, as perhaps no Age will be ever
able to <hi>paralell.</hi> For the <hi>Spaniſh Intereſt</hi> prevaling in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and
<hi>Flanders,</hi> with the <hi>Walloon Provinces,</hi> whoever could; or would not
ſubmit, retreated hither, as likewiſe great multitudes out of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Germany;</hi> which made them the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of all People pretending to the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> the
only thing then deſired, and in the enjoyment whereof (whether
well or ill-inform'd we are not now to enquire) they were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

            <p>How much the World (eſpecially amongſt us) is <hi>cool'd</hi> as to ſuch

might authorize the groſſeſt Impieties, their wilful <hi>Perjuries,</hi>
and <hi>ſeditious</hi> Practices, the Violation of <hi>Publick Laws,</hi> and <hi>diſturbance</hi>
of <hi>Publick</hi> Peace, even to a moſt unnatural <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and execrable
<hi>Regicide:</hi> This, Sir, impartially ſpeaking, is undeniable Matter of
Fact; and if ever the Nation returns to its <hi>Wits</hi> again, <hi>ſober Sence,</hi>
and <hi>ſound Principles,</hi> ſuch <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will be <hi>recorded</hi> with a very
<hi>black</hi> Character, the Reproach not only of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but of
every thing which tends to true <hi>Religion,</hi> like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſacrificing all to their own groſs, <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi>
ſordid <hi>Avarice,</hi> and ſelf-will'd Ambition; and God grant they do
not bring the like <hi>fatal End upon our Place and Nation:</hi> The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
apprehenſion whereof makes not only my hand, but my heart,
tremble; and, amid'ſt ſuch <hi>melancholy</hi> Reflections, wiſh to have
been born in an Age, when <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> had had the Aſcendent of

ſtand, you know the Cloſe of that Old <hi>Rhime, Knaves and Fools
will quite undoe us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither can our Proſpect be much better, if we look upon the
<hi>Reformation</hi> abroad: What a ſtrange Indifferency have ſome <hi>Great
Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> lately diſcover'd? And how groſs the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi>
of others? To be ſure, where there was a <hi>General Toleration</hi>
of <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> together, with the ſeveral other differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſwaſions, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Arrians, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly extirpated, as in <hi>Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> the Two <hi>Auſtria's,
Poland,</hi> &amp;c. or in a fair Tendency thereunto, as at preſent in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41347:10"/>
               <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania:</hi> In all which Places they were very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous;
but what with contending amongſt themſelves, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating,</hi>
or <hi>oppoſing</hi> the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Government,</hi> they have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worm'd, or beaten out, with all the contempt and eaſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
And that the ſame Deſign is carrying on amongſt us, and
the ſame Event expected, they muſt be wilfully blind who do not
ſee, what with <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> on the
other, the no-<hi>Reality</hi> of ſuch as pretend moſt, and great <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi>
of all the reſt; as we are naturally prone to fall into Extreams,
ſo we ſeem ſtrangely diſpos'd (and the more, becauſe unwilling to
believe it, to fall into that which we have all along pretended moſt
vehemently to avoid.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, have I <hi>impartially,</hi> and perhaps too <hi>freely,</hi> told you
what I know, and what I think of the <hi>Dutch Toleration;</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this <hi>Freedom,</hi> it had been impoſſible to ſet you in a <hi>True Light,</hi>
ſo as to diſcover the groſs miſtakes of our <hi>Commonwealth</hi> Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who are always admiring the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> with the Excellent
<hi>Adminiſtration</hi> People live under there; which nevertheleſs they
underſtand no more, than how the <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> is
now manag'd during the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Abſence; and the many <hi>Projects</hi> they
are ſo troubleſome withal, both in <hi>Theory and Practice,</hi> are as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
thereunto, as one <hi>Pole</hi> to the other: Yet, ſince things are
brought to that paſs, as a <hi>Toleration</hi> muſt be, give me leave to tell
you, that venturing in any other than a <hi>Dutch</hi> Bottom, will <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck</hi>
the whole <hi>Cargo;</hi> that is, without a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> keeping the
<hi>Magiſtracy</hi> in ſuch hands as ſhall be of one <hi>Piece, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous</hi>
in the <hi>Management</hi> thereof; for which I ſhall briefly lay
down theſe following Reaſons, and ſo end your Trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> We ſhall have ſome Face of <hi>Government</hi> in an <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Religion;</hi> which I mention ſolely upon a <hi>Civil Account,</hi> and
that not only in regard to the outward <hi>Decorum,</hi> (which yet ought
to be conſider'd) but the abſolute Neceſſity thereof, as the only
means of preventing thoſe continual <hi>Contraſts</hi> and <hi>Caballings,</hi> which
the ſeveral <hi>Factions</hi> will have one againſt another; and if admitted
to <hi>Debates,</hi> all together againſt that which is uppermoſt; the
Miſchief, and Inconveniencies whereof, can no other way be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd,
than by fixing the <hi>Ruling Power</hi> in one Perſwaſion, to
whom it ſhall ſolely appertain to take care of the whole, ſee the
ſeveral <hi>Parties</hi> enjoy their private <hi>Opinions,</hi> without the leaſt Infra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon our <hi>Publick Peace.</hi> On the other ſide, let us reflect, firſt,
upon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndecency</hi> of the thing, how prepoſterous it muſt ſeem
to any Man of <hi>Sence,</hi> whether <hi>Native</hi> or <hi>Foreigner,</hi> that the <hi>Sword</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41347:11"/>
ſhould dance attendance from one Place to another, according to the
<hi>Caprice</hi> of each prevailing <hi>Faction:</hi> This Year's <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> has a
<hi>Conſcience</hi> of ſuch <hi>Latitude,</hi> as to <hi>Trim</hi> it between <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,</hi>
without the leaſt regret; whereas his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> may have
one ſo <hi>ſqueamiſh,</hi> and <hi>ſtreight-lac'd,</hi> as not to come within the Sound
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Organ,</hi> or under the roof of that <hi>Sumptuous,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Superſtitious Structure.</hi> But then too having got the <hi>Sword</hi> to go
their own way, how ſtrangely muſt it wander up and down, as
each Party prevail to get into the <hi>Chair;</hi> one Year it muſt attend
a <hi>Presbyterian</hi>-Meeting, the next, perhaps, will fall to the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's</hi>
Lot, and the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> will ill reſent it to go without
their turn; nay, we are not ſure but the <hi>Quakers</hi> may put in their
Claim, and without any Offence to the <hi>Inward-Man,</hi> deſire it
ſhould attend their <hi>Motions</hi> on a bulk in <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet.</hi> This,
Sir, I take to be as <hi>Natural</hi> to the aſpiring <hi>Spirits</hi> of thoſe ſeveral
<hi>Schiſmatical Herds,</hi> as <hi>Milk</hi> to a <hi>Calf,</hi> and they will <hi>low</hi> as much
if kept without it; yet how decent this will be, how unbecoming
the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Gravity</hi> of any <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> I leave for you, and the
World to judge. However that of <hi>Publick Security</hi> is much more to
be conſider'd; for whatever <hi>Pleas</hi> may be alledg'd, or <hi>Proteſtations</hi>
made, we know how things went, when the <hi>weak Conſcience</hi> had
got the <hi>ſtrongeſt Sword, Dominion was then founded in Grace,</hi> and the

Subjection all the Powers of Darkneſs.</hi>

two ſuch ſervile reſpects as <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Humour.</hi> Neither are we
to deſpair, but it may work a <hi>Reformation</hi> in the Perſons themſelves;
for generally when Men get nothing by acting the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> they
care no longer to wear the <hi>Vizard,</hi> chuſe rather to appear as they

ſince <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Deceit</hi> has fail'd in thoſe Advantages, which were

whatever the Event be as to them, I am confident you are ſatisfied

are prone to interpoſe in the moſt weighty <hi>Tranſactions,</hi>

And if any one objects this would be too great an Invaſion
upon their <hi>Liberties,</hi> I ſhall only reply, as at firſt, 'tis no more than
what their admired Neighbours the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> did upon their own
accord, to prevent the dangerous Conſequences of their many <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

Men, who knew better how to act for the <hi>Common Welfare</hi> than
themſelves: But whether many, or few (for this propounds only
the excluſion of ſome, no alteration in the whole <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> as
well knowing neither <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> nor <hi>Polygarchy</hi> will do with us, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there be zealous Pretenders to both) ſo they be all of one
Piece, Buſineſs will go on much the ſmoother, and be ſooner brought
to a Concluſion: And therefore give me leave to transferr St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Compariſon, from the <hi>Church</hi> to the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> it being equally
dangerous to them both, as in the <hi>Natural:</hi> If the <hi>Head</hi> be a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>

ſundry pretty <hi>Crotchets,</hi> which in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> hang out for
