            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Whose coate became thy cloake for each deceite,</l>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20040:11"/>
whereas the more inland parts of the Countrey
are somewhat scorched with ouer-much heate,
this bloweth many coole blasts from the snowy
neighboring mountaines; whence flowes good
store of water enriching the ground with grasse,
and beautifying the fields with a continuall
greennesse. Beyond this village westward about
a mile, at the foote of an high hill in an inclosed
valley, seuen leagues from <hi>Madrid,</hi> stands that
stately pile dedicated to the honor of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Laurence,</hi>
being the labour of foure and twenty yeeres, a
building of incredible cost and magnificence, and
such, as no former age could paralell; So that it
may iustly be accounted one of the greatest won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of this latter world. Besides the charges of
rich vestments, massy vessels of gold and siluer,
and other pretious furniture, it stood the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> (according to his booke of accounts) in one
thousand two hundred Sesterces, which makes
about three millions of money, or (according to
others) nine millions of pounds. The whole fabrik
is built in a square, except on that side toward the
Kings Pallace and on the backside of the Church,
looking towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> which seemes to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a cradle or gridiron vpon which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Laurence</hi>
was broyled: Euery side but this extending two
hundred and twenty paces: Some account the
whole length of it (from North to South) no lesse
then seuen hundred and twenty feete, and from
East to West (according to the common measure)
fiue hundred and seuenty. Each corner of the
building is garded with a faire tower made more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20040:11"/>
for neatnesse then strength, and beautified (from
the bottome to the top) with many faire win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.
The whole fabricke may be diuided in
three parts: On the South side stands the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Monks of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierome,</hi> which takes vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
one halfe of it. Toward the Northside stands
the Colledge for yonger nouices of the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">

               </note>
and forreigne children, chosen and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the King at a common table among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Somewhat Eastward stands the Kings
owne Pallace, being his Mansion house in the
summer time.</p>
            <p>Before you come to this stately edifice, you
may first obserue on the outside lying before it,
an open walke, beginning from the westside of
the Monastery, and thence compassing all the
Northside, being two hundred foote broade on
the West part betweene the Monastery, and the
partition, and one hundred and forty foote broad
on the North, all beautified with a faire pauement
of small square stones. In the middest according
to the length of the building, on that side where
the adioyning mountaine ouer-lookes it: A faire
great gate opens it selfe betweene eight huge
pillars on both sides of it, one aboue another, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which are foure other lesser pillars, and in the
midst of the front stands a curious statue of S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
This great gate opens to the Church, the
Monastery, and the Colledge. On both sides of
it are other lesser gates. That on the right hand
affordes a passage to the chops of mechanicall arts
for the vse of the Colledge. That on the left
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20040:12"/>
opens a way to the lodgings of the younger Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
or Nouices.</p>
            <p>On the same side also is a lesser gate, through
which you may passe into the Kings Palace. In a
faire front, ouer the entrance to the Church,
stand vpon their pillars and bases, the statues of
sixe Kings of Israel, each of them eighteene foot
high, whose heads and hands are of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the rest of a courser stone. Let vs enter now
into the interiour parts of this goodly Fabricke;
and first when you are vp the staires which leade
to the chiefe entrance of the Church, a large
open walke offers it selfe vnto your view, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Monastery from the Colledge. In this
walke are broad steps all along, which leade to
the entrance of the Church, and thence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
open Plaine, and so to a narrow Alley, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
which those of the Monastery on the one
side, and those of the Colledge on the other, may
passe to the Church, and from thence into the
lower station of the Quire. Now the place where
this Quire stands, is foure-square, hauing three
great Alleyes, or Iles, or Cloysters in the square,
which are accounted for the Nauis, or body of
the Church. Adioyning to this place of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermost
Quire, is an open Court on both sides,
from which the lower Quire it selfe, and two
Chappels scituated towards those two Courts,
receiue their light. Aboue this lower Quire
stands the Church it selfe, with its proper Quire
also; which Church (besides the vpper and lower
stations of the Quire, and the great Chappell) is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20040:12"/>
fouresquare of it selfe, and is sustained by foure
pillars, and other necessary props, and it hath
three collaterall Alleys or Cloysters, after the
manner of the former. In this Church are two
paire of faire Organs, hauing each of them two
and thirty registers or keyes. This Church also
hath no lesse then sixe and thirty Altars, and a
stately dore, by which they goe into a large vault
at the time of Supplications and diuine Orisons;
This Church is higher then the inferiour Quire
by thirty foot, and the Quire of that is so much
higher then the Church. The pauement of the
Church, as likewise of the vpper and lower
Quire, is checquered with white and black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
In the roofe of the Quire are expressed by
the Painter the Sunne, Moone and Starres, with
all the hoste of Heauen in most glorious manner,
and on the walles the portraitures of diuers and
sundry vertues, and some histories of S. <hi>Laurence</hi>
and S. <hi>Hierome.</hi> The seates are all made of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wood of diuers kinds and colours in Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian
worke. On the Southside of the Church is
a faire Porch, arched and beautified with diuers
pictures. In this Porch is a cleare Fountaine, built
about with Iasper and Marble, hauing seuen cocks
and cisternes, where the Monkes vse to wash their
hands, when they goe to celebrate their diuine
Seruice. The pauement also of this Porch is chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
with white and blacke Marble.</p>
            <p>The Vestry is next, a stately place, all arched
and paued as the former. The chests, and presses,
and other places where they keepe their holy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20040:13"/>
Vests, and ornaments of the Altars, are all made
of precious wood, the walles couered with histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
pictures. From this Vestry they ascend by
many steps vnto the high Altar. The place where
this Altar stands is fouresquare, and paued with
Iaspar of diuers colours. In the same place are
certaine Oratories, built for great Princes to
heare Masse, which Oratories are distinguished
into foure little Chappels, and adorned both on
the walles and pauement with checkered Iaspar.
This place where the Altar stands, is ten foot
higher then the Church, and they goe downe
from hence to the Church by certaine steps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great Chappell all of Iaspar. Through
this holy place (as they cal it) they go into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquary,
where are kept diuers precious reliques
of the Saints (forsooth) and shut vp in their cofers
or boxes. The like Reliquary is on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
also, full of many rare monuments.</p>
            <p>On the one side of the high Altar is a little
house, wherein is distributed the holy Eucharist,
a place of great holinesse and deuotion surely, On
the walls of this house are curiously painted foure
histories out of the old Testament, shadowing out
this holy Sacrament; In the roofe is portrayde
the Rainebow in the clouds with many Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
and Seraphins about it.</p>
            <p>Betweene this house and the high Altar stands
the Sacristia, within which is the Custodia of
the holy Eucharist (as they call it) This place is
built vpon eight pillars of Iaspar of a yellowish
colour, with some veines or streakes of white;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20040:13"/>
This Iaspar is so hard and excellent that it cannot
be polished but with Adamant. The barres and
chapiters wrought with flowers, are all made of
gilded mettall; On the bases which hang ouer
the wreathes stand eight statues of the Apostles,
the other foure stand in other hollow places
thereabout. Those twelue statues are cut and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen
with admirable Art, and are guilded by
fire. The pauement of this Sacristia is layd with
diuers kindes of Iaspar, and wrought in gilded
mettall with Mesaique worke. The two leaue
dores of this holy place, are made of the best rock
christall included in guilded mettall, and are so
transparent, that the inner Sacristia or Custodia
wherein the holy Eucharist is kept, may easily be
discerned. This peece by those that haue seene it,
and all other rare peeces in the world, is thought
to bee the most exquisite and admirable. The
maine contriuer of this curious fabricke was that
famous Arcitect <hi>Iacobus de Frizzo,</hi> who spent se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
whole yeeres in cutting and polishing those
Iaspers.</p>
            <p>Now are we come to the high Altar it selfe, a
worke no lesse noble and artificiall, built all of
fine Iasper and marble, whereon are placed many
crosses, candlestickes and other pretious orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This Altar is beautified with many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pictures and foure high places for the said
pictures, whereof some are higher then other.
In the lowest, betweene two painted tables, is the
place where the Custodia stands. On each side of
it are two statues, representing the foure Doctors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20040:14"/>
of the Church, <hi>Hierome, Augustine, Gregory,</hi> and
<hi>Ambrose.</hi> This Custodia is of pure Iasper, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with flowers ingrauen in Iasper of diuers
colours, vpon which as vpon their Bases stand all
the other statues and columnes of greene and
yeallowish Iasper, with their feete and chapiters
of guilded mettall. The square tablets vpon the
chapiters, as also the wreathes, and borders, and
globes, are made of a more refined and party co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Iasper. What shall I say more? The whole
peece is composed of the richest Iasper of seuerall
colours, with mettals cast and guilded.</p>
            <p>Next to the pictures of the second high place
or hollow, are two other statues on each side, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the foure Euangelists. After the same
order on the third high place are placed on each
side, two other statues, one of S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the other of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> the tutelary Saint
of the house of Burgundy. On the vppermost high
place are the images of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> The
innermost Sacristia or Custodia (as they call it)
wherein the holy Sacrament or body of Christ
(as they say) is preserued, is made wih the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
artifice that could be diuised. It hath foure
pillars of the purest Iasper, whose bases and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters
are of pure wrought gold, and so are the
tablets, and borders, and wreathes, and flowers,
all about the Custodia. Heere and there also are
placed many shining Emralds. The feete of those
pillars are of the same stone, engraued, and inlaid
with gold in diuers places. Three little square
pilasters which sustaine the feete of the other pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20040:14"/>
are of siluer and gilt, the ground-worke or
foundation of the whole is composed of the same
stone, interlaced with gilded mettall. The tablets
and squares of the pillars or pyramids, are of the
same materials with the pillars, the champhering
whereof is all of wrought gold. The priamids
are made of the richest Iasper of a dusky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
The little speares or bals on the top, are of
fine wrought gold. The hinges and borders of
the two leaue dores, are siluer, and gilt. The doores
themselues are of rocke Christall. That side of it
toward the Church hath a large square window
of the same. The two other sides are adorned
with vari-coloured Iasper, and inlayd with pure
gold. With the very same materials and artifice
is the inside beautified. In the midst of the roofe
hangs a precious Topaze, wherein is layd vp the
consecrated body of Christ (as they beleeue) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in a boxe of pretious Arhate.</p>
            <p>We haue seene the Church, now followes a
description of the Monastery if selfe. In the great
walke before the common entrance into the
Church, there is a gate opening a passage into the
common Porch of this Monastery; passing
through this porch, you come to a tower where
the bells hang, together with a curious clocke
shewing both the naturall and planetary houres;
This tower is erected from the very groundwork
of the Church toward the Monastery, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by another right opposite, there is a way
also from this porch of the Monastery to a faire
parlour, for the resort of those that would haue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20040:15"/>
conference with the Monkes. Next to this, is a
most stately and magnificent stairecase with a
roofe and couering answerable. Next these staires
adioynes a Chappell, where their masse was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
while the Church was building, here is
also a closet where the Records and writings of
the Monastery are carefully preserued. Through
the same great porch you passe into the Court
of the Monastery, thence to the vault, and so to
another Court where vnder ground, is kept all
the raine-water, which gathers together in that
place. Betwixt these two, a faire arch is erected,
together with a closet of excellent workmanship,
where many necessary implements are layd vp.</p>
            <p>From this porch also, there is a passage to the
porch of the refectory, whereto is adioyned a
closet, or wardrobe, where their vestments are
kept, which closet and porch also, be vaulted and
arched with a great deale of art and couriositie.
This porch is eight square, hauing eight win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
by which all the galleries adioyning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
their light. In the middest of that porch is
a pleasant fountaine, whose conduits and aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
are of Iasper. The refectory or dining
roome of the Monks, is a most magnificent piece.
Next to the chamber of the Keeper of the robes,
is a way to another chamber, for the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of strangers: next this the Kitchin, with the
porch of it, wherein beside many other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
are diuers fountaines of hot and cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
To the refectory is ioyned the Cloyster of
the Hospitall wherein are two great cisternes. The
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20040:15"/>
Hospitall it selfe is ioyned to this Cloyster, whose
dining roome reaches to the Kitchin Porch. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
these foresaid places, there are three other
houses, wherein are made and conserued all those
things, which pertaine to the distillation of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
That Walke which leades from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
to the Hospitall, is for them that are recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from their diseases, to exercise themselues
therein.</p>
            <p>From that great Porch aforesaid, is another
passage to the vault, where daily orizons are said.
Here are pourtrayd the Histories of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
from the Annunacition of the blessed
Virgin to the second comming of Christ. In the
midst of this fouresquare Vault, or Cloyster, is a
pleasant Garden, distinguished into diuers beds
and knots most curiously. In the midst of it, is
a pretty fabricke of eight corners, representing
the forme of a Church, built of a blacke stone,
and adorned on the inside with diuers coloured-Iasper.
In foure of the corners stand foure great
Giants, vomiting water into foure marble ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternes.
In the middest of this Arbor lyes the
principall path of the Garden. Now from the
said Vault you passe to the Chapter-house, and an
other house like it. These two roomes, together
with their Porch, haue their roofes set forth with
most exquisite pictures, and their pauement chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
with white and blacke Marble; round
about them are seates for the Monkes, and each
hath his sumptuous Altar. The way to the Monks
Cells, is from the great Porch also, wherein by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20040:16"/>
winding staires you ascend to the Priors vpper
Cells, and other chambers and cocklofts beside,
all couered with Lead. The Priors lower habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is an excellent building, all vaulted and
archt, exhibiting diuers Histories of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are included in artificiall Crownes
and studds wrought with flowers, the pauement
also is checquered with white and black Marble.
The Priors vpper Cell is built toward the North
West, on both sides of which are the Cells of
the other Monkes. The Chamber, or Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
where the Nouices lodge, ioynes to the
Monkes Cells. The Monkes beds are all in a
row ouer the Wardrobe and Refectory.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Library, which is seated
aboue the chiefe entrance to the Monastery. It is
one hundred fourescore and fiue foot long, and
two and thirty foot broad, in whose arched roofe
are the representations of diuers Arts and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
to which place is adioyned another roome
for the vse of the Library. The Library it selfe is
distinguished into three partitions. In the first
and principall are painted and delineated all the
Arts and faculties; and at the foot of euery ones
picture, all the bookes of that facultie, marshalled
in seemely order, all gilt, and of the same binding.
Here is to bee seene a great parchment booke,
wherein are exactly expressed in their proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
all kind of liuing creatures which are
knowne to be in the world.</p>
            <p>The other partition containes nothing but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Manuscripts of Diuinity, in Latine, Greeke,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20040:16"/>
and Hebrew, with the pictures of their seuerall
Authors set before them. Likewise the third
roome is furnished onely with Manuscripts of
diuers faculties and languages, the Authors
whereof are in like manner expressed to the
life.</p>
            <p>Let vs come in the next place to describe the
Colledge, and the Kings Palace. These two take
vp the North part of the building. Their Porch
or entrance, is an open Gallery which lyes before
the Church, right ouer against the great Porch of
the Monastery. To this Porch is ioyned another,
by which the Youth which apply themselues to
learning, passe daily into a little roome to heare
Mattens and Vespers. This place is shut vp with
three brazen grates. In the great Court separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Colledge from the Monastery, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
passage to the Schooles, where are taught
all Arts, but especially Law, Physick, and Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>This place hath its peculiar Courts, and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Galleries, to one of which adioynes the
Refectory of the Colledge with its Porch. Neere
the Porch stands the Kitchen, betweene its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Court, &amp; the Court of the common Schoole,
to which is ioyned the Childrens Schoole, and
their Refectory. On the Northside thorow a
narrow gate and entry, is a passage to the Kings
Palace. In the Porch or entrance, are three Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
or Offices with their Courts, built partly
for those which ouersee the purueiance of corne
and victuals, and partly for the vse of the Kitchin.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20040:17"/>
These houses are ioyned together for the seruice
of diuers tables.</p>
            <p>By the same Porch is a way to a faire roome,
where the Nobles of the Kings bed-chamber, the
Captaine of the Guard, with others of Noble
ranke and quality dine and sup daily. This way
also you may passe to the Galleries, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
belonging to diet and workmanship. Those
Galleries round about containe other chambers
both aboue, and below. On the same side is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Portall, by which they passe from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
to the lower Quire, Church, Colledge, and
Monastery. Neere this gate is a walke where the
Kings Watch, and other officers vse to meete.
Toward the Eastside are lodgings for Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
which reach to the great Porch, and run out
as farre as the Palace. In the same Court are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
houses for the Kings owne vse, and from
hence by a Gallery thorow a stately Portall you
enter into the Kings owne lodgings, built behind
the Chappell, where you meet with an open
Court, with Porches and Cloysters. On the West
side next the high Altar is another Gate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the King passes to the Monastery, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and other offices of the Court. The Kings
Porch lookes towards the Northside of the
Church. Hereupon the Church wall is curiously
painted the famous battell of <hi>Higuervela,</hi> wherein
King <hi>Iohn</hi> the second ouerthrew the Moores and
Saracens of <hi>Granado.</hi> Which picture represents
the story most exactly, and to the life, and shewes
both the order and manner of their fight, with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20040:17"/>
the seuerall habits and weapons both of Horse
and Foote which were then in vse. This picture
was drawne from the first copy, which was made
at the time of the battell in a faire linnen cloth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
one hundred and thirty foote long, and
found since by chance in the Tower of <hi>Segouia,</hi>
which History the Kings Maiesty caused to bee
painted againe vpon that wall for a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of so noble a victory. This piece is
well worth the sight.</p>
            <p>In the last place we come vnto the Garden, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward the East and Southpart of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
It reaches one hundred in breadth, and is
distinguished into many pretty knots and beds,
set with all kind of herbs and flowers, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with many pleasant Springs and Fountaines.
This Garden is much higher then the Orchard
adioyning, and you ascend from hence thither by
a walke of many staires, set with trees on both
sides.</p>
            <p>There are accounted to bee aboue forty Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of pure water within the walles of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.</p>
            <p>There are so many Closets and Keyes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Monastery, that there is a speciall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
appointed to be Master of the Keyes, which
Keyes are kept in a Closet by themselues, and are
esteemed to exceed some thousands.</p>
            <p>The third part of this famous Monastery of
Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> is possessed by 300. Monkes of the
Order of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> whose yeerely Reuenues
amount to aboue 35000. Spanish Ducats, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20040:18"/>
rest goes to the King and his family.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it is furnished with so many
Halles, Parlors, Dining-roomes, Chambers, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
Offices, Lodgings, and other necessarie
Roomes, that it may well suffice foure Kings
at once to keepe their Courts in. There are
certaine credible reports of men of credit and
vnderstanding, that some yeeres after that King
<hi>Philip</hi> the second had begun this great worke, he
comming thither with the Earle of <hi>Lemos,</hi> and
hauing shewed him the plot, and disclosed his
purpose in the finishing of so great a work, which
would amount to an incredible charge: he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Earle to tell him freely what he thought
of the Worke. The Earle stoutly, and with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spirit, answered the King, saying; Your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
as you are the greatest Monarch of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
so are you reputed the wisest among
Kings: now considering the great charge that
your Maiesty is at in your warres in Italy, in
France, and the Low-Countries, with the Great
Turke, and elsewhere: together with your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and extraordinary expences, and the likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of warres with the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> All
these things considered; it would bee a blemish
to your wisedome in the World, If your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
should goe forward with this Building: and
the charges will make you sinke before it bee
finished.</p>
            <p>The King replied notwithstanding all his wars
and other charges, Hee would goe on with this;
and hoped by the grace of God to see it finished,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20040:18"/>
to take pleasure and comfort in it in his life, the
which hee did, and enioyed it seeuen yeeres, and
that after his death it should bee a Receptacle for
his bones, and likewise for the Kings that should
succeed him; to be for a Court in their liues, and
for their Funerall after their deaths.</p>
            <p>Likewise it is crediblely reported, that when
the worke was finished, and the Officers brought

tongue as also to view the vniuersitie of <hi>Sallaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>)
departed with leaue from the Embassadour, to
reside for some space there. But not long after,
being importuned by Master <hi>Charles Maynard</hi>
brother to my Lord <hi>Maynard,</hi> and Master <hi>Edward
Filmer</hi> sonne to Sir <hi>Edward Filmer</hi> then, at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>
to suruey other parts of Spaine as <hi>Granado,

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20040:19"/>
brother then to the gouernour of <hi>Madrid,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it of him at his arriuall there. Thus depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from <hi>Sallamanca,</hi> came to <hi>Madrid</hi> to my Lord
Embassadours house, and some 3. weekes after his
comming went at the day appointed to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
house to receiue his money, and because
he was not well experienced in the brasse coyne;
tooke with him a seruant to on Master <hi>Prinn,</hi> an
English Merchant. Now there stood readie at
the Gouernors house a familiar of the Spanish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
who saluted Master <hi>Roe</hi> very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and asked him if he were not the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that was to receiue such a summe of money
of his Master; and said that his Master comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to attend his comming, and that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was readie some halfe a dozen houses off, If
he pleased to take paines to goe thither. Master
<hi>Roe</hi> little fearing any treacherie went with this
fellow, who by his apparell seemed <hi>Hombre de bien.</hi>
They come quickly to a faire house; where
the familiar carries M. <hi>Roe</hi> into an vpper roome,
where were some sixteene <hi>todos vestidos de negro

who seemed to bee the chiefe amongst them; and
the Master of the house, he very kindly salutes
Master <hi>Roe,</hi> asked him if he were not such a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

where he lay. Master <hi>Roe</hi> all this while fearing
nothing, pluckes out his bills of Exchange to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his money, and tells him that he lay in the
English Embassadours house: hee asketh him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe of this last point; Master <hi>Roe</hi> still
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20040:20"/>
answered him as before. Whereupon hee for the
present leaues Master <hi>Roe,</hi> &amp; consults (aside in the
same roome) with some of his fellowes, and comes
againe to Master <hi>Roe,</hi> &amp; tels him that he must haue
patience, and that he was taken Prisoner by the
spanish Inquisition. A second (with a great deale
of complementall grauitie) tooke his sword. A
third pickt his pockets, emptying him of all his
money and papers. A fourth brings a smith vnto
him, to fetter his legges with weightie Iuyues.
A fift was inquisitiue to know if he had any riding
clothes to trauell in: who told him he had at the
Embassadours house, which made them shake
their heads in token of feare to fetch them thence.
Heere they deteined him from two of the Clock
in the afternoone, till eleuen (or thereabouts) at
night: which time they set him sidewayes (by
reason of his fettered legges) on a Mule: attended
by a guard of some forty in number, who brought
him safe out of the towne on his iourney; and
then the greater part of them returned to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi>
But the first place I rested in was called,
<hi>Torede Ladronis,</hi> in English, the Towre of Theeues
(where the Captaine of the Guard comforted
him, but withall in delusion, tould him that
hee should be eased of his fetters the next day)
and from thence they continued their iourney
to <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> where on the way they met with
a flemmish Gentleman riding to <hi>Madrid,</hi> one
acquainted with Master <hi>Roe;</hi> who perceiuing
him in this plight, spake to him; but the Guard
perhibited Master <hi>Roe</hi> to haue any conference
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20040:20"/>
with him onely thus much hee spake in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to him, that hee desired him to informe
the Embassadour how and in what manner hee
met him, so they posted him to <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> where
they brought him to the inquisition house, where
he was more fully examined of the Segnior inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors
of the occasion of his apprehension, for
what cause hee was brought thither; laying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his charge, neither indeed could they,
enioining him to acknowledge the reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
himselfe was ignorant; they bid him examine
his conscience, to guesse or thinke what it was
might bring him thither, protesting that they
were impartiall and vpright Iudges, the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and rulers as free from corruption, as prone
to equitie; thus with much Grauitie was hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
times examined: For his lodging it was
somewhat homely, his diet bare, his restraint
close to the deniall of the sight of any one, but
made more miserable by the company of two
other prisoners with him, who were sometimes
examined by the inquisitors, what they thought
their fellow was in for, what his discourse was
among them: which Master <hi>Roe</hi> requited, when
the inquisitors demanded him what they discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, and for what reason hee thought them
there detained: who told them he could not tell.
Not long after they enquired of him, If he would
haue an Interpreter of the English Colledges to
come vnto him to Interpret his intentions, and to
conferre with with him in matters of Religion,
which hee seriously denied, auerring hee had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20040:21"/>
commit his life into the hands of Strangers,
euen such as they were, then into the hands of
English Iesuites, or Fugitiues, who knew them
more maliciously addicted to their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
then any Forraine person whatsoeuer; not
vnlike the runagate Turks, who cannot brooke
their owne Nation, by reason they obiect vnto
them their owne shame: and the reason of this
his detestation of their conference was in that he
suspected one Father <hi>Foster</hi> an English Iesuite, to
haue beene the contriuer of his imprisonment, in
that hee had discoursed with that Iesuite in the
Embassadors house, in matters of Religion. But
fearing his violent detention by the inquisition,
I will discouer the discouery of it; as also what
became of the Merchants Seruant. The flemish
Gentleman who met him on his Iourney, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Lord <hi>Ashton</hi> in what manner hee had seene
Master <hi>Roe;</hi> vpon the which the Embassador went
to the Inquisitor Generall to know the reason of
his imprisonment; who carried himselfe as one
ignorant of the cause or person, but being solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and importuned, at last confest he was sent to
Inquisition to <hi>Vallidolid</hi> for some hainous matters
concerning points of Religion: The Inquisitor
Generall vnderstanding that the Embassador
knew of Master <hi>Roes</hi> detention; now caused the
Merchants Seruant to be set at liberty, who all this
while was kept close in the same house where
Master <hi>Roe</hi> was apprehended, lest that he might
disclose the conueiance of this Gentleman. Of
these vnlawfull deuises, the Embassador informed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20040:21"/>
his Soueraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> of pious memory; who
forthwith writ Letters to his Maiesty of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
the subiect whereof was for his deliuery; Trinity
Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> preferred an humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the King, in testimony of his modest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
and vpright conuersation amongst
them; and partly for this reason, in that certaine
of the Spanish crue and faction had suggested to
his Maiesty, that he was a turbulent factious Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,
and therefore rightly punished by God in
this imprisonment: thus diswading (as much as
in them lay) the King to write any Letters in his
behalfe. These petitions were deliuered to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
by the Noble Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> besides his
Mother, Brothers, Kindred, more particularly
Sir <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Mildra</hi> were dayly
petitioners to his Maiestie. My Lord <hi>Ashton,</hi> was
since suitor to his Maiestie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to grant
King <hi>Iames</hi> suite, <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> then Embassadour
importuned the Embassadour for <hi>Venenan</hi> at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>
by letters of the same subiect alledging his
detention might example to surprize and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
any secretarie of any Embassadour whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.
The Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> with a passionate zeale
aboue all the rest dayly sollicited in the behalfe
of his deliuerie, the continuall redeemer of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
countrey men, if at any time they stood in
neede of him; which feruencie of his proceeded
not from any priuate interest, but his inbred affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his nation, still profering to be a prop and
pillar in the common good of his countrey, then
to aduance his particular estate: but to returne to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20040:22"/>
my inquisition; Master <hi>Roe</hi> could not haue his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
till <hi>Padre Maestro,</hi> came ouer into <hi>Spaine,</hi>
and solicited the businesse, and then he was soone
released, as yet ignorant by any information of
theirs of the reason of his detention; this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
being demanded of his Ferriman as hee
passed the Riuer <hi>Eron,</hi> trauailing out of <hi>Spaine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France;</hi> when he intended to returne, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the phrase of an English Spirit, <hi>Nunce sino a
luco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quostu doespana.</hi> Not long after was imprisoned
one Master <hi>Scott,</hi> a Yorkshire Gentleman appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
at <hi>Madrid</hi> and sent to the inquisition of
<hi>Toledo</hi> (as it is coniectured) in that he had disputed
with an Irish dominican Frier, Father <hi>Thomas</hi> in
matters of Religion; where his lodging and diet
was very hard according to his owne relation to
his Maiestie King <hi>Iames,</hi> but through the interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> was deliuered. Master
<hi>Pryma</hi> an English Merchant succeeded him in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
at <hi>Toledo,</hi> vpon no other true occasion
but because he endeuored a Monopoly of English
Merchandize to the impouerishment of other
<hi>Spanish</hi> Merchants, released also by the Lord of
<hi>Bristoll,</hi> but banished the Countrey. At <hi>Siuill</hi> they
clapt vp one Master <hi>Victorine Cheuerill</hi> freed by
the importunitie of the same Lord: But their
happynesse was the match with <hi>Spaine</hi> was then
proceeding and the Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> that Noble
Personage Embassador of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for otherwise
they might haue shared in the miseries of these
that follow, as Master <hi>Gurganey</hi> a true and learned
Protestant who died vnder the <hi>Spanish</hi> inquisition
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20040:22"/>
and a Scottish Gentleman, <hi>A.</hi> who was rackt in
in the Inquisition house at <hi>Malaga,</hi> to the distorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of each particular ioynt now a cripple in Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
house, and Master <hi>Mosley</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> who hath
beene detained in that Inquisition house these ten
yeeres and like to expire there. And others, as
for example, Master <hi>H.</hi> brother to the Earle of
<hi>L.</hi> who hauing viewed the greater parts of <hi>Europe,
France, Spaine, Italy, Constantinople, Greece,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to <hi>Italy,</hi> and so for <hi>England,</hi> was there appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
after this manner. The Gouernor of the
first Towne he was to passe through, had a great
desire to a <hi>Grecian</hi> horse of his which he brought
from thence; which hee intended to present to
his brother the L. in so much he requested it of
him, but the Gentleman not so foolishly courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as to depart from him; by his denyall so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
the Gouernour, that his reuenge laid
him close in the Inquisition; for the effecting
of which, he subornd his man by bribery to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
his Masters Religion, of which hee being
once assured, hee made his man a cloake for his
knauery ensuing. For hereupon hee sent him to
<hi>Rome</hi> prisoner as an hereticke and spie; in the
meane time kept his horse, while the poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
all his iourney had his legges chained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnder the horse his belly, and euery night
had no other lodging, but a roome vnder some
steaming priuie; at which inquisition house they
kept him for fiue yeeres vntill they had workt
him at last to receiue their own religion and then
released him. But notwithstanding as yet ielous
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20040:23"/>
of him kept two yeeres longer at the English Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to trie if hee were well grounded
in his Catholicke Religion; at which time they
dismissed him, and restored his horse vnto him
who is now in <hi>England</hi> a strong Catholike; another
example of their popish tiranny Father <hi>Barnes</hi>
a Benedictine frier late Chapline to the Prince
of <hi>Portugall</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who writing a booke against
the Popes supremacy, and the allegeance that
Subiects vnto their Soueraignes. And making
for <hi>England</hi> to prime it was the night before his
intended voiage vpon some notice giuen vnto the
Iesuites surprised at the Prince his house by a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the chiefe secretary of state, which they
procured by corruption and by an Act contrary to
the Lawes of <hi>France</hi> and all Nations; hurried
to <hi>Cambray</hi> in the Archdutches her Dominions,
where hee was put into the Castle, against
the day of his triall: from thence conueyed to
<hi>Milford</hi> Castle, and afterwards to <hi>Rome</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
house, it being impossible for any man
to know, whether hee, or any that are once there,
be aliue or dead. The Prince of <hi>Portugall</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Court of Parliament of <hi>France</hi> of this
act, who wondring at the insolency of the fact,
demanded him of the Infanta and the Pope, but
to no effect; a plot exercised very lately in the
yeere 1627. <hi>Spalatta,</hi> that turne coat of Religion,
puft more with ambition then corpulency, being
promised by <hi>Gundomar</hi> a Cardinals Cap at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in short succession and progresse
of time a tripple Crowne; who instansed in Pope
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20040:23"/>
               <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> who offering sacrifices to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
gods, was deposed; yet on his recantation
was againe elected, cherished the Bishop not to
feare, but hee might come to the like dignities
vpon the like submission, especially in that his
fault to reuolt from the Vicar of God was not
quite so erronious, as to deny God and his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Vpon these and the like gulling perswasions,
hauing his pardon sent him into <hi>England,</hi> went to
<hi>Rome</hi> with two Monkes his Chaplaines to fetch
his Cap, where waiting for it the space of a
tweluemoneth, to the expence of the incredible
masse of money and plate hee conueyed out of
<hi>England,</hi> but missing of it, turned Protestant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
or at least pretended one, whetting his
tongue and penne against his Holinesse, vpon
which reason he was apprehended by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and put into their Denne, where not long
after hee was poysoned, which made him swell
twise as bigge as he was before. A fit death for
such a one; his body was taken from the house
of death, and burnt in the fire for an heretike,
which being consumed, the ashes thereof were
scattered in the aire, as vnworthy that his atomes
should defile their Land. At which sight his
Chaplens being present, loth to taste of the like
sauce, fled to <hi>Gundomar</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> claiming his
promise concerning their protection, which for a
while he performed, allowing them for his credit
eight Rialls a day: but this lasted not long, for
soone after the Benedictines were neuer seene.
The Statesman, <hi>Gundomar,</hi> was requited in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20040:24"/>
like sort, notwithstanding the manifold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faithfull
seruices he had done for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
his sollicitations against Sir <hi>Water Raleigh,</hi> his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing
of <hi>Spalata, his caetera,</hi> for by way of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he had, as it is reported, giuen him a Spanish
figge; or else, though euer a merry man, yet at
last died for very griefe. To conclude with an
example of tyranny more vnnaturall then cruell,
one <hi>Philip</hi> the second, vpon suspition that his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne and heire (by his second wife) was an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,
or had too familiar conference with the
Protestant Princes, cast him into the Inquisition
house, and being sentenced by the Inquisitors to
die, the sentence was confirmed by the bloody
fathers hand and seale, hauing no other libertie
allowed him, then to chuse either strangling, or
bleeding to death by the cutting of his veines;
which last he chose, saying not long before his
expiring, O vnhappy sonne, but more vnhappy
father: this was effected priuately. Thus if the
Princes themselues haue vndergone the torture
of an Inquisition, nay, death it selfe, we may assure
our selues, that no forraine subiect shall be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from these Deuils and that Hell, if once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
vntill the houre of his vtmost breath.</p>

               <p>THe Knights of this Military Order haue
for Badge a blew sattin Crosse, shaped
much like the Crosse of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> though
somewhat broder, the middest of it is embroyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with golden rayes, and for the Crosse on the
top of it is placed our Lady, set out like the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Apocalyps, <hi>Amicta sole,</hi> clad with the
Sunne, and crowned with twelue Starres, and
trampling on the Moone in a blew Mantle, and
about it a Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his girdle, holding an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
in her armes, with a Scepter in the right
hand, and this is entitled, <hi>The Christian Warfare,
Protectresse of the immaculate Conception of the Virgin
our Lady.</hi> All Nations come into this Order, and
all the World will in time. The Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi>
shall be Master of it, who hath bestowed on
the Religion (besides what it was formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with) thirty thousand Duckats of yeerely
reuenew, besides eight Galeons, or tall ships of
his, which as at this time haue serued the most
Christian King of <hi>France</hi> before Rochell. And the
Catholike King of <hi>Spaine</hi> our Lord <hi>Philip</hi> the 4.
whom God long prosper, by the ioynt consent
and good liking of his Holinesse, and all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes, is Protector of the Order. The Title
of it is, <hi>Milita Christiana immaculat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Virginis Mariae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and it is also dedicated for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20040:27"/>
chasing of Rouers and Pyrates by Sea, as also for
defence of Frontires against Turkes and Moores,
and is subordinate in all things to the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
See, and our Blessed Father Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi>
the eighth hath confirmed it, and will assist with
his Gallies to the celestiall enterprize, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which he hath long aimed at,
and all Rome is much cheared and delighted
with it. The Order was first set on foot in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
in the yeere 1614. at what time wee newly
began to defend, and preach this immaculate and
soueraigne mystery, without knowing of either
of vs, thankes be to God Almighty for the same.
Let me onely tell you, that if we had gone from
<hi>Siuill</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and spent the eight yeeres which
we haue done there, for no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the effecting
of this businesse, it were a Iourney and time well
imployed. For you are to know, that although
this holy Image, with the sacred ornaments,
were all of the Conception, and of no other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
yet they there demanded no more, then that
this Military Religion should be established by
the title of Christian Warfare, in protection of
our Lady, without further addition. And about
the time of confirmation the Arch-Deacon <hi>Don-Matheo,</hi>
and I knew this, for all others were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that it was of the Conception, with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Armes and Ornaments, and wee turmoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vp and downe, and spake with the Duke of
<hi>Neuers,</hi> who acknowledged what wee put to him
(as being a most courteous Gentleman, and vsed
vs with all Noblenesse, telling vs indeed, that he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20040:27"/>
had not obserued so much, but that now at last he
remembred, that at the first meeting, which was
at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> vpon the erecting of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it fell out to bee vpon the eighth day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
which was also the day of the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that now he called it perfectly to mind.
This businesse hath once more begun to bee in
Treaty, aud wee haue all gone thorow-stitch so
well, that the Military Order of the holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is confirmed vnder that Title, and by all
the Votes, and Suffrages of great Lords and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and also of our Lord the Pope his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
I hope in God we shall send a Bull by the
next Poste, that may affoord much comfort to
that populous and pious City of <hi>Siuill,</hi> and all
Christendome besides. Let men oppose it, and
doe all they can or please, yet God Almighty
will doe as hee best pleaseth; he hath made all
things both in Heauen and Earth according to
his good pleasure. His Diuine Maiesty, as hee is
able, and to my desire, haue you in his protection.
Salute from me all our Friends in the Lord.</p>
