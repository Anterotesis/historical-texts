            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>But all things are naked, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are met this day to humble our soules, and to bring our Censer, as once <hi>Aaron</hi> did, and step in, that the wrath of the great GOD may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36830:3"/>
And was there ever need to lie in <hi>sackcloth,</hi> then when the Kingdome almost lies in <hi>ashes.</hi> Or to shed <hi>teares,</hi> then when the Nation hath shed so much <hi>blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> These dayes are called in Scripture, <hi>Soul-afflicting dayes,</hi> Lev. 23. 29. <hi>For whatsoever soule it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.</hi> And certainly, that may be one reason why there is so much State-afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because there is so little Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affliction. Our condition is low, but our hearts are high. God sees with what hearts we now come, what is our spring, what our centre; his eye is upon us. So saith my Text, <hi>All things are naked and open.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall wave the Coherence, lest I be prevented, and handle the words as an entire Proposition. We have here a <hi>Map of Gods Knowledge.</hi> But before I extract any thing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36830:3"/>
I will first open the Terms. In the <hi>Law,</hi> first the Lamps were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Incense was burned; I may allude, First the judgement is to be enlightned by Doctrine, before the affections are set on fire. Ministers must be first shining, and then burning Lamps.</p>
            <p>All things are [<hi>naked.</hi>] Some Expositors translate the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Excoriata,</hi> And to this sense <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> inclines. It is a Metaphor from the taking off the skin of any beast, which doth then appeare na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Thus our hearts are said to be naked; they lie open to the eye of God, they have no covering; there is no vaile over the heart of a sinner, but the vaile of unbelief; and this covering makes him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
            <p>This is not all, the Apostle goes higher. They are naked and [<hi>open</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">

Such a kinde of Anatomy doth God make; an heart-Anatomy: He doth cut up the <hi>inwards,</hi> and makes a difference; This is Flesh, that is Spirit; this is faith, that is fancy. He makes a dissection, as the knife that divides between the flesh and the bones, the bones and the marrow, the sinews and the veins. <hi>All things are open <gap reason="foreign">

himselfe in himself, and all things without himselfe, not only necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and contingent, but which shall never be, after a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, exquisite, and infallible manner.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> The Schools distinguish of<note place="margin">Answ.</note> a double knowledge in God. There is, 1. <hi>Scientia simplicis intelligentiae,</hi> a knowledge of pure intelligence, and thus he knows evil by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary good, as the light discovers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36830:9"/>
the darknesse. So we say, <hi>Rectum est index sui &amp; obliqui,</hi> The straight rule shews the crooked. 2. There is a knowledge of approbation. Thus God doth not know sinne; for he hates it, he punisheth it. Christ was <hi>made sinne,</hi> yet <hi>he knew no sinne;</hi> he did know it so as to hate it, not so as to act or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
            <p>I passe to the Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Reason.</hi> From his creation; <note place="margin">1. Reas.</note> God is the Father of lights, therefore must needs see. It is his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>He that planted the eare, shall he not heare? he that formed the eye, shall he not see *?</hi> He that<note place="margin">Ps. 94 9.</note> makes a Watch, knows all the pins and wheels in it, and though these wheels move crosse one to another, he knows the true and perfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Watch, and the spring that sets these wheels a going; <hi>He</hi>

               <hi>that formed the eye, shall he not see?</hi> Man may be compared to a spiritual Watch. The affections are the wheels; the heart is the spring; the motion of this Watch is false; the heart is deceitful; but God that made this watch knowes the true motion of it (be it never so false) and the spring that sets the wheels a going. God knows us better then we know our selves: He is as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> wheels full of eyes, and as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> saith, he is <hi>totus oculus,</hi> all eye<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Resp.</hi> It could not be that God<note place="margin">Answ.</note> was ignorant; because there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a cry, but it is spoken <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after the manner of a Judge; who will first examine the cause before he wil pass the sentence. Therefore to answer that Scripture, <hi>I will go down and see:</hi> It implies two things.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>moderation</hi> God useth when he is upon a work of Justice; God doth not make the sword the Judge; he doth first weigh things the balance; he doth ever <hi>lay judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the line,</hi> before he draws the line of confusion. God when he is upon a work of Justice, is not in a <hi>Ryot,</hi> as if he did not care where he hits, but goes in the way of a <hi>circuit</hi> against offenders, <hi>I will go down and see;</hi> He doth not punish rashly: and this may be a good hint to them that have power in their hand, they must work by line and plummet; judging the Cause rather then the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36830:11"/>
Person; they must proceed in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; else seeming Zeal is no better then Wild-fire; it is not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but violence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I will go down and see.</hi> It denotes Gods <hi>patience</hi> in waiting for sinners; He staid till the cry came up: God puts up a great deal of injury at our hands, before Justice draws the sword. He spins out mercy into patience, and eekes out patience into long-suffering. Oh, had not Gods patience been infinite, we have spent so long upon it, that we had quite spent the stock. But let no sinner presume: Though God be long-suffering, he doth not tell us how long: When the cry comes up, God comes down. If pride, lust, oppression abound, God will heare the cry, and will quench the fire of sinne with a showre of blood.</p>

            <p>First, The exactnesse of Gods knowledge; He hath such a deep insight as usually men have upon search. 2. God threatens to search, because he would have us search.

opens into our breasts? Doth he make a critical descant upon our actions? Oh what holinesse, what sincerity, what exemplary piety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, being in such a presence!

            <p>When we come to these solemne duties, God asks that question as<note place="margin">2 King. 10. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Iehu</hi> did <hi>Iehonadab,</hi> 2 King. 10. 15. he saluted him and said to him, <hi>Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</hi> And he said, <hi>It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he took him up into the chariot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Gods question. You come this day to humble your selves and make atonement, <hi>Is your heart right with me?</hi> if we can answer, as he did; Lord, thou knowest it is; Though I have much weaknesse, yet my heart is right, I have no false byasse upon it; though I am
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36830:13"/>
not perfect, I hope I am sincere; Then will God say, Give me your prayers, give me your tears, now <hi>come up with me into the chariot.</hi> A tear from a bleeding heart is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perfume in heaven. Oh did we consider this all-seeing eye, we durst not bring so much <hi>strange fire</hi> into the Divine presence. We read of <hi>Ezekiels wheels,</hi> they had a wheel within a wheel <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 1. 16.</note>. Thus God hath a thought within a thought; He doth <hi>intervenire</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Seneca.</note> he comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and our thoughts.</p>
            <p>The goddesse <hi>Minerva</hi> (as the Poets feign) was drawn in such lively colours, that which way soever one turned, still <hi>Minerva's</hi> eye was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.

               <hi>Of how dangerous consequence is it, to act any thing against God?</hi> He<note place="margin">2 Branch of Infor.</note> sees it, and his knowledge is arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Power; He that hath an eye to see, will finde an hand to punish.

            </p>
            <p>There are foure Things; and if we act either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against any of these, we act against God; and he sees it, He writes it down.</p>
            <p>1. If we act against his <hi>truth,</hi> we act against God, truth is a beame<note place="margin">1.</note> of God, it is his essence, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the truth; it is the most orient Pearle of his Crown, take away his truth and we ungod him. Truth is the precious seed,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36830:14"/>
by which we are begotten to life<note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 1. 18</note>, it is the pillar of our salvation; it is not only <hi>norma fidei,</hi> the rule of faith, but it is <hi>radix fidei,</hi> the root out of which faith grows; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way truth, and what is faith but fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? we believe our selves into hell. Truth is the great purchase of Christs blood, and it hath been transmitted to us in the blood of many Saints and Martyrs; if we strike at truth, we strike at God; and doth not God see this?</p>
            <p>Give me leave to plead in Gods cause, is not this pure wine of truth mixed with water, nay, with poison? How are the truths of God almost lost in the croud of errours? what truth in Divinity but is now called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion? some denying the Scriptures, others denying the Lord that bought them; not only <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth</hi> are out of course, but even <hi>the foundations of Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:36830:14"/>
are shaken. We read that <hi>when the bottom lesse Pit was opened, there arose a smoake as the smoake of a great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the Sunne and the aire were darkened</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 9. 2.</note>. The late errours sprung out of the furnace of hell, have made such a smoak and mist in the Church of God, that the bright Sunne of truth is much eclipsed in our Horizon. How many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are there now among us, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day in a new dresse? old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies newly vamp'd? Our Saviour Christ saith, <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 18. 8</note>

            <p>Secondly, We act against God,<note place="margin">2.</note> when we act against his <hi>Covenant;</hi> a Covenant is a serious thing. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

            <p>1. The Libertine. And there are<note place="margin">1. Branch of reproof</note> two kinds of them:</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>prophane Libertine,</hi> that fancies to himselfe a God made up of mercy; and therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphes himselfe in sinne, doth act <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> he is upon the spurre to go to hell, as if he were afraid hell would be full before he could get thither. Doth not he say, <hi>God shall not see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly the <hi>Religious Libertine,</hi> and these are of two sorts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:36830:19"/>1. That pleads Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <hi>Conscience!</hi> Must he have his Conscience, that makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? What, He that hath sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Conscience? If Conscience be a sufficient plea, the Papists will come in for a childes part. Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must have a Rule; it bindes only <hi>virtute praecepti,</hi> by vertue of a precept. If Conscience goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Word, <hi>Deponenda est talis</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science being defiled, may erre; Conscience erring, may suggest that which is sinfull. There is nothing can binde a man to sin.</p>
            <p>2. Sort of the Religious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is, That sinnes because Grace abounds; that saith, God sees no sinne in his people, and therefore what need we see it? After we are in Christ, we cannot sinne; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Repentance is out of date.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36830:20"/>
Whom I shall refute in two words.</p>
            <p>There needs Repentance after<note place="margin">1.</note> we are in Christ: for, 1. Though sinne in a Believer be <hi>covered</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 32. 1</note>, yet it is not perfectly <hi>cured.</hi> There are still <hi>Reliquiae peccati,</hi> some remainders of corruption; and certainly, as long as there is an issue of sin open, there must be an issue of sorrow kept open.</p>
            <p>2. Every sinne after we are in<note place="margin">2.</note> Christ, is a sinne of unkindnesse, it is <hi>labes sponsae,</hi> the sin of a Spouse; and if any thing will melt and break the heart, this will. The sinnes of the Regenerate do wound Christs heart deeper then others. Hath not Christ suffered enough already? Wilt thou wound him whom God hath wounded? Will you give him more vineger to drink? O rather <hi>Give wine to him that is of an heavy heart;</hi> Cheare him with thy teares: Look on a bleeding Christ with a bleeding heart.<note place="margin">2. Branch of reproof</note>

The Hypocrite weares a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor of Sanctity. <hi>Aquinas</hi> in his Summes calls hypocrisie <hi>simulatio virtutis.</hi> The counterfeiting of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The hypocrite is a very Mountebank, he pretends that which he is not. He is like those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that assumed the dead bodies, but there was no soul to animate them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 1. he is a shape, an<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 1</note> apparition, he doth but assume Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The hypocrite is a walking Land-skip, a rotten post guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over; he is like the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grapes that deceived the living birds. <note n="*" place="margin">Plut.</note> Or the beautifull apples of <hi>Sodom</hi> with this Motto, <hi>No further then Colours;</hi> touch them, and they moulder to dust.</p>
            <p>In short, hypocrites are like turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36830:21"/>
pictures which have on one side the image of a Lamb, on the other side a Lion: so they are on their out-side Saints, but their in-side de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills. Hypocrites may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to trumpets which make a great sound, but within they are hollow. Do these believe the all-seeing eye? The hypocrite turnes all Religion into meer complement; he walks with a dark Lanthorn, saying, <hi>No eye shall see.</hi> He goes about to juggle with God, as <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wife did think to do with the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 14. 6. but he pulled off her vizor, <hi>Come in thou wife of Ieroboam.</hi> The hypocrite knowes God is of purer eyes then to behold sinne, yet for all this will play a Devotion; he will venture to abuse God, that he may delude men.

They will not take the price of blood into the treasury, but they never scruple to take the guilt of blood into their souls.

            <p>And here as in a Scripture looking-glasse,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36830:22"/>
we may see our own faces; have we not many now adays seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly zealous against <hi>Popery?</hi> if they see a Crosse, though it be in a Coate of Armes, they are much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and are in a kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion: but in the mean time make no conscience of <hi>sacriledge,</hi> star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the Ministery, they put out the fire on Gods Altar, shut the doors of his Temple; is not this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hypocrisie?
