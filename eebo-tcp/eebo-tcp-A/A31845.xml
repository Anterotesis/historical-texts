         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>LIberty being that which in all times hath
been, but eſpecially now, is the common
Theame, and deſire of all men. Common
reaſon ſhewes that Kings leſſe then any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48109:3"/>
ſhould indure captivity, and yet I call God
and the world to witneſſe, with what pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
I have indured a tedious reſtraint, which
ſo long as I had any hopes that this ſort of
my ſufferings might conduce to the Peace of
my Kingdome, or the hindering of more
effuſion of blood; I did willingly undergoe:
But now finding by too certaine proofes, that
this my continued patience would not onely
turne to my perſonall ruine, but likewiſe be
of much more prejudice than furtherance to
the publique good:</p>
               <p>I thought I was bound, as well by naturall
as politicall obligations to ſeek my ſafety;
by retiring my ſelfe for ſome time from the
publique view, both of my friends and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And I appeale to all indifferent men,
to judge if I have not juſt cauſe to free my
ſelfe from the hands of thoſe who change
their principles with their condition; and
who are not aſhamed openly to intend the
deſtruction of the Nobility, by taking away
their negative voice, and with whom the
levellers doctrine is rather countenanced then
puniſhed.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48109:3"/>
               <p>And as for their intentions to my perſon,
their changing and putting more ſtrict
guards upon me, with the diſchaging moſt of
all thoſe ſervants of mine, who formerly they
willingly admitted to wait upon me, doth
ſufficiently declare: Nor would I have this
my retirement miſ-interpreted, for I ſhall
earneſtly and inceſſantly endeavour the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a ſafe and well-grounded peace, where
ever I am, or ſhall be; And that (as much
as may be) without the effuſion of more
Chriſtian blood, for which how many times
have I deſired, preſt to be heard, and yet no
eare given to me.</p>
               <p>And can any reaſonable men think
that (according to the ordinary courſe
of affaires) there can be a ſettled peace
without it; or that God will bleſſe thoſe
who refuſe to heare their owne King,
ſurely not?</p>
               <p>Nay I muſt further adde, That (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what concerns my ſelfe) unleſſe
all other cheife intereſts have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48109:4"/>
an hearing, but likewiſe juſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given unto them, (to wit the
Presbyterians, Independents, Army,
thoſe who have adhered to me, even
the Scots) I ſay there cannot (I ſpeak
not of miracles, it being of my opinion,
a ſinful preſumption, in ſuch caſes to
expect or truſt to them) be a ſafe or
laſting peace</p>
               <p>Now as I cannot deny but that my
perſonall ſecurity is the urgent cauſe
of this my retirement, ſo I take God to
witneſſe that the publique peace is no
leſſe before mine eyes; And I can find
no better way to expreſſe this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
(I know not what a wiſer man
may doe) then by deſiring and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that all cheife intereſts may be
heard, to the end each may have juſt
ſatisfaction, As for example; The
Army: for the reſt (though neceſſary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48109:4"/>
yet I ſuppoſe are not difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent)
ought (in my judgement) to
enjoy the liberty of their Conſciences
have an Act of Oblivion, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity
(which ſhould extend to
all the reſt of my Subjects) And that
al their arreares ſhould be ſpeedily and
duly paid, which I will undertake to
doe, ſo I may be heard, And that I be
not hindered from uſing ſuch lawfull
and honeſt meanes, as I ſhall chooſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, let me be heard with
freedome, honour, and ſafety, and I
ſhall (inſtantly) breake through this
cloud of retirement, and ſhew my ſelfe
really to be <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi>
