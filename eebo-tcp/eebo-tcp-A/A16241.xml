         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue made
maruellous complaints

and miſknowledge of man, for that he
neuer entreth into his owne conſcience,
and conſidereth not his owne proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
althoughe that his induſtrie and

without bridell or ſnaffle, by
his diligence and promptneſſe of wit, he
hath deſcribed the properties of herbes

with the calcionating of mettels. And
notwithſtanding man is ſo maſked and
diſguiſed, that he knoweth not himſelfe.
He is the Heraulde, beginner and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewer

There was none to my iudgement

with ſuch a facilitie that it ſhal ſerue for

Empire: Who conſidering profoundlye,
the frailtie and miſerie in the which oure
poore life is continually beſieged, ſayde:
The battel of this world is ſo perillous,
the yſſue ſo terrible and fearfull, that I
am aſſured if an auncient man ſhoulde
come forth of his graue, and make a faith
full diſcourſe and ſhewe of his life, from
the houre of his birth vntill the houre of
his death, and that the bodie ſhould ſhew
all the dolours and griefes that it hath
ſuffered, and the heart diſcouer al the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes
of fortune, men would be amaſed
of the body which hath ſo much ſuſtained,
and of the heart that hath ſo languiſhed,
the which I haue proued in my ſelfe, and
will liberally confeſſe it, though it be to
my infamie, but it maye be profitable to
others in time to come. In fiftye yeares
that I haue liued, I thought to approue
all the vices of this life, for to ſée if mans
malice might be ſatiſfied in anie thing:
And after that I had all ſéene, I founde
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more I eat, the more I did hunger,
the more I did drinke, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more I thirſted:
the more I ſlept, the more I would ſlepe:

the more I reſted, the more I breake: the

I neuer had thing in my poſſeſſion,

be hearde in all the corners of the earth,
that all humaine creatures might heare,
to the ende, to declare with the Prophet
<hi>Dauid</hi> this crie: Children of men, howe
long ſhal your hearts be hardened? And
not withoute a cauſe, for he that woulde

lamentation that he maketh vpon

and nouriſhe this body, which is nothing
but a verie veſſell of filth, and a ſepulcher
for wormes, &amp; thou leaueſt thy poore ſoule
which is the image of God, famiſhed and
voyde. Theſe are the complaintes that
this holy man made, in his deſert againſt
the ingratitude of this worlde: All the
which things by vs being brought in, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of him as of others, tend to no other
ende, but to prouoke man to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of himſelf, and to ſhewe him how
vile and abiect he is, to the ende that he
ſhould conſider euerie minute in the day,
that he is in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, as the chaffe,
and as the earthen veſſell is in the hande
of the potter, the which he may make, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make,
forme, breake, craſe, and repaire, as
to him ſéemeth beſt, without doing it any
wrong or iniurie. For, what is man elſe
but a ſimilitude or ſtatute in this worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is a verie ſhoppe of the workes of
God, who with one puſhe will fall, and
notwithſtanding in what miſerie ſo euer
he be wrapt in, yet he knoweth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
neither yet will bow vnder the yoke
of God.</p>
            <p>(Now therefore) hauing well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the vniuerſall ſtate of man, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to make a moſte ample diſcourſe
of this matter, and to contemplate man
more neare, to the ende that he learne to
humble himſelfe vnder the hande of hys
God. And therefore, that among all the
Heathen, <hi>Plinie,</hi> as me ſemeth, hath moſt
worthily philoſophied of our nature: We
wil bring him for witneſſe, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that
Chriſtians to their great confuſion and

which liued without the knowledge
of God, without law, without knowledge
of the heauenly and Euangelicall light.
Let vs conſider a little (ſayth he) howe it
behoueth man to couer his bodye, at the

in what contemnation nature hath

<pb facs="tcp:2884:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beaſtes can of nature helpe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
but man knoweth nothing if he be
not taught, but of his own proper nature
wepeth. Man only among the beaſtes is
ſubiect to paine, paſſion, pleaſure, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
auarice, an vnmeaſurable appetite
to liue, borne only to ſuperſtition, onlye
in worldlye cares, that follow him: to be
ſhort, he is ſubiect to wrath and enimitie.
The beaſts liue in peace and amitie with
thoſe of their kinde, but man alone is eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to man. And yet for the more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and gratifiyng of beaſtes, nature
hath prouided them caues and holes, to
kepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rage of the tempeſts,
thunders and lightnings, as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greate
ones, they haue dennes and caues in the
ground: and the little ones, as Whelks,
Snayles, Torterels, and ſuch like, nature
hath ſo prouided, that they beare with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their houſes eaſely on their backes.</p>
            <p>Not only the ſéedes and corne, but that
ſhe hath couered with eares, the plantes
with ſkinne, nuttes with ſhell, péele and
rinde, and al for the conſeruation of their
kindes. But man hath nothing, vnleſſe he
<pb facs="tcp:2884:16"/>
ſéeke it with labor, and with the ſweate of
his browes. Furthermore if we do confer
the helth and valure of beaſts, with ours,
we ſhall finde that they haue a greate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
ouer vs, for nature hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vs with a complectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo wauering and
vnſtedfaſt, and ſubiect to ſo many kindes
of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, that ſeldome
we are in perfect health: beſides this, ſhe
hath charged man with ſuche an vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
appetite, that he ceaſeth not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallye
to ſéeke for newe and ſtraunge
kinde of meates, and hauing founde to
his appetite, with greate payne he can
abſtaine himſelfe, but that he wyll take
more than nedefull: after the whiche
commeth Surfets, Rheumes, Cancars,
and other infinite kindes of ſickeneſſes.
But as touching beaſtes, they content
themſelues with that, that nature hathe
prepared, without chaunging or forcing
their nature, for to pleaſe their appetite.
Moreouer nature hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection
ſo well ruled and gouerned, that
they neuer take more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is requiſite for
their nouriſhment, neyther in drinke, nor
<pb facs="tcp:2884:16"/>
in meat. But as for man, al the fruites of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, thoſe of the trées, the fiſhes of the
ſea, and the Fowles of the aire, doe not
ſuffice him, but in all points turning hys
nature, he doth diſguiſe puffe vp, &amp; change
the ſubſtance into exceſſe, and the nature
into arte, to the ende that by ſuch vnſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe,
nature be angered, and almoſt
forced to take more than is nedefull: ſo
then, when that nature is ouercharged,
and that the ſtomacke is wel filled: all the
braynes are troubled in ſuch ſorte, that
there is neither of them that can execute
their office. And I am aſhamed that I
muſt nedes tell it, that the vnmeaſurable
delicateneſſe that raigneth among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
this day, is the cauſe that there are
many, that are not aſhamed to giue their
bodies, and their members to al kinde of
vice and villanie, and to all kinds of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
howe execrable ſo euer they be,
euen in committing many fornications,
theftes, fellonies. And I doe maruell that
the bellies of manye vnſatiable gluttons
do not rot and bruſte out by their greate
<pb facs="tcp:2884:17"/>
exceſſe, and in the meane time the poore
Lazarus ſtandeth at the gate redy to die
for hunger, and can not haue ſo much as
the crommes that fall from theyr table.</p>
            <p>And therfore ſuch Godbellies or Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygods,
are called by the Prophetes, fatte
Calues, who by good reaſon may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to brute beaſtes: for their ſoule
which is the chiefeſt part they haue (being
in the bodie ſo perfumed with meats and
drinkes) is captiue as in a darke priſon or
dungeon, where as it is almoſte ſtifled
and ſmuthered, and the wits whiche are
the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, with the which ſhe ought
to be ſerued, are buried therein as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bowels of a beaſt: and againſt ſuch
gluttons as make their belly their God,
the Prophet Eſay crieth out ſaying, Wo
be to you that riſe earlie to follow drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
and to ſit drinking till the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening,
to the ende that the wine heate

is ſo familiar among men, that there is
not almoſt, neither Nation or prouince,
but that is infected, and that glorieth in
their great drinking. The Tartarians,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:17"/>
the Perſians, and the Gréekes haue cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kenneſſe among their chiefeſt
triumphes, and conſtrained them that
were at their bankets to drinke or to goe

in his time did ſo raigne, that they did
not only drink themſelues out of al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but alſo they conſtrained their
Mares and Horſes to doe the like. <hi>Paulus
Diacrus</hi> in his Hiſtorie of Lumbardes,
doth rehearſe a thing almoſt monſtrous,
of the vice of drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe, of foure old me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that made a banket, in the whiche they
drunke the yeares of one another, after
the maner as followeth: they ordeyned
to drinke two to two, and counted theyr
age of yeares that they had, and he that
drunke to his companion, ſhould drinke
ſo many times as he had liued yeres, and
the yongeſt of theſe foure, was .lviij. yeres
olde: the ſeconde, ſixtye thrée: the thirde,

<pb facs="tcp:2884:18"/>
was not knowen what they did eate at
this banket either more or leſſe, but we
know that he that drunke leaſt, did drinke
lviij. taſters of wine, and the others ſo
many as they had liued yeares, in ſuche
ſorte that one of them did drinke .lxxxxij.
times. It is not therfore without a cauſe
that this great Philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi> kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
the harme that wine bringeth to
man, ſaide, that partly the Gods had ſent
wine for the puniſhment of man, and to
take vengeance of their ſinnes, cauſing
them when that they are drunke, to kyll
and murther one another, the which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of <hi>Cyneas</hi> Ambaſſadour of King
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> on a time when that he arriued
in Egypt, and that he had ſéene the exceſſe
height of the vineyards in that countrie,
did ſaye that by good right that mother
was hanged ſo highe, ſeing ſhe brought
forth ſo daungerous a childe as the wine.
For this cauſe <hi>Androcides</hi> did admoniſh
that great Monarch <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> that wine
was the bloud of the earth: and therefore
he ſhoulde take héede howe to receyue it.
The which not being well obſerued by
<pb facs="tcp:2884:18"/>
him, in his intemperancie killed <hi>Clytus,</hi>
burned the Citie of <hi>Percepolis,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
manye other foule and deteſtable
crimes. It is not therefore in this our
age that theſe wicked vices of gluttonye
and drunkenneſſe haue made their laſte
ende vpon the earth, but it ſéemeth that
they haue nowe made almoſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in with man. The tranſgreſſion of

poore beaſt had kept the dead bodie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any meate. For the which occaſion,
the King commaunded the dead bodie to
be buried, and that the dog for his fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
ſhoulde be nouriſhed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in his Court, and certaine dayes
<pb facs="tcp:2884:28"/>
after, he made inquiſition of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but he coulde know nothing therof.
It chaunced not long after, that his men
of warre made their muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er before him,
that he might ſée their order. The dog of
whom was made mention, was alwayes
with the King, and remayned verie ſadde
and heauie, till thoſe paſſed by that had
ſtaine his maiſter: then with a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
furie he ran againſt them, and wold
haue bitten them, howling moſt pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
turning him to King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
him moſt attentiuelye, ſéeming
as though he woulde haue aſked iuſtice:
which was the occaſion that the King and
all the aſſiſtants did ſuſpect the murther
to be committed by thoſe, in ſuch ſort that
by theſe coniectures, they were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
conuinced, and puniſhed according
to their deſertes. A thing miraculous,
wherin God doth ſhew himſelf a iuſt and
righteous Iudge in his iudgements, and
that he hath murtherers in ſo great dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
that ſhed humaine bloud, that he
permitteth brute beaſtes to accuſe them
and ſhew them their vices. I might here
<pb facs="tcp:2884:29"/>
bring an infinite number of examples as
well Eccleſiaſticall as prophane, by the
which it is euidently ſhewed, that in the
contemplation of beaſtes, there maye be
found an harmonious Philoſophie, as
well morall as naturall. For conſidering
their maners and actions, ſo well ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
according to the vſe of nature, theyr
iuſtice, temperature, fortitude and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
in the adminiſtration of their ſmal
publike weales, their continencie to the
workes of nature, wyth certaine other
partes of vertue that they exerciſe: by
the diligent conſideration of which, man
may enter into his owne conſcience and
aduiſe, as being ouercome of thoſe in
many things, and conſidering his miſerie
and pitifull Metamorphoſe, and howe he
doth degenerate from his excellency and
dignitie, he is moued to abhorre his life,
finding himſelfe inferior to thoſe whome
he ought to excell, as much as he paſſeth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in honor and dignitie. For this cauſe
our Sauiour Chriſte calleth the Scribes
and Phariſeys, in Sainct Mathewe, the
children of wrath. And that Eſaye repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:2884:29"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of Iſraell of their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
towardes God, ſheweth them by
example, that the Oxe and the Aſſe know
their maſters Crib, but Iſraell knoweth
not his Lorde God. Alſo we are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by the hiſtory of the herde of Swine
(which by the permiſſion of God were
vexed of the Diuell) that thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their life in deliciouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Againſt the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curians.</note> as a
great manye Belligods that raigne thys
daye in the world, and lead a corrupt life,
ſhall one day be made a pray for Diuels.
For ſeing they wil not be the temple and
houſe of God, and habitation of the holy
ghoſt, they muſte néedes be the manſion
of Diuels. Suche Hogges are thoſe that
make their Paradiſe in this worlde, and
that diſſemble their vices, the which they
ſée with their eyes, and touch with theyr
fingers, for feare that they haue to léeſe
the earthly richeſſe, their offices, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
prebendaries and dignities, for feare
to be depriued from their carnall luſtes.
Suche Swine are flatterers, that all the
time of their liues do no other thing but
kéepe Princes in their error, and that
<pb facs="tcp:2884:30"/>
haue for the firſt article of their faith, that
there is no God but their bellye, for all
their religion is conuerted to carnall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.
As touching the lawe of Ieſus
Chriſt, it is too thorniſhe, they will none
of it, they will not drinke of his cup, the
drinke ſéemeth to them too bitter: they
muſt haue a Ieſus Chriſt arraied in vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet,
more ſwéete, more ſofte, more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and more delicate. They can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the ſharpneſſe of S. Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
they ſéeke for the Courtes of Kings,
and the pompes of the worlde, and they
haue no other pleaſures in this worlde,
but to thinke how they maye liue eaſily.
They maye well for a while cloke and
diſguiſe their iniquity, but one day it ſhal
be diſcouered, before the face and throne
of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> as Dauid doth well vnderſtand,
when he ſayth, whither ſhall I goe then
from thy ſpirite, or whither ſhall I go the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from thy preſence, if I climbe vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
thou art there, if I go downe to hell,
thou art there alſo, if I take the wings of
the morning, and remaine in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
parts of the ſea, euen there alſo ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:2884:30"/>
thy hand lead me, and thy right hand ſhal
holde me. If I ſay peraduenture the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhall couer me, then ſhall my night
be turned to daye, yea the darkneſſe is no
darkeneſſe with thée, but the night is as
cleare as the day, he that made the Eare,
ſhall not he heare? he that made the eye,
ſhall not he ſée and conſider? Therefore
to conclude, it is great horror and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
that man whiche is but a
miſerable worme of the earth, that maye
ſcant créepe, without the hope of eternall
life, and is the moſt miſerable of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
how that he dare repugne againſt
the order of nature, and his owne office,
in which al other creatures remaine, and
alſo how he dare riſe againſt God, which
in a moment maye conſume him. But
who is it that doth not maruell at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe

But firſt, let vs ſée of what ſéede he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred,

heated by the naturall heate, it createth a

and the bloud mingled together, begin to

the mouing of the moſt mightieſt
pallace of intelligence and memorie, the

by their order, the creation of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

howe the childe being in the mothers
wombe,<note place="margin">N. Deha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

is receiued in a little ſkin or bladder, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the childe, ordeyned of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to that office, and howe he hath no

purgings by the fundement, for that he
receiueth no ſuſtenance by the mouthe,
and that the bowels and ſtomacke doeth
not yet his office, by the whiche meanes
nothing is tranſported into the lower
partes. And howe that the ſixe firſt dayes
he is as milke, the nine dayes following,
bloude, the other twelue days after, fleſh,
and the eightene dayes that followe, the
ſoule is incloſed. I know not therefore ſo
Diamond a heart which is not moued &amp;
rauiſhed with great admiration to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
things ſo pitiful &amp; ſtran<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. And yet
this that we haue ſpoken, is very littel,
if we wil conſider more neare the things
that follow, who is it that will not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering in what maner he is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
and with what guiding, without
hauing the vſe of the mouth, vntill he be
borne into the world, then how much his
nature is tender, frayle and weake, in
ſuche ſort, that if the mother be neuer ſo
little hurt or ſmitten, if ſhe ſmell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmoke
of a candell ſnuffe, it is enough to kill the

<hi>Plinie</hi> to be waile our humaine cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:32"/>
ſaying, I am aſhamed to conſider
how fraile the beginning is of him that
tameth all beaſts, ſéeing that oftentimes
the ſmell of a ſnuffe of candell ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the mother. But whilſt he is in
the wombe of his mother, with what
foode is he nouriſhed, what preſeruations
hath nature prepared for him? If that his
creation hath ſéemed vnto vs ſtraunge,
no doubt his ſuſtentation will rauiſh vs
in more greate admiration, ſeing that he
is a ſubſtance of bloud, and inſtrument of
his mother. The which is ſo deteſtable
and vncleane, that I can not withoute
great horror rehearſe that which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
and Phiſicions haue written,
that haue treated of the ſecrets of nature.
Thoſe therefore that are curious of ſuch
things, let them reade <hi>Plinie,</hi> which hath
written thereof in his naturall hiſtorie.<note place="margin">7. booke.</note>
And after that he hath bene long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this venim, and that he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
&amp; becommeth in quantity ſufficient,
ſéeking therefore for more greater nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
&amp; that he cannot receyue by the

which is the occaſion that he moueth and

that he hath alwayes had till that tyme,
then the wombe feeling it ſelf pained, wil
kéepe him no longer in, but ſéeketh mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to bring him forth, and therefore it
openeth, &amp; by the ſaid opening, the childe
féeling the atre, followeth to come forth,
and ſtraineth more and more to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, and to enter into the light
therof, not without great violent dolors
and offence of his tender and delicate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
But during the nine monethes how
great paine and torment doeth the poore
mother ſuffer and beare? Without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
in coumpt ſome that during the
time that they be great, léeſe their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
and couet to eate humaine fleſhe, in
ſuch ſort that we reade in ſome hiſtories<note place="margin">Diuerſe appetites of vvome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvith childe.</note>
that the poore huſbandes haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

as the humors broken and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

<pb facs="tcp:2884:33"/>
what anguiſhe and paine the poore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſuffer in their childings,<note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie of pore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> and what

there are children that come forth
their arms firſt, &amp; others their fete firſt,
others their knées firſt, and others ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart.
But that which is more cruell,
and that we cannot apprehend without
horror, is, that ſometimes it is force to
cal Chirurgians, Mediciners and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars,
in ſtede of wiſe Matrons and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues,
to diſmember the children and
pull them out by pieces, and ſometime
it behoueth to open the poore innocent
mother aliue, and put yron tooles in hir
bodie, yea to murther hir for to haue hir
fruite: ſome children are borne ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
like and deformed, that they are not
like men, but abhominable monſters:
ſome are borne with .ij. heades, and foure
legges, as one which was ſéene in the
Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> whilſt this booke was a
making, others cleping together, as
hath bene ſéene in Fraunce, and in other
places. Two women children were
<pb facs="tcp:2884:34"/>
borne ioyned together by the ſhoulders,
after the one had liued a certaine time,
died and infected the other. <hi>Polydorus</hi>
writeth,<note place="margin">Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous childings.</note> that before that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
chaſed <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought
forth a childe, hauing the heade like an
Eliphant, another hauing foure féete
like a beaſt. The ſage hiſtorians doe
write, that a Courtiſan of Rome, in the
yeare of grace, fiue hundreth and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene,
bare a child halfe a beaſt &amp; halfe a
man. Thoſe that haue written the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hiſtories, do teſtifie for a ſuretie, that
there are at this preſent, children halfe
beaſtes, by the occaſion of certaine bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
men that are there. Some there are
that are borne blinde, others deafe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dumbe, and others there are born
lame of their limmes, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are ſorowfull. In ſuch ſort that if
we conſider attentiuely all the miſery
of our natiuitie, we ſhall finde the olde
Prouerbe true, which ſayth, that we are
conceyued in filth &amp; vnclenneſſe, borne
in ſinne and care, and nouriſhed wyth
<pb facs="tcp:2884:34"/>
paine and labor. Here therfore you may
ſée the firſt action of the tragedie of the
life of humaines. Here you may ſée his
life and gouernement, whilſt he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
in his mothers wombe. Well,
this priſoner being once come forth of
this his maternall priſon, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what he is, being vpon the earth.
What? is he any other thing than the
ſimilitude of a poore worme that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
out of the earth, with what clothing is
he couered, making his moſt glorious
entrie into the pallace of this world? on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with bloud, in the which he is bathed
and couered, whiche is nothing els but
the image and figure of ſinne, which by
the bloud is ſignified in Scripture. O
grieuous neceſſitie, O cruell and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition, that before this creature
hath ſinned, he is bond and ſeruant of
ſin. This is the bitter grape, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
ſpeaketh the Prophet Ieremie, that our
fathers did eate, and their children had
yet their téeth ſet on edge, by the which
is preſented the originall ſinne. What
<pb facs="tcp:2884:35"/>
is the firſt ſong that man ſingeth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
into this worlde, onely wepings,
teares, and bewaylings, which are as
meſſengers and foreſhewers of his cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
to come, the which bicauſe he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not ſhewe by wordes, he witneſſeth by
teares and cries. And notwithſtanding,
here is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of Monarchs, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Princes, Emperors and others,
that riſe in dignities in this worlde. The
worme be he neuer ſo little, as ſoone as
nature hath brought it out of the earth,
beginneth to craule and créepe, and to
ſeke paſture. The little Chicke as ſoone
as he is out of the ſhell, is found cleane,
and néedeth not to be waſhed as man,
he runneth after the Hen, and knoweth
when he is called he pecketh and eateth,
he feareth the Kite, without prouing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hir malice, he flieth the daunger, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guided by nature. But conſider man,
aſſone as he is in the worlde, is a little
fearefull monſter, &amp; lump of fleſh, which
will let himſelf be eaten of other beaſts,
if he be not ſéene too, or die for hunger
<pb facs="tcp:2884:35"/>
before he can gripe his mothers breaſt,
and will aſſoone eate poyſon as any good
meat, before he can diſcerne the good fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the euill: if he be left in his cradell, he
will be ſtiffeled in his owne doung or
filth, and is ſo vnable, that he cannot
caſte out his owne doung, and yet the
little birdes of the aire, and beaſtes can
doe it. Beholde here the perfumes and
ſwéete ſauors, with the whiche nature
hath embalmed man, and decked him
that maketh ſo great brag of <hi>Hercules,</hi>
&amp; that nameth himſelfe chiefe head of al
other creatures.<note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie of man that is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by another than his mother.</note> This miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being once plunged in the gulfe of
miſeries, it behoueth him to haue nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
and clothing, for to comforte
the infirmitie of his nature. This office
is appointed for mothers, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, nature hath giuen them
breaſts, which are like little bottels, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proper to that effect.<note place="margin">Miſery of man in his nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> But how manye
mothers are there at this preſent, or for
to ſpeake the truth, cruell ſtepmothers,
vnto whom it ſufficeth onely, to bring
<pb facs="tcp:2884:36"/>
the children into this world, and for that
they wil not take a little paines to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
them, they ſend them to ſorrowfull
villages, for to be nouriſhed of ſtraunge
and vnknowen nurſes, which often ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
do chaunge them, and bring home
others. Alſo they will be leſſe aſhamed
to holde a little dog in their armes, than
the fruit that they haue ingendred. The
which practiſe is not in beaſtes, be they
neuer ſo brutiſh, for they neuer put their
yong ones, in the keeping of others,
though nature giue them neuer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but they nouriſh them themſelues,
and are ſuche zelous protectors of theyr
yong ones, that they kéepe them always
in their armes, til ſuch time as they can
auoide daunger. And that which is more
to be maruelled at, there riſeth a certain
gelouſie betwene the male and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
who ſhalbe the kéeper, and for that
intent they quarrell together, and fight
one with another. The whiche maye be
ſéene not only in the Apes and others,
but alſo in Beares,<note place="margin">The Apes</note> whiche of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:2884:36"/>
are fierce and cruell, and yet they
haue ſo greate affection to their yong
ones, that they are not only content to
nouriſhe them with their milke, but ſo
ſoone as they are brought forth, hauing
almoſt no forme nor facion,<note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers.</note> they licke
them and pullyſhe them to make them
more perfect. Likewiſe the little Birds,
who although they haue fiue or ſixe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their wings, and hauyng neyther
milke, grayne, nor other ſéede for their
ſuſtenance, notwithſtanding they ſpare
neither Arte nor diligence, wherewyth
nature hath endued them for their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
It is therefore a true witneſſe
of humaine miſerie, ſooing that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
ſo ſoone to be depriued of that
which to him is due, by iuſt right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being forced to ſucke the milke of
a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge woman, yea, and many times
of ſuch a one, as maye be founde beſt
cheape, what corruption or deformitie
ſo euer ſhe haue. The which many times
is ſo contagious vnto the children, that
it were better for them to be nouriſhed
<pb facs="tcp:2884:37"/>
of ſome brute beaſt in the wilderneſſe,
than to be put into the mercie of ſuche
nurſes, for not onely the bodye remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
infected and marred, as by antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the experience hathe bene in <hi>Titus,</hi>
ſonne to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and many others,
the which as writeth <hi>Lampridus,</hi> was
all the dayes of his life ſubiect to infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and ſickneſſes, for that he was
nourſed of one ſubiect to ſickneſſe. But
that worſe is, when that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
ſome ſpot or crime in the ſoules of
this vicious nourſing, as <hi>Dion</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greke
writeth, in the ſeconde booke of <hi>Ceſars,</hi>
when he maketh mention of <hi>Caligula,</hi>
the fourth Emperour of Rome, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
and infamies of whome, was not
imputed to father or mother, but to the
nurſe that gaue him ſucke, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cruell or barbarous of hir ſelfe, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the endes of hir breaſts with bloud,
cauſing the childe, to whome ſhe gaue

that he did not only commit an infinite

but one head, to the ende that with one

inough in his mothers wombe, as ſoone

new ſorrow, by the ingratitude of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which are ſo delicate and tender
themſelues, that they will not nouriſh
them, but cauſe them to ſucke the milke
of thoſe that oftentimes chaunge their
fruite, or els féede them with milke vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and depraued, by the which meanes
in proceſſe of time there riſeth a number
of diſeaſes, as the Poxe, the Leproſie,
and other like, as many Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue
declared, to the great hurt of poore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and continuall infamie of their

<pb facs="tcp:2884:38"/>
the childe ſhall be frowarde, not by
the receiuing of the milke, but with ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
looking vpon them, if ſhe be a drunkerd,
ſhe will cauſe the childe to be the like,
as it is read in the life of the Emperor
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was a great drunkerd,
for that the nurſe that gaue him ſucke,
did not only drinke vnmeaſurably, but
alſo ſhe gaue the childe ſoppes tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

So that if ſhe be ſickly, ſhe rendreth the
childe ſicklye, if ſhe be wicked, ſhe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the childe alſo to be wicked. Leaue
we him therefore in the protection and
kéeping of his nurſe. In howe manye
daungers is he wrapped, whilſt that he
is a nurſing, what paine and diſpleaſure
haue they, which in the mean time haue
the charge of them, ſome will crie all
the night long, ſo that their nurſes can
take no reſt, ſome when they can ſcant
go, will fall and breake their faces, and
their lims, ſo that many times there is

wiſhe that his mothers wombe had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

héede at the moſt excellent anotamie
that the holie Prophet Ioh maketh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſayth:<note place="margin">Iob. xiii.</note> Man that is born of a woman
hath but a ſhort time to liue, and is full
of miſerie, he commeth vp and is cutte
downe like a flower, he flieth as it were

of theſe wordes, and lay the weight and
authoritie to eche one of his ſentences,
and we ſhall find that all the heatheniſh
<pb facs="tcp:2884:40"/>
Philoſophie is but dreames and ſmoke,
to the regarde of that of the ſpirite of
God, when that he will enſtruct man to
humble and knowe himſelfe, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
when that he calleth him (ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> born
of a woman) hath he ſaide that without a
cauſe? no, for among all the creatures
whome God hath created, there is not
one more ſubiect to miſeries and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
than a woman, eſpeciallye thoſe
that are fruitfull, for they haue ſcant a
monethes reſt in a whole yere, but that
they are continually ouercome with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

than the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto whom in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his noſe and his mouth, the life is

<pb facs="tcp:2884:40"/>
King of all things vpon earth, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſo ſhort life, althoughe he knoweth
howe to employe his time, and yet the
little time that he hath, is ſhortned by
ſléepes, dreams, angers, cares, and other
indignations, in ſuche ſorte that if we
ſhoulde recken al, there reſteth nothing
leſſe than life. Then the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
man to a ſhadowe, what is thys
ſhadow? anye other thing than an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
ſhew, that deceiueth the ſight of
man, a phancie, a falſe figure, without
ſubſtance, the which ſometimes ſéemeth
to be greate, and incontinently little.
Euen ſo it is wyth man, the whiche
ſometimes ſéemeth to be ſomewhat, and
neuertheleſſe, of himſelfe is nothing.
For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he is elected moſt higheſt,
and when that he is in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
of honor, then ſodenly he periſheth,
ſo that no man knoweth where he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
no more than a ſhadowe when the
night is come, and to him it chaunceth
as the Prophet Dauid ſayth: I haue ſéen
the wicked, mightie and flouriſhing as
<pb facs="tcp:2884:41"/>
the gréene Bay, and I haue paſſed by,
and he was gone. I haue ſought him,
but he was not to be found.</p>
            <p>We haue here ſhewed as much as is
poſſible, by howe many perillous daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
man hath his firſt comming forth
into this worlde. Nowe therfore let vs
conſider a little, what he is when he
is ſpro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vp, let vs ſée whether that there
is any end of his miſeries. But if we be
equitable Iudges, we ſhal finde that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he doth encreaſe his miſeries, for it
is the ſeaſon wherein nature doth reare
agaynſte him a more furious combat,
his bloud beginneth to riſe, the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh
him to his owne pleaſure, the
ſenſualitie doth lead him, the malicious
worlde eſpieth him, the diuell tempteth
him, ſo that it is impoſſible, but that he
which is aſſailed with ſo manye vices, &amp;
ſuccoured of none, in the ende is diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
and ouercome, for in the bodye in
youth, riot, libertie, richeſſe, and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
aboundeth all the vices in the
world, ſaith <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and there
<pb facs="tcp:2884:41"/>
plant their ſiege. It ſufficeth not onely
this miſerable creature, Man, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
with ſtraunge milke, but alſo he
muſt be conſtrained to receiue inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others than of his parents.<note place="margin">A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of fathers that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their children to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vicious tutors.</note> For
there are fewe <hi>Catoes</hi> that will take the
pains to inſtruct their children, they are
forced to proue the ſeueritie of maſters,
for to teach them the beginning of Arts
&amp; ſciences, ſeing that there is no ground
be it neuer ſo fruitful &amp; luckye, but will
be vnfruitfull, if it be not diligently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,
and the more fruitfull and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is, the more wéedes and Darnell
it will bring forth: Alſo the more that the
childe is wakened, the more peril there
is, leaſt he ſtraye, it behoueth when the
trées are yong to vpholde them, and to
cut the ouerweightie braunches, if that
afterwarde ye pretende to gather anye
fruit. Likewiſe it is neceſſarie to reform
and correct the vices that raigne in
youth, leaſt that afterwarde it returne
to the parents ignominie and reproch.
But there are at this day manie fathers
<pb facs="tcp:2884:42"/>
and mothers, which for defaulte not to
haue well inſtructed their children in
their youth, in ſteade of reſt and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and eate their breade in theyr
age, with ſorrow. Moreouer there are
many mothers, whiche in ſteade of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them good and godlye inſtructions
in their youth, intertaine and nouriſhe
them in volupteouſneſſe and deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but though they are nouriſhers of
their bodies, yet are they deſtroyers of
their ſoules. And if <hi>Heli</hi> was grieuouſly
puniſhed with his children,<note place="margin">An ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of fathers tovvardes their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> for that he
did not chaſtice them ſo ſharply as their
offences did requier: what ſhal become
of thoſe fathers and mothers, which in
ſteade of correctors of their children, are
their corruptors? and theſe kinde of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are compared to Apes, which kyll
their yong ones by too muche ſtraining
them betwene their armes, and kéeping
them ſo deare, and this is the cauſe that
ſo many fall into the hands of the hang
man, which are to them reformers and
correctors. The auncient Romaines had
<pb facs="tcp:2884:42"/>
thoſe parentes in ſo greate deteſtation
which did not correct their children, that
they did ordein and ſtabliſh a law which
was called <hi>Fatidia.</hi> By the which it was
ordeined, that for the firſt attempt the
ſaid Law ſhould be ſhewed the child, for
the ſeconde time he ſhould be corrected,
and the thirde time hanged, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be baniſhed, as for default of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
chaſticement to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they
were partakers of their euill. But I
would gladly demaund what thoſe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Romaines would doe, if they ſaw
the pitiful eſtate of many of oure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weales, with what Irons, with
what bondes or torments woulde they
beate downe the fathers and mothers?
who in the ſteade of giuing good exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to their familie, and to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues the firſt examples of vertue to
their children, before that they ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be inſtructed, they them ſelues doe
breake and depraue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and wicked examples. For the firſte
precept that they giue them how to liue
<pb facs="tcp:2884:43"/>
well,<note place="margin">Many mothers make the ropes vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are hanged.</note> is to blaſpheme, crie, exerciſe glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
and drunkennes, to diſpiſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of their innocency, to be a forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator?
and to kiſſe women and maidens
in their preſence. And manye mothers
there are this daye in the worlde, which
doe as <hi>Herodias</hi> did, that learne theyr
daughters to daunce, Rethoricke ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
to haunt companies, ſcoffe &amp; flout,
to paint and plaiſter their faces, to deck
their fingers with rings, &amp; their neckes
with Iuels, as though they were Iuell
ſellers pretending to kéepe a ſhop. But
in the ende it will chaunce to them as it
chaunced to the Prophet Dauid, whoſe
ſinne was puniſhed by his children,
which were ſo wicked, that one of them
named <hi>Aman</hi> did deflowre his owne ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Thamar:</hi> and the other called <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi>
did kill hys brother <hi>Aman.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
he ſought the death of hys

kingdome. The rule of the auncient
Philoſophers hath alwayes bene found
true, that many committe manye grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

crimes in this world, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> puniſhing
wherof, God kepeth in the other worlde,
except the ſinne that man committeth
in the bringing vp of his children, for
the whiche cuſtomablye he beareth the
paine and puniſhment in this worlde.
For the father can giue to the child but
fraile and mortall fleſhe, by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, the life taketh end, but by
good learning and knowledge, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
praiſe and memorie redoundeth.
Therefore to conclude, if that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue hene in great perill and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
being nouriſhed with ſpotted milk,
for the moſt part of ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nurſes, yet
the perill doubleth to thoſe that ſhoulde
cauſe them to be inſtructed, for that the
foode of the bodie is more vile than the

we haue not yet ſpoken of <hi>Plato</hi> who
hath more deuinelye philoſophied vpon

and ioye of the ſeconde life, which is the
true and aſſured place of reſt.</p>
            <p>This greate Philoſopher <hi>Plato,</hi> in a
Dialogue that he hath made of death,
and diſcourſe of this wicked world, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to a certaine Philoſopher named
<hi>Socrates,</hi> and ſheweth by a maruellous
eloquence, the miſeries of our life, as
followeth. Knoweſt thou not (ſayth he)
that this humayne lyfe is as a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
the whiche the good and wiſe men
performe in ioye, ſinging with gladnes,
when that of neceſſitie they drawe to
their laſt end. Doeſt thou not know that
man conſiſteth of the ſoule, the which is
ſhut vp within, as in a tabernacle, with
the which nature hath incloſed vs, not
wythout great troubles and vexations:
and yet in the meane time, if ſhe deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
vnto vs any part of hir goods, they
<pb facs="tcp:2884:44"/>
are hidden from vs, and are of a ſhorte
time, ioyned with ſorrowe and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
at the occaſion whereof, the ſoule
féeling dolor and griefe, deſireth the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall
habitation, and wiſheth for the
benefites thereof. Conſider that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of this worlde, is no other
thing than a chaunging from euill to
good. But harken, ſayth he, from thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
vnto thy graue what kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
is there but that thou haſt taſted,
eyther penurie, colde, heate, ſtripes. &amp;c.
yea, before that man can ſhewe his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
and thoughtes. What other
meſſenger or more certaine token can
he haue of his miſeries, than his wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
wailings and complaintes, after
that he hath taſted ſo many euils, &amp; that
he is come to the ſeauenth yeare of his
age: then it behoueth him to haue tutors
and ſcholemaiſters for to inſtruct him in
good learning: growing further in yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and comming into his adoleſcency,
it behoueth him to haue more rigorous
reformers for to tame his wilde youth,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:45"/>
and to breake him to labor. This being
done, his beard beginneth to grow, and
then he becommeth man, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
it is then the time that he
entreth into déeper cogitations and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in the ſpirite: it is requiſite then
that he frequent publike places, that he
haunt the company of thoſe that are as
touchſtones for to knowe the good from
the euill. If he be come of a greate and
noble ſtocke, he muſt make many enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
of warre, to put himſelfe in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
perils, hazarde his life, to ſhed hys
bloud for to die in the bed of honor, or
els he ſhall be reputed a daſtardlye co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and deſpiſed of all men. If he be of
baſe eſtate, and that he be called to the
knowledge of Artes, for all that he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not to runne into a thouſand dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
trauailes, paines, and lettings, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
of the bodie as of the ſoule. He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth
daye and night, and ſweateth
water and bloude, for to get againe that
which ſhall maintaine his eſtate during
his life, and oftentimes it is ſéene what
<pb facs="tcp:2884:45"/>
paine ſo euer man doth take for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
he can ſcant get to ſerue his nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſitie.
It is not therefore without a

that many Patriarkes and Prophetes,
haue choſen this kind of liuing, as that
in which there is leaſt guile and deceit,
and alſo that many Romain Emperors
haue in times paſt left their Pallaces,
Capitols, Arkes, triumphes, glorious
and faire buildings, and Empires, with
all the reſt of their worldly maieſtie, for
to remaine in the fields, to til and labor
the earth, trées and gardens, as we read
of <hi>Diocleſian, Attallus, Cirus, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus
<pb facs="tcp:2884:47"/>

they will ſaye that among theſe Roſes,
there are a great many thornes. This
being true, that God hauing driuen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out of Paradiſe, ſent him into the earth,
as to a place of exile, and ſaid vnto him,
the earth ſhalbe curſed for thy ſake, thou
ſhalt eate therof in trauel and paine all
the dayes of thy life. For ſhe ſhall bring
forth thornes, wéedes, and thiſtels, and
thou ſhalt eate the hearbes of the field,
in the ſweate of thy face ſhalt thou eate
thy bread till thou be turned againe to
earth, out of the which thou waſt taken.
But alas who hath more experimented
or taſted this which God hath ſpoken,
than the poore labourers or huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who manye times after that they
haue labored, ſowed, &amp; tilled the ground,
trauelled all the daye long, endured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

But wilt thou knowe how pitifull

there is no houſhold, but wéepeth

for to ſuſtaine their poore life, virgins
are defloured, the chaſt matrons remain

humanity is defaced, equitie is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
the Region is left waſte, holye

ſée their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlaine before their faces,
there is found an infinit number of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
as manye orphelins: Kings,

the great ſubſidies and taxes, that they
leuell on their ſubiectes, nothing but

filling of diches, keping of watche and

Alas was it not inough, that nature had

To be ſhorte, they muſt frame themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

to all ordinances and maners of the

conſider all that maye render the life of
man in tranquility, happy and content,
we ſhall finde that fortune among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to do good or euill without correction,

The diſcourſe of which if we wil conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that there is no vice in a Prince, but
that they cloke it &amp; hide it vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texetie
of ſome vertue. The ſeconde ſort
are theſe, inuentors of newe ſubſidies:
they reſte no night but that in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:2884:62"/>
they bring ſome inuention or new
practiſe to the Prince, to drawe monye
from the poore people: they cauſe newe
ſtatutes to be erected: they break, forme,
reforme, diminiſhe and adde: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
confiſcations and proſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
in ſuch ſorte that all their ſtudie is to
make themſelues rich on the calamities
and miſeries of the poore people. There
is yet another ſort, that vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of honeſtie counterfeiting good
men, haue alwayes the eye on other
mens liuings, and make the office of
reformer of vices: they accuſe and eſpie
out other mens liues: they inuent wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and falſe deuiſes, yea, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to get other mens goods, but alſo
ſéeke their death,<note place="margin">The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders made moſt dreadfull prayers for vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and by their meanes
they cauſe manye a one to be put to

For this cauſe it is that the Elders
(as <hi>Herodianus</hi> writeth) if their Kinges
or Princes had behaued them ſelues
wickedlye in the adminiſtration of the
publicke affaire, they condemned them
<pb facs="tcp:2884:62"/>
for diuels after their death, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the temples with the Prieſtes,
praying openlye to the Gods, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them, but recommended them to
the infernall powers, to the ende that
they might be grieuouſlye tormented.
The which hath not bene onely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the Elders before vs, but alſo of
certaine in our time, as witneſſeth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius
Geuara,</hi> Crowner to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
in a certaine Epiſtle wherein he
ſayeth that to the Viceroy of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> for
vengeance of the tyrannies that he had
exerciſed againſt his ſubiectes, after hys
death, they made this Epitaphe on hys
tombe that followeth.</p>
            <p>Qui propter nos homines, &amp; propter
noſtram ſalutem deſcendit ad inferos.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſée the miſeries wherin
Princes are ſubiect. Here are the thorns
that they receiue in recompence of their
brightneſſe and royall dignitie, whiche
ought to be like a Lampe, that giueth

is darkened with any vice, it is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochable
<pb facs="tcp:2884:63"/>
than in any other priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For they alone ſinne not (as <hi>Plato</hi>
writeth) by the fault that they commit,
but by the euill example that they giue:

eſtate of the Aſſirians, Perſians, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,

more wicked than good. Let vs conſider
what the Romane Emperors were,
which haue bene eſtéemed the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing

thou ſhalt find them ſo ouercomed with
vices and all kinde of cruelties, that I

that they had made it riche with manye

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the vices that they brought with

them, are more greater than the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
that they haue gained, for the

what felicitie is in the principall, the

               </gap> then the infamie of thoſe that are
wicked, is written in hiſtories for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
memory therof. The which thing
Kings, Princes, Emperors, and others
conſtituted in dignities, ought more to
feare a thouſande folde, than the toung
that ſpeaketh euill, the whiche can but
ſhame the liuing, but bookes ſlaunder &amp;
defame the deade. All the which things
<pb facs="tcp:2884:64"/>
being liuely conſidered by <hi>Diocleſian,</hi>
and manye other Emperors, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
their Scepters and Empires, and
withdrew them into the fieldes, louing
much better to remaine the reſt of their
life in ſome deſert place, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

            <p>Let vs leaue ſpeaking of Kings, and

we with the heades, whiche are Popes,
and Pontificals, are not they happie
and fortunate in this worlde? their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
is the moſt greateſt, and ſupreme
of al other. It is obtained without paine

reuerence and honor, they are riche, and
of great power, and all giuen to honors

of pouertie. But if thou do well conſider
the ende of the Tragedie, thou wilt not
count them happy, but abhorre their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:65"/>
and alſo complaine and bewayle
their ſtate,<note place="margin">Pope Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine in his bookes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicitie of Princes.</note> for if they will follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſteps

of his neighbour, they alone ſhould

watch for all the world, they ſhould haue
no reſt, but all the minutes of their life
ſhoulde be beſtowed for the health of the
publicke weale, for feare that Sathan
ſeduct not their flocke. For if it be ſo, as
S. Iohn Chriſoſtome writeth vpon the
Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, that he that is
the rector or gouernor of one onlye
Churche or congregation, maye with
great difficultie be ſaued, ſo great is his
charge. In what perill then are the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
that are gardes, tutors, protectors
and heades of all Chriſtian Churches.
The which things the Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> a
man learned and of a good life, hauing
many times waied and conſidered, was
accuſtomed to ſaye with teares to his
moſt priuieſt friendes, that among all
<pb facs="tcp:2884:65"/>
the eſtates of the worlde, there was
none that ſéemed to hym more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
and more perillous of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than the eſtate of Popes and
Pontificalles. For although the throne
and ſeidge wherein he did ſit, was richly
decked with diuers pompes, yet was it
filled with many ſharp thornes, and the
precious cloke with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whiche they were
couered,<note place="margin">A notable ſentence of Pope Adrian on the miſerie of Popes.</note> was full of ſharpe pointed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
and ſo heauie to beare, that his
ſhoulders therewith was pained, and as
for the Miter that couered their heads,
it is a very flame that burned euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the bottome of the ſoule: and if we will
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the notable Philoſophie of Pope

ſhall finde it not vnprofitable: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

yet if ye reade <hi>Platina</hi> and others
that haue written their liues, you ſhall
finde them ſo wicked, that ye will ſaye
that there are manye Wolues among
theſe paſtors. In conſideration thereof
S. Bernard lamenteth the condition of
<pb facs="tcp:2884:66"/>
Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> when that <hi>Rome</hi> was
leſſe depraued than it is at this day: but
what iuſt occaſion ſhoulde he haue to
complain, if he had ſene the diſorder and
confuſion that hath raigned ſince hys

a better ſchole, bluſhe for ſhame, and

is of a truth, that the Prieſts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and Gentiles, were choſen among
the others,<note place="margin">Clictho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus.</note> of a more ſingular doctrine
and manners leſſe depraued, as the
Prieſts of Egypt,<note place="margin">The eſtate of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Prieſtes.</note> which being nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
of the publicke, had no other ſcience
nor occupation, after that they had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

that they were (as <hi>Ariſtotel</hi> writeth) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors
of Mathematickes, and their

had in ſo great admiration, that
<hi>Ligurges, Pythagoras, Plato, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and the moſt part of the renoumed
Philoſophers of Gréece did forſake their

after that they had ſaid their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

the ſecretes of the firmament,

of learning, as their ſolitarie

their moſte vrgent affaires, they made
their refuge to them as to their Gods.
The Indians in like maner to their
Prieſts, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they call <hi>Gymnoſophiſtes,</hi>
being ſo prompt in doctrine, and ſo wel
ruled in good maners, that they alone
aboue other men by their eloquence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
the greate tyrant <hi>Alexander,</hi>

them without harme, but hauing their
prudencie in admiration, left them in
liberties and fredomes, and honoured
them with an infinite number of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and magnificall preſents. Alſo the
auncient Gaules or Frenchmen, the
which at that time had no knowledge of
the Goſpell, had (as writeth <hi>Ceſar</hi> in his
Commentaries) their Prieſtes, whome
they called <hi>Druids,</hi> who were ſo ſtraight
of liuing, and of ſo great doctrine in ſo
<pb facs="tcp:2884:67"/>
great admiration, that they wondred at
them, as if they had bene Gods: who
after that they had beſtowed a certayne

inſtructed youth, diſputed of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie

and of the nature of things, and ſo lead
the eſtate of their life in vertuous occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
and works, not letting one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of the time to ſlip without bearing
ſome profite to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale. Here
is the ſtate, here is the life, here is the
maners and occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Prieſts that
had no knowledge of God, without law,
without faith, without hope of a ſecond
life, and without feare of Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
Let vs conferre the doctrine of
the moſt part of our Prieſts, their lyfe,
maners and conuerſation, and we ſhall
finde that theſe one day ſhal riſe againſt
them, euen at the daye of iudgement,
and ſhalbe the accuſers of their wicked
life: it is vnto the wicked to whome I
ſpeake, it is vnto the vices, and not vnto
<pb facs="tcp:2884:68"/>
the perſons. I know well that there are
a great number of good and learned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
in manye Chriſtian Regions and
Prouinces, which are vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the flocke, to whome they preach
moſt worthily the word of God. I know
alſo that there are many excellent Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in this uniuerſitie, and in other
places, by whoſe good erudition and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
all Europe is at this daye illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.
But to the contrarie, how many
Prieſtes are there in the world, that are
drowned in ſuche ignorance, that wyth
great paine they can ſaye a Maſſe, but
muſt mumble it betwéene their téeth, for
feare that their faults be diſcouered, ſo
dull are they, without knowledge and
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the dignitie, powre and
ſtrength of the ſacraments which they
miniſter. There are manye paſtors at
this day that haue better ſkil in Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
facions, or els in ſome other vanitie,
than in deſoluing the doubtes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,

<pb facs="tcp:2884:68"/>

that all their actions paſſe before the

that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of a Iudge be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable

For alwayes the people will finde
ſome fault, as <hi>Plutarchus</hi> writeth in his
pollicies. The Athenienſies murmured
at their <hi>Simonidus</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpake too hie:
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Thebia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s accuſed <hi>Paniculus,</hi> for that he

noted their <hi>Ligurges,</hi> for that he
went alwayes holding downe of hys
head: the Romanes founde a great vice
in <hi>Scipion,</hi> for that in ſléeping he ſnorted
too loude: the Vticences defamed the
good <hi>Cato</hi> in his eating: they founde
<hi>Pompeius</hi> vnciuile, for that he woulde

blamed <hi>Hannibal,</hi> for that he
was alwayes vnlaced and open before
his ſtomacke: others murmured at <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Ceſar,</hi> for that he caried the girdell
of euil grace. And yet this is but little in
compariſon of other good men, that this
people or common ſort haue perſecuted,
baniſhed, and in the ende put to death
in ſatiſfaction of their good ſeruices that
they had done in the common welth. If
that greate Orator <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were
aliue, he could ſay ſomewhat, who after
that he had bene ſo iuſt and faithfull a
protector of his common wealth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
was in the ende vniuſtlye bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
as though he had committed ſome

<hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſo yll treated of his
that he was conſtrained to wander mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
in the world. The Romanes did
the like to <hi>Camilus:</hi> the Gréekes to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurges</hi>
and <hi>Solon:</hi> the one of them was
ſtoned, and the other hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Moyſes and many other holy men haue

ſo manye times taſted the furie of the

this is the concluſion, riches cauſeth a

hauing taſed the martirdomes of
mariage, ſaid that there were but twoo
good dayes in all the life of mariage, the
one was the wedding day, and the other
the day that the woman dieth, for that on
the day of mariage, there is made good
cheare, the Bride is freſh and new, and
all new things are pleaſant, and of all
pleaſures the firſt is moſte delectable.
The other day that he ſayth is good, is
the daye wherein the woman dieth, for
that the beaſt being deade, deade is the
poiſon, and that by the death of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
the huſband is out of bondage. In
confirmation wherof, there is recited a
<pb facs="tcp:2884:77"/>
pretie hiſtorie of a noble Romane, who
the day after his mariage, after that he
had lien the firſt night with his wife,
was verye penſiue and ſorowfull, and
being demaunded of certaine of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friends, what was the occaſion
of his ſorrow, ſéeing that his wife was
ſo faire, riche, and come of a noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie:
ſhewing them his foote, he ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
out his leg, ſaying, my friendes,
my ſhooe is newe, faire and well made,

harder to finde in this woride, than a
good woman, following the auncient
Prouerb, that ſayth that a good woman,
a good Mule, and a good Goate, and thrée
daungerous beaſtes. Alſo is recited the
ſaying of <hi>Plutarchus,</hi> the which demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

if there be any thing more lighter

other mens children, or if by chaunce

S. Ierome and S. Auguſtine do declare
that in their time, the word of God was
had in ſuch reuerence, that it was ſpred
in all the corners of the earth, euen in

ſhineth but in a little end and corner of

Europe. And yet that which ought to
giue vs moſt feare, are the diuerſitie of
opinions that are among vs, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
wherein we are wrapped, for that
which one ſayth is white, another ſayth

one, is darkneſſe to another, that which
ſome finde ſwéete, others iudge it bitter,
that which is Ieſus Chriſts veritie and
heauen to one, is Antichriſtes dreames
and hell to another. In the meane time
what ſhoulde the Ignorant thinke, in
what trouble, perplexitie and diſpayre
ought their poore conſciences to be in,
when they ſée that denied of one, which

wyth the which the parties that

the powre of the venim was ſo

the which did runne day and night vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
and with the loſſe of their bloude
they loſt their liues, and it came to ſuch
extremitie &amp; deſolation, that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with

dying, the which afterward were chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to a violet or blewiſh colour, as if
the bloud had ben ſpred al ouer their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And to be ſhort, the deſolation was
ſo great, that the father kept no count of
his childe, nor the huſbande of his wife,
yea with monie in their handes, oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
they died for default of a glaſſe of
water, or if by fortune they had for to
eate, the ſickneſſe was ſo cruel and ſhort
that they died many times with meat in
their mouthes, and the furie of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
was ſo inflamed, and al the town
<pb facs="tcp:2884:84"/>
ſo infected, that with their looke that they
wold caſt vpon ſome, they woulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them, and their winde and breath
was ſo venemous, that there would riſe
botches and ſores on the parties that
therewith were attainted. It is a fearful
and pitiful thing in nature, the which
a Phiſition left vs in writing, the which
was ordeined of the chiefe of the Citie,
to viſite the ſicke, that the euill was ſo
cruell, that no remedie might be found,
ſo that they that were taken therewith,
had no hope of health, but by the aſſault
of death. And they were ſo acquainted
therewith, that when they felt them

take a ſhéete, and lie downe aliue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
looking for no other thing than the

After the great ruine of Italie, and that

ſuch ſcarcitie of foode and ſuſtenance,
that they were faine to eate all kinde of

for the hunger was ſo great, that the

pieces of ſiluer, and the fourth part of a
meaſure of Pigeons dung, fiue pieces
of ſiluer, and yet that which is furtheſt
from our humanitie, after that all the
vittailes were conſumed, the mothers
did eate their owne children, in ſuch ſort
that a poore wife of the Citie made hir
complaint to the King of Iſraell, (ſéeing
him vpon the wall) for that hir neighbor
would not kéepe and performe the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

which was, that they ſhoulde eate hir

ſhe hirſelf was oppreſſed with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

that ſhe had plaide this pitifull Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
the ſouldiers came againe, and they
ſmelling the ſmell of the roſted childe,
began to threaten hir euen to die, if that
ſhe brought not forth the meat. But ſhe
being as it were in a rage, ſéeking mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to follow hir ſonnes ſteppes, being
nothing abaſhed, ſaid vnto them, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my friendes, I haue done you no
wrong, beholde I haue kept you your
parts: ſo ending hir wordes, ſhe brought
forth the reſt of hir childe, and ſet it on
the table, wherewith the ſouldiers being
amaſed and confounded, felt themſelues
ſo ſmitten to the heart, that they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
dumbe and ouercome, but ſhe to the
contrarie, with a fearful looke, and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt

countenance, ſaid vnto them, what
my friends, be merie, it is my fruite, it
is my childe, it is my déede, why do you
not eate therof? I haue ſatiſfied my ſelfe

therin than the mother that bare him?
thinke you ſcorne of my meate, of the
which I haue eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before you? But they
which coulde not ſuffer or abide to ſée ſo
pitiful a ſpectacle, went their ways, and
left hir alone with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reſt of hir child, the
which was in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt that was left

with their eyes, or as it were touched
with their finger, therefore I will ſhew
here howe that God doeth ſpare vs no
more, than he hath done our Elders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, when that he is angrie for oure
ſinnes, as it ſhalbe plainely ſhewed by
this Hiſtorie that followeth, the whiche
<pb facs="tcp:2884:88"/>
               <hi>Willyam Paradin</hi> hath written,<note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our age.</note> a man
learned and wel ſéene in the knowledge
of Hiſtories or memoriall things done
in our time, where as he ſayth, that the
yeare a thouſand, fiue hundreth, twentie
eight, the world was giuen to ſo many
vices, and was ſo full of ſinne and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
that it was not humbled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
bicauſe of the furious aſſaultes
and great effuſion of bloud of the former
wars,<note place="margin">The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous contagion of our time.</note> but to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, it was become
worſe and wholy depraued, by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
whereof the bonde of Gods wrathe
was ſprede out in this poore Realme of
Fraunce, after ſuch a ſorte, that it was
thought that all was brought to an end.
For there happened ſo great calamitie,
pouertie and miſerie, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the like knowen by memoriall of
time, of the like affliction, aſwell in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
bodies, as in fruties and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the earth, for during the ſpace
of fiue whole yeares,<note place="margin">A famine, the yere 1528.</note> which beganne the
yeare. 1528. the time came into ſuche a
diſorder, that the foure ſeaſons left their
<pb facs="tcp:2884:89"/>
natural courſe, and ſhewed themſelues
chaunged and altered among themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
the Spring time being Harueſt,
and the Harueſt the Spring time, the
Sommer in Winter, and the Winter
in Sommer, but aboue all, the Sommer
had ſuch powre, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it occupied the raigne
and domination of the others, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye
againſt his nature contrarie, ſo
that in the déepeſt colde of Winter,
that is to wit, December, Ianuarie and
February, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which times they ought
to reſt, die, leaue the ground, and giue it
ouer to froſtes, ſnowes and cold, it was
ſo extreme whote, and the earth was ſo
heated and burned, that it was a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſight to ſée. For in fiue yeares there
fell little froſt that remained aboue one
day or twain, ſo that by this vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
great heat, maintained and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the vermine of the earth, as Todes,
Frogs, Graſhoppers, Caterpillers, and
ſuch like, in ſuch quantity, that the yong
and tender corne was no ſooner come
forth, and out of his blade, but that it
<pb facs="tcp:2884:89"/>
was eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and deuoured, which was the
cauſe that the corne that ought to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie,
and haue many eares and ſtalks
of one roote, brought forth but one or
twoo, and yet very barren, beeing full of
Darnell and blaſtings, in ſuch ſort, that
when it was gathered, the moſte part
came not aboue the quantitie of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
ſéede, and manye times leſſe. And
this famine laſted fiue yeares without
ceaſing, a thing ſo pitifull and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it is not poſſible for man to y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
the like without ſeeing, whiche
was the cauſe that a quarter of Wheat
was ſold at Lyonnois, Foreſts, Auerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Bauionlois, Burgonny, Sauoye,
Dolphinye, and manye other places, for
the ſumme of .xiiij .xvi .xviii. poundes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noys.
And the poore people were ſo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
with ſuche dearth and ſcarcitie ſo
long a time, that a number of miſchiefs
and maledictions did follow. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore
people that liued well inoughe of theyr
rents and reuenues, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to
forſake all and aſke their bread for Gods
<pb facs="tcp:2884:90"/>
ſake, and the number of poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
did ſo encreaſe, that it was a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſight to ſée them in flockes harde
to ouercome, and more daungerous to
endure, for beſide the great feare that
men had to be robbed of them, the which
extreme neceſſitie did conſtraine, there
proceded a great ſtinking and infectious
ſmell out of their bodies, for that they
filled their bellies with all kindes of
hearbes, good, naught, helthfull and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous,
ſo that there was no herbes left
in Gardens, that they might come by,
not ſo muche as the ſtalkes and rootes
of Coleworts (of the which) they founde
not the one halfe to ſuſtaine them. And
when that there was no more to be had
in Gardens, they had their refuge to
wilde herbes, not vſed, ſo that the moſt
part of them, woulde ſéeth great kettels
with Mallowes and other herbes, and
ſo ſatiſfied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as doe hogs. But it
was a greater wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der to ſée bread made
of chaffe, ackornes, and of haye ſéede, the
which the poore were forced to eate, by
<pb facs="tcp:2884:90"/>
impacience and rage of hunger, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
remembring themſelues, howe that
hogs do delite to féede on Fearne rootes,
they made breade thereof, deceiuing or
beguiling the hogs of their foode and
ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The which is inough to make
vs knowe how much oure Lord Gods
wrath was againſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> filth of our ſinne,
ſéeing that he permitted that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould
be brought to ſuch neceſſitie, as to eate
with the hogges, by the which meanes
followed a number diſeaſes, and the
worlde fell into a greate feare, ſéeing
a great bande or companie of men and
women, yong and olde, goe ſhaking
or trembling in the ſtréetes, the others
hauing the ſkinne ſwollen lyke drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
others lying halfe deade on the
ground, drawing their laſt breath, and
of ſuch kind of people were ſtables and
barnes filled, others were ſo langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
that of great paine, they coulde tel
their neceſſitie, nor yet ſcant draw their
breath, but quiuered and ſhaked with
their legs, rather ſéeming like to fancies
<pb facs="tcp:2884:91"/>
and dreames, than men. Beſides al this
the great compaſſion was to ſee a great
company of poore mothers, bare, leane,
and diſfigured, compaſſed and charged
with many yong children, the which by
great diſtreſſe of famine, cried out vnto
their mothers for foode, the which beheld
them ſo pitifullye and dolefully, that it
ſéemed to me the greateſt pitie of al, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the anguiſhe and diſtreſſe of heart
that they ſhewed, by ſhedding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of teares, and pitifull looke. The
ſaide <hi>Paradin</hi> writeth, to haue ſéene at a
place called Louhans in Burgonie, a
poore woman, the which by great means
and importunitie had found the meanes
to get a piece of bread, the which was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſnatched out of hir hand, by a litle
childe of hirs, the which ſhe gaue ſucke
to, and held in hir armes, the which was
ſcant a yeare olde, the mother had neuer
ſéene it eate bread before, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which ſhe
maruelled greatly, beholding hir lyttell
childe, how it did eate this ſame browne
breade that was hard and drie, with ſo
<pb facs="tcp:2884:91"/>
great an appetite, that it was a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
&amp; maruellous thing to behold, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
woulde haue gathered togither the
crums that fell from his mouth, but the
child began to crie out, as though it had
ſuſtained ſome great wrong, for anger
that he ſaw his mother gather togither
the crums, as though he had ben afraied
not to haue had inough. O eternal &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God, what image? what ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?
might there be founde anye heart ſo
void of humanity, that might not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thereby with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion &amp; pitie? The
ſaid Author reciteth yet, that in an other
village (not far diſtant from the before
ſaide) were found two women, the which
not finding wherewithall to ſuſtaine
or ſlake their hunger, did eate and fill
themſelues with a venemous herbe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Scyla,</hi> being like Onyons, or wilde
Lettiſe, and not knowing the vertue
nor propertie of the ſaide herbe, poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themſelues, in ſuch ſort and maner
that their féete and hands became gréen
like Lezardes ſkinnes, and the poyſon
<pb facs="tcp:2884:92"/>
came forth vnder their nayles of theyr
fingers, ſo that there was no remedie
but that they died ſoone after. Finallye,
this miſerie and calamitie being of a
long and an intollerable time, the good
huſbandmen of the countries hauing
lande, heritages and poſſeſſions, were
conſtrained to haue their refuge to rich
Merchantes, whereof ſome had hourded
vp whole barnes full of corne, for to bye
firſt of them, whilſt that their monie laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and then afterwardes was landes,
and heritages laid to gage, &amp; ſolde who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and at a ſmal price, of the which ſuch
was worth a hundreth pounds, for the
which they had not ten, ſo great was the
miſchiefe, and yll lucke of this curſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice
and vſurie, and yet it was not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that men were afflicted &amp; ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the vehement yre and ſcourge
of Gods wrath, by coniuration of al the
elements, &amp; almoſt of all the creatures,
but that men alſo (their like) did afflict
and perſecute them. For theſe couetous
rich men, ſéeing the time to ſuccéede, as
<pb facs="tcp:2884:92"/>
they did wiſh and deſier, for to fyll thier
cheſts &amp; coffers, did not faile to their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
they had Factors for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for to put to ſale y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goods
at their price, and at the worde of thoſe
that had corne, for the bying wherof the
good people wold leaue nothing vnſold,
euen to lay to gage their clothing, for to
haue foode, and that which was worſe,
the moſt part ſawe not that meaſured
that they bought, and notwithſtanding
they were conſtrained to take it, ſuch as
pleaſed the ſeller, and to bye (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
goth) a pig in a poke. And I muſt
here tel, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there hath bene ſuch a vſurer
that hath had a piece of grounde for leſſe
than the writings haue coſte at a Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
hands. Thoſe that haue made ſuche
rapines, know well that I ſpeak truth.
And after al theſe miſchiefs, you ſhould
ſée nothing but good people driuen out
of their houſes and goods, they, their
wiues and children, and then they died
in Hoſpitals, of the which, theſe falſe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are the murtherers, as if they had
<pb facs="tcp:2884:93"/>
cut their throtes, and they ſhall render
and giue account before him, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
nothing is hidden. We haue here made
a long declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thrée ſcourges, with
the which our God is wonted to waken
his creatures, when that he féeleth them
obſtinate and wallowing in their ſins,
but this before is little, to the regard of
other cruel diſeaſes, with the which our
life is threatned, and beſieged all oure
dayes.<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of diſeaſes, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
               <hi>Plinie</hi> and manye other Phiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

that ſince two thouſand yeare, they

kinde of ſickneſſes, to the whiche
the humaine bodies are ſubiect, without
reckning thoſe that daylie encreaſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the which they make mention of
ſome ſo cruell, that I cannot refer them
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſhame. I will leaue here to ſpeake
of the vulgar and common ſort of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
where as it behoueth ſometimes to
burne the members with hote burning
catares, ſaw a ſunder bones, take oute
the paine in the head, pull bowels out
<pb facs="tcp:2884:93"/>
of their bodies, as though there ſhoulde
be made ſome Inuentarie &amp; Anotamy.
Others that haue bene made to keepe
diets ſo ſtraight, bicauſe of the furie of
their diſeaſe (as <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
that they haue bene conſtrained to
drinke their owne vrine to quench their

their hunger. Others being perſwaded
that they haue ſwallowed downe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
to the whiche there was no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

liue ſerpents put into the Baſen wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

that they were come out of their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,

<hi>Marcus Varonus,</hi> one of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt

ſayth, that in Spaine there was a great

What witneſſe of our humaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
is here declared in al theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
O what diſcipline or ſchoole is this,
for to teach man to know himſelfe? what
a maruell of the powre of God is thys
toward his creatures? of whom the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes
are ſo terrible and fearfull,
that as ſoone as man thinketh to ſpread
out his horns, or to riſe againſt his god,
he can ſo well at the firſt bridle and pull
down his boldneſſe and proude lookes, &amp;
ſo tame him, that not onely he doth ſend

<pb facs="tcp:2884:101"/>
war, famine &amp; peſtilence, but in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
there is neither element, nor other
brutiſh creature, but that ſéeketh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye,
euen to the little beaſts, which are
as miniſters and executors of his diuine
iuſtice, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is manifeſt, not only by
the witneſſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heathen, but alſo by
holie Scripture, when that the Frogs &amp;
Graſhoppers did forſake their places,<note place="margin">Exod. 8. &amp; 9. Cap.</note>
for to aſcende and come vp to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and euen to the bed of the obſtinate
<hi>Pharao.</hi> We haue here before ſhewed a
ſtraunge philoſophie of the miſerie of
man. For if man were of yron, or as
hard as a Diamond, it is maruel howe
he can endure the one halfe of his life,
without being bruſed and broken, ſéeing
the paynes, anguiſhes, trauels and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that it behoueth him at all times
to ſuſtain. Notwithſtanding, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
ſo euer happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, what charge
or burthen y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature doth lay vpon him,
yet he can not, nor wil not hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble himſelf
vnder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mighty hand of God for to cary
his yoke, nor yet to know himſelfe to be
<pb facs="tcp:2884:102"/>
as he is. Therefore by good right doeth
the Lord God reproue him by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that he hath the forehead of braſſe,<note place="margin">Eſay. 4.</note>
and the necke of yron, the which things
being yll vnderſtanded of <hi>Plato</hi> and of
<hi>Plinie,</hi> ſéeing the great gulfe of miſeries
wherein man is plunged in, euen from
his birth, to his graue, hathe called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cruell and a vſureſſe, the whiche
cauſeth ſo many intereſts to be payd to
man, of his excellency and dignitie, that
they haue eſteemed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brute beaſtes more
happier than man, but both the one and
the other vnder this name of nature
haue chalenged or complayned on God
of vniuſtice and crueltie. But to proue
the contrary, all the euils and this ſea of
miſerie, wherewith man is charged, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not of the hatred of God, but of
the malice and corruption of man who
is the very Author of all his afflictions
and calamities, for thinking to be equal
with his God, he hath begonne to fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his nobleneſſe, and to efface the ymage
of God grauen in him, and to chaunge
<pb facs="tcp:2884:102"/>
it to the likeneſſe of a Diuell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is happened to him that which the
Prophet Dauid ſayth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note> God hath called
man to honor, yet he doeth not conſider
it, and therefore is compared to the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
that periſh. Here you may ſée that
his proudneſſe, arrogancie and bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
hath bene the cauſe of all the ſores
and maledictions of humaine kind. For
yf it had not bene for the ambition and
deſier to be great (of the firſt man) we
had bene as the Aungels in heauen, ſuch
as we ſhall be at the reſurrection, and
crowned with honor and glorie. And yet
this is little, as touching the paines and
afflictions before mencioned, which are
as a leaning ſtock to our bodies, but the
diſeaſes of the ſpirite is much worſe, the
which are muche more perillous than
the afflictions of the bodie. For thoſe of
the bodie, ſayth <hi>Plutarchus,</hi> do manifeſt
and ſhew out of themſelues, eyther by
the yll colour of the face, or by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the thumbe, or els by ſome other
meanes or griefe, and beyng knowen,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:103"/>
the remedies are incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſought for.<note place="margin">Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſpirite.</note>
But as touching the maladies of the
ſpirite, he that is ſicke, cannot iudge by
ſignes or otherwiſe his griefe, for it is
in the ſpirite, who can then giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
&amp; therfore the pacient not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his diſeaſe, ſéeketh not alſo for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.
Furthermore there is a greater
abuſe, for thoſe that haue their bodies
afflicted, we call them by the name of
ſicke, the which doth torment them, as
if they were perſecuted with a franſie,
we name them franticke: if they be pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their ioyntes, we ſaye they haue
the Gout: if they ſhake, we ſay they haue
the Palſey. But O immortall God we
do the contrarie to the afflicted ſpirites,
for thoſe that are wrathfull, burne in
their paſſion: thoſe that wound one and
kill another, we call them hardie and
ſtrong, &amp; we ſay that they eſteme much
honor and commendation: they that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
women and virgins, we call that
bearing of loue: thoſe that are proude,
and that ſéeke by all vnlawfull meanes
<pb facs="tcp:2884:103"/>
to climbe vp to high dignities, we name
them graue, honorable, men of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
and ripe iudgement: thoſe that
are couetous, and that become riche in
ſhort times, &amp; that beguile their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
by many ſubtilties &amp; inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, we
call this good huſbandrie, &amp; ſo forth euen
of al the reſt. Here you may ſée how that
we cloke all theſe things. Here you may
ſée that this ſhadowing or cloking of
vice vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mantell of vertue, is cauſe
of ſo many euils and miſchiefes, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
happen and fall vpon vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by the onely name, worthie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
the things that merite blame and
diſhonor, of the whiche the moſt part of
humaine ſpirits at this day are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and vexed, as we haue done thoſe of
the bodie: what eloquence or dignitie of
worde might ſatiſfice? what maieſtie
of ſentences might comprehende them?
for ſeeing that the worlde wherein we
are, is at this daye drowned in ſo manie
kindes of vices, that it ſéemeth to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,

the Eccleſiaſticall ſort, Iudas, and
Simon Magus ſowed the firſte ſéede
therof, the which hath ſo fructified ſince,
that many others haue taſted and felt
therof. At ſuch time as the Church was

the Tyrants and Infidels, and that it
was gouerned by poore fiſhermen, they
nouriſhed theſe poore, and ſuffered not
that anye one ſhoulde want. But nowe
that it is at the higheſt degrée of riches,
and that it is gouerned by the greate

that now we may ſée the ſtréetes full of

Howe manye afflicted ſoules are there
with this maladie. The ſeaſon is nowe
come, that all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world is no other thing,
than a verie place of enuious, it is the
moſt auncienteſt and eldeſt of all, and
notwithſtanding it is the moſt practiſe
of our age, and ſéemeth to returne to his
firſt infancie, the experience of the firſte
age was in Adam and the Serpent, in
Abel and Caine, in Iacob and Eſau, in
Ioſeph and his brethren, in Saul and
Dauid, in Achitophell and Thuſi, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Mardocheus, the whiche pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
not one another for the riches that

which daily is put in vre amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians

for our worlde is ſo farre out of

not onely to thoſe that enioy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

and thoſe that are in the higheſt degrée,

of the fauor of Kings and of Princes, in

their death, and cauſe them to be diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and therefore the wiſe Emperour
<hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſaide that Enuie was
a Serpent ſo enuenimed, that there

was neuer mortall among the mortals,
but that of hir teeth haue bene bitten, of

who euer ſawe the exceſſiue pompes in

that we may well name our worlde, a
<pb facs="tcp:2884:109"/>
worlde of Sattin, of Veluet, of Purple,
and of Silke, of the whiche we take ſo
much paine to decke this carin carcaſſe
ſo curiouſly, and in the meane time we
care not nor kéepe no count if our poore
Soule remain foule and ful of ſores and
woundes, and rent by a great many of
enormious and haynous ſinnes, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
which it is compaſſed, but let vs beware
after all theſe things that that happen
not to vs which the Prophete did write
againſt the women of Ieruſalem, who
after he had reproned their pryde, their

It ſhal happen to you, ſaith the Lord

            <p>We may alſo adde another affliction
of the ſpirite to the former which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Loue,<note place="margin">Loue is counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſpirite.</note> but so contagious that al the
eſtates of the worlde doe féele it, an euil
ſo peſtilent and venemous, that it plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
and intermedleth among all ages
indifferently, as all the diuels doe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
all the Elementes without excepting
perſons or qualitie of olde or yong, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
or diſcrete, of féeble or ſtrong. And
the greateſt pain in this maladie is that
they become mad and out of their wits,
if they be not wel treated and medicined
at the firſt. And therefore it is that <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Aeginetaus</hi> in his thirde booke ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to al thoſe that are perſecuted of this
furor of euill, a rule howe to liue. The
which <hi>Ompercleus</hi> following the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel
of <hi>Plato,</hi> ordained alſo who made two
kindes of furies, of the whiche he called
one in Gréeke <hi>Exotikon,</hi> whych ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Latine <hi>Amatorium,</hi> and in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
Loue. I haue ſéene thoſe opened,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:110"/>
that haue died of this maladie, that had
their bowels ſhronke, their poore heart
all burned, their Liuer and Lightes all
vades and conſumed, their Braines en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domaged,
and I thynke that their poore
ſoule was burned by the vehement and
exceſſiue heate that they did indure, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that the rage of Loue had ouercomme
them, and euen as the cure of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie
is vncurable, alſo the originall is
very doubtful to thoſe that haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The Phiſitions ſaye, that this rage of
Loue that preſſeth ſo ſore, and that is
ſpred through the worlde, proceedeth of
the correſpondent qualitie of bloude,
and that the complectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> engendreth the
ſame mutuall loue: the Aſtrologians in
like maner ſaye that Loue proceadeth
when that two metting haue one mind,
or that they be chaunged in ſome other
conſtellation, for they be conſtrained to
loue togither. Other Philoſophers haue
ſaide, that when we caſt our ſight vpon
that which we deſire, ſodenly certaine
ſpirits that are engendred of the moſte
<pb facs="tcp:2884:110"/>
perfecteſt part of bloud, proceding from
the heart of the partie which we do loue,
and promptly aſcendeth euen vp to the
eyes, and afterwarde conuerteth into
vapors inuiſible, and entreth into oure
eyes, which are bent to receyue them,
euen ſo as in looking in a glaſſe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
therein ſome ſpotte by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and ſo from the eyes it penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to the heart, and ſo by littell and
little it ſpreadeth all about, and therfore
the miſerable Louer being drawen to,
by the new ſpirites, the which deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to ioine and drawe neare, with
their principall and natural habitation,
is conſtreyned to mourne and lament
his loſt libertie. Others after that they
had ſtudied all that euer they could ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and not finding the ſpring and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of this ſo furious an euil, haue ſaid
that Loue was one, I know not what,
that came I know not how, and burned
I know not how, a thing verie certaine
and true, for he that doeth conſider, the
ieſtes, facions of doing, countenances,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:111"/>
furies and Eclipſes of theſe poore paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he woulde confeſſe, that he neuer
ſawe a more ſtraunger Metamorphoſie,
or ſpectacle more ridiculous, ſodenlye
you ſhall ſée them drowned in teares,
making the aire to ſounde with their
cries, ſighes, plaints, murmurings and
imprecations, another time you ſhall ſée
them colde, frozen, &amp; in a traunce, their
faces pale and chaunged, other times, if
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they haue had any good lucke, or other
gentle entertainment of the thing that
they loue,<note place="margin">Geſtes and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> you ſhall ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gay, chearfull
and pleaſant, ſo that you woulde iudge
that they were chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into ſome other
forme, ſomtimes they loue to be ſolitary
and ſeeke ſecrete places, to ſpeake and
reaſon with themſelues, and ſometimes
ye ſhall ſee them paſſe fiue or ſix times a
day through a ſtreat, for to ſpie whether
that they maye haue any looke of the eye
of hir whom they loue, and in the mean
time the poore Pages and Verlets haue
their legs bruſed with running, their
armes broken with rubbing, ſpunging,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:111"/>
bruſhing, trimming and making clean
the Gentleman. And if that he chaunce
to haue any ſparke of ieloſie, then they
begin to rage and the pacientes are in
extréeme perill, the force and violence of
the maladie ſtriueth againſt the nature,
it is a Catharre that burneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there
is no liue nor ſenſible part within them
but that is grieued, and then if they be
fearfull, they become franticke and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
there is neither Arte, inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, craft
or conſpiracie, but that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out: they
be come <hi>Lycantropes</hi> and goe all the
night like raging wolues. And although
the maladie of it ſelfe is fantaſticall y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
yet according to the humor that
ſhe méeteth, ſhe worketh maruellous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes,
for if the Louer be poore, there is
no office of humanitie, but that he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, euen to ſacrifice, and to put him
ſelfe in peril, if néede ſhall require. If he
be rich, his purſe (as the Gréekes terme
it) is tied with a Léeke blade, thoughe he
be couetous, he beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth then prodigal,
there is no bagge that he will ſpare to
<pb facs="tcp:2884:112"/>
emptye, ſo great is the power of this
poyſon, the which hath moued <hi>Plautus</hi>
to ſay, that Loue was the firſt inuenter
of beggerie. If the Louer be learned,
&amp; that his ſpirits be any thing weakned
you ſhall ſée him faigne a ſea of teares,
a Lake of miſeries, to double hys
plaintes, accuſe the heauen, make an
Anotomie of his hart, frieſe the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer,
burne the Winter, worſhippe, playe the
Idolater, wonder, to faigne Paradiſe, to

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they loue, then what is ther
here but a bewtye, hir browes, arches,
hir eyes After gemells, hir lookes, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
hir mouth, Coral, hir téeth, pearls
of Orient, hir breath, balme, amber, and
muſke, hir throte of ſnowe, hir necke of
milke, the mountanes or dugs that ſhe
hath on hir breſt, balles or apples of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liblaſter.
And generally al the reſt of the
bodie is no other but a prodigalitie and
treaſure of heauen and of nature, which
<pb facs="tcp:2884:112"/>
ſhe hath reſerued to pleaſe or agrée in al
perfection to the thing that they loue.
Here you maye ſée howe thys cruell
maladie of Loue tormenteth thoſe that
are attained of this mortall poyſon, and
notwithſtanding, there are ſo manye
people, Nations and Prouinces, ſo
charged with theſe furious aſſaultes,
that if there were an armie made of al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Louers that are in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world, there is no
Emperor nor Monarch, but woulde be
afraide to ſée ſuche a number of fooles in
a companie. And neuertheleſſe this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent
euill, by cuſtome it hath got ſo
much on humaine kinde, that there can
no remedie be founde althoughe that
many medicins,<note place="margin">They that haue vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of Loue could not helpe themſelues.</note> Gréekes and Arabians
haue employed all their wit and policie
for to remedy this paſſion. <hi>Samocraceus,
Nigideus,</hi> and <hi>Ouid</hi> haue written many
great volumes of the remedie of Loue,
by the whiche they ſhewe the remedies
for others, but they can find no remedy
for themſelues,<note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Loue.</note> for that all thrée died,
purſued &amp; deſtroyed, not for the harmes
<pb facs="tcp:2884:113"/>
that they did at Rome, but for the Loues
that they inuented. The Emperor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Aurelius</hi> knowing that <hi>Fauſtine</hi> his
wife loued a Ruffian,<note place="margin">The furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loue of Fauſtine, vvyfe to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Marcus Aurelius, the childe had the like qualities.</note> ſo that ſhe was
vnpacient, and was in perill of death
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furious deſier that ſhe had to haue
him in hir poſſeſſion, aſſembled a great
many people learned, and of al faculties
and ſciences, for to giùe him counſell to
quench the burning heat that conſumed
hir by little and little. But after manye
reſolutions, certayne of hys Nobles
counſelled him to kill him whome hys
wife loued, and that one ſhould giue hir
ſecretly of his bloud to drinke, the which
was promptlye executed. This remedie
was great, for hir affection was quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
And yet it was not of ſo great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
as <hi>Iulìus Capitolin</hi> writeth, but
that <hi>Comodus</hi> whome they engendred
afterwardes, was bloudie and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
and was more like in conditions to
the Ruffian,<note place="margin">Entropeus in the life of Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> than to the father, and alſo
was daily conuerſant with the Ruffia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and delighted more in their companie
<pb facs="tcp:2884:113"/>
than in the companie of others, ſo that
it ſéemed that the Mothers paſſion was
tranſported to the childe. But this is
little to that whych I haue read in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
Hiſtories, that things are come to
ſuch deſolation, that when this fooliſhe
frenſie doth take holde of vs, it rendreth
vs brutiſh and mad, as it hath bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
and euidently ſhewed and ſéene
in a yong Lad being of the higheſt kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

the Citizens of the Citie, the which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
many times beheld a faire ſtatute

whiche was in a publicke place of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The powre of Loue.</note>
he was ſo ſtricken with the loue of it,
that he would neuer léeſe the ſight
of it, and alwayes remayned by it, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
and kiſſing it, as if it had bene
a liuing ſoule. And when that he was
out of hir ſight, he wept and lamented
ſo pitifully, that it woulde haue moued
the moſt conſtanteſt to pitie, and in the
ende this paſſion got ſo much powre on
him, &amp; was brought to ſuch extremitie,
<pb facs="tcp:2884:114"/>
that he deſired the Senatours to ſell it
him at what price they woulde, to the
ende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he might haue it to beare about
with him, the which thing they woulde
not graunt, for that it was a publicke
work, and that their powre or auctority
extended not ſo far: wherefore the yong,
man cauſed to be made a rich crowne of
gold with other ſumpteous ornaments,
and went to the Image, ſet the crowne
on hir heade, and decked hir with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

And yet the maruellous worke of
all theſe partes is nothing to that which
followeth, if we will conſider in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
all the proportion of the face, of the

that among all the men the which are
almoſt infinit, all of them do ſo differ in
the face that among ſo many thouſande
millions of men there can not be founde
<pb facs="tcp:2884:125"/>
two like, but that they are blemiſhed by
ſome markes and notes: the ſecond that

great,<note place="margin">A praiſe of beautie as vvell of men as of vvomen.</note> that ſometimes we deſier to die of
our good wills, and gladly ſacrifice oure
ſelues for the beautie of ſome perſones,
and we are ſo ſtirred euen to become
out of our wits, by the prickings and
prouocations of this faire and beautiful
face. In witneſſe whereof I could bring
forth an infinite number of worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages,
as well auncient as moderne,
which ſéemed to haue ſpoyled the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his moſt richeſt treaſures, for
to paint out all the corners of the earth,
and to exalt the memorie of them and

of this beautie, as thoughe thereon
their whole glory and honor did depend.
For the beames that proceadeth of thys

to the moſt liuelieſt part of the ſoule,
and maketh there force to be felt exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely

in the face, the which although it be
not aboue the greatnes of halfe a foote,
notwithſtanding in the leaſt mutation
or chaunging thereof appeareth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of men, ioyfull and ſorowfull, of

did kéepe and preſerue him againſt
their powre. So that ſeeing that by thys
meanes he could not diſpatch his life, he
was conſtreyned at the laſt to kill him
ſelfe with a dagger. <hi>Galen</hi> the Prince of
Medicins writeth that a Maide (named

ſtraunge and harde to beleue, his bodie
caſt ſuche a ſauor being deade, that one

M. Paulus</hi> a Venetian reciteth that the

All the Gréeke and Latin wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

Phiſicke, finding ſo many helthful

ſo worthy and ſo excellent, ſo wonderful
and celeſtial. Let vs therfore leaue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to compare him to brute beaſtes.
<pb facs="tcp:2884:140"/>
The which although God hath prouided
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all that for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is néedefull for the
preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their life, giuing to ſome,

other inclinencies of the ayre, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

lightneſſe and ſwiftneſſe to run &amp; flie, to
others ſubtilty to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in dens
and caues of the earth, to others fethers
and wings that they maye hang in the
ayre, to the ende to euitate the furie and
rage of man, all the which things not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
are of little value to the
regard of man. For although he be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
naked, and couered with ſo tender a
ſkin, that quickely he is hurt and recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
harme, yet neuertheleſſe that was
not done without great prouidence.<note place="margin">An aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere to the obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</note> For
knowing that he had to exerciſe his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and other interior ſenſes much more
diligently than the brute beaſts to ſerue
afterward to the Intelecke, it was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neceſſarie that he ſingularly ſhould

haue his Organs and inſtruments,<note place="margin">Baptiſt Gelo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Pare.</note> by
the whiche he doeth ſuch operations of
matter more delicate and light, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

knowing that the ſpirit followeth in his
complections the temperature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
And if he had bene compoſed of rude
and thick ſkin, ſo ſhould he haue had the
vnderſtanding blunt and brutiſhe, but
man is created of a ſubtill and liuelye
fleſhe, bicauſe that the ſpirite which is
liuely and ſubtill, for the better &amp; more
perfecter opening &amp; knowing of things.
The workmaiſter therefore is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
which hath not attributed to man
certaine commodities as he hath done to
beaſtes, knowing that his ſapience and
wiſedome might render that which the
condition of nature had denied him. For
althoughe he commeth forth naked on
the earth, &amp; without armour or defence,
(the which chaunceth not to beaſtes that
haue hornes, clawes, haire and ſhelles)
it is for his greate profit and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
being armed with knowledge, and
<pb facs="tcp:2884:141"/>
endued with reaſon, not outwarde but
inwardly he hath put his munition and
defence, not in the bodie but in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
in ſuch ſort that there is neyther the
greatneſſe nor ſtrength of wilde beaſts,
neyther their defence in their hornes,

of the nature (of the which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
as of the condicion that is ſo tender
and fraile, that in many things beaſtes

ſo mad, or dare we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that God hath
ſhewed more fauor to other beaſts than
to man: no truly: for although he hath
created him vile and abiect, as of a lump
of earth, yet this in nothing doth dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb facs="tcp:2884:142"/>
his glory. For it is manifeſt that he
hath not created man corruptible for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
of a better, for by the creation of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Sunne, the Moone &amp; the ſtarres, he hath
ſhewed how he might haue created man
of a thing more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
him of the earth for to beate downe
his pride and arrogancy, the which hath
bene the cauſe of the ruine and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of al his poſteritie, and that he muſt
not only ſtudie on earthly things as the
brute beaſtes doe that looke for no other
ſelicitie but in this miſerable world, but
he muſt lift vp his eies to Heauen, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing

the miſeries with the which he is

created him not ſubiect to ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
for God exalted him to the moſte
higheſt degrée of all the dignities of the
earth, and if he haue ſo many miſeries
as we haue before ſhewed, they are
chaunced to him ſince that he knew not
<pb facs="tcp:2884:143"/>

though God hath made him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to many miſeries, it is not for anye
hatred that he bare vnto him, for he hath
not pardoned his only ſonne, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great
loue he bare vnto man, but it is for
his great profit that he hath created him
ſuch, willing thereby to admoniſh him
of his ſinne, and to plucke out from his

which the Deuill hath planted for to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and kéepe him vnder his feare. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is the cauſe that man is ſubiect
to ſo many miſeries, and is become mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall
and corruptible. And if man therfore
ſéeing himſelfe ſo wicked and miſerable,
be ſo proude and hie minded, what wold
he be if he were immortall and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.
And therefore God hath here
ſhewed his wiſedome and ſapience in
<pb facs="tcp:2884:143"/>
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he hath made him ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Notwithſtanding in this corruptible
and mortall veſſell of earth he hath kept
ſo goodly a harmonie and countenance,
that it is not poſſible to imagine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
one more fairer.<note place="margin">Concluſion</note> To the ende ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that in few wordes we will make a

wil conſider man in the firſt eſtate that
God created him, it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

he might be glorified as in the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt

But if we conſider him in the eſtate of
the generall corruption ſpred all ouer
the poſteritie of Adam, we ſhall ſée him
nooſeled in ſinne, monſtruous, fearfull,
deformed, ſubiect to a thouſande incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,

ſhort, in ſteade of being Lord of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is become ſlaue to ſinne in the

Gods word, ye ſhall ſée him reſtored not

poured out for to ſuccor him, making
him a new creature, as Sainct Ambroſe
