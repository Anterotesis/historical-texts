            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nvvise much vvere I beeing base and barren, if I thought to escape that which <hi>Homer</hi> that sweete and sugred Mecaenas of Greece might in no wise auoyde. Simple were I to seeke to auoyde that which the wisest and the learnedst <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Architas,</hi> coulde not shunne: therefore euen as the <hi>Rhodians</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the games of <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> were taunted of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the one for their brauerie, the other for their raggednesse: so these Cinikes sortes finde faulte with the good aswell as the badde. <hi>Lucullus</hi> a noble Romane demaunded of the Philosopher <hi>Seneca,</hi> what best he might doe to please <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, and not to offende the common people, had in aunswere, to doe much seruice vnto Princes, and to vse little taulke, and to shewe humanitie vnto the commons: Knowing well gentle Reader, how ready the most part are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the learned, and hovv fewe are willing to excuse the ignorant, I am contented rather to be reprehended for my good will in penning this pilgrimage of Princes, than to be commended by that vvhich may prooue my ydle lyfe by silence. Being mindefull of the youth of Egypt how they shoulde make account vnto their magistrates of paine and trauell, most willing to accomplish some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might discharge the same, I tooke this laboure in hande, in that, that I coulde to the vttermost to beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite my countrie, to pleasure my friendes, and to shewe my selfe more willing than able in performing the same: and though I in my rashenesse presume to write of the liues of Princes, yet I trust in gathering the fragments &amp; broken sentences, as a beginning vnto others that are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stored, it vvill be of the vvise and learned considered, though of others defamed and taunted.

booke sayth <hi>Plini</hi> so simple, but it profiteth some body, for in bookes sayde <hi>Chilo</hi> the Philosopher are the fame of vvorthie men eternized, and the veritie of thinges etere vnknovvne wvritten, vvhich tvvo thinges neyther time can consume, nor fortune destroy, and for this cause were the bones of <hi>Homer</hi> sought and contended for of seuen Cities in Greece to be buried and kept as a monument of so great a vvriter, and for this vvas <hi>Euripides</hi> dying in <hi>Macedonia</hi> sent for by embassadors of <hi>Athens,</hi> to bee hadde in memorie as a prayse vnto <hi>Athens</hi> by his buriall For the Greekes supposed the greatest honour of all to haue educated such men as vvere studious and carefull for their countrie. For greater is the attempt of any simple booke writer to hazarde himselfe to present perill to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with diuers men with a pen in his hande, then that that valiaunt <hi>Perithus</hi> with <hi>Cerberus,</hi> or <hi>Theseus</hi> vvith <hi>Minotaurus,</hi> yea, or <hi>Hercules</hi> with <hi>Antheús,</hi> iollie champions vvith swordes drawne: for that they fought vvith one a peece, and that before their faces, &amp; the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple writer with thousandes, and they behinde his backe slaunder him. <hi>Architas</hi> the Philosopher, whome the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> made a general in their warres sixe seueral times, he I saye vvas in no such daungers in his vvarres, as hee was resisted for his rules and lawes in <hi>Tarentum. Plato</hi> vvas not in such perill at the besieging of <hi>Tanagra,</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> amongst all his enimies, as he vvas enuied in Greece by <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> his ovvne schollers by his Philosophie.

Simple men must not therefore be discomfited to vvrite bicause the vvise and learned vvere herein euill spoken: For the <hi>Gimnosophistes</hi> in India, the <hi>Prophetes</hi> in Egypt, the Sages in <hi>Persea,</hi> the <hi>Ephori</hi> in <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and the <hi>Philosophers</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> are novv more famous and renovvmed being deade, then they being a liue vvere enuied and slaundered, their vvritinges and bookes more read novve, than alovved or knovvne then, they rtrauell novve is commended, though their liues then vvere despised.

These thrée last Garlandes mencioned for the skaling of walles, the boording of shippes, and attempting the tentes, were made all of Golde, and giuen by the Princes or Senators to the aforesayde souldiours. There was likewise in Rome concerning the triumphes, that none might triumph vnlesse he had bene before some officer in Rome, as <hi>Dictator, Pretor, Consuls,</hi> or suche like: and if any (without they were sent by the Senators) had wonne any victories, though there conquest were neuer so great, and their victorie

inuentions, as may well appeare vnto the most ignoraunt an errour. And alas howe simple are they in finding out the substaunce of the soule, what it shoulde bée, where it shoulde be, and by what it shoulde bée, some say that there is no soule, but a naturall moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi>

And thus of approued Philosophers, they shewe themselues simple innocentes: How igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt were they in defining the soule of man? so far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agréeing one with an other, that <hi>Zenocrates</hi> thinketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the soule to be but a number that mooues it selfe, which all the Egyptians sometime consented vnto. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> himselfe the Prince of all Philosophers,<note place="margin">

The diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of mourning was such, that amongst the Gréekes they shaued their heades and beardes, and threwe it to the graue with the deade. Amongst the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when the kinges of <hi>Sparta</hi> died, certaine horsemen were appoynted to trauayle ouer all the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, certefiyng the death of the king, and the women in euery cittie, doe beate their brasen pottes, and make great heauye noyse for the same. The Egyptians doe mourne after this sort, they rent their clothes, they shut their temples, they eate no meate, they sméere theyr faces with dirt, and thus abstaining from washing their faces thrée score and twelue dayes they lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle the death of their kinges and friendes.

cut their heares of, mangle their faces, beate their breastes.

Another play was vsed then in Gréece, either vpon the Dice, or els closelye in hande: called euen and odde. This playe came from Gréece vnto Rome, in the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> the seconde Emperour of Rome, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> doth write in the life of <hi>Augustus,</hi> where the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> wrote a letter vnto his daughter in Rome, after this sort: Daughter I sende thée two hundred &amp; fiftye pence, which I geue amongst thy ghestes to play after Supper the Gréeke play called euen and not euen, whether they will at Dice or cloase in hande.

The youngmen of Rome shoulde gather together, euery one bearing in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9247:121"/>

The women likewise thinkyng thereby to become more fruitfull and fertill, offered them selues wyllyngly to receaue stripes. These scurges and whippes that they had in their handes, made such ratling noyse by reason they were made of drie skinnes, that it made him that ran before to straine him selfe, hearing the noyse, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the stripes. The seconde game that the Romanes vsed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Circenses.</hi>
               </note> was called <hi>Circenses,</hi> as some say sprong vp first amongst the Romanes them selues, a place appointed by Rome, enuironed about with huge &amp; strong walles: Here all kindes of pastime and sportes were vsed, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Horses and fighting on Horsebacke in the one ende, in the middest the champions were placed in armes a foote to fight, in the other ende wrastlers, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, runners and such like games were appointed: so that the place was framed accordingly long and large, that they might haue roome enough in both endes, and in the middest. This was the chiefe and the auncientest play amongst the Romanes sauyng <hi>Saturnalia</hi>: this sport did <hi>Ianus</hi> which then did raigne, togither with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus</hi> as <hi>Macrobius</hi> saith, inuent and frame in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and monumentes of <hi>Saturnus</hi> his fellowe.<note place="margin">

Some say this play sprong first among the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> some againe affirme that it began amongst the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but how and where it began first in other countreys it is no matter, but in Rome it was first framed and inuented by <hi>Ianus.</hi> The fourth play amongst the Romanes was then called <hi>Gladiatoria,</hi>

Thus by this play were the Romanes taught boldly to fight with their enemies, and hardned at home, litle to estéeme woundes and strokes abrode. Thus games and playes were chéefely estéemed of the Romanes, though diuers others as <hi>Cicero</hi> in his office affirmeth, the Romones had in <hi>Martius</hi> féelde harde by Rome, to exercize the youngmen to practize feates, to become redy and prompt in marshall offayres, which they onely most estéemed.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F men bée diuers in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one towardes another, as wée dayly sée and trye by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: howe much ought the siely and simple beast which wanteth vse of speach to bée commended, that so careth and prouideth for him &amp; his. And though as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith that it is common vnto all liuing creatures to multiplie and to be carefull ouer those that nature procreated, &amp; to differ in no part from a beast therin: yet by reason we are to excell all kinde of beastes, all things in subiection vnto man, aswell the heauens aboue, and all that shineth therin, as earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath and all that liue thereon. And hence I maruayle much though thd secrete working of nature, in fearce and raging beastes bée tollerable, yet in a reasonable man, in whom saith the Philosopher nature onely moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto the beast suche enimitie, variaunce and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorde shoulde procéede. It is thought that the Eagle and the Swanne be not fréendes, the Dolphin and the Whale can not agrée, the Woolfe and the Foxe at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaunce: so of the Dogge and the Cat, of the Crowe and the Kite may be spoken, but it is well knowen that man is most odious vnto man, and though it be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Homo homini Deus,</hi> yet is it prooued <hi>Homo homini Daemon.</hi>

               </note> If nature made the mighty Lion the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt beast in the worlde to feare the little crowyng Cock? If nature do cause the huge and monstrous Elephant, to tremble at the sight of a sielie simple Shéepe? And if nature mooue the Panther, a strong

If nature worke so subtilly, that the strongest, mightiest, and valiauntest beast, shoulde feare the most innocent and most simple beast? howe much more might reason rule in vs to feare our God and his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie workes? which wée altogether either forget his glory, or despise his power. Though in beasts the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens haue dominion: yet saide Dauid, man by reason and feare of God ruleth the heauens. But I wyll omit to speake further of that, and wyl returne to that which I meane a litle to discusse. I wil not speake of the loue and affection of men generall, but of the loue mutuall betwixt man and wife, betwixt brother and brother. And as it is a vertue not to be forgotten, so is it a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue most rare to finde: for euerye thing in his owne kinde is most to bée accepted.

            <p>Thrée things can neuer want due commendations: Good wine when it is dronke, a wise sentence when it is spoken, and a good man in aduersities.</p>
            <p>Two things can suffer no equality: Loue, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie.</p>

            <p>There be sixe thinges that wyll neuer hide them selues: A scab in the hande, a cough in a feast, an awle in a bagge, a strumpet in a window, pouerty in pride, and wantounesse in lust.</p>
            <p>There is no societie betwéene fiue thinges: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Woolfe and the Lambe, betwéene light and darknesse, betwéene life and death, betwéene godlinesse and wickednesse, betwéene a fréende and a flatterer.</p>

There is a historie worthy to be noted of Princes in <hi>Iustine</hi> that will not punishe these offences. <hi>Pausanias</hi> a noble gentleman of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> beyng a verie faire yong man, whiche <hi>Attalus</hi> for lust muche abused, and not contented wickedly and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to handle the yong man, so brought hym vnto a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet where in his winkyng <hi>Attalus</hi> would haue vsed hym as before, makyng all men priuie how <hi>Pausanias</hi> was kynge <hi>Attalus</hi> paramour as a woman, thus the young manne beyng ashamed, often complained vnto <hi>Philip</hi> kyng of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whiche <hi>Philip</hi> had maried then of late the suster of <hi>Attalus,</hi>

and diuers complaintes made vnto kyng Philippe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng no redresse thereof, but rather was flouted and scoft at Philippes hand, <hi>Pausanias</hi> tooke it so greuously, that <hi>Attalus</hi> was so estemed with the kyng, beyng the cause of his complaintes, and he so neglected that was so mynded, he after this sorte requited his shame and iniuries. At the mariage of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> kyng Philippes doughter, and <hi>Alexander</hi> Kyng of Epire, in greate tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes and pompes, Kyng Philippe in the middeste of ioyes, walkyng betwene his owne sonne <hi>Alexander</hi> the Greate, who then was but younge, and <hi>Alexander</hi> kyng of Epire his soonne in lawe, beyng married then vnto his daughter <hi>Cleopatra, Pausanias</hi> thruste hym vnto the harte, saiyng: minister Iustice, and punishe luste. Thus died that mightie Prince, as well for the bearyng of <hi>Attalus</hi> faulte, as also for his owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vsyng the same somtyme with a brother in lawe of his, naturall brother vnto his firste wife <hi>Olimpias.</hi> Luste and intemperancie, are neuer escaped without iuste punishemente, and due vengeaunce.<note place="margin">

Therfore the first disturber of common wealth, and last destroyer of good states: the beginning of all sorowes, the ende of all ioyes: the cause of all euyll, and the onely let of all goodnesse is enuie.

The feare of death causeth the soonne, to forsake the father, the mother to renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the one brother to deny an other, and one frende to forsake the other. In so muche Christ himself was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of his Disciples for feare of death. Peter denied him, and all the reste fledde from hym, and all for feare of death. Behold therefore how fearfull some are, how ioyfull others are. How lothsome some, &amp; how willyng others haue been to die. Some desperately die beyng wearie of life. As <hi>Sabinus Iuba, Cleomenes,</hi> some han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self, some burnyng them selues, &amp; some drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, &amp; thus with one desperat ende or other thei died. But fith euery man muste die, it were reason that euerie man should prepare to die, for to die wel is nothing els but to liue again.

The second que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stion was, whether the lande engendered more, or the Sea, to this answered the second philosopher and said,
<pb facs="tcp:9247:221"/>
the Land did engender more, for that the Sea was but a portion of the Lande. The thirde question was, to knowe what beast was most subtill, that beast answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thirde Philosopher, that man can not discerne. Fourthly it was demaunded why they beeyng Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, were so induced to perswade the <hi>Sabians</hi> to rebellion, bicause saide the Philosopher, it is better to die manfully, then to liue miserablie. The fifte questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, whether the daie was made before the night, or the night before the day, to the which it was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the daie. The sixte was to vnderstande, howe <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the greate hym selfe might get good will of the people, in shewyng saied the sixte Philosopher thy self not terrible vnto the people. The seuenth to aske was whether life or death wer stronger, and it was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life. The eight was to knowe howe longe a manne should liue, vntill saied the eight Philosopher a manne thinketh death better then life. The last question was proposed of <hi>Alexander</hi> to knowe how might a mortall man be accompted in the nomber of the Gods. In doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng greater thynges saide all the Philosophers, then man is able to dooe. For that they knewe this proude Prince would be a GOD, and that he would learne of the sage Philosophers how he might voide mortalitie, he was answered sharpely, for that hee should knowe hym to be a man, and beyng a manne, he should make himself readie to die, for death is the rewarde of sinne, and death is the beginnyng of life againe vnto the good, as <hi>Aulus Posthumius,</hi>

For so <hi>Hector</hi> speaking in <hi>Homer,</hi> said vnto his wife <hi>Andromacha,</hi> that she should not be sory for his death, sith all men must die.

               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:9247:221"/>
that they shall neuer die, but passyng from one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnto another, yet some die ioyfully, as the brethren of <hi>Policrita,</hi> beyng taken captiue by <hi>Diognitus</hi>

            <l>To extoll the reedes and rushes long, with solemne muse aduice.</l>
            <l>Though skilfull thei with learned muse, in thinges so small to flowe,</l>
            <l>Yet willing I my faithfull hart to natiue zoill to showe:</l>
            <l>For who in Athens idle were, by Dracos lawe should die,</l>
            <l>As in Hetruria idle heads, by lawe were forcde to flie.</l>
            <l>VVhose ground in Rome was baren found, was put in prison faste,</l>
            <l>And kyng of Aegypt toke accompt, of daily labour past:</l>
            <l>The Spartan youth that waxed grosse by lawe should fast it out,</l>
            <l>And loitring Indians went vndinde, from place to place about.</l>
            <l>Ech labour well deserueth hire, that Idlenes doth flee,</l>
            <l>Ech vertue must haue due reward, ech vice must punished be:</l>
            <l>For rather had I venture fame, Chirilus stripes to haue,</l>
            <l>Then still with Vatia idle be, ech filthy lust to laue.</l>
            <l>Saill then by raging Scillas rockes, passe by Ciclops denne,</l>
            <l>On through Lotophagos tent full bould, feare not Auernus fene,</l>
            <l>Trudge fast from flattryng Cirens face, make haste from Cirses sight,</l>
            <l>Pearce Limbo through, possesse the place where iustice iudgeth right.</l>
            <l>Mauger of Maegera head, in spit of furies go,</l>

            <l>The Scithian rude had rather here, a horse to ney or kike,</l>
            <l>Then solem sound of Orpheus Harpe, with skilfull stroke to strike</l>
            <l>The Arcadian blind with Midas will, preferre the pipe of Pan,</l>
            <l>Before Appollo sacred God, who iudge of musike can.</l>
            <l>Hadst thou Briareus hundred hands, or hundred Argos eies,</l>
            <l>Suppose thy sences slack to serue, ech reader to suffice:</l>
            <l>And as Vlixes mates were changde, to shiftyng shapes of hoggs,</l>
            <l>So like Actaeon thou shalt be, deuoured of some doggs.</l>
            <l>Some will finde in vearse thy fault, some will defame thy sence,</l>
            <l>Some thy stile and some thy state, will finde in thee offence:</l>
            <l>The learned loth I am to lose, of right their frendship craue,</l>
            <l>Sith thou and thei wer taught in place, true frendship seke to haue.</l>

            <l>But mount to skey in flight to slee, some foules his frend to please.</l>

            <l>Do brag and bost themselues so braue, and other birds do mocke:</l>
