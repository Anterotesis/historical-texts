            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

B.</hi> do truly and sincerely acknowledge,<note place="margin">3 Iac. c. 4.</note> profess, testifie, and declare in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God and the world, That our Sovereign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second is lawfull and rightfull King of this Realm, and of all other His Majestie's Dominions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and that the Pope neither of himself nor by any authority of the Church or See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or by any other means with any other, hath any power or authority to depose the King, or to dispose of any of His Majestie's Kingdoms or Dominions, or to authorize any foreign Prince to invade or annoy Him, or His Countries, or to discharge any of His Subjects of their allegiance and obedience to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, or to give licence or leave to any of them to bear Arms, raise Tumult, or to offer any violence or hurt to His Majestie's Royal Person, State, or Government, or to any of His Majestie's Subjects, within His Majestie's Dominions. Also I do swear from my heart, That notwithstanding any Declaration or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, or Deprivation, made or granted, or to be made or granted, by the Pope or his Successors, or by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity derived, or pretended to be derived, from him, or his See, against the said King, His Heirs or Successors; or any Absolution of the said Subjects from their obedience. I will bear saith and true allegiance to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, and Him and Them will defend to the uttermost of my power,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33319:121"/>
against all Conspiracies and Contempts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, which shall be made against His or their Persons, their Crown and Dignity, by reason or colour of any such Sentence or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, or otherwise; and will do my best endeavour to disclose and make known unto His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Traiterous Conspiracies, which I shall know or hear of to be against Him, or any of them.</p>
               <p>And I do further swear, That I do from my heart abhor, detest, and abjure, as impious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, That Princes which be Excommunicated or Deprived by the Pope, may be deposed or murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever.<note place="margin">Upon this Oath the party ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it shall subscribe his name or mark.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And I do believe, and in Conscience am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, That neither the Pope, nor any person whatsoever, hath power to absolve me of this Oath, or any part thereof, which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by good and full authority to be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ministred unto me, and do renounce all Pardons and Dispensations to the contrary. And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear according to these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words by me spoken, and according to the plain and common sense and understanding of the same words, without any Equivocation or mental Evasion, or secret Reservation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
