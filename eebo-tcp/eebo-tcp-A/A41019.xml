            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> but because their societie herein resembles that Sow in <hi>Martiall</hi> which farrowed in the Theater by a wound there received: so this Order by the wound received from the State (I mean the penalties inflicted upon Romish Catholiques for Recusancie) hath growne fruitfull and exceedingly multiplyed. But in the meane while, are not Iesuits <hi>consciences seared with a hot iron,</hi> who every where in their Printed Pamphlets, and Libels most bitterly exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the State for inflicting penalties upon Papists in <hi>England</hi> for Recusancie, whereof they themselves have not only been the Authors but chiefe Actors therein to enforce it by the rescript of his Holines procured by them meerely for their advantage, as this Author sheweth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to detect likewise the craft of the Secular Priests, <hi>verè seculares</hi> true <hi>worldlings,</hi> who for their owne advantage counterplot against the Iesuits and endeavour by subtill fetches and straines of conscience, to evacuate and frustrate their opposites designes: <hi>Sic ars eluditur arte.</hi> The Iesuits out of pretended zeale to the Romane faith, and religion, mainely contend for Recusancie, fearefully adiuring all English Papists with whom they have any power, that by no means either themselves resort to our publique service, or send their children to any Protestant Churches or Schooles: on the contrary the secular Priests out of pretended care and love to those of their religion, perswade them to make no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of repairing to our Churches or Schooles: that so they may save both the mulct of the law, and great charges by sending their children beyond the Seas there to be brought up in the Colledges and Schooles of the Iesuits. As for instructing them in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Catholique religion, that they will take care of, if the parents be pleased to commend them to their tuition. Thus both make religion <hi>a stalking horse</hi> to their worldly ends: the Iesuit is for Recusancie, the secular Priest for Conformitie; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them truly to gaine soules to Christ, but to draw toll to their own mill. If there be no necessitie of Recusancie, the Iesuits may <hi>shut up their shops</hi> beyond the Seas, and if their be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of Recusancie, the Secular Priests may <hi>shut up their shops</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And what care the Iesuits though many Families
<pb facs="tcp:61533:4"/>
of Romish Catholiques in <hi>England</hi> sensibly decay in their estates, partly by reason of the penaltie of the law inflicted upon them for Recusancie, and partly in respect of the great expence they are at in the education of their children and transportation beyond the Sea, so long as the Iesuits Colledges by this means thrive and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? and what care the Secular Priests though their proselytes run a hazard of their soules, by frequenting the Churches and Schooles of those they account quite out of the way of salvation, so long as they themselves are well paid for the education of their children, and a good amends is made by the Masters temporall gaine for the danger of the Schollers spirituall losse. When I read this Authors Preface and Discourse evidently discovering the Iesuits <hi>myning</hi> and the Secular Priests <hi>counter-myning:</hi> me thinks I see <hi>Pseudolus</hi> and <hi>Simias</hi> in the Poet, out-vying one the other in craftie fetches, deceitfull subtilties practised by them with dissembling, lyes and periuries.</p>
            <p>Thirdly to lay open to the view of the world the detestable and damnable doctrine of Romish Priests, and Iesuits who straine and weaken the strongest <hi>sinew</hi> which holdeth the <hi>members of</hi> all Ecclesiasticall and Politicke <hi>Bodies</hi> together: who <hi>cancell that bond</hi> which being made on earth is <hi>Registred</hi> in the high <hi>Court of Heaven,</hi> and the three Persons in the blessed Trinitie are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as <hi>witnesses</hi> thereunto. The Iesuits teach, that a man may without scruple of conscience or guilt of sinne affirme that upon oath in words, which he knoweth to be false, and deny upon oath that which he knoweth to be true, so he be sure to have some clause in his minde, which added thereunto in his inward intention, though not uttered, may make what he saith true in a sense: And this Priest here in his last Chapter teacheth it to be lawfull to forge, and fasten a meaning to the words of an Oath cleane contrary to the meaning of the Law-givers, who first made the Oath, and the Magistrate who lawfully requireth that Oath of them, as I will make it evidently appeare, when I come to scan his last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now what is this else then to use the name of the God of tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h in taking publique and solemne Oathes to confirme a lye, either in words or meaning? what is it else then to mocke with Religion, and play <hi>fast and loose</hi> with the most sacred <hi>bonds</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:61533:5"/>
Pietie and Loyaltie. Verily if Religion be derived <hi>à religando</hi> from binding the conscience, or our faith to God or man; he should not slander these men, who sayes, they have no Religion. For the surest and strongest bonds of Religion can no more tye them then the greene withes could <hi>Sampson</hi> which he brake at pleasure. Let there be an Oath advisedly penned, in tearmes most expresse and significant, with all the cautions that the wit of man can devise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all manner of evasions, and backed with never so many dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imprecations and anathema maranathaes upon the soule of him that shall by any slight, cunning, falshood or periurie either violate or invalidate and evacuate this Oath: yet these men can with a wet finger either loosen it by a forged and forced interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or untie the knot by a mentall reservation, or cut it asunder by Papall dispensation, <hi>ô ubi estis fontes lachrymarum?</hi> Suppose a Romish Priest or Iesuit be brought before a Magistrate to be examined: if the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacie be tendered unto him, thereby to discover who he is, he will take them both in his own sense though neither in the sense of him who ministreth these Oathes, nor in the sense of the Parliament which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. If hee farther demand of him upon Oath, whether he be a Priest or no, he will say he is not: reserving in his minde, (of Apollo) if he question him further, whether he lately came from beyond the Seas: he will forsweare it, reserving in his minde (the red or dead Sea) if he farther require of him whether he have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived holy Orders from a Romish Bishop: he will denie it reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his minde (without a Miter) if the Examiner aske him further whether he had any speech with any English Nun at Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, if the Iudge or Iustice charge him to use no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation or mentall reservation, he will say and sweare he useth none, reserving in his minde (to tell you) and <hi>so he slips all knots</hi> and it may be truly said of him what <hi>Pseudolus</hi> in the Poet spake of <hi>Ballio non potest pietate obsisti huic ut res sunt caeterae,</hi>

If there be no idolatrie committed in Protestant Churches then God is there purely worshipped in spirit and truth. If there bee no hurt done in Protestant Churches no danger of sinne, nor so much as any appearance of evill, then are all Papists iustly to be punished who refuse to come to our Church, and they are guilty of grievous sinne in disobeying the commands of King and State, and have no pretence at all for their recusancie.

A man is not bound alwayes to speake a truth, but he is bound never to lie, feigne, or play the hypocrite.</note>

Hence it is, that although a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike be bound under paine of damnation to professe his religion in the twice before assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61533:14"/>
yet he is not bound to professe a Recusancy of a thing of its own nature indifferent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at all times, and in all places to discover his Religion: for this were as much in effect, as to cry himselfe, over the whole kingdome, or to write over his doore, that he were A Catholike, or at least some Sectary. For (as I shall hereafter say:) Recusancy is common both to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, Brownists and other Sectaries, different in opinion from Protestants) which would be an occasion to call himselfe in question for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he professeth; whence I may rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the Recusancy of Catholikes no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then to be, an indiscreet discovery of a mans Religion without necessitie or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereby he makes himselfe lyable to the penall laws of <hi>England</hi> for not going to Church, Which was brought first amongst them into <hi>England,</hi> by a certaine company of men, <hi>for</hi>

            <p>In the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, and the alteration of Religion in England, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes went to Church to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61533:14"/>
to the State, as they did in K. <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths time; yet privately kept to themselves <hi>the exercise</hi> of their owne Religion. Which some Priests, perceiving not convenient, for the propagation of their owne family, then newly hatched: wrought in the Councel of Trent, that twelve Fathers of the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel (not all Bishops, yet favourers of the said family) might be selected, to declare to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Catholikes upon these suggestions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Protestants of England were <hi>idolatrous</hi> and <hi>blasphemous hereticks, hating God and his Church:</hi> that their commerce, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Church, would be an occasion of the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> of their soules; denying and betraying of the true faith; giving of scandall to men of tender conscience, as breaking that signe which was distinctive betweene the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God and not his people; that it was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlawfull for them to goe any longer to the Protestant Church, as appeareth by the words of the said declaration, which if I had by me, I would willingly have here inserted. This declaration being thus obtained, they possessed <note n="k" place="margin">If seven Popes one after another swallowed the same State gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and after the swallowing of them <hi>sub annulo piscatoris,</hi> sent rescripts into England forbidding all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes under paine of mortall sinne, to repaire to Protestant Churches, which this Authour acknowledgeth to be an errour in those Popes, what becomes of the infallible assistance of the holy Spirit annexed to <hi>Peters</hi> chaire? if so many Popes might be deceived by false suggestions, why not by false arguments, and objections? if they may be deceived in matter of fact, why not in matter of faith, which often dependeth upon matter of fact? and there being more need of inerrabilitie in a visible head for matter of fact, then matter of faith, the later so far as it is necessary to salvation being plainely set downe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If they may be deceived as men, why not as Popes? surely if the Pope doe any thing as Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is sending forth his Buls and Rescripts, whereby he governeth and instructeth the Pseudo-Catholike Church, and decides cases of conscience; and if in such he be subject to errour and mistaking, even in a matter of as great weight as any was agitated in the Councell of Trent, as this Priest affirmeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. upon what a sandie foundation is the Romish Babell built? and how loose and weake is the maine ground of a Papists faith?</note> certain Popes (to wit: <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, <hi>Pius</hi> the the fifth, the two last <hi>Gregories, Sixtus, Clement,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth) so strongly with the same, and the aforesaid suggestions; that the said <hi>Popes</hi> likewise declared as it is said <hi>by</hi> certaine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61533:15"/>
               <hi>rescripts</hi> which I never yet could see their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church to be likewise unlawfull. Which said suggestions had they beene, or were they true, I should likewise say and grant it unlawfull; but not being true, as I shall hereafter shew: the <note n="l" place="margin">It cannot be the common opinion of Divines that it is lawfull for a man to goe to Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with those who are of a different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

               <hi>common opinion</hi> of Divines in this point is to be followed; to wit: that it is a thing indifferent and therefore may be lawfull to frequent the Churches of Schismaticks.</p>
            <p>Now to prove what I have said; that it was first brought in, by a certaine company of men. It is evident in it selfe by the carriage of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse; for it is altogether improbable, that one mans authoritie (to wit, Doctor <hi>Sanders</hi> who is named to be the onely Agent herein, a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61533:15"/>
man alwaies ill relished in our state, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this point to be esteemed partiall) could select so many Fathers out of the said Councel, in a matter of such importance, upon his owne bare suggestion; or that the said Fathers would, or ought to have declared the same; unlesse they had been made beleeve, that the aforesaid suggestions were true, in the common opinion of most of the Priests then in our kingdome.</p>
            <p>That it was wrought for temporall ends by the said company, the event shewes the same: for there is none that have got, or do get there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but onely the said company; as appeares by their <hi>abundant treasure,</hi> and rich Colledges: for Recusancie begets persecution, and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almes deeds, that God may assist the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in their distresses. And by this Recusancie great mens children can get no learning or sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within this kingdome; but must be sent beyond the Seas, each at twentie five, or thirtie pound <hi>per annum.</hi> by which, their said family was and is propagated, and their heape increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>Further, the politicall invention of recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was so sweet and pleasing, by reason of the great gaine which it brought; that one of the said company (Authour of the answer to the libell of Justice) all besmeared with wonted pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so much delighteth in tribulation, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth by this recusancie; that he would not a <hi>toleration</hi> of Catholike religion in England, if he might. Although in his answer to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the said libell he saith (as knowing him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61533:16"/>
not able to procure of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the State, a toleration for Catholikes) that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine conditions of his, he would accept of the same: but when he speakes from his heart of the thing it selfe, he saith in his said Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 216. That it is such, as to aske it of God, were to aske, we know <hi>not</hi> what; for that persecution is better.</p>
            <p>That the said declaration and Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts were got by the aforesaid suggestions, appears by the writings themselves as they are cited, and further by one <hi>R. P.</hi> of the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who wrote a booke printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1607. <hi>Contra Anonymum,</hi> against a man without name: (Doctor <hi>Wright</hi>) that it was not lawfull to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Churches of heretikes: where promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously he relates all the aforesaid suggestions, as the ground of his opinion; and bringeth Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> with eight o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, most of them of the same Schoole for the approbation of his case. Which case as he puts it, I thinke any man living would likewise have approved.</p>
            <p>That these men above others, were so labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and serious, for this recusancie appeares, in that, whosoever would oppose them, were presently blasted for heretikes, or at least fallen men, insomuch that <hi>Azorius</hi> who wrote that it was lawfull for a Catholike to goe to the <hi>Church of Schismaticks</hi> was so troubled by the importunitie of these suggestions, that he was constrained through feare that that part of his family, should have suffered some great tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61533:16"/>
detriment by his judicious writing (as they say) to recant his opinion, and hold it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our case of England. See the said booke <hi>pag.</hi> 106. by all which any man may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the aforesaid company were the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie-bodies: and that for their owne ends (as I have said) upon the aforesaid grounds: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise why should they, more then others, have beene so importune as to perswade, yea compel <hi>Azorius,</hi> who (not perceiving (under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of piety their rare politicall drift) wrote a common opinion to the whole world, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that common opinion to have place in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</p>
            <p>That the foresaid Suggestions were and are false, it is certaine by experience to any, that know the state of the Protestant Church of England: and that to the ruine of soules as shall be proved in the question following.</p>
            <p>That it was procured covertly, and by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect meanes; appeares in that onely twelve Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were chosen, and the whole Corps of the Councell left out, and amongst the rest, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Worcester there then present; who knowing better the State and affaires of our Countrey, then all the rest, it seemes to me that he might have beene one of the twelve, whose authoritie would have given more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to this point, to our countrey: then all the other selected. But it should seeme, that it was declared without any debate, as a matter of no great importance, although it seemeth to my weakenesse a matter of as great weight, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61533:17"/>
any that was then <hi>agitated in</hi> the said Councel: and therefore to leave a whole Councel, in so weighty a matter, that concerned the affaires of a whole Kingdome in point of Religion, and where we might have <hi>had an infallibilitie</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <p>No infallibilitie in any generall Councel since the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, much lesse in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was neither a generall Councel, nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, nor free, nor at all an assembly of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops, but of Images, moved like the statues of <hi>Dedalus</hi> by the sinewes of others. See the historie of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> written in Italian by <hi>Petro Soave Polano,</hi> and the Epistle <hi>Dudith quinque Eccles. ad Maximilianum,</hi> 2. <hi>Caes.</hi> But were the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> a generall Councel lawfully called, consisting of eminent Doctors and Pastours as it were starres of the first magnitude, yet they could not without horrible presumption arrogate to that their Synod infallibilitie: for that not onely Provinciall but even oecumenicall Councels may erre, and be fouly mistaken, and that in matter of faith may thus be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>First, every assemby which consisteth of members subject to errour may be seduced, and deceived, but generall Councels are assemblies consisting of members subject to errour; for all men are so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Therefore generall Councels may be seduced and deceived. This reason is strongly backed by the authoritie of the most judicious of all the Fathers, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and that in many places, namely, <hi>Ep.</hi> 112. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Si Divinarum scripturarum, earum scilicet quae canonicae in Ecclesia nominantur, perspicua firmatur autoritate, sine ulla Dub. tation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pelag. c.</hi> 61. <hi>solis canonicis debeo sine ulla recusatione consensum.</hi> In the writing of any such men I hold my selfe at libertie (namely to give my assent unto them or not) for I owe consent without any stay or staggering to the Canonicall Scriptures alone: therefore not to the Popes Rescripts, or Decrees of generall Councels. And in his second booke, <hi>De bapt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cont. Donat. c.</hi> 3. <hi>Quis nesciat scripturam canonicam omnibus posterioribus Episcoporum literis ita praeponi; ut de illa om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino dubitari et disceptari non possit utrum vel verum rectum sit quicquid in eâ scriptum esse constiterit. Episcoporum autem literas quae post confirmatum canonem vel scriptae sunt, vel scribuntur, et per sermonem fortè sapientiorem cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuslibet in ea re peritioris et per aliorum Episcoporum graviorem authoritatem, doctioremque prudentiam et per concilia licere reprehendi, si quid in eis fortè a veritate deviatum est. Et ipsa concilia quae per singulas regiones vel provincias fiunt, plenariorum conciliorum authoritati, quae fiunt ex universo orbe christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, sine ullis ambagibus cedere: ipsaque plenaria saepe priora posterioribus emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari, cum aliquo experimento rerum aperitur quod clausum erat, et cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quod latebat.</hi> Who knowes not that the canonicall Scriptures are so farre to be preferred above the latterr letters of Bishops, that whatsoever is found written in it may neither be doubted nor disputed of whether it be true or right: but the letters of Bishops may not only be disputed of, but censured by Bishops that are more wise and learned then they, if any thing in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings swerve from the truth: or by Provinciall Synods, and these also must give place to plenarie and generall Councels, and even plenarie and generall Councels may be amended, the former by the latter, and it is to be noted that he speaketh of errour in matter of faith. For these words are part of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to an Objection of the <hi>Donatists</hi> out of the letters of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> concerning the point of rebaptizing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the determinations of generall Councels were infallible, all Christians were necessarily bound to stand unto them, and to submit to their authoritie: but this Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> peremptorily denies, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Cont. Maxim. c.</hi> 14. <hi>Nec ego Nicenum nec tu debes Ariminense, tanquam preiudicaturus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre concilium; nec ego huius authoritate nec tu illius detineris.</hi> Neither ought I to alleadge the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> nor thou the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> in prejudice to either part. For neither am I bound to the authoritie of the one, nor thou to the authoritie of the other; and it is worth the observation that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh of the first most famous Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> whose authoritie was greater and held more sacred and venerable then any Councel since, and if that Councel concluded not Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> shall the authoritie of a late Conveticle at <hi>Trent</hi> conclude all Christians?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If generall Councels may contradict one the other, they may certainly erre. For it is impossible that both parts of a contradiction should be true. But generall Councels contradict one the other. <hi>Ergo.</hi> For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel held at <hi>Ariminum</hi> contradicteth the first generall Councel held at <hi>Nice</hi> in the point of consubstantialitie of the Sonne with the Father. The generall Councel held at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> contradicteth the generall Councel held at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> in the point of <hi>Eutychianisme.</hi> The generall Councel at <hi>Frankeford,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth your second generall Councel held at <hi>Nice</hi> in the point of Image worship. Your generall Councel held at <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth your Councel of <hi>Constance</hi> in the point of the Councels superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie above the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Cuivis contingere potest quod cuiquam potest,</hi> that which hath befallen some generall Councels, may befall any other, unlesse they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge some speciall priviledge to the contrary; but divers generall Councels have erred. A generall Councel of Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.12. erred, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Lord shall deliver Ramoth Gilead into the Kings hand</hi>; a generall Councel of Priests, <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.65. erred damnably in condemning Christ for a blasphemer guiltie of death. The generall Councel held at <hi>Arminum</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, denying the Sonnes equalitie with the Father, at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> confounding the two natures in Christ: at <hi>Nice</hi> under <hi>Irene,</hi> decreeing that Angels are to be painted, because they are of a corporeall nature: at <hi>Constance,</hi> denying the Laitie to be bound to receive the communion in both kindes against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse precept of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. And of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. At <hi>Florence,</hi> and after at <hi>Trent,</hi> defining that the effect of the Sacrament depends upon the intention of the Priest or Bishop, who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth it. Which if it were true, no man in the Roman Church could ever be assured either of his baptisme, or of his confirmation, or of his absolution, or of his ordination, or of the validitie of his matrimonie, or of his safe adoration of the Host, or of the vertue of his extreme unction. For how can he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the intention of the Bishop or Priest who administred unto him these rites, all which they account sacraments? Neither can they evade by saying that these Councels might erre because they were not confirmed by the Pope; for the Popes were present at all these later, either in person or by their Legates, and it is for certain that their second Councel at <hi>Nice,</hi> was confirmed by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>; at <hi>Constance</hi> by Pope <hi>Martine,</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> by Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> at <hi>Trent</hi> by divers Popes. Lastly, if Councels had an immunitie from error, the prayer which they made at their Councels registred by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>Epist.</hi> were a meere mockerie. The prayer was conceived in this forme: <hi>Quia conscientià remordente tabescimus ne aut ignorattia nos traxerit in errorem aut praeceps forsitan voluntas impulerit a iustitia declinare, ob hoc te poscimus, te rogamus ut si quid offensionis in hac concilii celebritate attraximus, condonare et remissibile facere digneris.</hi> Because we pine away through remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, fearing lest either ignorance have drawn us into error, or a headie will driven us to swerve from justice, for this we pray thee, we beseech thee that if we have done any thing amisse in this great and famous assembly, thou wouldest vouchsafe to pardon it. I conclude therefore with the words of <hi>Leo</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Anatolius,</hi> who lightly phillips off the authoritie of the generall Councel held at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in which there were above 600. Fathers. In one word, <hi>Tanquam refutari nequeat, quod illicitè voluerit multitudo.</hi> as if that could not be refuted which a multitude hath unlawfully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; giving withall most wholesome conusell to all Councels, <hi>nulla sibi de multiplicitate congregationis concilia blandiantur.</hi> Let no Councels flatter themselves with the great multitude of persons assembled in them, as if that might priviledge them from errour.</p>
               </note>; and to adhere to twelve men fallible by suggestion without any debate or dispute; in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be without great suspition of sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster proceedings. Partly therefore supposing and partly intending further to prove the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said suggestions to be false, and consequently the said Councel, and Popes to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A SAFEGARD FROM Shipwracke to a Prudent Catholique.</head>
            <head type="sub">Question. Whether it be lawfull <note n="n" place="margin">Here least the Reader should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be aware; be bitten by a snake lying under the grasse, I hold it necessary to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish between two questions, which may seem to be a like, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. The first, whether Papists may goe to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches. The second, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Protestant may goe to a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church. He that shall give the same solution to both these questions, shall give a greater wound to the Protestant cause, in the latter, then his plaister will salve in the former. The Protestants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in this stand not upon even tearmes: for there is nothing in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Liturgie or Service, which the Romanists doe, or by their own Rules can except at; The Confession, forme of Absolution, Prayers, Hymnes, Collects, Lessons, Epistles and Gospels, are either such as the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves use, or at least such as they dislike not; whereas it is farre otherwise in the Romane Missall. For there is sprinkling, exorcised water, censing books, and pictures, worshipping images, invocation of Saints, prayers for the dead, intercession by the prayers and merits of souls departed, and which is the height of all idolatry adoration of their Host or breaden God, and all this service performed in an unknowne tongue contrary to the expresse order of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. all which the Reformed Churches condemne and abhorre, and whereas this Author alleadgeth, there can be no text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brought, forbidding Papists to come to our Church: I beleeve him, but on the other side there are many expresse Texts of holy Scripture from whence it may be strongly inferred, that no Protestant whose conscience is convinced of the manifold idolatries and superstitions, wherewith the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Liturgie is polluted, can with a safe conscience goe to Masse, as namely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.4. <hi>I have not sate with vaine persons, neither will I goe in with dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, I have hated the congregation of evill doers, and will not sit with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.7. <hi>Neither be ye idolaters as were some of them,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my dearely beloved flee from idolatrie,</hi> 1 Ioh. 5.21. <hi>Keepe your selves from idols,</hi> 2.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Answer it to be lawfull for him, who doth it without a doubtfull consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: or thought of sin, which I say, because if a man should do that, which in it selfe is lawfull; doubting, or not being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, whether it be lawfull or no; he would sin in doing the same: because he would put himselfe in hazzard or danger of sin; and as the Wise man saith: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. <hi>Qui amat periculum peribit in eo:</hi> He that loves danger shall perish in the same. So he that thinks a thing, which in it selfe is indifferent, to be sinne, and doth the same, sinneth: because such a man hath a will to doe the thing, although it were sin; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his sinfull will commits sin. Otherwise as I have said before, it is lawfull. Which I prove
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61533:21"/>
first. The thing in it selfe is not forbidden by any Law: either by the Law of God, or the Church. Not by the Law of God; for no place of holy Scripture can be shewed, by which it is forbidden. Nor by the Law of the Church: for no Councell or Canon of the Church can be produced for the prohibition of the same. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is lawfull.</p>

            <p>Againe, by the examples of <hi>Ioseph of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea and Nicodemus,</hi> Joh. 19.38, 39. who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they went to the Synagogue of Jews, and so not apparent disciples of our Saviour, yet they were his disciples in secret. For it is there said: that after the death of our Saviour, <hi>Ioseph of Arimathea,</hi> because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secret, for feare of the Jews, <hi>desired Pilate, &amp;c. Nicodemus</hi> also came, he that at the first, <hi>came to Iesus by night, &amp;c.</hi> by which appeares, that the Jews knew not of their Religion. It is manifest likewise, that all the Apostles as freely conversed in the Synagogues of Jews, as out of the same: when thereby they could best exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their function and mission. For the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> in their annotations upon the 20 Chapter of the <hi>Acts vers.</hi> 16. Confesse that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the festivitie of Pentecost was established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians; yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might hasten
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61533:23"/>
to the festivitie of the Jews. Therefore as these holy men, might goe <hi>to the Synagoue,</hi> and <hi>reserve</hi> their Religion to themselves: so may a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique to the Protestant Churches. And indeed, it is an essentiall ingredient to the Mission of all Apostolicall men, to treate and converse with all men concerning salvation, in all places best for their purpose.</p>

               <hi>of a false law,</hi> being in danger of death. See <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza,</hi> and

That by the Law of God and nature, it is lawfull, and the precepts of the Church (if any there were that forbid this) doe not binde Christians, in cases of great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the life, or soule, or honour, or fame, or outward things. See <hi>Azor.</hi> above cited, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Schismaticall Church of the Greeks, where he saith, that a Catholique hearing Masse in a Schismaticall Church, there on a Sunday, fulfilleth the precept of the Church command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same.

Which in part may be proved by the fact of a certaine Catholique Lady, who going to Church in <hi>England,</hi> sent her Priest to <hi>Paris,</hi> to have this case resolved by the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors, who all Subscribed, That a Catholique in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might lawfully goe to the Protestant Church. That this is true, it may be justified by some persons of great qualitie yet alive.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>English</hi> Scholler shall answer, that we went to the Synagogue of <hi>Iewes</hi> out of curiositie and when they did not exercise their rites and ceremonies. I reply, that to choose, we would have gone (if we might have had private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie unknowne to them) to have seene their rites and ceremonies; neither doe we set downe our intention of going: for if it may be done with any intention lawfully, especially where the whole matter of all their rites and ceremonies is alwaies conserved: (to wit, a burning lampe with oyle for the soules depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, now as they conceive, in <hi>Limbo patrum:</hi> a place where the oblation of oyle to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61533:25"/>
is alwaies kept: the tenne Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments placed in veneration: a number of linnen rolles or bands wrote with <hi>Hebrew</hi> letters, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they binde the tenne Commandements according to their distinction of feasts: the knife of Circumcision and the like). Which may be stumbling blocks to some weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, although the men to performe these rites should not be present, why should wee not goe to the Protestant Church with some intention lawfully? where there are onely men within bare wals saying some Catholique ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by them pieced up together without any Catholique forme, not to the possible hurt of any but themselves: and whether I went to the said Synagogue out of curiositie, or out of the love of science, to reason with them about their tenets (as then and there I did) the more to abhorre them, yet I will assure you, that with neither of these intentions doe I goe to the Church of Protestants, and yet lawfully.</p>
            <p>It is lastly proved by reason: to goe to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches is not of its owne nature evill (according to the opinion of the above cited Authors, or so much as <hi>per accidens</hi> evill, as our case now standeth which will be hereafter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) but a thing indifferent; so that by a good intention it may be made good, as by an evill intention made evill. For the intention and object makes the act good or bad. But a man may with a good intention doe a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. <hi>Ergo,</hi> a man may with a good intention goe to Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61533:26"/>Againe, if it be unlawfull to go to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Church; it is either because of Scandall, or because it is a distinctive signe betweene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques and hereticks; or because there is danger of subversion or blasphemie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>But neither of these things there occurre.

               <p>
                  <hi>SCandall</hi> is defined by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Thomas</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2ae. <hi>q.</hi> 43. <hi>ar.</hi> 48. and other Divines (out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom.</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 15. and 18. <hi>Matth. To be a word or deed lesse right</hi> (or lesse good) <hi>giving occasion to another of Spirituall ruine or falling into sinne.</hi> Neither doe they take the <hi>adverb (lesse)</hi> comparatively, but negatively for that, which is not good; that is: with <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> in regard of some particular circumstance of time, place, or persons, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth some morall rectitude or goodnesse. This <hi>Scandall</hi> may be divided into <hi>Active &amp; Passive.</hi> Active is in him that gives it; <hi>Passive</hi> in him that takes it; both expressed in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the <hi>verbes</hi> Active and Passive: to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize, and to be scandalized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.17.18. Active may be subdivided into <hi>per se &amp; per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideus.</hi> Active <hi>per se</hi> is, when a man with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and certaine intention gives his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour occasion of sinning by some word or deed, either intrinsecally or extrinsecally evil. Active
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61533:26"/>
                  <hi>per accidens</hi> is, when besides the intention of the doer, and nature of the act done, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally evill, or at leastwise, having some species or shew of evill; by which occasion is taken, to the spirituall ruine of another. Passive scandall is also subdivided, into passive scandall given, and Passive scandall taken. The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Active scandall either <hi>per se</hi> or <hi>per accidens,</hi> given and received by an other. Such was the scandall forbidden by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. He that shall scandalize one of these little ones that beleve in me, it is expedient for him that a millstone bee hanged about his necke, and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea. And this is called Scandall of the weake or little ones to whom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith) to be ignorant and moved through weaknesse, and so be scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized. For the perfect (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith in the place before cited) are not scandalized. Passive scandall taken is, when a man out of envie and malice taketh occasion of sinne by anothers words or deeds ill interpreted and misunderstood without any lawfull or probable cause. And this is called the scandall of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, which is a sinne onely to themselves, and not to be regarded of the speaker or doer; as appeares by the answer of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Sinite illos, caeci sunt et duces caeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Let them alone, blinde they are, and guides of the blinde.</p>
               <p>Hence Divines with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Thomas</hi> doe inferre first, that sometime Passive scandall may be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61533:27"/>
without active, as it was in the scandall of the Pharisees. Sometimes active scandall may be without Passive: as when one by his bad word or deed, or ill example, doth scandalize and giveth occasion to others of falling into sinne; and yet none are scandalized, or take the occasion given, to sinne thereby. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they may be both together, as when one by his bad example giveth, and another taketh thereby occasion to sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they inferre, that no good works which are necessary, as is the observing of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, can give occasion of sinning to any man; and therefore not to be omitted, to avoyd the the Passive scandall, even of the weake ones, as well observeth <hi>Alfonsus Tostatus</hi>: Because that were to sinne <note n="r" place="margin">The distinction of veniall and mortall sinnes <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>status</hi> (learned in <hi>Peter Lumbards</hi> schoole, not in <hi>Christs</hi>) may teach, but not truely.

An assertion, as farre from Theologicall truth, as Christian modestie. For first, <hi>the law of God is perfect,</hi> Psal. 19.7. and consequently commandeth all good, and forbiddeth all evill: else were it not a perfect but a scantive and defective rule of good. Secondly, though there may be many good workes which the law of God commandeth not, to all persons, at all times, and in all places, in every manner and measure; yet neither is there any good worke nor can be, which is not comprised within that great and large Commandement of <hi>loving the Lord with all our heart, and all our soule, and all our might: Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.27. For it implyes a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to say that we can <hi>love</hi> God more then with all <hi>our might, and strength,</hi> and we see that all is required by this commandement. Thirdly, the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to perfection it selfe, so farre as it is attainable by us in this life, falleth under the expresse commandement of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> How can there be any counsels of perfection over and above the law, when the law of Christ requireth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it selfe? What good worke is there or can there be tending to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian perfection, which Saint <hi>Pauls Whatsoever</hi> carrieth not, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are iust, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any vertue, if there be any praise, thinke on these things.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>dato et non concesso,</hi> admitting for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments sake, that in some one particular or other, that a man might do more then God commands: yet in other things the best man that is, comes short of the law. <hi>For in many things we offend all, Iames</hi> 4.2. and even such a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man as <hi>Iob</hi> was cannot <hi>answer one of a thousand, Iob</hi> 9.3. What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of works of supererogation, when a mans stock or treasure of good workes cannot hold out to pay his own debts? Fifthly, though we strive to the uttermost to walke exactly before God, and abstaine from all knowne sinnes, so farre as humane frailtie permits in this life, and fulfill all righteousnesse in doing all the commandements of God with all our might: may we then su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perarrogate any thing to our selves, or supererogate to others? No our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth us a contrarie lesson, <hi>When you shall have done all these things which are commanded you, say we are unprofitable servants, for we have done that which was our dutie to doe,</hi> Luk. 17.10. We are <hi>unprofitable servants,</hi> therefore not deserving of our Master, and we <hi>doe but that which is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to doe,</hi> and therefore not more then we are bound to doe.</note> 
                  <hi>counsels</hi> which are not of necessitie to be done, or things indifferent of themselves, yet necessary to be done, for the safeguard of a mans life, or goods. Then the scandall that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61533:28"/>
to some by this, that others doe them: either proceedeth from malice; and then that is a scandall of Pharisees, and to be contemned;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61533:28"/>
and no spiritual or temporal good is to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the same. Or it proceedeth from infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie or ignorance, and it is the aforesaid scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of weaknesse. And for this scandall we must refraine for a time (according to the example of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. Who to <hi>avoyd</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">He fouly mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the matter, it was no scandall to Christ to bee poore that hee might make us rich, no more then to be abased, to exalt us; to bee stript, to cloth us; to take the forme of a servant, to make us free; to be condemned, to acquit us; to be in an agonie, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us; and to die, to restore us to life. The viler he became for our sakes, the more highly ought we to esteeme of him. Neither did Christ goe any way about to conceale his povertie, nay he openly proclaimed it: <hi>The foxes have holes, and fowles of heaven neasts, but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head, Matth.</hi> 8.20. But the cause why at that time being destitute of money, he wrought a miracle, was (as the text saith) <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. <hi>That he might not offend them,</hi> who questioned him about tribute, by not paying it. For though he was free, yet the <hi>Iewes</hi> not taking notice of that freedome, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie would have inferred from his not paying, that he had denyed that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ought to be paid to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and consequently had denyed <hi>Caesars</hi> authority &amp; soverainty. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.20. But if povertie be scandalous, why do the Fryars by a vow of perfection, as they terme it, undertake this scandalous povertie?</note> 
                  <hi>the scandall</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> concerning his poverty, bid Saint <hi>Peter</hi> goe to the Sea, &amp;c.) even from the workes of Evangelicall counsels and things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise indifferent, although necessary to be done. Or we must doe them secretly, lest the ignorant, whose minde is weake be troubled. This must be done, untill having yeilded a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our actions, and shewed them to be good, or of themselves indifferent, and necessary to be done for safeguard of life or fortunes: and so the scandall cease, which proceeded from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. But if after a reason be yeilded, the scandall shall not cease, it is not to be esteemed a scandall proceeding from ignorance, but from malice, and to be contemned. Neither ought we then to refraine from any the aforesaid acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61533:29"/>
to avoyd this scandall. Thus <hi>Abulensis</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Matth. q.</hi> 51. <hi>Salmeron, tom.</hi> 7. <hi>tract.</hi> 29. <hi>Estius in cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ad Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Diana</hi> 5. <hi>parte tract.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>de scand. p.</hi> 186. who expresly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: that a man is not bound to loose his goods and temporall fortunes to avoyd the scandall of weake ones after an admonition and reason (for the lawfull doing of the act) be yeilded. <hi>Lorca in</hi> 22. <hi>q.</hi> 43. <hi>ar.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 11. and divers others cited by the said <hi>Diana.</hi> But if the great ones (such as are Priests and Teachers) take this scandall, and the doctrine, or action be profitable; they are not to be regarded, for they are incurable, because they are blinde; that is: they will not see and understand what both God and reason dictates to them. And he that is weake (saith <hi>Estius</hi>) may be sufficiently instructed and taught, that his brother doth well, and that he ought not to be offended by his fact. After which sufficient and full instructions, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in scandall; it will be the Scandall of Pharisees as is aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Now to proove the assertion, which is the first branch of the <hi>Minor.</hi> Scandall, is a word or deed lesse right, apt to give occasion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of spirituall ruine. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61533:29"/>
                  <hi>Minor</hi> I prove. To goe to heare a piece of a Masse in English, is no deed lesse right. But to goe to Church, is to goe to heare <hi>a</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">I answer that the Masse being rightly understood our Liturgy ought not to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a piece of the Masse. For though there are some passages alike in both: yet they tend not to the same end, nor are retained upon the same ground. Every part of any thing hath a reference to the whole, and consequently every part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish service to their Masse, as a preparatory or an appertenance, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate part thereof; whereas no part of our service tendeth at all to that end, nay we are so farre from intending the sacrifice of the Masse in our service, that we disclaime and abominate it and hold it no better then a <hi>Masse of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions and contradictions</hi>; superstitions in the manner, and contradictions in the matter thereof. For they teach it to be a sacrifice properly so called, yet nothing therein is properly sacrificed: not the bread and wine: for they are transubstantiated before the sacrifice; not Christs body, for no living thing can properly be sacrificed, unlesse it be slaine, but Christ as the Apostle teacheth us, <hi>being once dead dieth no more.</hi> Secondly, they teach it, to be an externall and sensible sacrifice, and yet Christ there appeareth to no sense; but is as they teach, couched and concealed under the accidents of bread and wine. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they teach that it is an unbloody sacrifice, and yet Christs blood is there truely and really shed and drunke by the communicants with the mouth. Fourthly, that it is a perfect and all-sufficient sacrifice, and yet they repeat it and reiterate it daily. Fifthly, Christs body is there with his humane dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and yet is whole in the whole and whole in every smallest part and point of the Host. Secondly, I say, that Christ indeed forbids us to <hi>cast pearle before swine,</hi> but no where to take a pearle though out of a swines snout, if we finde any such there.

               <p>It may be here objected first, that although to go to Church, be of its own nature a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, yet <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> it is evill. For consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circumstances of time and place, it hath a shew &amp; appearance of evill, apt to occasion sin in another. From w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we are commanded to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.22. saying, <hi>From all shew of evill refraine your selves.</hi> To which I answer, first: That all the appearance of evill, which, going to Church hath, is, that in <hi>England</hi> above other countreys, Priests have not been freely left to the Principles of Divinitie or Lay-men to their Christian libertie; but it hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to have bin declared unlawfull upon false suggestions, and continued thus thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull by some erroneous judgements. Which my neighbour likewise phantasing erroneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehends it a <hi>species</hi> cast from going to Church, which indeed is not so; nor otherwise, then if a man with a blood-shotten eye should behold glasse, &amp; say it were red; when <hi>a parte rei,</hi> it were white. It were very hard, if I eating fish in the lent, and one purblind seeing me eate, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending it flesh, because he goes away scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, as thinking me to have eaten flesh, by reason of his false eyes; that I should be said to have given him scandall. So it would seeme likewise as hard, if a broken phansie, or an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61533:31"/>
minde should conceive evill <hi>species</hi> from mine actions, which <hi>a parte rei</hi> are no <hi>species</hi> at all of them, but quite contrary to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir species; that I should thereby be judged to give scandall to little ones. No: I hope as the erroneous eyes shall beare their owne imperfections; so the erroneous judgement shall beare its owne mistake; and neither shall accuse me before God of the scandall of little ones.</p>
               <p>Hence I answer, secondly, to the place of the Apostle before objected, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the appearance or shew of evill, is to be understood; first that it proceeds really from the act done, and that it be not only a conjecturall appearance, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certaine. That no man play Tom-foole in striking him that stands next him without a cause. Secondly, that the appearance proceeds not from a deed to be done of necessitie, either by the Law of God, or nature. Otherwise we might inferre the Apostle to command contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories, to refraine and not to refraine from such a deed, whence proceeds the appearance. For if the thing be commanded by the Law of God, it must necessarily be done, or otherwise sinne. And if it were to be done by the Law of Nature; the blessed Apostle was not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, as to bid us refraine from a thing in its owne nature lawfull, and of necessitie to be done; without admittance of some way to avoyd scandall. Although by reason of some circumstance, place or person, it might have a shew of evill, and so for some time be suspended, as some things of naturall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61533:31"/>
yea, the <hi>Evangelicall counsels</hi> may have. But in such cases we are to instruct and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the weake (as I by these presents doe) that although it should seeme to them to be evill, or to have some shew of evill, yet in very deed it is not evill, but good. And I am constrained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of death to do the same. After which instruction and admonition, if they still persist in their scandall; it is not a scandall of little ones, but of Pharisees and great ones. Neither doth it proceed from infirmitie or ignorance, but from malice: and is not to be regarded. So that it seemes a thing unreasonable, and in the strength of judgement against nature, that a man shall more regard the trouble of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours conscience at a thing lawfull, then the hazard of his own life, and ruine of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and fortunes in the execution of the same. See <hi>Diana</hi> for this Doctrine and all the Authors by him above cited.</p>
               <p>If any shall here reply to my first answer of the objection, that the shew of evill is really in the act of going to Church, and not as falsely imagined: and that this shew of evill appeares not only to weake and ignorant people, but to men of understanding of all sorts; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Catholiques, but likewise to Schismaticks of all sorts: who in going to Church to save their goods, confesse that they doe it against their conscience, as conceiving it to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by reason of the aforesaid Declaration of the twelve Fathers in the Councell of Trent, and the foresaid Popes; which whether it were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61533:32"/>
gotten by false suggestions or no, they discerne not, neither doe they dispute, but simply obey. To make up the rime in reason, the more <hi>simple they.</hi> For reason may teach great ones, and men seeming of understanding that are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Lay-Catholiques the contrary; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing is done at Church which is either evill or hurtfull:) and both reason and learning Priests. And therefore I rejoyce with <hi>Aristotle: Propter illorum cogitare, nihil mutatur in re,</hi> and say, that the shew of evill proceeds not from the act of going to Church. For in all King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> time, and the beginning of Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> time, untill the thirteenth yeere of her Raigne, when all Catholiques did or might goe to Church, going to Church by Catholiques then being in fashion; none took scandall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: because there was then, no shew of evill. And why should there be now more shew of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in the act, then at that time? If ye answer by reason of the aforesaid Declaration. I reply that then the <hi>species</hi> of evill, ought to be in the said Declaration, as gotten upon false grounds, and not in the act of going to Church; which any man might easily perceive, considering the nature of the act it selfe. And the experience of our distressed countrey teacheth us, that those indirect proceedings are more apt to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate scandal, then the act of going to Church, which of its own nature is lawfull, and hath been lawfully practised and approved by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of all Divines of any indifferency in other countreyes, and so might have been in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61533:32"/>
ours, had it not been for turbulent people, who for their owne ends have more troubled the Church in procuring of breves and rescripts then all other nations besides of our condition.</p>
               <p>To Schismaticks, I say they sin not, in simply going to Church, but in going to Church with an ill conscience, as thinking that to be sin, and doing the same; which indeed is not so: and the ground of their errour, they have had from the misunderstanding of Catholiques.</p>
               <p>To weake ones I answer, desiring them to be satisfied, because I have and shall prove the thing in it selfe to be lawfull, and that I am (as I have said) in danger and hazard of my life, in not doing the same. So that by a naturall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie I am bound to it. Which necessitie if it were not; I might peradventure rest in the common <hi>Maxime</hi> of Philosophers. <hi>Frustra fit per plura, quod potest fieri per pauciora.</hi> It is in vain done by more, that may be done by lesse.</p>
               <p>It may be objected secondly, that it is as much scandall to goe to Church, as it was to eate of those meats offered to Idols. Of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. the eating of which in it selfe considered, although the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle thought no sin in Wise men, or great ones; because they did eate the same without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all to the Idoll, as he seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, <hi>verse,</hi> 4. yet because some ignorant Christians (seeing the said Wise men eate) did likewise eate the same meats with conscience and devotion, as if the said meats had received some vertue or sanctification from the Idol.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61533:33"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the Wise men, to abstaine from eating the said flesh; for that out of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and misunderstanding of their eating: the aforesaid Christians, then newly converted did take offence and sin. Whereupon in great zeale he said, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>If meate scandalize my brother, I will never eate flesh, lest I scandalize my brother.</hi> So that one would thinke, that the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle would rather have chosen to die (as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid words may import) then by eating the said meats or any flesh to have scandalized his brother. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine</hi> in expresse termes, <hi>lib. de bon. conjugali cap.</hi> 16. saith: It was farre better to have dyed, then to have eaten of those meats so offered to Idols, conformable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe elsewhere: who likewise saith. That a man may not commit (or occasion) so much as <hi>a</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">See page 28. Letter <hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</note> 
                  <hi>veniall sinne,</hi> to gaine the whole world. Which he that giveth scandall, must needs at the least commit. Therefore what the said Apostle and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine</hi> said and thought of the eating of the said meats; the same ought every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique to take as said of the act of going to Church.</p>
               <p>I answer, denying the consequence: and say that there is a great disparitie betweene the said meats offered to Idols, and eaten in the temple with Infidels: and the act of going to Church. First, because in the meats so offered, there was not only a shew and appearance of evill, but a morall malignitie therein, as well to great, as to little ones. Which although the wise did take away, that the said malignitie touched not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61533:33"/>
them; yet the weake neither did, or had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so to doe. Whence the Apostle said, <hi>vers.</hi> the 7. that there was not knowledge in all. For the morall malignitie; that was in those meats to all, was a prophanation and impuritie in them, as being things dedicated to the Idol or the Devill. So that as a man receiveth good by holy? bread or things sanctified; so he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth evill by a thing: prophaned or maligned. Which morall malignitie the Wise taking away (as I have said) by blessing the said meats to the use of their bodies, and conceiving both them, and the Idoll as they were in themselves, meere creatures, both created for the use of man, did eate what was usefull to eate without sinne. Whereas the weake, not so much as considering the prophanenesse of the meats, but (seeing the Wiser eate) with error of judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived vertue and sanctification in the same: as being eaten in the temple and offered to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol by Infidels, and so with conscience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion they received the same: and were (as the Apostle saith, in the said seventh <hi>vers.</hi>) polluted thereby. Now in going to Church, their <hi>is no morall</hi> malignitie at all; in so much, that scarce the weakest man can invent how to sin by any thing that is there done. It being of its owne nature so indifferent, and to a good intention, good, that <hi>a parte rei</hi> their is no appearance of evill therein.</p>
               <p>If any one say that there is appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and scandall by reason of disobedience, in that, the act is done contrary to the declaration
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61533:34"/>
of the said twelve Fathers, and certain Popes. I answer, that the declaration is, as if it were not; because gotten upon most false suggestions, as I have and shall say; and consequently the minds of the said Fathers and wils of the said Popes is to us in this matter as yet unknowne: and the species or shew of evill from thence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, rather to be lamented then regarded. If the reply be made as before, that the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not examined, but the will of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Superiors hath alwaies beene held, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that which hath been best for the soule, and dehorting from going to Church, and that so by reason and vertue hereof, there results a certaine shew of evill, in doing the same, which maketh it appeare to most men unlawfull, and consequently scandalous. I rejoyce as before, that the instruction and admonition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie and necessitie of the act, ought to take away all scandall howsoever apprehended: and that such as apprehend it unlawfull, and will not be satisfied, cannot doe it. And lastly such as will not be satisfied, but scandalized, are not to be regarded, as I have said before.</p>
               <p>Adde out of <hi>Navar Man. c.</hi> 23. <hi>n.</hi> 38. That it is not a sinne in a man, not to obey his superiour, when he hath probable reasons to thinke, that his superiour was deceived in so commanding, or that he would not have given such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if he had knowne the truth. And if any shew of evill result, or scandall arise in that he is not obeyed, the necessitie of doing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie act, being in danger of death, must excuse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61533:34"/>
and take away all scandall, for in such a case no humane lawes binde as I shall hereafter say. I answer to this Objection secondly, that there is a disparitie betweene the said meates, and going to Church, in that the said meates were not to be eaten of necessitie: that is, there was neither hazard of life or goods in abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or more gaine then prejudice of soules in eating. And therefore it was more requisite, that the wise should abstaine in a matter of so little moment or necessitie where there was scandall, then that the weake should have been instructed and admonished, that it might have beene done without sinne, which is not so, in going to Church. For in abstaining from thence, there is both <hi>hazard of life and fortunes,</hi> and as I shall hereafter say, losse of soules: and therefore of necessitie, the weake are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished and instructed, that there is no sinne in the act: neither is going to Church preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall, but advantageous to soules, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth.</p>
               <p>Adde that if there were any humane law or Ecclesiasticall law forbidding going to Church, it were not to be fulfilled with hazard of life or goods (as all Casuists hold) <hi>See Azorius &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr. consil. de haeret. above cited</hi>: if otherwise it doth not appeare forbidden by the law of God. For all humane lawes tend to the preservation and conservation of the whole man, even in the greatest state of perfection: and where by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of keeping a law; disjuncture either of soule or body may probably follow; there that law
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61533:35"/>
is for the time to be suspended: as appeares in the law forbidding to eate flesh in the Lent, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine office, with danger of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and the like: where the weake ones are rather to be instructed of the necessitie of suspending the law, then the body to perish by keeping the same: the same say in our case. And I doe with reason perswade my selfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Apostles whole discourse in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid 8. Chapter to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his words, <hi>verse</hi> the 13. if there had beene no other food to have beene gotten for him, to have preserved him from famine, then the said flesh so offered to Idols, that he would rather have perswaded the weake ones, that there had beene no sinne in it, if with due circumstances they had eaten, and how, and in what manner they might safely have eaten, and so have prevented his sinning against the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>verse</hi> 12. and striking their weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, then by abstaining from that (and as is supposed wanting all other food) have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed through hunger.</p>
               <p>It may be objected thirdly, that those famous Doctors of <hi>Rhemes, William Allen</hi> (afterwards Cardinall) <hi>Richard Bristoe, William Reynolds,</hi> and the aforesaid <hi>Gregory Martin</hi>; who translated the whole Bible into <hi>English</hi> with annotations upon the same, in many places, as well of the Old Testament, as of the new, held it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any Catholike to goe to the Protestant Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is unlawfull and scandalous to goe to the same. To the antecedent I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61533:35"/>
that the said Doctors were reverend and learned men, and their worke renowned: but because they would have the same goe forth with more l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stre, as pleasing the Pope; and to avoid all opposition of the aforesaid suggestors, they forsooke the common opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in two points then agitated: the one, that the Pope could not depose Kings of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dominions. And the other, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques might frequent the Churches of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. Which they might well doe for their ends, being Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns for the same; the contrary opinions not being condemned by the Church, but left under dispute. Yet hence the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence doth not appeare true. For if the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Doctors had spoken from their hearts, grounding themselves upon the Church or reason; their interpretation of Scriptures with notes, would with me in these poynts have had great authoritie; and the conclusion have stood good. Whereas now one of the said foure, to wit: <hi>Gregory Martin</hi> having delivered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it was lawfull for a Catholike to goe to Church, as appeares by the said booke of <hi>R. P. pag.</hi> 109. and 110. it seemeth they did not speake in that point their mindes freely: perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture because it was not expedient for all sorts of people: which I confesse to be the best reason. Yet for Gods sake let us speake the truth in these troublesome times to men (at leastwise) of reason and understanding. Againe the very reasons they give in their annotations
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61533:36"/>
upon the fifth Chapter and 19. verse of the 4. booke of <hi>Kings</hi> doe shew, that they did intend but seeming reason, and not wholly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; for whereas for our opinion is, and alwaies hath beene usually brought the example of <note n="y" place="margin">See the letter <hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Naaman the Syrian,</hi> permitted (as I have said before) by the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> to goe to the Idolatrous temple <hi>Rimmon</hi>; which is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to our case; the aforesaid good Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the said example as nothing like to the same.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first reason is, because of the time, for since the preaching of Christs Gospel (say they) we are more strictly commanded to professe our faith, then in <hi>Naamans</hi> time. Which reason I conceive under favour to be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as well to <hi>Naamans</hi> case as to ours: for the doing of an act indifferent, may neither be a profession or a deniall of faith, but a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both, <hi>viz.</hi> a not discovery of the same. Neither was it more lawfull in <hi>Naamans</hi> time to deny God, then now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Reason is, because of the place: For that the Noblemans religion was not practised in the Countrey where he went to the temple: and so there could no scandall arise thereby. This reason is in my judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the purpose: for no more is Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion practised in this Countrey where we goe to Church. Again, it proves not <hi>Naamans</hi> case hereby more lawfull, then the going to Church; for there may be scandall, where a thing of its owne nature may be lawfully done: as there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61533:36"/>
might have beene scandall in our Saviours po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. if he had not prevented it. And there may be no scandall, and yet the act unlawfull. Therefore if it were lawfull abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from scandall, that being in our case easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoyded, or taken away, the thing may still remaine lawfull. For if he that goeth to Church be a knowne Catholike, the weake are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished of the indifferencie of the thing, and the urgent necessitie he hath, to doe it; and so scandall is avoyded. If he be not knowne; how can he give more scandall, then <hi>Naaman</hi> did? or to whom?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third reason is, because of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of persons, in that <hi>Naaman</hi> had an Office to serve the King in the temple, and therefore he might goe, lest otherwise the King should have thought himselfe disdained. This reason seemes to me very strange: that a man may goe to Church to serve his King, and may not goe to Church to serve himselfe (when as charitie alwayes beginneth at home: and if a man be naught in or to himselfe, to whom can he be good?) or that feare of displeasure through ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended disdaine, can excuse a man from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which were otherwise unlawfull; as though a man were not bound, rather to suffer the displeasure of his King, with losse of his life, then suffer wrack of his owne conscience: and if feare of displeasure did excuse <hi>Naaman,</hi> why should not the danger of death, losse of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ruine of posteritie, and the like, excuse Catholiques?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61533:37"/>4. The fourth reason, and most especiall difference is (say they) that <hi>Naaman</hi> made a promise before the Prophet and his own train, that he would from thence forth serve onely the true God: and to that purpose carried earth with him to make an Altar for sacrifice. Whereas those that goe to the Protestant Church, doe not renounce all heresies, nor professe to frequent Masse, &amp;c. But (pray give me leave to say) they doe; and that herein, there is no difference at all. For Catholikes that goe to Church are knowne to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessaries, and their minde and intention is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to him knowne, as <hi>Naamans</hi> was to the Prophet. And if they be knowne Catholiques, their beliefe is likewise knowne, at leastwise to their traine, if not to others, by their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the See of Rome; so that herein there is no disparitie at all. And if they be not knowne; it is prudence to keepe themselves so, more then to their Confessaries; which is a sufficient protestation in these troublesome times. For I wonder by what law a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n is bound to make any other Protestation of his beliefe for the doing of a thing indifferent?</p>
               <p>So that (as I have said) for the said foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and likewise because there is Idolatrie committed at Protestant Churches, (which I never yet <hi>could finde,</hi> as often as I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the same, and doe hope to prove the contrarie) the aforesaid Doctors make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and scandalous to goe to Church; and our case different from <hi>Naamans.</hi> Hence they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61533:37"/>
liken it to that of <hi>Eleazarus</hi> and the other <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 6.7. who were commanded by eating Swines flesh to depart from the law of God, and their fathers. Which (say they) by no meanes was lawfull to doe, or to make shew of doing the same: <hi>And a man may sweare it true.</hi> For Swines flesh being forbidden by the law, they were bound under sinne, to abstaine from the same. And if they should have made their brethren beleeve in words, that they had eaten, they would have told an untruth, with dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in a matter forbidden by the law, both which were <note n="z" place="margin">See the letter R <hi>pag.</hi> 28.</note> 
                  <hi>mortall</hi> sinnes: which is as farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from our case, as light from darknesse. For we contend that to goe to a Protestant Church, is by no law forbidden, but a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and by a good intention may be made really good without any dissembling. And they bring us an example of a thing, which in doing, many sinnes are committed: so that for the reasons which I have given, I conceive that the authoritie of the said rewoned Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth nothing against our assertion; unlesse the Protestants were an assembly of fallen he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, where there were danger of sinne by subversion or the like, which can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>It may be fourthly objected, that it is the common opinion of men, that to go to Church is scandalous, because it is a signe of hereticall falshood, and a man so doing is reputed as fallen, both of Catholiques and Protestants. I answer, that it is false; and experience teacheth us the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61533:38"/>
contrary. For who made it such a signe? and Schismaticks that goe to Church with an ill conscience, only to save their goods, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in this, they are accounted to hurt onely themselves, yet of all Catholiques they are trusted and esteemed as honest men, and of Protestants they are esteemed no other. And they sinne not (as I have said) in going to Church, but in going with an ill conscience, and being barred of simple Priests from other meanes of salvation, and in doing so, give scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall. But you will say: they deny their faith in this act. I deny that. They deny onely recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancie with an ill conscience, and not religion. Yet I grant that such Schismaticks professe no faith at all. And if there be any other opinion of men concerning them, it is malicious and pharisaical, generated by the craft and deceit of others, under the <hi>species</hi> of pretended piety, making people beleeve, that there is sinne and scandall in the act, when there is none; and if any Protestant thinketh otherwise of this; they have it from the erroneous customary opinion of some Catholiques revealing the same.</p>
               <p>It may be objected fifthly. To communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with heretiques is sinne, and scandall: but to goe to Church, is to communicate with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques. <hi>Ergo.</hi> It is sinne and scandall. To which I answer, first distinguishing the <hi>Major:</hi> to communicate with hereticks publikely, and particularly denounced to be such, or in their heresie. I grant the <hi>Major,</hi> but deny the <hi>Minor</hi> in the same sence; but to communicate with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61533:38"/>
heretiques not denounced such, not in <hi>point of heresie,</hi> to be sinne: that is most false: for then we should neither eate, drinke, buy or sell, with Protestants which is most absurd. Which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie to take away, and all scruple rising from thence by communicating with heretiques as well in service as otherwaies, was the before mentioned constitution of <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, prudently made.</p>
               <p>Adde that if we may not communicate with Protestants in going to Church, we must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Brownists in refraining the Church, and so be thought the same with them, or else every one must be bound to get himselfe convicted for a Popish Recusant, that so Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants may know him to be a Catholique and no Brownist; and so to avoyd water he must runne into the fire. If you answer, that so he goeth not to Church it maketh no matter what Protestants thinke of him, for Catholiques know what he is. I reply then by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that if he goe to Church, it maketh no matter what Protestants thinke of him, for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques may likewise know what he is.</p>
               <p>I answer secondly, that the <hi>Major</hi> supposeth what is not granted. <hi>viz.</hi> That Protestants with whom I goe to Church are formall heretiques: which I desire to be first proved. For an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique is he that obstinately denieth any article <note n="a" place="margin">This definition of an heretique is both defective &amp; redundant: defective, for every obstinate deniall of an article of faith makes not an heretique, unlesse his conscience be clearely convinced of his errour out of the word of God, it is redundant also, for a man may be an heretique by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any article of faith, though that article be not proposed to him by the Catholike Church to be beleeved; though but his pastour, or any other, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Christian out of Gods word clearely propound it to him and prove, it or it be read by himselfe in the Scripture: if he obstinately persist in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall thereof after his conscience is convinced, he becomes an heretique.</note> 
                  <hi>of faith proposed by the</hi> Catholique Church to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61533:39"/>
be beleeved. How can a Protestant be said ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately (which includes a knowne infallibility rejected) to deny an article proposed by the Catholique Church (as I have said before) when he <hi>beleeves</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">The Protestants of <hi>England</hi> know other Churches besides their own, and some have learnedly discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all the Churches in the Christian world, as <hi>Purchas, Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Mocket,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Paget,</hi> and others: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Let this traducer of the reformed Churches answer punctually, whether he beleeveth that the learned Doctors, Confessours, and Martyrs who lived and died within the first 500. yeeres, held the entire Catholique faith necessary to salvation or no? If they held it not, how were they saved, upon what good ground or warrant are so many of them canonized for Saints even by the Roman Church? but on the other side, if they beleeved all things necessary to salvation, how can we be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed incredulous, or defective in our faith, who beleeveth all that can be proved to have beene joyntly beleeved, and unanimously professed by them.</note>, and beleeve not <hi>the truth</hi>; yet they are not properly, and in rigor formall heritiques.</p>

               <p>THat Recusancy is a distinctive sign of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique from a Protestant is most false. Which is thus proved. If Recusancie be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctive signe, it is a signe naturall or by institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but neither can be said. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is no signe. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved. Not naturall, for as <hi>Hurtado</hi> above cited well observeth. Actions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61533:41"/>
and things are not of their own nature signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: but have naturall and politicall uses inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of any signification. For a bush hung out at a Taverne doore doth naturally signifie no more wine to be sold, then any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatsoever. Nor doth the habit of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop naturally signifie a Bishop more then a Judge: and so of other things. No more doe naturally the actions of men.</p>
               <p>But admit that Recusancy were improperly said a naturall signe, yet it would naturally sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more a Catholique then a Brownist (for he refuseth likewise to goe to Church) or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sectary. Although a <hi>posteriori</hi> it might be thought by discourse to signifie some one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Protestant Church, but why, or wherefore, it would never signifie.</p>
               <p>Not by institution: for if so, who instituted the same? God, or man? Not man; for it is out of his power, to signe the people of God, from not his people. It is only the owner of the flocke, that must signe the sheepe, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; unlesse, it be by speciall order from him. Hence when God would signe his people in the old Testament, from the people of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he himselfe instituted Circumcision, <hi>Gen</hi> 17. as a distinctive signe betweene them and others: that whosoever had that signe, should be of his people; and who so had it not, was to be rejected. Neither was it sufficient that any man had accidentally, and by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Abraham,</hi> any other signe, by which he might be knowne from others: because he was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61533:42"/>
not thought sufficiently marked, nor accounted any one of Gods people, by any other sign then Circumcision. Which was the sole marke of God, saying: <hi>All the male kinde of you shall be Circumcised.</hi> And this is consonant to reason. For one man may get a distinctive signe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans institution; shall God therefore own him? Brownists (as I have said) have Recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, doth it therefore follow, that they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Catholiques? If a sheepe in my neighbours flocke should teare an eare in a bramble, or bush, or accidentally breake an horne; this sheepe is hereby distinct from the rest; yet the owner, doth not own it by that marke: but by a marke of his own institution and ruddle. So it is in the present.</p>
               <p>That God did not institute the same, it is so evident, that it needs no proofe. For where may we finde his institution? Vnlesse we should run to the all-knowing spirit of hereticks. Hence it follows that Recusancie is no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive signe.</p>
               <p>If you aske me, what is then the signe to know a Catholique from any other Sectary? I answer. His beleefe of the Creed of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To use a distinctive signe of a false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that properly is such, is a deniall of faith, and evill in it selfe. But the Service said in a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61533:42"/>
Protestant Church is such. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I grant the <hi>Major.</hi> For if the signe be proper of a people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God as (since the promulgation of the Gospel) Circumcision is to a Jew, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> must needs be true. But if the signe be gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or the like, used to the worship and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a false law, which some fondly call a proper signe, then the <hi>Major,</hi> meaning the use of such a signe to be a denyall of faith is false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Diana resol.</hi> 34. <hi>pag.</hi> 191. above cited, <hi>Azorius, Sanches,</hi> and many others there.

We teach he is there truly present, and is truly received by all worthy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants but spiritually by faith, not carnally with the mouth according to the grosse Capernaitical conceipt of Romanists. For first our Saviour in the sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where he commandeth all, <hi>to eate his flesh, and drinke his blood,</hi> vers. 53. affirming that <hi>his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drinke indeed</hi>; perceiving that some were offended thereat, saying, vers. 60. <hi>this is a hard saying, who can beare it</hi>; thus he declareth his own meaning, vers. 63. <hi>The words which I speake unto you, they are spirit and they are life,</hi> that is, spiritually to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, not carnally and grossely. Secondly, the Orthodox Fathers disclaime this carnall eating with the mouth: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyril</hi> in his Anathems denyeth the Sacrament to be <hi>hominis comestionem,</hi> An <hi>Anthropophagie</hi> or <hi>man eating,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, it is <hi>mensa aquilarum,</hi> not <hi>graculorum:</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austine,</hi> that it is <hi>cibus mentis,</hi> not <hi>ventris</hi> or <hi>dentis; the food of the soule, not of the tooth or belly: Tract</hi> 20. in <hi>Iohan.

Fourthly, Christ never wrought any miracle outwardly upon the creature; but the truth therof appeared, even to sense, <hi>when he turned the water into wine, Ioh.</hi> 2. The change was discovered by the taste, vers. 9, 10. <hi>When the Ruler of the feast had tasted it, he said to the Bridegroome thou hast kept the good wine till now:</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when Christ multiplyed the five Barley loaves and the two fishes, both the taste and the stomacke, and the eyes of all that were present gave testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to the truth of this miracle. <hi>For they did all eate and were satisfied, and saw twelve bask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts remaining full of the fragments or broken meat which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them that had eaten.</hi> Neither can it be shewed, that ever Christ the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of truth deluded the sense. If therefore the bread had been truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally turned into the substance of flesh either the sight, or the taste, or the touch would have discerned this change, which yet as themselves confesse, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nothing but the whitenesse, the roundnesse, the taste, and other accidents of bread. Fifthly, If the flesh of Christ may be eaten with the mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, not only infidels and reprobates, but even rats and mice might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the negligence of Priests gnaw upon the consecrated Host, and eate the flesh of the Son of God, which were horrid to imagine and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to utter. Sixthly, if the Romish Priests undoubtedly beleeve this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of transubstantiation, as they doe other Articles of their faith: why did <hi>Garnet</hi> and other Popish Priests when they were required to say these or the like words; <hi>if after I have consecrated and pronounced the words, this is my body, there be not in stead of the bread the very flesh of Christ let me have no part in heaven,</hi> they refused so to doe this profession being demanded of them, but a day or two before their deaths, when if ever, men will clearely discharge their conscience and utter whatsoever is in their very heart, it being the last time they are like ever to <hi>confesse with the mouth unto salvation.</hi> Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the bread be transubstantiated into Christs body, and his body truly really, and properly taken from the hand of the Priest put into the mouth, chawed with the teeth, and swallowed down into the stomacke of all communicants: either Christ of necessitie must have two bodies, one visible, another invisible, one with the full dimensions of a man, the other of a wafer, one passible, the other impassible, one residing in one place, the other filling a million of places: or at least the selfe same body of Christ must at the same time be visible at the right hand of his Father, and invisible in the Host: with the dimensions of a man in heaven, and of a wafer on earth: with distinction of organs in heaven, and inorganicall upon earth: resting in heaven, and moved on earth from the hand to the mouth, and from the mouth to the stomack of millions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants. Lastly, I demand of this Priest and his pew-fellows, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Christs body after it is conveighed into the stomack, doth it remaine there after the forme and accidents of bread are changed or doth it some wayes, remove out of the stomack, or is it there converted into any other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: they dare not pitch upon any of these three, nothing therefore remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but an annihilation or corruption in the stomack and so <hi>the holy one of God whom God would never suffer to see corruption, no not in the grave</hi>; shall now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his glorification suffer corruption in the stomack of all Romish Capernaits.</note>

               <p>Here some may aske, whether it belongs to me out of my authoritie to institute or renew this pious ceremony in taking bread and wine in remembrance of the death of Christ, generally for the prudent Catholiques of <hi>England?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer no.

For Saint <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> that great and pious Doctor using much jaculatory prayers, and being upon the place of naturall necessitie, and there uttering some of the said prayers, the Devill asked him, Whether that were a place to pray in? to whom he answered, <hi>in opusc.

               <p>If you reply againe, that so we may offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to an Idol in a temple (because we may burne perfume, and the Idol we know to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) I deny that: and the disparity is in this, that in offering Incense, the act and shew there tends to the honour and worship of the Devill.

               <p>If you reply thirdly, that there is dissembling in going to Church (as going two waies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion contrary to the Scripture) for thereby I seeme to be otherwise then I am: the reply is false, for I professe but one religion which is Catholique, and at Church I doe but observe the picture of true religion ill formed, which is but a humane act not hurtfull, but by a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intention may be made good, by which all hypocrisie and dissimulation may be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And if I seeme to Protestants to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant; what am I the worse for that? I never yet could finde any law, to ground an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the censures of men. If they censure me to be a Protestant, I am not under their scourge for religion, unlesse they will on purpose make an Act <hi>of Parliament to cut off my head,</hi> which shall be no president for any other Iudges or Iustices: and then I must set up my rest with a Noble man, saying, <hi>Contra potentiam non est resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentia.</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:61533:47"/>
There is no resistance against power. But continuing alwaies loyall both to my King and Countrey, and obedient to God and his Church, and in so doing, giving both God and <hi>Caesar</hi> their due, and that without either sinne or dissembling. I had rather they censure mee unjustly (yet according to the lawes established, for I alwaies stand <hi>pro Rege &amp; Lege</hi>) and so misse their aime by an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> then I loose my life by a pure might. But hence it doth not follow, for all their censure, that I am a Protestant: for to be so, I must beleeve the 39. Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is the definition of a Protestant. Which Articles or any other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of theirs I meddle not with: for if I must doe all things contrary to Protestants, lest I should be thought so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they eate, I must fast; and when they sleep, I must wake; which is ridiculous. As for their thinking me a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, it proceeds from want of knowledge: for they or most of them neither <note n="k" place="margin">He meaneth a Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or Papist, which indeed can hardly be knowne to be a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique. <hi>See pag.</hi> 1. <hi>letter <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</hi> But doth he think that we know not what a Papist is?

               <p>It may be objected secondly, that there were divers Statutes made upon the alteration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the 2.5. and 6. yeers of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth; and 1. and 23. of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore taking as much of the Masse, as would serve for their Service, and to be independent of the Pope, they left the rest. But that they did it in hatred of God and his Church: or for any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction sake, it is altogether improbable. For what would a man get, by hating of God? or the Church, of which himselfe must be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to be saved? or how could they make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of that they knew not; for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church was not then knowne, or scarce established. And therefore without wholly granting the <hi>Major,</hi> or distinguishing the <hi>Minor.</hi> I answer, that every one ought under paine of damnation to obey his temporall Prince in matters lawfull. Yet to suffer for his religion, and (abstracting from all obedience either to Statute or Resc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I deny the sequele, and to the Antecedent I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that according to Divines; a man is bound to confesse his religion <hi>Semper, sed non ad sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>: alwaies, but not at all waies: that is, not at all times, and in all places: but as I have said before out of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> in the said two cases, <hi>viz.</hi> as often as the honour and glory of God requires the same, or the spirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our neighbour shall exact it, as likely to be impaired by silence: which to be requisite I have before granted. Yet hence it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that I am bound to goe into the Market place and cry out; I am a Catholike, who will punish me? or before I am called to publish my religion, to make my selfe be called; or to live and converse to the same time, as having a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led being, and not going to Church. I read that Saint <hi>Faelix</hi> going to martyrdome, S. <hi>Adauc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet I conceive that he had a speciall revelation for the same; and that it is no warrant for our indiscretion.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, that so a man shall professe no religion. I answer the inference to be naught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for suppose a mans recusancie were never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, this man professeth some religion; for he doth not live a heathen. Why then recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61533:49"/>
being rejected, should he not professe the same?</p>
               <p>If it be said, that it is written, that no man can serve two masters rightly. Yet a man may serve one Master, and have a servant to serve him, or he may serve one master, and keepe or use that Masters picture, howsoever ill it be drawne.</p>
               <p>It may be objected fourthly, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, in which he writes to the Catholiques of <hi>England,</hi> declareth, that they ought not to goe to the Churches of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, or heare their Sermons without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the divine worship, and their owne salvation. To which I answer, that the said Pope wrote both piously, fatherly, and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically, according to the aforesaid suggestions by him received: and if he had had the truth of the state of <hi>England,</hi> I beleeve he would have written as piously the contrary. For put the case, that those zealous suggestors had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the consideration of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the Pope himselfe the truth and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of Catholiques going to Church, with these seven reasons following: supposing an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessitie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First that there is no evill or harme done or said in the Protestant Churches to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of any Catholike soule, that may not either be hindred, or prevented very well, by the instruction of Priests; for they preach not against any notable point of doctrine held in the Catholique Church (although <note n="m" place="margin">See page 53.

                  <hi>some simple</hi>

Minister for want of matter may glance at some of our tenets by halfes understood: or in these daies to please his auditorie may <hi>raile against the</hi> Pope, which he doth so irrationally, that few Protestants of any judgement do beleeve him) for if he should seriously preach controversies as insisting seriously upon the true doctrine of both sides, his Auditors (or at lest some of them) would be apt to doubt, and so to search and dive further into the truth: for as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, doubt begets science, which might be an occasion of somes falling from him, which fearing, he is silent in doctrine, <hi>and onely teacheth moralitie:</hi> which why a man may not heare in urgent extremity from any man, I cannot conceive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, that their going to Church, would be a conservation and a preservation of their lands and goods, with a prevention of ruine to the family and posterity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it would be a means to obtaine and purchase the love of their neighbours; and a meanes of their conversion by an affable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; by which likewise they might beare the greatest Offices in the common wealth: <hi>and become</hi>

                  <hi>Parliament men</hi> as well as others: of whom and whose power and force in matters of Religion, these dayes can somewhat declare.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, that it would be a meanes, that whereas Priests leave their Colledges, and now live in private mens houses, to the benefit of one or two, and to the great danger of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Patrons; they might by this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61533:50"/>
meanes more freely converse with all sorts of people after an Apostolicall manner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert many to the honour of God, the increase of his Church, and good of their owne soules. Whereas now they doe little good out of that private house, unlesse maintaine some decayed gentlewomen in good clothes to gossip up and downe; and like bels to ring their praises, that they may fish one in a yeere to the disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their function, and great prejudice of their Mission.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, that divers Schismaticks that now goe to Church with an ill conscience, and thinke themselves in state of damnation, doe suffer spirituall detriment, and oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented with sudden death everlastingly perish.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, many thousands that are very morall and well affected Protestants, were it not for the stop of Recusancie would become Catholiques. Which, rather then they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe themselves and Family, now will not heare of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly, that no poore Catholique that is not able to give twenty pound <hi>per annum</hi> with their children to some Colledge beyond the Seas, can bring them up, either in science or any other art or trade by reason of Recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and this, to the ruine of all poore people: many having a very great charge, and small revenues; and part of that likewise taken away for Recusancie.</p>

And that they were fezible in policie, by civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conversing, intermingling and insinuating themselves by degrees into the conversation of all sorts of people. So that in time a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect might have been wrought: would not this discourse have been more consonant to truth and charitie, and lesse displeasing or odious to our State of <hi>England,</hi> then to suggest that they are Idolatrous hereticks, blasphemers of God and his Church, professours (as indeed they are not because they know the true and sincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it) <hi>of a false religion,</hi> subverters of souls <hi>(but poore ones God wote),</hi> abominable scandalous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c. and that it was a scandal for good people to converse with them in things indifferent, and therfore desire that it might be declared unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that no Catholike might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> them, as in Christian libertie otherwise he might lawfully do? thereby to introduce for their own ends, our now goodly distinctive sign of recusancie?

in London; accusing the said <hi>Day</hi> with much zealous hypocrisie, that he had put forth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pictures to the hurt of Gods Church, and infinite scandall of Protestants. After went <hi>a Sancta Clara cum tanta gravitate,</hi> seconding with an abominable deale of zeale and authoritie (having then got himself to be Provinciall) the complaint of the said <hi>Perrot.</hi> Hereupon the said <hi>Signior</hi> with the said <hi>a Sancta Clara's sollicitor, Luke Wadding</hi> an Irishman in Rome complaines to the Pope: and obtaines upon the former mens suggestions, a terrible Bull against the said <hi>Day</hi> being never cited to answer, admonished, or knowing any thing thereof. The Bull being come to the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> his lodging in Fleetstreet and safe in his deske, <hi>he did me the honour</hi> to shew me the same. Which I read, and asking the said <hi>a Sacta Clara</hi> why he procured it, he told me, for the said <hi>Day</hi> his putting forth of the said pictures, who likewise said, that the said <hi>Day</hi> knew nothing of the same: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired me to be silent. At which, I was much astonished, and knowing very certainly the ground of the whole businesse to be false; and therefore that both the said <hi>Day,</hi> the Popes Agent, and the Pope himselfe were most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly abused; I thought that if the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> were permitted in this manner to abuse men; the best men living might be censured, excommunicated, degraded; and what not without ever being heard? Which is no pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise among Heathens. As for the setting forth of the said pictures, the matter in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61533:53"/>
as being from my purpose, I omit, Yet thus much will I speake that it was a thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, through the whole Catholique Church: the said pictures themselves liked, yea desired of the said <hi>Day</hi> his superiours: who to this day doe acknowledge their approbation of the same, countenanced by the said <hi>a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Clara, Perrott,</hi> and all others ever after they were put forth, for the space of above ten yeers before, to mine own knowledge. A booke at the same time (of <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> his complaint) printed at <hi>Doway</hi> in defence of the same, never proved by oath that any of the said pictures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to the hands of any one Protestant. Neither doe I thinke that any one Protestant (unlesse it might be such, as <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> had suborned for his own revenge to speake against the same) ever saw any of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there could be no indiscretion or scandall by them proved. Nay, the said pictures being made for some particular friends devotion, not so much as one Catholique to an hundred had or knew of them: but contrariwise some that had them from the said <hi>Perrott,</hi> were scandalized through weaknesse by the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> his questioning of them in this manner, as though that should be set forth for their devotion, that in it selfe was false. Yet notwithstanding all this, the malicious suggestions of the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> against this mans doings, did so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, that <hi>Dayes</hi> innocency was thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be condemned by the said <hi>Bull for doing a pious and a religious act.</hi> This indeed I must
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61533:53"/>
say, that the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> when he had him at his mercy, through the remorse and sting of his own conscience, durst not promulgate the said Bull, but kept it dead in his deske, for feare that those who otherwise honour the Popes Bulls honestly and lawfully gotten, would have called him to the Kings Bench Barre for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of this. And had he not taken the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Proclamation of banishment (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his ambitious and seditious wit) he would have been not only questioned for this Bull, but likewise for other matters of a farre fouler nature, which made it high time for him to run. Let any man now judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Popes Holinesse doth not suffer much by hypocriticall suggestions: whether he that so notoriously abused him in words, did not likewise doe it in deeds. For about the same time, when the said Bull came over, his said booke likewise came out of the Inquisition: at which newes the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> again grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that his said book should be so questioned, and yet passe (although by her Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants means, if <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> himselfe may be beleeved) unblemished; told divers persons se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously speaking, that there was never an able man in Rome. To which some replying, yes: The Pope, and Court of Cardinals: in faith (quoth he) no; (making a signe of contempt with his hand) <hi>they are slight and weake fellows.</hi> Here is a fellow to get Buls! here is one that got himselfe made the Popes Protonotary, and bound himselfe by oath, to reveale what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61533:54"/>
he heard or saw done evilly against the Pope! yet he is as ready as any to abuse him. I wonder what account he can give to the Pope of this his office: but it should seeme, that he did <hi>except himselfe in his oath,</hi> that he might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy intreat him at his pleasure. That this is true, it will be deposed upon oath by divers wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, whensoever his Holinesse will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to exact the same. And further the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> added, that he was writing a booke (conceiving as it should seeme, the whole Church to be weake, and to want his helpe) wherein he would shew, what Rules generall Councels ought to observe in declaring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith; which rules (as he said) not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, the Councell should not be held lawfull. Oh abominable presumption and ambition! let any man judge, whether this man be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who will presume to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner with the holy Ghost, in directing and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaching his Church? If this man live, we may perchance in time have broached a quaternitie in <hi>divinis</hi>; but I hope that God will prevent his hereticall humour. And thus leaving the said <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> to him that will have him: my intent here is, only to shew upon what unjust grounds by suggestion a Bull may be gotten from Rome. And whether the aforesaid sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestors for Recusancy, who lived at the Popes doores, and continually at his, or their favorites sides, might not also get their rescripts, Buls and Declarations by the like fraud, for their own ends, although questionlesse with the like
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61533:54"/>
pretended zeale and pietie I leave to every mans conscience to judge. For as in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Countreys where Buls and Breves are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Bishops of Diocesses there can be no thought of any sinister proceedings: so out of such countreys where particular men or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations busie themselves in procuring such Buls, &amp;c. there is never want of suspition and most commonly of abusive dealing. And it stands with reason: because particular men would never sue for generall Briefs concerning a whole State, or trouble themselves more then others, if it were not for their own ends, and did not concerne themselves above the rest. And therefore the ancient Pietie and Apostolicall Clemencie of Popes in such Cases hath been, patiently to heare wherein they have been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed and abused; for it is not their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at any time to grant any thing either upon a veyled truth, or unjust (though speciously sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested) grounds. Hence <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, writing to an Archbishop of Canterbury, gives a Rule of large extent; <hi>Extra de rescript. ex parte.</hi> That in these kinde of letters (that is, such as proceed upon information, as our Case is) this Condition (If the request bee upon true grounds) is ever understood, though it be not expressed. And writing to the Archbishop of <hi>Ravenna, Ibidem</hi> he saith, <hi>Siquando,</hi> If at any time we write such things to you, as exasperate your minde, you must not be troubled; but diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considering the qualitie of the businesse, whereof we write, either reverently fulfill our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61533:55"/>
command, or pretend by your letters a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cause why you cannot: for we will endure patiently, if you forbeare to performe that, which was suggested to us, by evill information: by which appeares the worthy integritie of the See Apostolique, howsoever it be by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse of flattering hypocrites oftentimes abused.</p>

            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>§. <hi>3.</hi> That it is not unlawfull to goe to Church for feare of danger of subversion or Blasphemy, which is the third and last branch of the Minor to be proved.</head>
               <p>WHich I prove thus. Not danger of subversion: for to what purpose should they preach subversive doctrine? when that supposeth a knowledge in the Minister of some people there present to be subverted. Which supposition is false, and must needs savour of a broken fancie. For the Minister intends no more, then to exhort his Auditors to a good life, and to instruct them in moralitie. For as I have said, if he should preach controversies, he must know some Catholiques to be there; or otherwise he would but ingender doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Protestants, and doubts science: and by that meanes would more trouble and disturbe the mindes of the people, then profit them; which out of prudencie, he forbeares: and so contents himselfe now and then, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and away. And in Catholique countries
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61533:55"/>
I my selfe have heard Priests rebuked for preaching of controversies to a Catholique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie, as being a meanes rather to disturbe them, then profit them, as troubling themselves with doubts of things either above their reach and capacitie; or whereof otherwise they are infallibly certaine: so that generally contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies are never preached, unlesse it be to bring people from their doubts, to a better and greater certaintie then they were in before; which hath onely place among people newly converted, or staggering in their religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly. A man is said to be in danger, when that which is feared commonly &amp; oftner hapneth then the contrary: so a man is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of subversion by going to a place, where few come, but are subverted: but so it hapneth not in the Protestant Church: as is apparent by Schismaticks of all sorts; who many yeeres fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Protestant Church, and yet retaine their opinion of the Catholique religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out subversion, and become Catholiques at last.</p>
               <p>Adde that going to Church will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Catholiques in their religion, then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from the same: for then they will have upon their owne knowledge, what now they take upon trust: for if what is done in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Churches, be opposite to what is done in Catholique Churches (as the contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion useth to say, comparing them to light and darkenesse, which are privative opposites ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dialecticks; although the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison

If the first, it were a wonderfull thing, that hearing a little moralitie, should make them fall from the doctrine they were brought up in all their life: or hearing a small piece of controversie men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (if it should so happen) by a Minister, they should be presently carried away from the doctrine they have so long knowne, and never once tell it to the priests, they daily converse with: especially when they goe not out of any dislike of their religion, but with a cleare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for some other ends. I conceive it would rather confirme them, in hearing that spoken, which in their owne conscience they

Which heate, if after this fight of contrarieties or opposition, should not be allayed (the parties being as it were swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, with zeale of the house of our Lord) and the dislike of the Sermon as fraught with untruths, seeme too troublesome: they may depart the Church, for there be many cases of necessitie, to make a man go out of the Church, and as many likewise to make him come short of the same: as to Service (<hi>if it stand:</hi> if not, there is the lesse to be done, and it shall never trouble me) Sermon, or both: for as there are many waies to the wood, so there are many waies to the Protestant Church.

alwaies observed, that most commonly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques converted from Protestancie, have been more firme and solid in religion, as knowing both, then those that never knew but one. And if Schismaticks (of whom I have before spoken) from the wisest to the meanest of capacity, that notwithstanding they goe to Church, and are voyd of grace, are never so much as shaken from their intention of being Catholiques, or their opinion of Catholique religion; why should those that abound so much with Gods grace and professed Catholiques, be said to be in danger, or feared to swerve from a religion they so well know?</p>
               <p>As for blasphemie there is likewise none. If you reply (as the contrary opinion useth to doe out of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2ae. <hi>q.</hi> 13. <hi>art.</hi> 1. and 2.) that Protestants out of a set intent and purpose ascribe their heresies to Gods revelation, and denie his revelations to Orthodox articles of faith, in which consists blasphemy, and without this blasphemy they cannot preach: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Catholique can goe to Church. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the antecedent to be false; and this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie to be much like the Rhemists Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as preferring and embracing their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions before God: and so honouring a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and rejecting their Creator: but in truth and charitie, we ought not to make them worse then they are: for blasphemie and Idolatrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinnes, there must be some formall intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the sinner to deny God his due in what he doth. And so likewise there must be an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61533:58"/>
of committing Idolatry; that is, of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and embracing that which is a morally knowne creature before the Creator; and so to give the creature what is due to the Creator: or otherwise there can be neither blasphemie nor Idolatry. As no man will say, that I eating flesh on a fasting day unknowne or forgotten, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry in preferring my belly before the law of Gods Church, and consequently God, because I had no intention thereto: so no man can say that in the Protestant Church there is formall Idolatry or blasphemy, because they mistake. For <hi>Diana</hi> saith, 5<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. <hi>parte tract. de par. mamae. resol. pag.</hi> 138. that blasphemy is a sinne, in that contumelious words are spoken against God with a minde or intention to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, either directly, or indirectly, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or <hi>interpretative.</hi> Now in the Protestant Churches what contumelious words are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against God with a minde, &amp;c? If you say as before, that they ascribe their heresies to Gods revelation, and deny his revelation to Orthodoxe Articles. I answer, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t their minds and intentions are not so much as <hi>interpretativè</hi> to dishonour God thereby; or indeed so to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe their heresies. For if they knew their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to be heresies, and the tenents they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be Orthodoxe Articles, as we do by the light of faith; it would evidently follow, that they spake sometimes contumeliously against God, which they doe not know, but simply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture according to their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and therein they erre and mistake. And
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61533:58"/>
because they doe not endeavour the meanes to search and know the truth, by the definitions of Councels, and Doctrine of Catholique Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they sinne: yet doe not commit Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: for it is not their intention, to make an Idol of their opinion, unlesse you take Idolatry so largely, as every sinner may be said to be an Idolater: because in every sinne there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version from God, and a conversion to the creature: and consequently in this sense, all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are Idolaters. And if it be unlawfull to converse with these Idolaters, or the like blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers; that is, such as sinne by word or deed; we must converse onely <hi>in spatio imaginario,</hi> or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. We must goe out of this world.</p>
               <p>There were divers very learned and holy Fathers, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the question of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme administred by hereticks, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Anselme</hi> and others, who did mistake and erre, before they knew the sense and definition of the Church: whom therefore to call blasphemers or Idolaters were blasphemie indeed. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there are divers points this day controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among Catholique Divines, as the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate conception of our blessed Lady and the like; the Authours of which to count blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, before they knew the sense of the Church, were more then peevish. Neither are they to be so accounted, after the sense of the Church is knowne, for the time they held their opinions before. So it is with Protestants, for although the Orthodoxe Articles are knowne
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61533:59"/>
to us by the Church; yet to them they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; and to most of them so unknowne, as if they had not been revealed at all; because they know none <hi>other Church but</hi>

                  <hi>their owne.</hi> And therefore what they beleeve, they have by errour and mistake, and not as blasphemy. Whence in my opinion it were more proper and Apostolicall for such men, as call them blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and Idolaters, to use some prudent and faire way, to propose to the aforesaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, the true Church, and the authoritie of the same, without all suspition of partialitie, and then they should see, whether having this meane of beliefe in a balanced judgement, they would attribute their heresies to Gods revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deny his revelation to Orthodoxe Articles, or no.</p>
               <p>To the authoritie of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Thomas.</hi> I answer, that he meaneth such as attribute heresies <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus tales</hi> to Gods revelation: and deny his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to Orthodox Articles <hi>quâ tales:</hi> as Arch-hereticks did in this reduplicative sense to be blasphemers. But not such as take Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the revealed word of God, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand the same in a specificative sense, through their own ignorance or infirmitie, to be blasphemers; Neither did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Thomas</hi> or any other temperate and solid Divine ever inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It may be here first objected, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raigne went to Church, and so did likewise the Catholiques in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and they were all, in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61533:59"/>
a short time subverted. <hi>Ergo:</hi> there is danger of subversion in going to Church. I deny the later part of the antecedent: and say, that while the plot of Recusancie was working, there was a command got, upon the former suggestions, that no Catholiques should goe to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church. So by barring them of their Christian libertie by degrees to bring in Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancie, as a pretended signe, betweene a good Christian and a bad. Which some few Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques then beleeving themselves bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey (as indeed they were not, but might as well withall reverence and obedience have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeched the Pope to have recalled his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) refused the Church. Others (and those the most part of the kingdome, as appeares by the afore Author of the Answer to the Libell of Justice, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 172. <hi>&amp;</hi> 182.) fearing the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of the said Statutes, did not refuse: but continued to goe to Church: who being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Priests (being but a few then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and those of most power, being for the said recusancy) as having no spirituall comfort, or instructions in what sense, they might truely and lawfully doe what they did, to avoyd the said penalties of the Law, and likewise thinking that those Priests thought them to doe ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in what themselves found no hurt, they dyed as they lived. But whether in Protestant tenents or Catholique: or whether they would not have dyed Catholiques if they had had helpe, especially such as lived before in Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time, I present to any wise and pious mans
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61533:60"/>
judgement truly considering the state of those times. And afterwards their children being still neglected upon this point of Recusancy, and living in ignorance, ingendred the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igion now on foot. So that the cause of their falling was not their subversion, as may be proved by witnesses yet alive; but over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet zeale in Priests the chiefest heads of whom (ayming as is evident at a temporall end) neglecting and rejecting such as would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their unreasonable command: and in the same manner it hapneth with Catholiques that now goe to Church in these dangerous times. Who going to Church only to save themselves from ruine, and being rejected as judged to be fallen from the true faith by ignorant Priests, and therefore not looked after, with any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian instructions or admonitions faine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Protestants, rather then they will bee thought to live against their conscience. Whence I may truely say (and prove by the Authour last before cited, who confesseth that in the thirteenth yeere of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reigne the third part of this Kingdome at least was Catholique) that since the fall of Religion in <hi>England,</hi> by this onely Cheate of recusancie, tenne soules have beene lost, for one gained, which is both lamentable and damnable to those that were the first Authors of the same.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Scots:</hi> their fall was neither sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version or Recusancie which was never gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally admitted (because not covertly procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) by the Clergie of that Kingdome: but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61533:60"/>
want of Priests to administer the Sacraments, and give them other spirituall comfort; who seeing the soyle not so fertile as ours, and the lawes more severe; those few that were, rather chose to converse on the Northern borders of <hi>England,</hi> then in their owne Countrey. And Catholiques there, seeing themselves destitute of all spirituall comfort, went to Church to save their inferiour portion from ruine; who if they had had but plenty, or sufficiencie of priests to have instructed them, I doubt not, but they would have still remained Catholiques. And it had been farre more easie, so to have conserved them, then fallen now to convert them. And thus came the <hi>bane</hi> of <note n="s" place="margin">The bane of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie not of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique religion. See <hi>pag.</hi> 1. letter C and <hi>pag.</hi> 52. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter C.</note> Catholique religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both Kingdomes; which are like so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue remedilesse, unlesse they be assisted by Gods infinite and miraculous power.</p>
               <p>It may be objected secondly; that divers Popes, as <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, both the last <hi>Gregories, Sixtus, Clement,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, granted to priests their faculties with an intention, that they should administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to onely such, as abstained from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches. I answer that it is so said by <hi>R. P.</hi> but whether it be so in truth or no, I know not: peradventure such faculties might be granted to such as received them from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid suggestors hands, and to none others. Neither did I ever see any faculties as yet so limited, nor I hope ever shall. For although the aforesaid Popes might be inclined to the said suggestors tribe, &amp; so admit of their sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61533:61"/>
thinking them to proceed from zeale, and not from hypocrisie: who likewise thought their pretenses holy: and what a Christian like thing it was, to suffer persecution for Gods sake; and what a number of Martyrs were made in <hi>England, &amp; sanguinem martyrum esse semen Ecclesiae:</hi> that the blood of the Martyrs was the seed of the Church. Further, what an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable people Protestants were: Idolaters, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous heretiques, subversive of soules, and many other the like exaggerating speeches; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which any Pope living (unlesse he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne their drift) would have done the like. Whereas certainly had they but made known, the true State of <hi>England</hi> in those dayes, and sought the good of souls (and not themselves) in truth they ought to have done; the said Popes would never have done, as they did to us, more then to the <hi>Scots, Hollanders, Germans</hi> and other nations: by subjecting us and all poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by this device of Recusancie to all misery and slavery. Neither hath his Holinesse that now is, ever declared any such thing, for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he (better knowing by experience the said suggestors tribe, and their plots, with their moth-like dealings in most Kingdomes) will be advised hence forward, how he granteth any more Rescripts, or limiteth any faculties upon their importune suggestions. As for our Martyrs of <hi>England.</hi> I hope them truely Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, because they died not so much for recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancie, <note n="t" place="margin">Nay not so much for Religion, noe nor at all for it, but for Treason and disloyaltie. See <hi>pag.</hi> 22. letter Q.</note> 
                  <hi>as for Religion</hi> and a good conscience (although that might be a meanes to bring
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61533:61"/>
them to their death, sooner then otherwise). Yet I dare not call all of them Saints, untill the holy Church doth bid me, as having approved of their miracles: but most of them I think true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be blessed men, and of great charitie. For as our Saviour saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Majorem chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem nemo habet, quam ut animam suam ponat quis pro amico suo.</hi> No man hath greater love, then who layeth downe his life for his friend. Yet I hope likewise others some, who yet live, to be as blessed, and their charitie or love as great; although not so apparent for the present, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as yet not exercised in fight, but when God shall be pleased to call them to suffer for their Religion, they may make it as manifest. For although a man of a thinne skin, and a veine transparent with lesse art strooke, doth present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleed in abundance: yet no man may hence inferre, that a man of a thicker skinne, and a more obscure veine not lightly strook, hath no blood in his body to shed; so it is in the present, betweene him that suffers for Religion being discovered by Recusancie, and him that suffers not, being undetected by rejecting the same. And in this they differ; that as the one suffers for a good conscience sake; so the other <hi>suffers</hi> not, with a good conscience. As for the said exaggerating speeches, they doe so much strengthen and confirme me, knowing them to be false, that I am morally certaine: that the said <note n="u" place="margin">The Fathers heo speakes of were the flower of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> neither were they abused by any false suggestion, for the case was put truely unto them, and they resolved it according to their conscience after long disputation and mature deliberation.

                  <hi>twelve Fathers</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi>

selected by the said suggestors for recusancie were abused; aswell as the aforesaid Popes. And therefore as they are said to have granted to some limited faculties, meerely upon the said false suggestions (which how farre they did binde, the suggestors at their pleasure, to great persons according to their custome, could very well tell) they might as well have granted the same, without any such limitation, if it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them: and I am perswaded more to the glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is improbable with me, and against the nature of an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall mission, that men should be sent out of Colledges into Protestant countries to private mens houses, to play bo-peepe: as fearing to be seene conversing with Protestants, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants not caring to come to them, for any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion. I wonder by this kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, what kinde of conversion could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue? whereas Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said to them that were about him, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. You know how I have withdrawne nothing that was profitable, but that I preached it to you, and taught you openly, and from house to house. Neither doe I beleeve that any man can prove any notable increase of Catholike religion in <hi>England,</hi> either in great families or in small, from the time of this recusancie brought in, unto this present: onely this I see, a great impoverishment of the Catholiques here, and halfe a dozen faire high Colledges built beyond the seas, besides what common purse I know not: and this I conceive
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61533:62"/>
to be all the effect of recusancie; for persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as I have said) begets prayers to God, and almesdeeds to his supposed servants, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great Colledges for refuge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>But some may here againe reply; that if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusancie had beene rejected, and conformitie admitted, yet Protestants would have had some other invention to punish Catholiques for their religion. I answer it might be so, if some evill spirits had told them the proceedings of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques before hand (as I never yet knew in my life Catholiques private to themselves) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise why should they have invented more to punish Catholiques, then they have hitherto done to punish Schismaticks or Separatists? The said Suggestors had best invent for them some way more then they have already, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a persecution, which were but conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as it seemes, to the said Authour of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, &amp;c. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 216. as is before said: who delighteth more to have a persecution (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not to fall upon himselfe or his tribe) then a toleration in religion.

That if any Clarke, or Lay-man did enter into the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Jews or Hereticks to pray, he should be deposed, and excommunicated. I answer, that it might be a necessary Decree: because then there were but young Christians, and they newly instructed, in very high mysteries, as the mystery of the Incarnation, which was so hard to them, as that God should be borne man,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61533:64"/>
poore, live poorely, and at last be put to so shamefull a death, by the hands of men, his own creatures, that the forcible Arguments of the Jews might have <note n="z" place="margin">There was no feare of the Iews perverting the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians, especially in the Apostles dayes in which we reade in the <hi>Acts,</hi> how mightily the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and their converts confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iewes, Christ making good his promise to them that he <hi>would give them a mouth and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which their enemies should not be able to resist, Luk.</hi> 21.15. but the true reason why they made such a Canon (if yet they made such Canons w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is very much doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted) was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the scandall which the Church might receive by the Christians frequenting the Iews Synagogues in which the now abrogated rites of <hi>Moses</hi> were to the injury of the Gospell retained, and Christ himselfe blasphemed which no Christian eare ought to endure.</note> 
                  <hi>easily perverted them.</hi> Againe, the Jews were formall blasphemers of God; our Saviour telling them himself; that he had done those signes among them, that no other man could doe. Whereby he gave them to know, that he was God: all which the Jews rejected as naught, and said, that he did them in Beelzebub Prince of the Devils. And when he told them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 36. <hi>that he was the Sonne of God,</hi> they answered that he blasphemed, to whom he replyed, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. <hi>If I doe not the works of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeve me not.</hi> And therefore it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, that those Christians should abstaine from their synagogue, least they should have fallen to have been as they were.</p>
               <p>The company of hereticks, the Apostles might likewise forbid: because they were such as fell from and amongst themselves, and very likely particularly denounced excommunicate; so that danger of subversion was there immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: because their intention was formally to subv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61533:65"/>
to the ground; and so borne and bred, as they know no other religion, but their own, and there doe so rest: teaching their own but to live morally which is both common to Catholique and Protestant. Which motive or reason hath no place in our case, where (I contend) there is no danger at all.</p>
               <p>Hence it may be generally observed that what Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or Canons soever, forbid Communication with hereticks: they are to be understood of notorious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in point of their heresie, or particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced excommunicated for heresie and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in Catholique countreyes or from amongst Catholiques. And not of such as are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and subversive hereticks, but borne incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in a countrey to be converted, and not knowing the Catholique Church.</p>
               <p>After all this, some may yet say, that it hath been a long custome with them to abstain from the Protestant Church above these threescore yeers: and they have suffered and lost much by refusing the same; and can I have so little judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to thinke upon mine own bare word or opinion to make them leave this their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome? I answer (how small soever my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be) that it is not only my opinion, but the common opinion of Divines in the Catholique Church: and I never spake with any Priest in <hi>England</hi> about this point in my life, that was able to give me satisfaction to the contrary. Some indeed have answered me, that it were lawfull, if it were not for scandall. Others, if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61533:65"/>
it were not a distinctive signe: and when I have urged, that scandall may be avoyded (as I have before said) and for a distinctive signe, I knew none, for who should institute that signe? then they have answered, that a long custome had brought it in: I have blessed my self to thinke, that men should so unjustly deale with poore Catholiques, as to bring upon them a yoake or fetters; which they can keepe upon them by no other law, then that they themselves cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly got them on, or chained them about threescore yeeres since, and now to kicke of these chaines, or their devises would prove (forsooth) scandall: because they would seeme refractary and disobedient to their suggestive humours: but to give me a reason why going to Church was unlawfull before the refusall thereof became this supposed distinctive signe, or before the same could be cause of scandall I could never yet heare any man give: but only the aforesaid <hi>R.

As for their sufferings and losses I am sorry for them, and doe assure my selfe, that they will receive a great reward for the same: because they suffered not so much,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61533:67"/>
for the love of recusancie, as for the love of God: for whosoever doth the meanest worke (no indiscretion therein being apprehended by the doer) either for Gods sake or for vertue sake, although of some (considering the act it selfe, and not knowing the doers intention) it may be judged indiscreet: yet the worke may have a reward from God, and yet another that doth not the same, no punishment.</p>

               <p>This Oath according to every part and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the same may be lawfully taken by any Catholike; as have averred both M. <hi>Widdrington,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61533:69"/>
Sir <hi>William Howard,</hi> and others; who have so substantially wrote of the same with explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each branch; that I thinke no wise man dares hazard his credit in going about to refute the same. Yet the weaknesse of some Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques hath beene so great, that they have not onely taken scandall, (being of the Pharisees not much to be regarded) but gone about to defame such as stood for this Oath to their great prejudice; notwithstanding the said M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Widdrington</hi> in his <hi>Newyeeres-gift,</hi> hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved, that besides the authoritie of many famous Divines, it was the opinion of the chiefest secular Priests in <hi>England</hi>; but these uncharitable proceedings were hatched by a sort of arrogant and covetous people, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make every thing scandalous among Catholiques that was not done by their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and to this purpose, the first principles were to leade people into scruples, and being there, to put a ring upon them, abusively tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the yoake of our blessed Lady; by which they might more easily leade them to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and censures, as men doe Bears to their purposes. <hi>Oh wise Venetians! how sacred are your lawes?</hi> would a man thinke that such blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or rather envious peevishnesse could be in Catholiques, as, what they understand not, to censure at their pleasure without any respect of persons? and presently judge them as fallen men whom they dislike? although indeed fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then themselves, and very well able to teach most of their guides. But to the purpose,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61533:69"/>
the truth is, that the aforesaid Authours have so fully proved the lawfulnesse of taking the said Oath, that no man needs speake more in proofe thereof, as not being able to speak better to the purpose. And therefore I referre every man to the said Writers to informe themselves lest they demeritoriously suffer for refusing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This onely give me leave to insert, as a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to some, that considering it is contrarie to the Popes (forced) opinion as appeareth by his Declarative <hi>Breve</hi>; he that shall sweare or abjure the doctrine and position (<hi>That Princes which be, &amp;c.</hi>) in the fourth branch, as impious, hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and damnable (I conceive) indirectly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jureth the Popes opinion, as impious, hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and damnable: and what a fault that may be made in <hi>Rome</hi> (especially by some sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, who although to mine owne knowledge doe teach, this Oath lawfull in private, to men of qualitie: yet in publique, and to his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse out of a seeming zeale they will lament the fact) I leave to the judgement of wise men. When as they shall sweare his doctrine erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in such bitter terms, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be the supreame Pastour of their souls: questionlesse in such, it will be interpreted at the least arrogacie and presumption. And I for mine owne part should thinke it very hard to be forced to take the Oath of Supremacie in <hi>Rome</hi> under any termes directly or indirectly misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming my dutie to my naturall Prince: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he might erre in mistake. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61533:70"/>
I doe humbly present the consideration of our case in this Oath of Allegiance to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties most gracious Clemencie. This caution or consideration I present to such, as having taken the said Oath, intend afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse at <hi>Rome.</hi> But if death or ruine urge, then (<hi>spectata conscientia</hi>) I say as before, follow the opinion of Sir <hi>William Howard,</hi> and Master <hi>Widdrington</hi> as secure. For in such extremitie it is to be hoped, that his Holinesse will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a pious and pittifull father, then too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Judge.</p>
               <p>If any be urged to this Oath out of any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preferment: let him follow the example of that huge Divine <hi>a Sancta Clara</hi> (an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of mine) and take it in private before a Master of the Chancery, and get a Certificate thereof from him, and it will be sufficient.</p>
               <p>Here is to be noted the intolerable abuse which some suggestors did put upon the Popes Holinesse, concerning this Oath of Allegiance; who procured him to send forth a declarative Briefe, forbidding <hi>English</hi> Catholiques to take the same; as conteining many things plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to faith and salvation: and by this meanes compelled him against his will, to make the Doctrine adverse to the Oath, his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. When as the procurers themselves, and their abettors did (as I have said) counsell in private, some men of qualitie (who were friends to them) to take the same as lawfull, as may be easily proved. And which is more strange, that they should procure it to be declared so repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61533:70"/>
when as the doctrine to be abjured in the said oath wrote by <hi>Santarellus</hi> was declared by all the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors and sixteene of the chiefest Jesuits in <hi>France</hi> to be wicked: so that what is held lawfull by most Divines in the Church (it being the most common opinion, except some few that would seeme to flatter the Pope) should be held wicked only for us to take: but I conceive, as I have said before, that the intent and end of the procuration of such Briefs is, that nothing should be thought good or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>England</hi> to be done, without the speciall approbation of the suggestors tribe: so that if any man should doe what they have not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by vertue of the Popes Briefe, he shall be presently blasted for an heretick: and if he doe what they approve, he shall be saved harmelesse by them both at home and abroad, let him be never so bad. <hi>Sed meliora Spero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let any judicious man consider all the Buls, Breves and Censures that have beene procured touching the affaires of <hi>English</hi> Catholiques from the first Bull of excommunication against Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> to the last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of in <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. against one who knowes nothing of the same, and he shall finde, by farre, more hurt done to Catholiques, then ever good. It were a blessed turne if some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be taken by our most gracious Queene for the prevention of such mischiefes: which serve for nothing more, then to make Schismes and Rents in the Church of God, and the Pope, and his authoritie to be lesse regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61533:71"/>
It were more fitting in my poore judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Catholiques were succoured in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, then by barring them of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty, in what they may lawfully doe, to adde affliction to affliction. I must say no more; for I perceive that some beginne to swell, but the matter is not great: for I will write nothing by Gods grace contrary to the Catholique Church. Yet I feare they will breake before I have done with:</p>

perfect establishment of the new Protestant Church within this Realme, and other His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Dominions.

                  <note n="s" place="margin">A ridiculous eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and contrary to the intention and letter of the law, as shall be proved hereafter. The intention of the law was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate the Popes usurped jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not over the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had: but over the Romish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised. Besides, the letter of the law carryeth supreame <hi>governour of the Realme and all other Her Highnesse Dominions and Countreys,</hi> not only of the Protestant Church within Her Realmes. This is made more evident in the Admonition to the Injunctions, 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> where Her Supremacie is described to be <hi>over all manner of persons borne within Her Realmes, Dominions and Countreys:</hi> therefore over Papists as well as Protestants, unlesse they be no manner of persons.</note>

               <p>It is to be noted fourthly: that a man may be said to be a <hi>Forreiner</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">I acknowledge the word <hi>forreiner</hi> is sometimes taken for an opposite to <hi>domesticus fidei, a stranger from the covenant of grace:</hi> but in the Act of Parliament and Oath of Supremacie, as it is expounded in the Admonition (which is also Enacted) the word <hi>forreiner</hi> can signifie no other but those who are not natives.</note>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61533:75"/>
sence, all that are of the Protestant faith with the King, are Domesticks of the same faith, and within His Dominions only subject to His spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall jurisdiction by the Laws of the Realme. And all that are not of the Protestant faith, are forreiners to the same, conformable to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> who accounted all those of whatsoever Nation, or under whatsoever temporall Dominion or Iurisdiction in the world) who were of the same faith with himselfe which he taught, were Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks of that faith. And those of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Nation or temporall Dominion, that were not of the same faith, he accounted forreiners. Whence he saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Let us doe good to all:</hi> but especially to the domesticks (or those of the house) of faith.

               <p>It is to be noted fifthly and chiefly, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are required in every lawful oath: which according to the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> are three. <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Truth, Iudgement, and Iustice:</hi> for he saith in his fourth Chapter. <hi>Thou shalt sweare our Lord liveth, in truth and in judgement and in justice:</hi> upon which place the holy Doctor, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the foresaid conditions are requisite to every oath: of whom all Divines have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same; requiring in every lawfull oath, every of the said three conditions. The reason hereof is: because an oath being an invocation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61533:76"/>
of God, as witnesse that what we speake is true; it is requisite that we should use judgement or discretion, to see that we doe nothing rashly, or without due reverence, devotion and faith, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards so great a Majestie, but we must especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard, that we make not him, who is the chiefe and Soveraigne veritie and inflexible ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, either ignorant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what we say: or Patron of a lye, as witnesse of that, which either is false in assertion, or unjust in promise. Hence an oath wanting Iudgement or discretion and wisdome: is a rash and foolish oath, that which wanteth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: is called an unjust oath. And finally, where there is not truth: it is adjudged a false or lying oath, and is more properly then all the rest, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Perjurie.</p>
               <p>These notes premised, I shall now prove, the said Oath of Supremacie to be lawfull for any Catholique to take.</p>
               <p>Every Oath that is accompanyed with the three said conditions or companions, <hi>viz.</hi> veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, justice, and judgement (in the opinion of all Divines, Canon and Civil Lawyers) is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Oath: but such is the Oath of Supremacie above recited in every part and particle of the same. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, discoursing of every branch in particular, and first, of the first branch: wherein I sweare that the King is only Supreame Governour of this Realme, as well in all Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall things or causes, touching the Church of the said Realm: as Temporall touching the State, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Dominions. Which I doe sweare dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61533:76"/>
as a thing true and just. For there is no other Supreme Governour of temporall things to be assigned, but the King: as all will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: nor of Ecclesiasticall things, or the Church of <hi>England</hi>; as by a sufficient Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be proved. For the Parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt, is not supreame governour of the Churches within this Realme; when as according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of reason, the King is governour of that: and therefore not supreame. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cannot be assigned supreame governour, when as he hath all his authoritie of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the King, and so he hath a Superior. A Lay-eldership cannot be supreame gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for although it be unknowne, what it is, or from whence it receiveth its authoritie; yet I thinke no Lay-eldership so barbarous: as not to admit the King chiefe governour of the same. Neither can the Pope be any way su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame governour of the aforesaid Church: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he professeth himself only <hi>supreame head and governour of the Catholique Church</hi> and of no other according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. what is it to him to judge of them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, of which Catholique Church His <note n="u" place="margin">Neither can the Pope.

               <p>For the second or third branch it is likewise proved. For I sweare them likewise discreetly, truly and justly. <hi>viz.</hi> that no forrein Prince, Person, Prelate, &amp;c. hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, &amp;c. within this <hi>Realme (in the</hi>

For neither doth His Majestie or did Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> claime to be chiefe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Catholique Religion, or Romane Church, or any jurisdiction therein. It being by them both (as I have often said) abhorred as superstitious, and abolished for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by the said Queene and State of <hi>England:</hi> therefore it is against reason, and a kinde of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie treason to sweare either of them governour of a Religion which they apprehend so evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in respect of the Protestant Church esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, the Pope is a forrein Person and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: and his jurisdiction forrein. Neither hath he, or any other forrein Person any jurisdiction in the <hi>aforesaid</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">The words of the Oath are not <hi>that no forreiner, Prince, or Prelate, hath or ought to have any iurisdiction or spirituall authoritie within the Protestant Church but within the Realmes,</hi> therefore no jurisdiction within His Majesties Dominions, over any members either of the Protestant or of the Romish Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Church, or ought</hi> to have: for as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61533:77"/>
I have said in the fourth note, out of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> as all those that are of the Catholique faith, are domesticks of that faith: and all that are not of the same faith, are forreiners to it: so all that are of the Protestant faith (of which His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie is governour) are domesticks of the same: and all that are not of the same, are forreiners to that Religion. Hence appeares the truth of the said branches: wherein is said (in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) <hi>That no forrein Prince, &amp;c.</hi> and (in the third) <hi>I doe utterly renounce and forsake all forrein jurisdictions, &amp;c.</hi> which I doe justly and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce as well in respect of the Protestant Church, as of the Catholique: for as I have said the Pope is truly a forreiner to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church: in respect of which, I must by the law renounce his jurisdiction. And he is no forreiner in respect of the Catholique Church, in which I am bound to respect him and his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: for if all Catholiques be domesticks one to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>forreiner?</hi> his jurisdiction being as internall and intrinsecall, as innate and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to every Catholique in the world; as it is to him, that stands next him in his chamber at Rome. And therefore there being no forrein jurisdiction in the Catholique Church, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sence I may lawfully renounce all forrein ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last branch can have no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie at all, with any Catholique. So that the words of this Oath seeme to me so cleere and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61533:78"/>
lawfull, since the establishment of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church; that it may be taken of any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique without any the least danger of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie, or any other sinne (scandall being avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) or without mentall reservation or secret equivocation: that I admire that any man hath so long scrupulized to the losse of himselfe and fortunes: when as being necessitated to take the same, and scandall being easily to be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as I have said out of <hi>Diana</hi> and others) he might have prevented his owne ruine with a safe conscience: as I conceive Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> and other men of estates did, who are reported to have <hi>lately taken the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be objected first, that this Oath thus explicated, hath no coherencie, the first branch with the second and third; and therefore that it be coherent, and taken conformably to the intention of the law-maker, as we sweare the King to be onely Supreame Governour of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the first branch; so ought we in the second and third branch to renounce all Jurisdiction forreign to the same. To which I answer first, that coherencie is no condition requisite to an oath, but impertinent to the truth or falshood of the same: for there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of a different nature inserted in an oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there is a most perfect cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie in the aforesaid explication: for as in the first branch, I sweare the King Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so in the second and third: I abjure all forreigne Jurisdictions whatsoever.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61533:78"/>
Which are the very direct words of the oath: for there are no words in any branch signifying a renunciation of all Jurisdiction forreigne to the Protestant Church of <hi>England.</hi> Whence there is a great difference between renouncing all Jurisdiction forreigne to the particular Church of <hi>England,</hi> and renouncing all forren Jurisdiction. For a forren Jurisdiction renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced is rightly described <hi>A power or right denied to be extent to the swearer by any law,</hi> and is more generall, then a Jurisdiction forreign to the Protestant Church: which is onely a power not extent to a Protestant <hi>quâ talis:</hi> which although it be forren to the said Church; yet it may be properly extent and appertaining to the swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. So that it is intended by the said oath; that as in the first branch, we sweare the King onely Supreame Governor of the Protestant Church within this Realme and his Dominions: so in the second and third; we are to renounce all forren Jurisdictions whatsoever; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> either the Pope, or any other forren Person hath, or ought to have in the same: which every Catholique may lawfully do, notwithstanding that generall saying; That the <hi>Pope hath Iurisdiction over all Christians:</hi> for that is meant, a generall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Catholique Church, either actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or potentiall, extent to all; which is forren to none: and which, by taking this oath is not denyed. I answer thirdly, that all penall lawes (as is this law for taking the oath) in doubtfull words, are ever <hi>to be</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">It is true if the words will beare it and it be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law &amp; lawmaker, but <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicta glossa quae corrumpit contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>; cursed be the Glosse which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Text, &amp; quite perverts the meaning of the law as this doth.

               <p>It may be objected secondly, that the oath must be interpreted according to the intention of the law and lawmaker: for as <hi>Suares</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fly depend: therefore it by any meanes, the will of the lawmaker may be knowne, according to it especially we must understand the words of the law. But the will of the lawmaker is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently knowne concerning this oath, to make it apparently unlawfull for any Catholique to take as appeareth by the words of King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, saying, (in his Premonition <hi>pag.</hi> 9. and in his Apology for the oath, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. and 9.) that by the oath of Allegiance, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to demand of his subjects nothing else, but a profession of that temporall Allegiance and civill obedience, which all subjects, by the law of God and nature, doe owe to their lawfull Prince, &amp;c. <hi>For as the Oath of Supremacie,</hi> (saith he) <hi>was devised for putting a difference betweene Papists and them of our profession.</hi> So was the oath of Allegiance ordained for making a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the civilly obedient Papists and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61533:79"/>
the perverse disciples of the Powder treason; by which words it appeareth that King <hi>Iames</hi> held, both the law and the law maker intended by the oath of Supremacie, to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Papists and Protestants: and that no Papist would take that oath, wherein the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Pope, was intended to be abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the said oath of Supremacie is to be interpreted accordingly, all doubtfulnesse of words set aside; and <hi>consequenter</hi> unlawfull for any Catholique to take.</p>
               <p>To the Major of which Objection; I answer first, granting the same. Secondly with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction; that the intentions of the law and law maker are to bee sought, when they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the law in a truer sense, then the plaine words doe, as they lie; otherwise not, lest it want veritie.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Suarez</hi> I answer, that himselfe saith in the place before cited, that if at any time the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the words of an oath should induce any injustice, or like absurditie, concerning the minde, or meaning of the lawmaker: they must be drawne to a sense, although improper; wherein the law may be just and reasonable: for this is presumed to be the minde of the law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as it hath beene declared by many lawes in <hi>F. tit. de lege.</hi> thus <hi>Suarez.</hi>

               <p>So that although there were in the words of this oath divers significations impropper and unusuall; yet in the opinion of <hi>Suarez,</hi> it might be taken; and the words interpreted in the truest sense, abstracting from the <hi>reall intention

of the law maker:</hi> how much more then (say I) the words being not improper, or unusuall, but according to the intention <hi>of the</hi>

                  <hi>law and law maker,</hi> may they be taken in the more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sence, which may make the law to be just and reasonable? See for this doctrine <hi>Can.

               </p>
               <p>Hence it followeth first out of the doctrine of the said <hi>Suarez,</hi> that although the words and sentences contained in this oath, being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered barely by themselves, and without due circumstances (to wit, the intention of the law and lawmaker, and to what end and purpose the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id oath was framed) may seeme to some doubtfull and ambiguous (although to me they seeme not so) that is, not cleare and morally certaine; and so for one to sweare them in that doubtfull sence, were to expose himselfe to danger of perjurie: yet considering (as I have said) that such doubtfull words, are to be taken in the more favourable sense, and which <hi>maketh the</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">The law is just and reasonable without your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and forged Glosse: for why should not all that enjoy the benefit of his Majesties lawes as well as Protestants, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to his Majesties scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and supreame power over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as well as Protestants, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing the power is the same, which the most religious Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and most Christian Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and divers of his Majesties Predecessors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realme have exercised upon all their subjects.</note> 
                  <hi>law to be just</hi> and reasonable, and to contain no falshood or injustice. If any one sweare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those words, which of themselves are doubtfull, in no doubtfull sense, but in a true and determinate sense, and wherein they are not doubtfull, but cleere and morally certaine, there is no danger <hi>of perjurie at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:61533:80"/>It may seeme to follow secondly out of the aforesaid doctrine, that such as tooke the oath of Supremacie in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth dayes (which rather then those famous and glorious men, Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> and Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> would take, they worthily chose to die) were not to be condemned of perjurie; because it might be supposed, that they being learned Bishops and Noblemen, knowing what belonged to an oath, did draw the same to some improper sense, which ought to have beene the intention of the aforesaid King to make the law just; as if they should have sworne the then King, Head or chiefe of the Church of his countrey; for that he was Sovereigne Lord and ruler of both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Spirituall and Temporall: all sorts being bound to obey his lawfull civill lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. And so in this sense (although it be a kinde of improper speech) every King is Head of the Clergy and all others of his owne Countrey. Or peradventure they might sweare him Supreame Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; that is, Chiefe of the congregation of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers within his dominions: for so in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, we commonly say him, to be the head of a Colledge, Court or Citie, that is the chiefe; and him to be chiefe who is supreame therein. The Church being then taken by all Divines for a congregation of men; Why might not King <hi>Henrie</hi> be improperly sworne (in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Suarez</hi>) Head of the then congregation in <hi>England</hi>? So that what Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and piously refused with relation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61533:81"/>
of the aforesaid King, others might without perjurie take with relation to the law of God (abstracting from all unlawfull intentions) to wit, that every oath be just and reasonable as being to be taken in <hi>Veritie, Iustice and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and so what was unlawfull in a proper sence, might at lest be free from Perjurie in an improper. Thus understanding the first branch; and the second and third in the same sence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delivered, they might peradventure be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused (as I have said) from perjurie; <hi>But never from sinne.</hi> For considering the state of <hi>England</hi> in those dayes, and the absolute intention of the King which (well knowne to the whole world) was; to be sworne <hi>Supreame Head</hi>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61533:81"/>
profession of a mans faith. As when the honour and glory of God, and the spirituall benefit of his neighbour should exact the same. Now when or what greater honour could a man have done to God, then to have stood for the truth of the Gospel, and defence of the Catholike faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so opposed? And in whom could there have beene more edification and greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample given, for simple and unlearned men to follow, then in Bishops and great men of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Neither was it to purpose for them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, that they were in danger of their lives and fortunes; for they were bound to loose both, rather then to denie any one Article of faith. For although I have said, that a man is not bound, with danger of life, or fortunes, to abstaine from a thing lawfull, or of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent (as the going to a Protestant Church in a Protestant Countrey, taking the oath of Alleagiance, or the now oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; every of which is farre enough from an Article of faith, or point of religion; onely more cryed downe, because out of fashion, then out of any grounded reason or judgement) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the scandall of we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61533:82"/>
daies, being a point of religion, and an article of faith, although they might be excused from perjurie, yet never from sinne and scandall. And therefore I conceive that <hi>Suares</hi> onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth that then lawes and oathes invented contrary to the law of God, may be drawne to an improper sence, when scandall may be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with integritie of faith. And so those that tooke the aforesaid Kings oath, I leave to the judgement of God: for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. It is our Lord that judgeth; who best knoweth the rectitude of all mens actions, and the secret intentions of each mans heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of the said objection is denyed. And to the words of K. <hi>Iames</hi> saying: that <hi>as the Oath of Supremacie was devised for putting a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Papists and them of our profession. So was, &amp;c.</hi> I answer that the said King did not by those words, undertake to give an absolute and totall reason, why the said oath was devised, (himselfe not being the deviser or maker there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) but spake according to the effect, which hee saw the oath of Supremacie tooke in his daies: who conceiving that Catholiques held it, not an oath lawfull for them to take (and therefore some in King <hi>Henries</hi> daies refused the same out of conscience; others since the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of Masse and establishment of the Protestant Church, out of scruples, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering either the change of times, or alteration of the Church) conceived likewise a difference to result thereby betweene them and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61533:82"/>
so that the <hi>said</hi>

                  <hi>renowned King did not</hi> intend by the aforesaid words, to make known the intention of the law or lawmaker, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spake what an effect the said devised oath had in Catholiques wrought.</p>
               <p>That neither of the said oathes of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie were framed to put a difference betweene Papists and Protestants is evident by what I have said; for in King <hi>Henrie</hi> his dayes, there were no <hi>Protestants</hi>

And in the said Queens daies, the oath was onely made to give and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her power and authoritie in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or Ecclesiasticall things; thereby (as I have sufficiently said) to propagate and establish the Protestant Church: and to no other end or purpose.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> being thus answered, the consequence appeares naught; and the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion for the lawfulnesse of the oath in force.</p>

And if any did suffer for the same, I pray let him likewise whisper when, or in what yeere, or Kings reign? and then compare his speech to what I have said.

                     <p>Either <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>Moore</hi> were no Martyrs, who died for refusing to take this Oath, or they are no good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists who take it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>Moore</hi> were famous and glorious Martyrs in the opinion of the Romane Church as hath beene prooved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> they who take the Oath of Supremacie are no good Papists.</p>

Fourthly, from the confession of this Priest, <hi>pag.</hi> 118. <hi>The Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie when it was made in the dayes of King</hi> Henry 8. <hi>was unlawfull to be taken by any Catholique:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 119. <hi>If any had sworne the King to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Head of that Church, he would have sworne false, as making the Church a monster having two heads, or depriving the Pope of his authoritie granted him by God.</hi> Whence I thus argue.</p>
                     <p>The Oath of Supremacie prescribed by that Act of Parliament, in the 35. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. was unlawfull to be taken by any Roman Catholique, as this Priest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth.</p>
                     <p>But the Oath of Supremacie prescribed by Act of Parliament in the first of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in force at this day, is the same with the Oath prescribed by Act of Parliament in the 35. of <hi>Henrie</hi> the eighth, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by comparing both the Oathes together, with a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi> in an Act the fifth of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for expounding this Oath, where it is said: <hi>That we confesse and acknowledge in her Maiestie, her Heires and Successours, no other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, then that which was challenged, and lately used by the noble King</hi> Henrie <hi>the eighth, and King</hi> Edward <hi>the sixth:</hi> as in the Admonition to the Qeenes Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions more plainly appeares. <hi>The Queenes Maiestie would that all her loving subiects should understand that nothing was, is, or shall be meant, or intended by the same Oath, to have any other Dutie, Allegiance, or Bond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the same Oath, then was acknowledged to be due to the most noble King of famous memorie, King</hi> Henrie <hi>the eighth her Maiesties father, or King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>the sixt, her Maiesties brother.</hi>

                     <p>I conclude therefore, <hi>super tota materia</hi> that the taking of the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, is an abrenunciation of the Romish faith, and consequently, that we wrong no Papist that takes the Oath, if we <hi>beleeve him a forswearer who forsweares his beliefe.</hi>
