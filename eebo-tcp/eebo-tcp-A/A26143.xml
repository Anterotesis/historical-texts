            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Lord Russel's
INNOCENCY
Further DEFENDED, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere is a Pamphlet very lately published, which
stiles it self, <hi>The Magistracy and Government of</hi>
England <hi>Vindicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears by the following part of the Title,
to be no less than <hi>A Justification of the Proceedings against
Criminals;</hi> impudently declaring in plain and express words,
as also by all his subsequent Discourse, That by the <hi>Criminal</hi>
he means the late Lord <hi>Russel. Page 2. Column</hi> 2. in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of it.</p>
            <p>And the Author does professedly own, that the Book is
written by way of Answer to a small Discourse or Argument
lately printed, which bears the Title of <hi>A Defence of the late
Lord</hi> Russel'<hi>s Innocency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It argues a transcendent boldness in this Answerer, to call
this Noble Lord a <hi>Criminal,</hi> and to justifie those Proceedings
against him, which all honest men ever accounted no less than
Murther, under a pretence and colour of a legal Proceeding,
and to presume to publish such a Discourse as this, after the
King and the two Houses of Parliament have, by the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Judgment that can be given, pronounced that Noble
Lord to have been Innocent; and thereby have done so great
Right to his Memory, and that with so high a Zeal, and so
mighty a Concernment for him, as the like cannot be shewn
in former Precedents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98276:3"/>
It is most evident, that the Author was composing this
Scandalous Libel even when he very well knew the Bill was
brought down from the Lords to the Commons, for reversing
this Noble Lord's Attainder; and the Author could not but
observe with what Zeal and Affection the Bill was entertain'd
at its first enterance into that House.</p>
            <p>The Author, by endeavouring to conceal himself, is from
thence, as he plainly professes, encouraged to take the more
liberty to lay about him in the dark (as he fancies) and
thinks to escape <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nseen; and not only strikes at the Author
of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defence, but as far as in him lies, wounds
that Noble Lord in his Honour, whose Justification and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
was so undertaken, and labours to overthrow that
Right and Justice that hath been done by the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>This is no way agreeable to a noble and generous soul, to
come behind a man and strike him; it rather follows the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of that devilish Powder-Plot, to destroy and blow up
the King and both Houses, and to do it in such a close and
clandestine way, <hi>as it should not be known who hurt them:</hi>
for he was too much a Coward to set his Name to it.</p>
            <p>But it is very easie to tell you what are the first Letters of
this Author's Name, without casting of a Figure. His Argument
in Law plainly speaks his Profession, and what Robe he wears:
and his stile and phrase of speaking, having appear'd in so
many noted Tryals, as do in so many visible and legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
disclose the Author, Sir <hi>R. S.</hi> does under his hand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
and utterly disclaim it; and is heartily believ'd in what
he says.</p>
            <p>This slanderous Author acknowledges, that upon the Lord
<hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal some blamed the Jury, most censured the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
but very few arraigned the <hi>Council</hi> or Court. Here it
evidently appears how our Author is concerned: first for
the Council, and then the Court, and <hi>Self</hi> hath the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
though it be here with a breach of good manners to
name the Council before the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page the first,</hi> he takes it heinously that any Gentlemen of
the Long Robe should appear in Print to Riducle their own
Profession, this grosly speaks our Author one that was of
Councel in the Tryal. <hi>Et tu Brute?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98276:3"/>
If it had been an open Enemy, a Doctor of the Commons
excersing his Wit and Raillery on the Common Law Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
then (as he expresses himself) this Author could
have born it; but he did not imagine that Satyrs and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
upon past Proceedings should be writ by Lawyers.</p>
            <p>In reply to which it may be justly said, That when Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
will make use of their Wit and Rhetorick, as this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
has done, to boulster up an unjust and revengeful
Proceeding, and out of ambitious Designs, to get or continue
in Favour, and to gain greater Preferment, or shew their
Parts, will engage in Causes of Blood, and help to destroy the
Innocent, and be instrumental in subverting the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it is every Lawyers Duty as far as in him lies, to
vindicate the Profession, by utterly disclaiming and abhorring
all such Practices: And the Defender can appeal to all that
have known his Conversation for above this forty years and
under, whether ever he used any such pitiful mean and unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Arts and Methods, better becoming the Stage than a
Court of Justice; and whether he did not, when it was in his
power, constantly restrain and condemn that scandalous and
disgraceful way of Practice. And he can as freely appeal to
all that will be at the pains to Read his Printed Argument
(which this conceal'd Author so unjustly Censures) whether
any such bitter Reviling, and revengeful Humour, appear in
any part of what he so publish'd, or the least reflecting upon
any particular person, but only in the general, and no further
than the meer Justice of the Cause did extort from him; so
far was he from this Author's scurrilous and rude course of
reflecting upon any Persons private Conversation; but some
mens faculties lie this way, and they are very well known,
tho' after such manifest and gross provocations that have been
given by this Author, and such publick and scandalous Actings
of his in the eye of the World, it might justly be said with
the Poet:
<q>Difficile est Satyr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s non Scribere.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of this Answer, in his first Paragraph, would
have the World believe that he writes upon no other design
than to <hi>support Magistracy,</hi> and the <hi>Government; a Noble Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>


               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98276:4"/>
(as he terms it). Every Man knows what sort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he labour'd to support, but the other day, and how far
he was instrumental in it; but the other day, and how far
he was instrumental in it; but it is rather thought fit to leave
him to a General Act of Indemnity and Oblivion, then take
any Revenge upon him.</p>
            <p>He seems to allow the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender, in his Fourth
Paragraph, to be an Author of Age, Experience, Figure, and
Learning, (but he will not say Candour or Honesty). Thus
he writes.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender is very glad he hath so little of
this Adversary's Commendation, for it would gain but small
esteem amongst Men of true worth, to be commended by
him. It might be said to him with the Philosopher upon the
like occasion, being commended by an infamous person, <hi>What
Ill have I done, that thou shouldst thus Commend me?</hi> Yet that
Candour and Honesty, which he covertly refuses to allow, is
that which the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender prefers before all this
Answerer's mercenary Wit and Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>In his fifth Paragraph he judges the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
to fall under the Accusation of Treason, and says that
Noble Lord was most pitied, of any under those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>That Noble Lord's misfortune (among other things)
was his falling under the lash of so bitter and sharp a Tongue
as yours,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> who however you seem now to mention that Lord
with pity, had then no pity for him, but used him with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as may appear by your own Printed Narrative of that
Tryal, and your Rhetorical Flourishes in a Case of innocent
Bloud, which contributed in an high degree to enveagle the
Jury, and bring that Noble Lord to the Scaffold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He confidently says in the same Paragraph, that</hi> in truth the
fairness and indifferency of that Tryal was such, that his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were pleased.</p>
            <p>How untrue this is,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> in both the parts of it, that the
Tryal was very far from being Fair and Indifferent, and that
his nearest Relations were highly exasperated and offended,
shall appear before we part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Sixth Paragraph of his sheet, he complains that</hi> the
memory of that Vnfortunate Gentleman, was revived by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the Defence of his Innocency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98276:4"/>
Why what hurt in the reviving of his Memory? his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is precious, he dyed a Martyr for his Religion, and
for the Rights and Liberties of his Countrey, and fell a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
under cruel and merciless hands.</p>
            <p>It is indeed this Answerers Conscience that flies in his
face, the reviving of this Noble Lords Memory speaks Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and Amazement to the Answerer. Thus did bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Herod</hi> when he heard of the Fame of Jesus, he presently
cryes out, <hi>This is</hi> John <hi>whom I Beheaded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He does prepare himself to make use of <hi>indecent or
disrespectful Language,</hi> (as himself expresses it) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
himself with the thought, that his Name shall not be
known. A pitiful and unmanly dealing, not becoming a
person pretending to Ingenuity. The Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
dealt otherwise, and owns his Name, and will let
the world know what this Answerer is.</p>
            <p>In the four next ensuing Paragraphs, he is much to seek
for what end and purpose the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defence was
Printed in that Pamphlet (as his wonted Rhetorick thinks fit
to call it.)</p>
            <p>It could not be (as he most contemptuously says) for
Consumption of Paper.</p>
            <p>Nor for the Bookseller's Profit, for a Reason to be guess'd
at.</p>
            <p>Forbear, for shame, to use these sly and silly Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they are fitter for School-boys, or the Mountebank's
Stage, or for <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> than for a Man of your Figure,
one may be ashamed to have any Dispute with such an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick,
or rather a jesting and jeering Merry-Andrew.
Pray keep this Sport for the next <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair, and
learn more Gravity and Civility.</p>
            <p>It could not be (as he further proceeds upon the same
Enquiry) for the sake of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Memory, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his surviving Relations; for what was written in the
Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defence, is (says he) but a painting to the
Life, the too deep Concern of that Noble Lord, in a
weak as well as criminal Enterprize.</p>
            <p>This is wonderful boldness and daring in this <hi>Answerer,</hi>
still to pronounce him a Criminal (that Noble Lord)


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98276:5"/>
whom the Supream Power of the Nation, and the highest
Judicature and Authority have adjudged Innocent. And
yet he has the Impudence to entitle his undutiful Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
<hi>The Magistracy and Government of</hi> England <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi>
And to Publish this, after he, as well as any Man
knew that the Act of Parliament had pass'd, asserting the
Innocency of that Noble Lord, and the Barbarity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
of the Proceedings against him. Wherein this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer</hi>
had so great an Hand, and so bitter and sharp a
Tongue.</p>
            <p>One would think that an ordinary Wit might have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to put him in mind, that as yet there is no Act of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pardon and Indemnity pass'd, And who knows upon
whom the great Exception may light?</p>
            <p>But he gives a very just occasion to the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
to let the World know for what end and purpose
he long since writ, and so lately Printed so despised a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet;
by which, even his Adversary may be convinc'd,
it was not meerly for Consumption of Paper, or for the
Bookseller's Profit, but truly for the sake of that Lord's
Memory, in asserting his Innocency, and at the desire, and
for the sake of his surviving Relations. And for the truth
of what is thus affirm'd, he does appeal to those Noble
Relations of his, who are yet alive.</p>
            <p>While that Noble Lord was upon his Tryal, or very
soon after, there came a <hi>Letter</hi> to his Defender's hand,
who was then in the Countrey; near Eighty Miles from
<hi>London,</hi> and this from a person of great Honour, and one
of the nearest Relation to that Noble Lord, requesting
the Author of his Defence to afford the best Advice he
could; and accordingly he heartily and freely gave it:
Much of which does appear by what is Printed by
him.</p>
            <p>This was not the only <hi>Letter</hi> he receiv'd from that
Lord's great Relations, upon that sad occasion: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that bloudy stroke had been given, a Paper was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
as the Speech intended by that Dying Lord.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which, the now <hi>Answerer</hi> and Adversary (as
is too evident) did publish his first Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>An


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98276:5"/>
Antidote against Poyson,</hi> composed (to use its own words)
of some Remarks upon the Paper printed by the direction
of the Lady <hi>Russel,</hi> and mentioned to have been delivered
by the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> to the Sheriffs at the place of Execution.
Thus far of the Title of that pretended <hi>Antidote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter end of his second <hi>Page,</hi> that which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Discourse out of his Pamphlet call'd the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote,</hi>
and which is barely repeated in order to be answer'd
and confuted, he grosly mistakes in this latter Pamphlet,
and falsely affirms, it is admitted to be true; and from
thence endeavours to have the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
as arguing against the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
his guilt: Which is a very unworthy way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this pretended <hi>Answerer,</hi> but easily discern'd by any
wary and intelligent Reader. Nay, this <hi>Answerer</hi> himself
immediately after, before he is aware, clears the Lord <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>'s
Defender again from the Imputation, by taking notice
that the Defender of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> endeavours to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the Credibility of the Evidence given against the Lord
<hi>Russel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reply declines the taking notice of many of this
Answerer's Paragraphs, that are spent meerly in vilifying
the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender, it being obvious that they
were intended onely to render mean and contemptible
the person he undertakes to answer; it being beneath this
<hi>Reply</hi> to repeat them, and to follow the <hi>Answerer</hi> in his
rude and scurrilous way of writing.</p>
            <p>It was indeed no Secret to the Learned, that a Variance
between the Indictment and the Evidence, might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
on the <hi>General Issue;</hi> nor that <hi>Treason</hi> and the
<hi>Misprision</hi> of it are different Crimes; nor that proofs of
Treason must not be by Hearsay nor Argument only; nor
that less than two Witnesses are not to be allow'd for proof
of that Crime; nor that the Witnesses ought to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But these are not so generally known to such as are
not profess'd Lawyers; and may be usefully remembred
to such as are brought upon their Tryals for their Lives,
and are denied the help of Councel when they most need
it, and are apt to be more under a consternation, when


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98276:6"/>
they are beset with such sad apprehensions of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and baited at by a multitude of crafty Wits, and such
as abuse their Parts and Eloquence, to destroy the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and the Court (it may be) not always so indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
as they should be. And these useful and well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Assistances, as ordinary and useless as the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Answerer</hi> would represent them, were very thankfully
entertain'd, and made use of by several persons of great
Abilities, and of the best Quality, who afterwards fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the like cruel and malicious Prosecution: but they
were no profess'd <hi>Lawyers.</hi> And most of these are still
living, and will and do testifie the truth hereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Answerer</hi> in his fourth <hi>Page</hi> falls to argue the points
in Law upon the great Head and Title of Treason.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Reply</hi> forbears to repeat what the <hi>Answerer</hi> says up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this subject, or to repeat what this <hi>Repliant</hi> has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
printed, but therein refers himself to what is so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Only finds it necessary to state the point in question in
as few and plain words as he can, and leave it to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reader to judge of it.</p>
            <p>The great Statute of Treason, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the 25th
of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was the only Statute upon which the Lord
<hi>Russel</hi> was indicted, and this is acknowledg'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
by the <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> as appears by the printed
Narrative of the Tryal, and he could best know his own
meaning.</p>
            <p>They could not proceed against the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> upon
the late Statute of Treasons, made in 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. for that
Statute limits the Prosecution to a certain time, after the
Treason committed; which was elaps'd in the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s
Case.</p>
            <p>Now the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. does specifie and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
the several and particular Heads, and Sorts, or
Species of Treason, that might be proceeded upon, or
tryed and adjudged in the ordinary Courts, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
<hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> or Judges of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> or Gaol-delivery.
Such as that of <hi>Newgate,</hi> or the Sessions for
Gaol-delivery at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> where the Noble Lord
<hi>Russel</hi> was brought to his Tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98276:6"/>
The scope and drift of that Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. (as
appears by the Preamble) was to confine those ordinary
Courts and the ordinary Judges to plain manifest Rules,
what they should adjudge Treason, and what not, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so great Concernment to the lives of Men; and not
to allow the Judges or Lawyers a latitude or liberty to
make what they thought fit to be Treason, or to exercise
the Tongues and unruly Noises of <hi>Lawyers</hi> in a matter of
that moment. And that Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. being in
its nature a confining, restraining, and explanatory <hi>Law,</hi>
ought therefore not to be largely extended or improv'd
and stretched beyond the plain words and apparent sence
of them.</p>
            <p>Now among other several Species, or Heads, or sorts of
Treason, particularly enumerated by that Statute, there are
these two, pertinent to our Case, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Compassing or Imagining the Death of the King.</item>
                  <item>2. Levying War against the King.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the common Reader (for whose satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
this is written) may easily observe this distinction,
That the first of these is Treason (in the very imagining
or conspiring) though the King's Death do not ensue.</p>
            <p>But the latter is not Treason in the conspiring and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
but the Treason must be in the actual levying of
War.</p>
            <p>So that barely to consult, conspire, or imagine to levy
War, though there be never so plain nor so open or overt
an act of such consulting or conspiring or imagining of it,
will not amount to this Species or sort of Treason, upon this
Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which is the only Statute upon which
the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was concern'd.</p>
            <p>For that Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. did not intend to make
it Treason, to consult or conspire to levy War, without the
actual levying of War.</p>
            <p>This will not be denied nor disputed by the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s
Adversaries, nor by this <hi>Answerer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98276:7"/>
But perfectly to evade this Statute, and the manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and meaning of it, they insist,</p>
            <p>That though conspiring to levy War, be not Treason
within the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. yet to conspire, consult,
agree, or conclude to stir up, or raise, or move Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Rebellion against the King, and to consult or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
to seize the King's Guards, (which signifie one and
the same thing with consulting or conspiring to levy War)
these (say they) may be an open or overt Act, to prove
a consulting or conspiring to kill the King.</p>
            <p>What is this but to confound the several and distinct
sorts and Species of Treasons, which the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
doth so carefully and industriously labour to distinguish?</p>
            <p>And what is this, but to make a bare conspiring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
to levy War, without any actual levying of it, to
be Treason within this Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Statute would not have to be so taken? and so the
good design and scope of the Statute, the security of mens
lives is wholly overthrown by this Artifice; and what shall
be taken to be Treason, and what not, will be still as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
as it was before the making of that <hi>Act</hi> of 25
<hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And it was then a needless idle thing in those that made
the Statute of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and so of former Statutes, to
make the conspiring to levy War to be Treason: for by
this practice and construction it is already made so to their
hands, by 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was Indicted for Conspiring to
kill King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the overt or open <hi>Act</hi>
alledg'd to show and signifie it, is nothing but his consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and conspiring to raise and stir up Insurrection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and consulting to seize the King's Guards, (though
they were not actually done) which are just the same
thing with conspiring to levy War; which plainly is no
Treason within the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and therefore
most clearly the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was not guilty within that
Statute, upon that Indictment and Evidence.</p>
            <p>Since the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender has compos'd this
short State of his Case upon this great point, there hath come


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98276:7"/>
to his hands, a printed half sheet, which has excellently well
done the same work, which had been but a few hours
sooner, it had saved the labour of this part of the present
Discourse and Argument: This half sheet is justly entitled ,
<hi>A Justification of the late Act of Parliament, for the
Reversing the Judgment against the Lord</hi> Russel.</p>
            <p>There is but one Point more to speak to, and then the
Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Defender will bid his <hi>Answerer</hi> and Reader
Adieu: And it is that Point which the <hi>Answerer</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

and so no occasion was given then to consider of it; but
it is largely debated by Court and Council, at the Lord
<hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal; yet being then but suddenly started, tho it
were well argued by the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Councel assign'd, no
Authorities however were then cited (thô call'd for by the
Court) to justifie and make good the Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is a point in Law
which the Act for Reversing the Judgment against the
Lord <hi>Russel</hi> is principally, and in the first place grounded
upon, <hi>viz.</hi> That there had been an undone and illegal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of
of Jurors to Try that Noble Lord (too often practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of late) and that the Noble Lord was refus'd his Lawful
Challenge to them for want of Freehold. The truth
of this as to matter of Fact, doth evidently appear by the
large Narrative of the Tryal, Printed by that Lord's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries;
and this is not in the least touched upon by the
printed half sheet, stiled, <hi>A that of the Act for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal

            </p>

               </gap>ie that Freehold was, or is to be, but
some Freehold (thô never so small) the Jurors ought to
have, or else it was a just cause of Challenge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98276:8"/>
It was indeed the Statute of 2 <hi>H. 5. C.</hi> 3. that first <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate
the yearly value of the Freehold, and requir'd it should be
of 40 <hi>s. per Annum,</hi> which 40 <hi>s. per Annum</hi> was then in
that King's Reign, being so long since, equivalent to a much
higher Value now.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Books and Authorities that speak of
Freehold of a less Value then 40 <hi>s. per Annum,</hi> must of
necessity be understood not to speak of Cases within that
Statute, but of Cases at the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>fol.</hi>
648. It is there held, that Freehold of any value was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for a Juror. This proves that Freehold is requisite,
and that it was so before the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. it being in
the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth's Father; and with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<hi>Kelloway, fol.</hi> 46. towards the end.</p>
            <p>Some other Cases after the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth,
proves the same, as 16 <hi>E. 4. fol.</hi> 8. half an Acre of Land,
so it be within the Hundred, says that Book, is sufficient,
and it is well known, that as to this qualification of having
Freehold, the same Rule governs in the rest of the Jurors,
as in those of the Hundred, 10 <hi>H. 6. Brookes Abridgement,
Challenge 192. Hales</hi>'s <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> 260.</p>
            <p>Nor do these Authorities distinguish at all between
Cases criminal and civil, nor in Cases criminal between that
of Treason and in Cases less criminal.</p>
            <p>This being so at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and the Statute of
2 <hi>H. 5. c.</hi> 3. only adding the yearly value, <hi>viz. 40 s.
per Annum</hi> Freehold, which before at the <hi>Common Law,</hi>
might be of any lower value. Now tho that Statute of
2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. be Repeal'd, as to Tryals in Treason, as in truth it
is by the latter Statute of 2 and 3 of <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Mary, cap.</hi>
10. which Enacts that all Tryals in Treason, shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the course of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> the result is, that
still there must be Freeholders to Try, thô they may be
Freeholders as at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> of any yearly value
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>That the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. (while it was in force) did

            <p>See Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi>'s Case, Justice <hi>Croke, 37 Eliz.
fol.</hi> 413. In an Information of Intrusion, by the Queen:
a Juror was challenged for want of Freehold, and upon
Examination of the Juror, it appear'd he had Freehold of

which admits it had been a good cause of Challenge, had
there been no Freehold at all; and it necessarily implies
that it was requir'd by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> for no Statute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed,
as to any lower value than 40 <hi>s. per Annum.</hi>
Nor does this Case distinguish between the Case of Intrusion
upon the Queen, and any other Case.</p>
            <p>But it may reasonably be argued, if Freehold be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in a Juror, who is to try a Case of Intrusion only, a
<hi>Fortiori,</hi> is it requisite in a Case of High-Treason, but in
that Case of Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> another Juror was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
that had no Freehold, and he was therefore set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>
            <p>Now that the Challenge for want of Freehold extends
to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Cities and Burroughs,
as well as to the Counties, is abundantly proved by the
Statutes of 11 <hi>H. 6. c. 1. 7. H. 7. c.</hi> 5. and 23 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 13.
to which the Reader for brevity-sake is referred.</p>
            <p>It is no where maintain'd that an agreement to Poyson
or Stab, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no Treason, if the very Act do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
as the <hi>Answerer</hi> very falsly alledges in the Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of his 6th Page, towards the lower end; for those
have a manifest tendency towards killing, nor are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
distinct species or sorts, or kinds of Treason from the
killing of the King, as that of Levying of War, and sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
the King's Guards (especially not shewing what Guards)
are a distinct species from that of killing the King, and need
not necessarily be understood to terminate and conclude in


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98276:9"/>
a killing the King, taking the King Prisoner, or seizing his
Person, may more reasonably be thought to aim at a killing
of the King, or have a tendency towards it.</p>
            <p>And the Indictment ought surely to have declar'd and
express'd clearly and plainly what Guards were meant,
there being variety of Guards; for every Indictment
ought to contain certainty.</p>
            <p>Herein the very Indictment was faulty.</p>
            <p>The bold <hi>Answerer</hi> hopes the King will always preserve
those Guards, thô the Parliament have declar'd their sense
to the contrary, when the present extraordinary occasion
shall be over.</p>
            <p>This daring presumptuous <hi>Answerer</hi> in defiance of the
Act for Reversal of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Attainder, the Tryal
having been partial, unjust, and illegal, as the <hi>Act</hi> affirms
it, yet dares to averr in his last Page that there was Evidence
enough to justifie all concerned in the Prosecution and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Answerer,</hi> towards his close, takes great care, and is
much concern'd to justifie the King's Sollicitor that then
was.</p>
            <p>And this would encline one to think that the then
King's Sollicitor was not the Author of that <hi>Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Poyson;</hi> nor of this last Print, entituled, <hi>The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
and Government Vindicated;</hi> which are so much alike
in their stile and strain. And in truth that late King's Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor
doth utterly deny that he had any hand in either of
them. And Sir <hi>George Jeffries,</hi> the last Lord Chancellor,
could not compose this last. This being so, it may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be judg'd where it must fix: for this, look into the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Tryal.</p>
            <p>I now refer the <hi>Answerer</hi> to justifie himself at Law, if
he happen to be in danger of an Exception out of an <hi>Act</hi>
of General Pardon and Indemnity, where he may have a
fairer opportunity to defend himself in his own more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Concern for endeavouring to subvert the Law,
which ever proves too hard for all its Opposers. And I
will so far follow his Humour and Vein, as to conclude
with Verses too.</p>
