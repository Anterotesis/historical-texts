            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Site no lesse me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morably

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6652:10"/>
sometimes dwelled one <hi>Audrogeus,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of approved esteeme: having borne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

wherein he ever demeaned himselfe

him an honour and ornament to his

one <hi>Euryclea,</hi> of good descent: a woman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
endowed with many choice and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
vertues: so as, those exquisite parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she was graced, expressed to her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
the native worth of that family, from
whence shee descended. These two, amongst
other worldly blessings, wherewith Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had singularly enriched them, were
made happy in an hopefull progeny. And of

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se, in a vertuous, discreet and religious
Daughter called <hi>Doriclea;</hi> one, whose fame
admitted no blemish; whom as Nature had
beautified with many extraordinary graces,
so her carefull Parents were no lesse ready to
adorne those native se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, with such Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as might accomplish those promising be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.
For which purpose, They provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her of such Masters, as might fit her in all
generous Sciences. One for musicke, dancing,
and a proper or gracefull posture; another for
her Needle; another for knowledge of the
Tongues. Nothing was awanting her that
might conferre the least light or lustre to so
faire and well-composed a temper. Nor was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6652:10"/>
shee lesse apt to receive, nor firme to reteine
whatsoever was taught her. For she was of a
docile and industrious disposition: affecting
nothing more then to learne, nor distasting
anything more then to glory in ought that she
had perfectly learned.</p>
               <p>Nor was it strange that so much care or
cost should bee bestowed upon her: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
she was the onely daughter, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the darling of her Mother. One, in
whom she treasured many faire hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for
whose future preferment she inlarged a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
care. For high were the aymes at which
they levelled her Fortunes: being as curious
in their choice, as shee in her prime flower
of youth resolute, never to exchange her
estate.</p>
               <p>Her desires were confin'd to an harmelesse
ambition of knowledge: she measured no day
without a <hi>line:</hi> bestowing so well the Lampe
of her life, as she was ever casting forth some
<hi>light</hi> or other to inlarge the <hi>Prospect</hi> of her
<hi>inner house.</hi> For the highest pitch of her emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was, in a pious imitation of such as had
descended from her house, to accommodate
her more knowing abilities. In a faire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of that noble Roman Virgin,
who made this her resolution: <q>That her
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> should manifest to the
world, that shee was the true Daughter of
such Parents: and that her house received
no derogation from her, from which shee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6652:11"/>
had her beginning.</q> Truth is, her Family,
as it was worthily to be ranked with the best:
so had it brought forth many eminent scienes,
whose thriving plantation had conferr'd
much honour on their Nation. Amongst
which ONE, who though he seemed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Favorite to all youthfull pleasures; and
as sociable in his waies, and pleasantly discur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
as if he had beene a downe-right Agent
of the time, preferring his pleasures before
any other private mentall employment: yet
did it appeare unto the world, that he en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oy'd
more divine parts then a vulgar judgement
could either judge or take notice of. For
sundry excellent Workes tasting both of
Lampe and Judgement were by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
though under an others name publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
which expressed the ability of his pen,
and the affected privacy of his mind.</p>
               <p>Nor could shee reflect upon the excellence
of their parts who had derived their prime
beginnings from her House: but out of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
emulation shee held it a derivative
duty to imitate them: though not in such
exactnesse as might seeme to equall their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
yet in a well disposed Zeale to fit her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with the best accommodations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
she could, to draw neare them in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to bee doubted, but native seedes
and sprinklings of goodnesse propagate
themselves to posterity: and beget in their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6652:11"/>
successors not onely a desire, but ability to
imitate and retaine, what their Predecessors
in their commendable lives exprest. For
though <hi>Wit</hi> nor <hi>Learning</hi> be no feffements of
<hi>Fortune:</hi> yet shall we finde in the posterity of
prompt and pregnant Parents, most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resemblances of that quicknesse and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse
in their children, which being secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by
constant and continued desires to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
whatsoever they see worthily observed, or

               <p>Never did Nature bestow her gifts in an

streamed them upon those noble Roman Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
<hi>Cornelia, Aurelia. Lelia, Paula, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,

were their endowments: full of genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
worth their naturall ornaments; yet had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6652:12"/>
all these lost much of their beauty, had they
rested so and derived from Art no lustre to
accomplish that beauty.</p>
               <p>This moved the Parents of those vertuous
Matrons, to ripen these seedes which <hi>Nature</hi>
had so freely bestowed, with these gracefull
beamelings of <hi>Art,</hi> to perfect that which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
had planted, and accomplish what so
loving a mother had moulded.</p>
               <p>Never had that brave <hi>Berenice</hi> wonne so
much ground, nor gain'd such command in
the eye of her beholder; Neither had that

Nor that love-attracting <hi>Cleopatra</hi> sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigniz'd
so much upon such princely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders:
had not something more then the
gifts of <hi>Nature</hi> accompanied them. These, as
they had a sufficient portion of beauty to take
the Sense: so had their <hi>Education</hi> so exactly
polished those outward parts, as they wrought
strangely upon the Conceit. For to be seene
in Musicke; to expresse a singular grace in the
Carriage of a dance; to discourse with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected

surreptitious Conceit of any forraigne fancy
to seaze on their enamoured brests: having
made such a vertuous and divine <hi>Choice,</hi> as
it were impiety to dreame of a <hi>Change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were the principall motives which
induced <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Euryclea,</hi> the tender
Parents of <hi>Doryclea,</hi> to provide for her such
Masters as might accomplish her by their
Principles of breeding, in such distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
as might best suit with her condition;
and expresse her with most winning grace in
the sight of such with whom shee consor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Nor were these, to whose direction shee
was committed, more serious in teaching,
nor exact in practising, then shee was quicke
in receiving, and firme in reteyning.</p>
               <p>For her <hi>Muslcuke,</hi> though naturally shee
stood not affected to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being rather addicted
to retyrednesse and privacy; yet seeing it was
her Parents desire, she declined from her owne
will, to satisfie their command to whom shee
ought herselfe. And herein shee grew such a
proficient, as none with more varietie and
lesse affectation ever wrought upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Yet would she never bee moved to discover
her perfection in this kinde, in any publicke
place: so farre she was from ostentation, and
so humbly affected, as whereinsoever shee was
praised, shee imputed it to an over esteeme of
their opinion who praised her; reteyning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6652:13"/>
ever that modest conceit, or rather disesteeme
of her owne abilities, as ever redounded more
to her honour.</p>
               <p>To repeate sundry Cantzonets and enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
measures composed by herselfe (were it
not too digressive from the Scope and Object
of our Historie) I should here addresse my
penne: But my ayme shall be rather briefly to
shadow, then to draw out to the full body the
presentment of so excellent a piece.</p>
               <p>Howsoever, those who were of judgement
have confirm'd thus much for her: That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was instrument married to voyce with
more harmony, then it was, when exercis'd
by <hi>Doriclea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was shee lesse gracefull in her <hi>Posture</hi>
or <hi>Carriage:</hi> retayning such a modest-virgin
state; as those who observed her, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taxe her of scorne, nor of too carelesse
neglect. Affable she could be without being
childish: and keepe her distance without
arrogance. Never could there appeare more
gracefull state in a more humble heart: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
ever rather to serve others in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
designes, then to observe others ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
her praise for her deserts. Neither was
she so carried away with these, as to forget
what might better sort with her quality, and

               <p>For her <hi>Needle,</hi> she made <hi>Dorcas</hi> her Pattern:
she was ever tasking herselfe to some worke or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6652:14"/>
other: wherein she made Charity her object,
by preparing for the naked a Cover.</p>
               <p>Lastly, for <hi>knowledge in Tongues</hi> (though
most men be of opinion that one is enough for
any woman) she profited so exceedingly, as
she reteyned the very accent and sound with
such propriety, as she became more easily to
be admired then imitated; and herein more
admired, by how much her Elocution was
free, native and unaffected.</p>
               <p>Thus in all these became <hi>Doriclea</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
proficient: so that, as she brought
with her into the world an excellent disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in affecting what was good and meriting
applause: so had the improvement of her <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation</hi>
so accomplish'd her, as no expression

               <p>This wee see exemplified
in every Creature, who out of a tender-native

               <p>Which Care extends and dilates it selfe

so are they more apprehensive of the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their owne by course of Nature.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed what that Divine Morall
sometimes observed, farre more certaine is

a Parents <hi>care</hi> then the <hi>share</hi> of his <hi>Comfort;</hi>
yet, so delightfull is the constancy of this
care, being directed to them, and for their

that their <hi>Care</hi> becomes a <hi>Solace,</hi> their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Providence</hi> a cheerefull <hi>Expence</hi> of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
choice and select houres for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their owne.</p>
               <p>This induced the Carefull Parents of our
accomplished <hi>Doriclea,</hi> to bestow their best
endeavours in providing a Convenient match
for their Daughter; in whom they had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
so rich hopes, as her reverend feare and
filiall obedience promised nothing lesse then
much comfort to their age, from those prime
expressions of her youth. Neither were the
favourites of her fame (mounted on the wings
of vertue) lesse slow in performing those
faire Offices which so excellent a Creature
merited. For as her irreproveable demeanure,
reteined ever amongst her familiars, passages
highly conducing to her honour: So those,
who knew her not but by report, retained no
lesse strength nor vigour of desire to court
so incomparable a Mistris, whom the fame of
her vertues with other personall indowments
had so fairely displayed.</p>
               <p>Beauty, said the antient Lyricke, could not
want Corrivals: but when <hi>Vertue</hi> presents
herselfe to make the house beautifull through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
it cannot but attract many Surveyers. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the judgements of men become so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6652:15"/>
deluded and distracted, as that young
debaucht Gallants was, who could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the presence of his Mistris because shee
was vertuous.</p>
               <p>But pure and refined judgements who make
their Choice not wholly by the outward
semblance, or that skinne-deepe beauty, which
the winter of age no sooner rivels, then shee
surrenders her glory: but by those inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which would make <hi>Zenophanes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be a wooer: fixe mainely upon that
which makes fancy truly happy. And both
these might a stayd affection finde stored and
treasured in <hi>Doriclea:</hi> Being such an one,
as to describe her truely, she was faire without
art, and in that native beauty, reteyned such
a winning favour, as she did nothing but what
did infinitely become her. Tall she was not,
but of that equall stature, as her well-tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
proportion could neither taxe her of too
much, nor accuse Nature of taking her measure
too little. To use Hyperboles, I hate it: yea,
and in so exquisite a Subiect, as the spreading
fame of her owne actions might seeme Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles
unto others, holding themselves so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to aspire to such perfections: or too farre
short to reteine the least hope of seconding
them in any proportionable measure of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>But howsoever, the carefull Parents of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi>
aymed at nothing more then to bestow
her on some person of quality, that in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6652:16"/>
line of love and merit their affections
might close: and make every day sound like
a marriage day in the joynt Correspondence
of their affectionate Choice: <hi>Doriclea,</hi> ever
indowed with a native modesty, pretended
to her Parents the tendernesse of her youth,
or her indisposition to health, purposely to
protract time: whereas, indeed, it was the
aversenesse of her mind from a marryed life:
desiring rather under the tender tuition
of her Parents to bestow her youth,
then to fix her fancy on any. For that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
affection shee reteyned to privacy (as
I formerly told you) rebaited the heate of
Loves assaults. Neither did she desire without
much instancy to frequent any publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
but rather to exercise her mind in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or discoursing with some of her intimate
acquaintance; with whom she lived and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
in such sweet and familiar manner,
as their delightfull Society estrang'd her
thoughts from the thought of a Lover. But her
Parents, ever harping upon one string; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
all this aversenesse and declining of
hers to a modest bashfull shame, which would
in time weare out, and set a better face upon
the proffers of Love. And sometimes they
would not stick privately to take their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under-hand advising her to entertaine a
Fortune whilest it was tendered; and how it
was their sole Care that she might bee advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and preferred to her liking. How they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6652:16"/>
grew old, and to leave her to the wide World,
could not chuse but perplex them. Then
would they nominate divers young gentlemen,
whose estates and descents might deserve her
entertainement. But no Rhetorick could bee
more dissorting or discording to her eare. The
discourse of a Nuptiall rite was so disrelishing
a note, as there was no ayre she affected lesse;
apprehending such content in her present vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
state, as to live and dye ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in, she desired
nothing more.</p>
               <p>But this must not serve her turne; privacy
must give way to fancy: a retyred Lawne to a
discourse of Love. By her Mothers provident
Care, she must learn to study the care of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Otherwise, this estranging her thoughts
from giving way to fancy, will be interpreted
a peevish kinde of pertinacy.</p>
               <p>Suppose her then rather out of an enforced
direction, then any freebred affection, entring
parley with a Suitor; whose quality how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
it suted or sorted with her dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>But neither did the Parents of <hi>Doriclea</hi>
stand so much ingaged to any wordly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as it had power to attract their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to it; nor was <hi>Doriclea</hi> so earthly-bred,
as to make Fortune the sole and absolute Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of her fancy: which might be instanced
in nothing more fully then in the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>There was one <hi>Mardanes,</hi> a rich Grazier;
one, who had all his time fed on the better
side oth' bush. This rich Chrone, who made
an Idoll of his Coine, made suit to <hi>Doriclea,</hi>
to obtaine her love. Rich and mighty proffers
he made her; pretending to throw himselfe
and Fortunes at her feet, so he might enjoy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6652:22"/>
her. Neither did her discreet Parents much
oppose it, nor incline to it, but refer'd all to
their Daughters choice: preferring her liking
before any other temporary proposition. But
how weakly this <hi>Mardanes</hi> proceeded, and
how unprosperously he succeeded, shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the issue: which fell so crosly to his
expectance, imagining his rich and plenteous
estate to be an Adamant attractive enough to
the dullest fancy, as he inverted the means of
proceeding directly, to an odious and impious
practise; seeking to procure her love by meanes
of Sorcery.</p>
               <p>Suppose him then first, after his long sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie
had received a repulse, contesting in
this sort with his affections: the grounds
whereof as they were weakly planted, so were

such a disparity in yeares, as her smooth
youth cannot endure these deepe furrowes
of age. Paritie ever begets best liking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
either partie. Whereas her fresh flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Prime would brook ill to be imbraced
by thy seere and saplesse armes. Besides, were
she never so loyall to thy bed, rumour would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6652:22"/>
not be silent: conceits would be working, and
jealous feares in every corner stirring. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
would impeach her, were her continent
desires never so restrained, nor to thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.
It becomes her then, as shee tenders
her honour, to make choice of such an one
who may more equally suit her, and with a
fresher and more agile youth better content
her.</p>
                  <p>Well, then this is all that can be objected
why thy suit is not received, thy proffers

the Lampe is quickly in the snuffe. There

                  <p>By this I gather, it were wisely done in
my particular, if I laboured to smother this
secret flame, before it increase or break forth
in more violence. For by marying one who
expects more than she can finde, thou maist
finde that which thou never expected. Take
heed then lest thy own Dogs know thee not
when thou comest home. It is thine owne
fault if thou fallest into <hi>Actaeons</hi> fate. Thy

Studies became diverted, being call'd
back into the Countrey. Where he continued
not long, till he was preferred to the Familie

himselfe so commendably, as there
was none of what quality so ever, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
infinite delight in his company. For
his discretion had sufficiently inform'd him
in the distinction of times: when to be grave
and serious; when pleasant and ingenious. And
though he knew how to argue Syllogistically,
and play the Sophister wittily: yet so modest
was he in the whole time of his reside there, as
he was never observed to presse any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no, though urged, without much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</p>
               <p>A rare quality in a Scholar: who, for most

               <p>In the same manner did our <hi>Philocles</hi> suffer;
for so constantly had his liking seated it selfe
on the towardly disposition of <hi>Doriclea,</hi> as
now upon the expiration of the years of her

a sincere Lover. Long had he expected what
the issue would be of her late Suitors affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

ever desirous to take his advice: whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,

she entertained such ignoble Servants: and
that her discreet fancy seemed rather to aime
at personall worth, then the rubbish of Earth:
Hee imagines a faire opportunity to be now
offer'd him of imparting his minde freely to
her, in whose purchase he might finde stored
an incomparable treasure. Revenues hee had
none to proffer her: having the constant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of a Scholer; which like two Lines meet
together in one Centre, equally closing in the
fate of a younger Brother. Yet observe his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6652:26"/>
modesty! Many times had hee resolved to
discover his love, which some contrary passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ever prevented. Sometimes hoping hee
might prevaile, and enjoy what he sought:
other sometimes, wholly despairing to reape
what his care had sown. Now would he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

could finde none: silent admiration was the
sole Orator of his affection. At last, recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his love distracted thoughts, and bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with himselfe, with that amorous Youth

for my long attendance, save only an
acknowledgement of my Service? A great
part of the prime of my youth have I here
bestowed in your Fathers house; where mine
highest care was your proficience: nor did
your increase in knowledge fall short of my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6652:26"/>
expectance. You have read, how <hi>Iacob</hi> for
his seven yeares service, received from <hi>Laban</hi>
his <hi>Leah.</hi> Wherewith <hi>Doriclea</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, said; And if my Father had any such
bleare-ey'd Daughter, you should have my
consent to enjoy her. But pray you good Sir
(quoth <hi>Doriclea</hi>) whence commeth this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
or whereto direct you it? H'as my
Father fallen in any manner short of what
was promised you; or deducted ought from
that annuall Pension hee conferred on you,
that you should thus upbraid us in any disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to your service? No, Mistresse, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Philocles</hi>) I have amply tasted of his
bountie; his liberall exhibition towards me,
hath farre exceeded any abilities in mee of
requitall. If I have any cause to complaine,
the ground thereof ariseth from your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and so you may be pleased to conceive
it. From mine, said <hi>Doriclea?</hi> Good Sir,
shew me in what particular, I have neglected
any office of respect to your deserving selfe!
Of all vices, I must ingenuously tell you, I
have ever constantly hated that of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Conscious I am, Heaven knowes, of
too many; yet of this, my thoughts have been
ever so freely cleared, as I cannot remember
wherein you may pretend any just cause of
taxing mee in this nature. O yes Mistresse,
answered he! I have taught you what I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you were as apt to forget, as you were
at first to get: and in forgoing that one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6652:27"/>
only Lesson, you have implyed a neglect of
my instruction. You may well remember,
for it is not so long since you got it by heart,
how I told you the signification of <hi>Amo,</hi>
and how you were to decline it. Neither
have I forgot it, so farre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> said she, as I meane
to make use of it. For the <hi>Active</hi> I shall ever
generally approve it: but for the <hi>Passive,</hi>
I never mean to entertaine it. What may <hi>Amo</hi>
then signifie, quoth <hi>Philocles? I love,</hi> said
<hi>Doriclea;</hi> and why do you <hi>decline,</hi> quoth he,
from so sweet a signification? Because (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
she) it was one of your first Lessons to
teach me how to <hi>decline</hi> it. Herein I doe but
observe your Lesson, and is this in me any
transgression? No, <hi>Doriclea,</hi> No, said <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles;</hi>
but my desire is that you would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
the fruit and effect of that Lesson. I
will not tell you how much he loves you,
who first read that Lesson to you. But were
there transparent Lights in his Bosome, you
might easily discerne, and consequently
affirme, that there were something in him
who deserved your affection. <hi>Deserved my
affection</hi> (answered <hi>Doriclea</hi>) Surely, I doubt
not, but my Fathers care has provided a better
Jointure then a Schoolehouse for his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Trust me Sir, if this be your Guerdon
which you expect for your care and serious
instruction; I am very likely, for my part to
prove unthankfull still: your motion falling
so farre short of all hope of promotion. Nay,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6652:27"/>
I must tell you, Sir, that you have so deceived
my opinion, as where before I bore your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
all respect, as to a serious and industrious
Master; your uncivile presumption (for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
title I cannot bestow of it) shall henceforth
teach me to dispense with that respect: and
if you seasonably desist not, make my Father
acquainted with your boldnesse. In such scorn
I hold your Motion, as I can finde no passion
strong enough to encounter with your indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
affection.</q> With which words, as one
seemingly above all measure, irreconcileably
incensed, she departed: leaving her disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>Philocles</hi> to converse with the Aire: or
like a melancholy Scholer, to enter parley
with his own sullen Saturnine thoughts. But
so strangely became he divided from himself,
as the very Organs of his Tongue had lost the

with some Meteor, stood staring, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing

by way of Argument, that she

her conceit: by making choice of some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
purposely to amate <hi>Philocles:</hi> and
shadowingly pretend a discovery of his late
proffer'd and professed fancy. As it chanced
one day, when her Parents and her selfe were
at Table together, where through a native ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
indulgence which they had ever shown to
their Daughter, she had liberty to expresse her
conceit upon any Subject. By means of this
liberty, which she alwaies used with much
modesty, she took occasion to enter into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
by way of argument, touching the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
which appeared betwixt <hi>Augustus</hi>
his Daughter and the Poet <hi>Ovid:</hi> wherein she
proceeded in this manner.</p>
               <p>Amongst all other occasionall Subjects,
wherein my small Reading has informed me;
there is nothing that occurres unto me more
strangely then that boldnesse, which I finde
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6652:30"/>
in that ingenious <hi>Ovid,</hi> with the Emperour
<hi>Augustus</hi> his Daughter. How a Poet, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> even

infatuated the understanding, and deluded
the conceipt with deceiving shadowes of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
How he, I say, durst attempt an assay
of such importance; by imparting his love,
where he ought so much of duty: or conceipt
himselfe worthy the least beamling or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion

could no lesse than apprehend upon so
unequall a familiarity; would debase her
thoughts so much, as to stoope to so base a

fury, an intranced rapsody, which would
suit incompetibly with a Princes fancy. No,
what is more, a meere Pedanticall Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master;

Girle, your judgement is too rash, said <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drogeus;</hi>
did not <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> whom you even
now named, voluntarily relinquish the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing'st
Empire in the world? He was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expulsed by force, nor deposed by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
consent: his desertion of an Imperiall
life came from his owne choice: being weary
of so pressing a burthen, the weight whereof
winged his resolves for a private condition.
But pray thee Girle, whence came the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this argument? Truly Sir, quoth she,
from no great ground; and I am glad at heart,
that having taken so slight an occasion, it has
so neerely closed it selfe in a digression. For
my Argument tooke first breath from the
boldnesse of a Schoolemaster in attempting,
and the lightnesse of his Scholler in consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The one too confident of his own parts;
the other too unmindefull of her own worth.
The first too opinionate of his owne desert;
the latter too forgetfull of her own descent.
Which Subject, presuming on your patience
and fatherly indulgence, I made choice of,
being the very last which occurred to my

<hi>Philocles</hi> heart in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
of this Subject: so
as, if the Parents of <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>
had suspected ought,
they might easily have gathered by the going
and comming of his colour, that there was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6652:32"/>
something in the winde that wrough such
strange effects in his count'nance and gesture.
All which proceeded from an imaginary feare,
doubting much that <hi>Doriclea</hi> had discovered
his too bold suit to her Parents: Or if she had
not already done it; this very Argument
whereof she took so free an occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
was an introduction of what she meant
to discover hereafter. So as, many times in
private would hee fall into sundry passions:
sometimes reproving his own presumption, in
presenting his love to one who was so farre
above the spheare of his affection: other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he would minister to his amated spirits
some small semblances of hope; as if she were
not the same she seem'd; but that her fancy,
howsoever shadowed or shrowded for the
time, would break forth into other expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then what her virgin modesty could yet
impart. Which deceiving opinion (as hee
judged it) he would streight labour to divert,
and condemne himselfe of egregious folly to
promise himselfe hope to obtaine: seeing all
passages of prevailing in his inconsiderate suit,
were shut up by his Mistresse disdaine. For to
impart his thoughts to her any more upon
that subject, he resolved fully never to attempt
it: desiring nothing more then that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
folly might be remitted; and all occasion
of discovery prevented: upon which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hee would willingly surcease from those
motives of love, which had so strongly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6652:33"/>
wrought on the faculties of his minde.</p>
               <p>Nor did hee see any means to unrip his
thoughts to an other, being so far from hope
of successe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as now it became a sufficient task
for him to prevent danger. For as the bent of
his fortunes at that time confin'd themselves
only to the spirit of hope: so was his hope
probably like to expire, should she whom hee
held so deere, make the least discovery of what
had passed betwixt him and her. It behoved
him therefore to apply himselfe to another
designe: and recant his familiarity with love:
which might both endanger his fortunes, and
deprive him all hopes of aspiring higher.</p>
               <p>Thus, as the precious stone <hi>Diocletes,</hi>
though it have many rare and excellent sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties
in it, yet it loseth them all, if it bee
put into a dead mans mouth; fared it with
<hi>Philocles,</hi> who though he were excellently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
richly qualified, and for elocution
generally approved; yet all these disheartned
by want of <hi>hope,</hi> lost all that lustre which they
formerly reteined.</p>
               <p>For though at retired houres, and at such
times as he found his Muse most propitious,
he composed diverse amorous Poems, apt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to stir up fancy; Yet so much was he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
as what his resolves were sometimes
addressed to present, his latter thoughts ever
retracted</p>
               <p>Howsoever, his melancholly walkes, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing more then privacy, discovered to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6652:33"/>
his Mistresse the effects of his fancy, who was
so farre from disclosing what might redound
to his dishonour; as those arguments whereof
she sometimes took occasion to treat, were
only urged to affright him, but in no case to
prejudice him: being so tender of his welfare,
as whatsoever appeared, nothing was by her
intended to decline his choice, or to give him
just cause of change. For so full of vertuous
remorse was <hi>Doricleas</hi> pious heart, as it was
more affectionately disposed, then by any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
was yet discovered.</p>
               <p>For as the Juniper tree maketh the hottest
coale, and the coolest shadow of any tree: For
the coale is so hot, that if it be rak't up in ashes
of the same, it continueth unextinquishable
by the space of a whole yeare: So this divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sented creature (to hold nearer resemblance
with the Juniper) though the heate of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
had beene long smothered in embers,
and discovered no visible flame; yet did it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
her vigour still, and by so much more
violent when iffuing, by how much longer
before it came to appearing. For love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
shewes his heat most, when outwardly
discerned least. And such was <hi>Doricleas</hi> case;
though she restrained her eye from fixing on
that Object which it desired: and her heart
to entertaine that guest which of all others she
most priz'd, yet could not her discretion make
such a foole of love, as wholly to bury her
thoughts from more discerning eyes. Truth
is, though no profession seem'd more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6652:34"/>
then that which he held: yet in her
conceipt, no vocation more pleasing, being
profest by one to her own thoughts so loving;
with her owne desires so complying. Little
then needed <hi>Philocles,</hi> to feare that she would
discover any thing to her Parents to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice:
seeing she so inwardly affected and
equally approved what he had propounded,
as nothing did more infinitely content her,
then at vacant hours to recollect those words
which he had delivered to her. Neither was it
her desire to tyrannize over her late-captiv'd
and inchained Servant: whose freedome lay
it in her power, should be confirm'd with as
ample and authentick a Charter; as true love
and constant devotion could enjoyne her.</p>
               <p>But all this little allay'd those incessant
cares and feares of poore <hi>Philocles:</hi> who every
day expected a discharge, when he should be
deprived of the place he bore, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all future hopes of renuing his suit, or
enjoying that prize which hee so infinitely
valued, as the sacrifice of his life he held at a
low rate to seaze him of the incomparable
purchase of her love.</p>
               <p>This mov'd him one day, after a sad recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

                     <p>HOw much those lines sweetned with

my indearedst thoughts cannot impart unto
you. To give you a reason why you should
love mee, I can give you no other, but that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6652:38"/>
my heart tels me I deserve you: &amp; that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
injoynet you to love me, seeing I
hold my life an easie sacrifice to injoy you.
Be it your goodnesse to believe mee; I will
sooner surcease to live, then from expressing
those loyall arguments of love; which your
vertues deserve, and which I with no lesse
constancy shall observe. I could never yet
dictate either by tongue or penne, what I
first conceiv'd not in heart I told you, that
your selfe was my booty; the portion I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
your vertuous beauty: and if you
pleased but to crowne my hopes with your
consent, our mutuall choice which should
never admit change, might make us both
equally happy.</p>
                     <p>To tell you that either my Fortunes or
descent did deserve you, were to labour, and
that fruitlesly, to delude you. But let me
become an Abject in the eyes of fame, an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of contempt to the world, if my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
devotion &amp; observance supply not that
deficience. For my descent, as I will not
boast of it, yet whensoever your parents, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

will finde it neither so ignoble as to despise
it, nor so meanely strengthened, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

But what are these, compared to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that affection, which combines hearts
and hands: And with a sacred cement so
knits and contracts mindes: As those who
were before divided, by meanes of this holy
league became so united, as nothing so
much as their presence could content them,
then which, nothing before did more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste
them! were my fortunes never so poor,
yet seeing my fancy appeares so pure, account
him worthy to deserve you, who will hold

               <p>Thus became Love a present and pregnant
Secretary.</p>
               <p>This object of fancy made the taske easy.
Letters know not how to blush, which cause
them commit to paper, what a bashfull tongue
could not so well deliver. Besides, this diverted
all occasion of jealousie in a meare-looking fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Which they before all others most
doubted; fearing to be prevented, now when
their loves begunne to be ripened and setled:
which would so perplexe the Sceane, as this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6652:39"/>
Comicke introduction might casually close
with a fearefull Conclusion.</p>
               <p>Albeit, so free from the least suspition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
light or ungrounded affection which <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi>
might any way harbour, were her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
as many times they would give their
daughter liberty to ride abroad, and visit her
friends. In all which freedomes she expressed
such modesty, as Envy could nothatch the least
occasion of jealousie from so compos'd a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
               <p>Yet, a greater desire shee reteyn'd to stay at
home, since her affection begunne to be setled
on <hi>Philocles,</hi> then before: many times preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an indisposition of health, or some other
minted excuse, to prevent her journey, by
remaining there where shee had planted her
fancy. But so tender were her Parents of their
daughter; being, as shee was, indeed, naturally
tender: as they desired she should change the
ayre, fearing much that her long stay or reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse
at home might enfeeble her health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And this their resolve now and then closed
well with her liking, having <hi>Philocles</hi> assign'd
her for her conduct: whose society, out of a
modest policy, though she seemed with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
to admit: yet how much that chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her heart, I appeale to all such constant
and affectionate Lovers, whose fancy h'as
beene crowned with such opportunity: and
whose Iourneyes have beene so incomparably
sweetned with the Society of a Mistris; whose
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6652:39"/>
conference had power enough to shorten the
houre; allay the difficulty of a troublesome
way; and to entertaine every object with such
occasionall delight: as nothing could more
cheerefully nor intentively worke on the
Conceit.</p>
               <p>But howbeit <hi>Philocles</hi> had sometimes the
happinesse to attend his Mistris; He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to a short returne, which could not
but beget an equall proportion of passion in
them both: In him to be divided from her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
whom he so intirely affected: In her, to
be dispossest of those unvaluable joyes which
her affection had in his Society treasured.
But their personall absence was ever suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by other remonstrances, not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
what was already begun, but to prepare
way for accomplishment of that, which with
joynt consent they desired might be solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done. Intercursive Letters were ever passing
betwixt them: and that in so quaint and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a Character, as interception, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
with a nimble construction, could
hardly extract ought that might discover what
they intended: or apply ought that might
occasionally prevent what their grounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
had resolved.</p>
               <p>For sometimes, he would write in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of another Suiter, to free his lines from
suspition: sometimes he would feague under
the title of that imaginarie Suiter, that he was
rejected by her: which to prevent, he would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6652:40"/>
revive those protests of love hee had formerly
professed. And to instance these, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
the subtilty of a Lover, peruse this
Letter, which under the faigned Name of
some dis-esteemed Suiter, hee thus addressed
to her.</p>

No day past without some memoriall of
this kinde. A strong motive to love; re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
to the memory, what personall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
might raze forth without revivall. This
it was which wrought so strongly on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened

nothing that made him so great a stranger to
armes, which he naturally affected: nor estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his affection more from his <hi>Octavia,</hi> to
whom by conjugall love he stood obliged:
nor divided him more from the care of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himselfe, then one line comming from

state begot an admiration in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders;
a strong impression in the wounded

a power to command love; and subdue the

               <p>Those secret delights of love which modest

whatsoever hee think. His eyes must partake
in the sight of their wooing dalliance; &amp; glad
he may do so, to prevent the worst. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
these silken Suiters will vouchsafe him
that honour to supply a place in their amorous
pastimes; as in making <hi>Gooselings</hi> in the fire, or
<hi>drawing of gloves,</hi> or such like harmelesse

best with his liking, but no doubt would
loose much of his spirit in carrying. For to

as he conceived, were imposed
him, purposely to humble him. Albeit, such
trials needed little, being one of such temper,
as his thoughts were farre above an inferiour
Spheare. For as hee beheld nothing in this
Theatre of Earth, worthy affecting, but his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6652:44"/>
                  <hi>Doriclea:</hi> so hee conceipted so well of his
choice, as he rested confident, such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
piece could not finde a brest to entertaine
a change. And his opinion was truly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
for howsoever his <hi>Doriclea</hi> might seeme
out of a desire to give her Parents content, to
converse with these jolly Wooers, and to leave
them in suspense, lest an absolute rejection of
them might procure their distaste; wee have
ever made it a constant Maxim, Where the <hi>eye</hi>
is, there the <hi>minde</hi> is: which might well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the behaviour of this constant Maid:
who, though she seemed amorously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with these, had her eye ever fixed on her
<hi>Philocles.</hi> But all this was not sufficient to her,
unlesse she might enjoy the presence of her
Dearest; from whom to be divided, even in
private treaties or parliance, was no small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
Suppose her then contriving sundry
plots to partake in what she did so infinitely
desire. Love is ingenious in devising, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times not so prosperous in succeeding.
Private meetings, purposely to relate their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
with meanes of preventing of what
her Parents, for ought that she knew, might
be intending; was her aime; further she aspired
not: for so pure and undistained were her
thoughts, as they hated to mixe themselves
with any irregular desire.</p>
               <p>Now to bring to passe what she sought;
many evenings would she pretend some one
businesse or other, to stay below behinde her
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6652:45"/>
Mother: but so light was her occasion, as her
Mother perceived, that it made her more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of her excuses. Seeing then these would
not do; she made use of a Trap-doore within
her Chamber; intending to come downe by
it, and so enjoy the benefit of time. But none
of these plots would hold; for <hi>Euryclea,</hi> who
by some private intelligence, or what other ill
office I know not, receiving notice of her
Daughters practise; one night when <hi>Doriclea</hi>
suspecting no harme, was to come downe by
the Trap-doore, as she had formerly done,
was received below by her Mother instead of
her Lover. Which how it perplexed this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Doriclea,</hi> exceeds the art of any
Pen to expresse: being not only deprived of
that beneficiall opportunity, with an evening
treaty, to crowne their fancy; but ingaged to
a just censure or opinion of jealousie. Which
her Mother had good cause to conceive; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what private advertisements had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
she found so apparently confirmed. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
then incensed <hi>Euryclea,</hi> who prized no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then her Daughters honour: nor
distasted ought more then those imputations
which censure might justly cast upon her, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up her Daughter in this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>What Girle, is your modest seeming come
to this? H'as our care, our too much care of
your preferment, made you forgetfull of
your honour? Have you either so meane an
opinion of your selfe; or so weak a conceipt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6652:45"/>
of our love, as to suffer your desires to mount
no higher, then to be the affectionate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
of a Schoolemaster? H'as your breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
begot in you a neglect of what you are,
or a contempt of that duty which you owe?
Be your actions so dark, as they must have
the night to shelter them? Must your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Family receive a blemish by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy?
Is this the hope we treasured in you,
the comfort we expected from you? Little,
did either your Father or I imagine what
you meant by that quaint discourse you oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
vented at the Table; in talking
of that immodest love betwixt a wanton
Poet and <hi>Augustus</hi> Daughter. It seemes you
delivered that Argument only to try us,
whether we stood affected to such a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
on which you had pitcht your wilde
affection. Simple Girle! conceive remorse
in time; do not undoe your Fortunes; there
is none yet that can (such is my too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
hope in you) justly traduce you; unlesse
the eyes of this Family. Redeeme their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
be more tender of your reputation.
There is no portion proportionably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the gage of honour: which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
you are lost for ever. No treasure so
precious as a continent soule; nothing more
to be lov'd, and nothing harder to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd,
being once lost.</p>
                  <p>It will grieve mee, to heare your selfe
griev'd with the relation of an ill report.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6652:46"/>
You may bee confident I shall take small
pleasure in the discovery of this nightwork.
Well Girle; those relenting teares promise
amendment: how soone is a Mothers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
appeased? I shall be ready to salve all, so
I finde a desire in you to amend all. I will
not make your Father, your too passionate
Father acquainted with it; neither will I
shew in publique any displeasing count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
towards your too presumptuous <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles.</hi>
All shall be carried with that equall
and faire temper, as you shall have cause to
say, that never indulgent Mother did more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ender her Daughters honour: nor could
use more connivence, where she found the
least hope of repentance. Retire then with
all privacy into your Chamber; I shall
charme your Maide that shee discover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Only let this be a warning unto you
henceforth, never to expose your honour
so freely, as to give occasion to the family to
speak lightly of you. For as honest repute
is the highest prize; so it merits of it selfe
such approved praise: as were your actions
never so private, the eye of piety would sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
them and crowne them. Neither can
any device finde such a shroud or shelter for
vice, as the piercing eye of fame will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it, and display the Actors when they
least dreame of it. Be then what you have so
long professed, vertuous; you cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Family from whence you came,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6652:46"/>
better: nor conferre on your maiden yeares
more true honour. This if you observe, it
will give us cause to blesse you, and second
the continuance of our care, in providing
a Match for you that may equall your birth
and fortunes: yea, and to close all in one,
confirme the opinion of your own fame, by
leaving to your posterity a president of your
surviving goodnesse.</p>

in cases of such extremity, what were best to

re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>resheth and nourisheth Nature most, then
to be rest of so sweet an opportunity of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his presence, whom she prized best.</p>
               <l>For though she sought her Parents minds to please,</l>
               <l>Her highest thoughts were fixt on <hi>Philocles.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>But the day must now supply the night,
with our <hi>Doriclea:</hi> by contenting her selfe
with the sight of him, in the presence of her
Parents, whom she in private conference so
much desired to enjoy. Their distance must
admit no conference: all their language now
must be delivered by the eye: readie no doubt
to expresse by a look, how much their united
hearts stood ingaged to love. Those <hi>Hesperian</hi>
Daughters never kept their golden fruit with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6652:47"/>
more vigilancy, then restrained <hi>Doriclea</hi> was
by her Mothers jealousie. So as, though her
unfeined love devised many plots to possesse
her of that which she so much desired, yet by
her Mothers intelligence was she ever preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Howbeit, she ever bore faire with <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi>
never so much as discovering any discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
towards his person: nor at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
him for his presumption; in aspiring
so high as the procurement of her Daughter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
affection. Albeit, one day taking him aside,
she told him; that she conceived it to be a far
better course for him, to returne to his former
Academick life: and that he lost but his time
in the Countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y: especially, seeing for the
present they had no imployments for him,
that might any way improve him, nor answer
those hopes he expected, nor parts deserved:
yet if occasion should afterwards fall forth
that it lay in their way to advance him: hee
should not faile in obtaining the best meanes
that their assistance or furtherance could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
procure him.</p>
               <p>But little wrought these with <hi>Philocles:</hi> he
preferred one Mistresse before nine Muses. His
highest of humane Philosophy rested in the
affection and contemplation of her on whom
he had fixed his fancy. Neverthelesse, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
himselfe thankfull for so unwelcome
a tender: pretending ever that he expected
daily to receive notice when some place might
fall, and then he would neglect no more time
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6652:47"/>
but addresse his course that way; which hee
hop'd e're long would offer it selfe in such
ample manner and measure, as might highly
conduce to the improvement both of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and profit.</p>
               <p>Meane time, hee hoped, his demeanure
should not be such, as might make any place
where he so journed for the time, weary of him.
And that he would choose rather to undergo
the poorest life, then be confined to that place,
where his carriage might not merit love. But
little did these reasons satisfie jealous <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea;</hi>
who laboured to prevent the worst, by
dividing <hi>Philocles</hi> from her presence whom
she tender'd best. To whom we must now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and see what extreames she is brought
to; who in this her languishing plight inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
her griefes; and in a secret repose, to

this for tender love, which deprives them
their sight whom they only love? Alas! do
they hold it a matter of such indifferency, to
dispense with fancy? Admit I have made
choice of him for my dearest Lover, whom
my Parents provided for my Schoolemaster,
must this deserve such strict censure, as to
divide me from the presence of my Tutor?
This were to make a Truant of a Scholer.
Must none marry but with their equals?
None rich, match with poore fortunes?
What will become then of poore vertue?
She may live a single life, and never partake

For alas, what will honour do to a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

small joy from the Title of a Lady, when
this naked style h'as bestow'd her on One

O retract then your too severe commands,
who enjoyne your Children such Tasks, as
affection cannot beare, nor freedome of
minde embrace, without a resolved distaste!
It is better seasonably to forgoe what we
cannot like; then seemingly to approve
what we cannot effect, and then repent too
late. For my resolves, I hope, they shall
never close in any other period then this:
That it shall be my constant scorne, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
affection by strength of <hi>allyance,</hi> which
to divided hearts can afford small as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>portion,</hi> which without a love-inducing
proportion, begets the enjoyer nought but
affliction; nor any other <hi>respect,</hi> be it never
so gracious or specious to the eye; but that
only which conveyes pure and effectuall
love to the heart. Never let Parents think
that any other affection can prosper: seeing
it is not grounded on that foundation,
which tenders the minde true solace and
contentment. Albeit, such who make their
choice by the eye, receive only direction
by sense; and such a love neither deserves
approvement, nor to offer it selfe to others
for a president. But where reason and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6652:50"/>
meet, there such a sweet union and
communion of mindes close in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one the other, as nothing can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
that individuall tye save only the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of that debt we owe to Nature. Yea,
but will provident Parents say, there is
more required in solemnizing a marriage,
then only bare love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is true; yet where
love is truly grounded, it will ever finde a
state competent to the minde, or a minde
competent to the state. It is impure love
that proves poore. Affection cannot want:
a very little sufficeth where love reigneth.
Whereas greatest meanes prove meane
fortunes, where affectionate mindes are
wanting to mannage those fortunes. O
let mee then enjoy my choice, and it
is not in the world that shall make me
desire to change. Rich am I above
comparison, enjoying the freedome of
my affection. Miserably poore above
relation. being deprived of loves fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Either then give me liberty to live
where I love; and to become seaz'd
where I have ingag'd mine heart: or let
me bee restrain'd for ever, rather then
so espous'd where I needs must hate.
O my dearest Parents! reflect upon
your owne condition, when your unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

only value meanes? Was portion the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only

on fancy, as fortune or outward ability?
Yes, yes; more purely were your undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

these and such as these were to our constant
<hi>Philocles;</hi> I leave to your judgements, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Lovers, who have suffer'd under the
malevolent quality of such a Planet: where
restrained of all oportunity, your Mistresses
invention found way by some ingenious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
or other after this manner, to discover the
constancy of their affections. Truth is, as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6652:53"/>
there is no passion which sooner works di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
then a depriving or distancing of us
from the object of our affection: so is there
no such motive to the conceipt; as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
of love. How witty it is in contriving?
How various in those numerous delights
which the height of that fancy is ever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
No difficulty, but love will encounter it;
no extremity, but she can digest it. There is
no action meriting honour, that can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
without labour. Infinite were those
tasks, and those full of jeopardie, which were
imposed on <hi>Alcydes,</hi> before he could be seazed
on his tyrannizing <hi>Omphale.</hi> Nor were the
affections of loyall Mistresses of lesse pursuit
in their reall expressions to their Servants.
What vast unfrequented deserts, unknowne to
any other inhabitants but wilde Beasts, have
their tender virgin-feet traced, to finde out
those whom they loved? What strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises
have they taken; what eminent fortunes
have they forsaken; what honours rejected;
what powerfull friends disclaimed; to enjoy
one only friend, whom they so highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
as by their personall seazure they held
themselves sufficiently enriched? Instances
we might here bring forth such store, as might
make up a story of themselves with out any
other intervening discourse. But omitting
others both forraine and moderne, in reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon our constant <hi>Doriclea,</hi> we shall finde
such noble constancy and masculine spirit in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6652:54"/>
her, as every Act shall present a sufficient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement;
and publish her by the impartiall
verdict of time, worthy that applause which
the relation of that age h'as given her.</p>
               <p>For as there was none which ever shewed
more constancy to those they lov'd; so was
there never any who with a more composed
temper encounter'd those affronts which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friends or fortunes cast upon her. Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all occurrents with so sweet and pleasing
a smile, as even her very profest enemies (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I must confesse very few, though vertue
must ever have some) suffered with her, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their passion into compassion, the heat of
their fury into a relenting admiration of her
fancy: which became so equally tempered, as
no distaste could alter it: being no lesse ready
to enter the List to enjoy her love, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the conquest of enjoying his love, in
whose bosome she desired only to live.</p>
               <p>Thus was our <hi>Doriclea</hi> resolved to suffer,
and to joy in her suffering, that she might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

for their honest loves to be clothed and closed

Well, I know not, what to conclude upon
such suspicious premises: but sure I am, that
a poysonous Snake may lye hid under the

too forward a Spring is ever nipt the soonest.
Though the Fish <hi>Sepia</hi> bewray her subtile en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter

out to cover her: others can go lesse disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

from amating his spirit, as he applyed all these
extreames as soveraigne Cordials: fearing
little, but as it was his hard fortune to suffer
much for her: so her noble disposition would
not be slow in returning a faire requitall, to
recompence those many occurrences which

Yet in this restraint, would he many times,

out in the discovery of those passionate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which their enforced absence one from

said he, being deprived of her presence
whom I only love? O how sweet were this

her whose presence would give me liberty?
How easie are the fetters of love? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
that liberty which divides us from
those we love? Yet was my former freedome
in this more gratefull to me than this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint:
in that I was admitted to enjoy the

restraint. Neither can this dis-passionate
censure of her incensed Parents in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

their fury, by reflecting on themselves, and
weighing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy of our united fancy:
but should my present thraldome beget her
distemper, my hopes were lost and perished
for ever. And what may I expect lesse from
one so truly loyall! No doubt, but she h'as
found as well as my selfe the reall proofe of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6652:56"/>
that experiment. Love is ever most violent,
when farthest divided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his object. So long
as we have liberty to enjoy in seeing, what
we may not more fully partake by injoying,
yet our eyes afford us some solace, to allay
those extreames of love with the fruition of
their presence. But when deprived of that
benefit; and to supply the comfort of such
an incomparable Object, we must make
Grates and Spider-woven wals our pensive
Consorts, would not imagination hold it
above humane suffering? No, no; while we
live, we are made to be Actors of passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

these tedious houres of his restraint in

Where he found some in the way of enjoying
of what they most affected, and suddenly
<hi>Ixion-</hi>like deceived with a Cloud. Others as
deeply plunged in despaire of injoying what
they loved, and these above expectance found
their desires crowned, where their hopes were
nearely expired. And of these he made use as
occasion serv'd: sometimes to humble his
hopes, lest they should mount or aspire above
themselves. Againe, were his hopes depressed;
with other instances he found them raised:
&amp; these were the most usuall consorts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

not easie to expresse: being not only deprived
of his presence, the highest benefit which was
admitted her: but equally suffering with him,
conceiving how those extremities which he

her. These wrought strange effects in her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate

now descend to other occurrents: and leave
these two divided Lovers, to the relation of
their own griefes, with this constant resolve;
that nothing may divorce their loves, but

to one who h'as now attain'd ripenesse of
age. I have beene young as you are, and no
doubt but addicted to like youthfull vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as others were. All which my aged sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

was a Subject fit for youth: for other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

wilde is fancy, that unlesse it be timely cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
it incurres that infirmity which cannot
be cured: and unlesse seasonably checked,
it makes choice of those which deserve most
to be rejected. This, I shall little need,
Daughter, to apply to you:  for your modesty
promiseth farre more discretion in fancy.
Yet I must tell you, I heare what I abhorre
to relate. Wherewith abruptly breaking off,
he demanded of her whether she knew not one

pleased sometimes to be my Suiter. It is true,
said the Hermit, and he intends ere long to be
your enjoyer. Mine, quoth she! Nay be
patient, said the Hermit. I must tell you, he
h'as ingaged himselfe in a desperate course
to enjoy you. Your repulse barr'd him of
his aimes; now his practise is to enjoy you
by indirect meanes. My Grave shall first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me, answer'd <hi>Doriclea.</hi> Nay, this is
the violent straine of a Woman, said the
Hermit; you will rather dye in the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

cure that passion. Pray you heare me. This
evill Man, whom you so slighted, h'as lately
contracted with an hatefull hideous Hag,

something from you, that may indirectly

unto other whither they were to go,
and what feats they were to do. Monstrous
were their practises: most of them aiming at
blood: and meerely for revenge without
hope of benefit to themselves. Others,
though not so cruell, yet no lesse unjust in
their attempts; were to practise plots and
projects of love, which in short time should
fall into such tragicall hate, as nothing
should compose the quarrell, but the Actors
life. Amongst which I heard one, whom
the rest of that miserable Meniey, as I
remember, called <hi>Spurcina;</hi> an ougly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

what she intended to do, being what she was
perswaded to by one <hi>Mardanes;</hi> which was,
that she should repaire daily to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, and by some meanes or other, as
by practising on something you might
weare, or some money you might bestow,
to procure him your love. And this she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to put in present execution. And
this must you prevent by serious devotion.
Let not the morning aire breath on you, nor
the rising Sunne shine upon you, before that

faile in her fruitlesse labour. I have
now told you what you are to do: thank
your selfe if you be deluded: seeing such
meanes are proposed to you, to prevent it.

rest upon you, as my prayers shall be for

                     </gap>ve I not perform'd those
sacred vowes which piety enjoyn'd me: or
neglected that office which charitie exacted

for lucre, wanton dalliance, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of honour: or have I fashion'd my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit

my selfe to the deservingst Suiter, too
liberall of mine honour? Have I made
the publique street my Gallery: or desir'd
unlawfull looks to seaze on my beauty? H'as

or afforded least hope to a light wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
eye of purchasing? Have I accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any presence with disdaine: or requited
any pious office with neglect? Did I ever
wish any ones hurt: or requite true love
with undeserved hate? Yes, yes, <hi>Doriclea,</hi>
herein hast thou offended. Hadst thou lov'd
<hi>Mardanes,</hi> he had never betaken himselfe to
unjust practises. And must I either then
love where I cannot affect, or make those I
reject, practise what humantiy would detest?
Injurious <hi>Mardanes!</hi> Hadst thou none to
exercise thy spels nor inchantments on, but
such an one who is not her own? This is
impiety above president. What were it to
enjoy, where thou canst never partake any

procure love, tragick events produce hate.
Desist then, unhappie man, from these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,

soule finde succour; or a succourlesse Maide

desire of their Author? So limited then is
their power, as they can practise nothing
that is impure, upon a soule divinely pure.
Practise then, <hi>Mardanes,</hi> what thou canst;
thou shalt never enjoy what thou wouldest.
I am better fortifi'd then to be so surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:
stronger fenced then so foiled. Nor

               <p>Nor were her resolves with lesse constancie

so farre prevailed, as by her devout morning
Exercise (being the season which the Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
most commonly used, ever hoping to
take her unprovided) those odious fruitlesse
Spels became ever frustrated. All which,
<hi>Spurcina</hi> the Spell-woman afterwards confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:

               <p>Thus lived <hi>Doriclea</hi> every way assailed and

               <p>Many times would she relate her gounds

But this wrought no effect upon her affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

Nor was her fancy so lightly fixed, as to give

drawing neare the bed, to put her Daughters

<hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> Do not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thy affection to any: restraine thy looks
when thou art in his companie. Next this,
be sure thou shew no impatience, if at any
time crossed in thy expectance. Thou seest
how many sharpe encounters I have grapled
with: and little nearer a conquest then I
was at first: yet must I not suffer my hopes
to be so extinguished. No task can be long,
where hope pretends a purchase of love.
Look up then Wench, cheerefully; let not
the subtilest Artist draw from thy look, the
least blush of love, or line of fancie. Wing
thy desires with hope, that hope may crown
thy expectance. And proceed in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

with thy choice; in which assay I faithfully
promise thee my best assistance.</q>

<hi>Spurcina</hi> brought forth; as all was struck out
of order, though at the first appearance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:6652:74"/>
who now overcome with a deepe jealousie;
imagined, that whatsoever <hi>Doriclea</hi> her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse

dissembled. And that her reall love towards
<hi>Mardanes</hi> was such, as she would prove her
Corrivall rather than Assistant, by interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Which groundlesse suspicion of hers
received life from that which if her deluded

discovered to her, how infinitely she stood
bound to her Mistresse for her love. For dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<hi>Doriclea</hi> perceiving the passionate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

then to bring her in a way of enjoying, of
what she was so eagerly pursuing; resolved of
a course that might expedite this designe: and
this was, to expresse all showes of affection to
<hi>Mardanes:</hi> as if she intended nothing more
then to reteine him her constant servant,
whom she had formerly rejected: and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
that neglect with such arguments of
love, that the world might take notice that he
and none but he was the man whom she affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Which relation (so ready is fame to
disperse her selfe upon every occasion) no
sooner vented it selfe abroad, then her Parents,
supposing her love to be now declining from

she wrought by. Proper parts were the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants
of her affection: and these she found
in none so well to life portrayed as in her
<hi>Philocles. Mardanes</hi> was then a rough-hewen
Swaine, whose presence she so much hated,
as she estranged her selfe from that place
which he frequented. And must he be now
entertained, because he is by poore <hi>Mellida</hi>

her Maide h'as chang'd her minde, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
him to the choice of a Mistresse. Let
my losse be his gaine; my deprivall of what
I desire most, the enjoyment of her whom
he expected least. The ruine of a poor Maide
is all that she can have; which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
much to her honour, seeing she, on
whom she so much relyed, and to whom her

Is your conceipt so meane of me, that

respect to <hi>Mardanes</hi> proceeds meerely from

with a resolution that whensoever you
made choice of him, I would love him?
Trust me <hi>Mellida,</hi> this distemper'd fancie
tastes of a frenzie. These humours will make
your constant'st friends your profest foes.
Shake off this jealousie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest it become thy

for the closing of the day approached; which
gave more freedome to <hi>Doriclea's</hi> working
thoughts to contrive what might close best

get: for on two severall tasks he bestowed this
tedious night: the one no lesse pleasing, then
the other dis-relishing. For the former part
of the Night, he bestowed on the thoughts of
that familiar conference, amorous, but harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
dalliance, sacred vowes, immutable
seales, mutually passed betwixt them.
These made the houres of sable night, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull,
as no <hi>Euphuus</hi> golden slumber could
so infinitely cheere him. He was wholly exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the gratefull remembrance of these
imaginary fancies. But leaving these, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on those which he so lately heard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6652:80"/>
he found houres farre longer in their
progression, then the other were, running so
pleasantly upon that harmonious descant of
affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Doriclea,</hi> false, said he! may that tongue
be ever silent that shall utter it; that injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conceipt a corrasive to it selfe, that shall
believe it. And yet these relations cannot be
so generally dispersed without some ground.
Opportunity may do much where Parents
assent gives way. Thy restraint, <hi>Philocles,</hi>
and discontinuance in thy suit might work
strange effects. He is rich who is thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall:
and Women must love to live, aswell
as live to love. Thy impoverish'd quality is
a mighty eye-sore to fancy. Wealth is a
good salve for age: and though she cannot
affect him as he is, she may hug him for what
he h'as. Marriages go not altogether by
joyning of hearts but hands. His store will
so highly improve her state, as it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
fancy, and raise her to what thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
may not aspire, the title of a Lady.
And yet me thinkes all this should little
moye the constant and loyall brest of <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea.</hi>
Heavens cannot chuse but frowne on
breach of faith: which is ever attended by
an heavie fate. Yea; but admit she be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled;
what meanes may she finde to resist
it? Parents will is a command: and as she
h'as ever borne the modesty of a Maide, so
h'as she reteined the duty of a Daughter, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6652:80"/>
obedience of a childe. Parents command
then might far prevaile with her: seeing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was ever so much preferred by her:
as all feares had been before this time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
had not this parentall sacrifice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
her. Well; be it so. Patience shall
be my Crowne: my prayers for her successe.
No griefe, shall so much surprize me, as the
desire of her happinesse shall delight me.
Meane time, I will suspend my judgement:
and expect better then I heare: but if the
issue second this report, I hope soone after
that an everlasting retire from Earth shall
cure my care.</q>

deare <hi>Philocles;</hi> wherein have I ever given
thee occasion to tax me of inconstancy; or in
my bosome desired to lodge any one beside
thee? Have I not neglected all my fortunes,
nay, my zeale to those whom I preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all fortunes, to bestow my selfe upon a
Scholers fortunes? If either rich youth
or age could have wrought on <hi>Doriclea's</hi>
fancy, she might long before this, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
all grounds of jealousie; and been a

Mistresse of an ample Family. And yet you
are cunning <hi>Philocles;</hi> you will not plainly
say you suspect me, for that were to tax
you of too palpable jealousie: but you must
shadow all under a dreame: and make visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

straitned by his golden battry. Well, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
God forgive you; you have hither to
had sufficient experience, how much my
disposition hath scorned to be taken up by
such prostitute affection. If Gold would
have done it, your loyall <hi>Doriclea</hi> might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

were no motives to me to inchaine my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
or with a yeelding hand, but a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
heart, to engage my person to such a
subject of folly.</p>
                  <p>O disburden your selfe, <hi>Philocles,</hi> of these
conceipts: they so ill become you, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
makes <hi>Philocles</hi> so unlike himselfe:
nor chils my affection more towards him,
who is my second-selfe. I have not begged
much at your hands, since the time we so
firmely united our hearts: all I intreat of
you is this, and it will redound to your own
hearts-ease as well as mine: to discard these
injurious conceipts towards your own, by
reflecting on her who can be no lesse then
yours, if her own.</p>
                  <p>And trust me, deare Sir, you may thank
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6652:84"/>
God, that you remaine seazed of such a
heart, which is not apt to take offence where
such good occasion is offered. Some cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Girles, if they had but perceived the
least inclination to jealousie in their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Suiters, which your own Character
h'as sufficiently discovered in you, they
would in time have prevented that mischiefe
which might have incurred; and collected
what domineering jealous Husbands they
would have showne themselves being once
married, having exprest themselves such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
Batchlers, when they were unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.
But love findes an easie shroud for
the highest crimes: nor can <hi>Doriclea</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<hi>Philocles</hi> Dreame any otherwise then
an unbounded affection breaking into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames:
which, when it cannot with suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
freedome impart her strength by day,
borrowes of the night to discover in a
dreame. And who can blame such vigilant
love; when the eyes though they sleepe, the
heart keepes true Centinell, lest fancy should
take her opportunity and make her escape?
Free leave then do I give thee, <hi>Philocles,</hi> to
dreame still of me; but so, that thy dreames
do not suspect me. For so might thy delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
imagination, which is seldome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

false for what is true: and make thee credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously

which <hi>Doriclea's</hi> Parents conceived of their

those ample fortunes of her undeserving Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
yet her own case must be first preferr'd,
being urged by such importunity, as she held

their desires must be first feasted with eying

long division from thee, my dearest <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi>
whom I preferred before the world?
For to be ever happy so surfets the conceipt,
as it dreames of no other state: a small
storme to him who hath ever enjoy'd a
calme, seemes like a tempest. Whereas my
present condition makes me more sensible
of my former affliction. I was deprived of
thee whom I incomparably loved. From all
civill curt'sies, save such as I received from
strangers, excluded. All hopes of future ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,

A Grate became my best prospect: the
World my story: where I saw no action of
sorrow presented more to life, then my own
misery. O how the relation of our former
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6652:88"/>
griefs become an addition to our present
joyes! Before I had none to converse with,
but such pittilesse Guardians, as rejoyced
in my restraint. Tedious were the houres
of my life, because divided from the object
of my love. Terrors I encounter'd with dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
passions I wrastled with hourely. No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
found I to allay my griefe: none to
impart my woes to, but such whose hearts
were iron-temper'd like my Grate. O what
an exchange have I found, in being free'd
from what did so inthrall me: and in being
restored to her presence, which of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyes doth only revive me! O my <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi>
how many fearfull visions have startled
me! how many distemper'd Dreames have
disquieted me! And whence proceeded all
these but from that love and feare equally

that paper of Verses he had writ unto her: and
how much his too affectionate feare had made
him transgresse: desiring her pardon, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting

his fault, and condemned that too liberall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

since your heavie restraint, I have been too

and spurr'd me on to revenge, and made me
apt enough to forget ought that did most
concerne me; but to imprint in my memory,
the thought of an injury. <hi>Envie</hi> revenged her
selfe justly on me, and made me pine away at
the very sight of an others prosperity. And
<hi>Covetousnesse,</hi> that age-benummed sinne, made
me desire most when I needed least, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted
me. Nor could I shake off these, till I
shak'd off my self by leaving the world, which
harbour'd these. But within one halfe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship,
I blushed at those vanities I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
affected: and by a private retire from
the world, found what the world was while I
was in it. Many were the conflicts I must free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confesse, which I suffered, before I could
wholly leave it. Yea, delights above conceipt,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6652:91"/>
presented themselves to my fancy, solliciting
me to love it. And with these I long contested,
and at last conquered, but with such difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as I many times failed, and had been quite
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Since which time, I have ever in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
privacy remained: knowne too much
to the world to affect it: nor so little to my
selfe, but that my in firmities humble me in it.
Many, too many, heaven knowes there be,
who professe this regular course which I have
entertained: but their profession is but how
to delude the world: by bleering the eyes of
men with a pretended sanctity: and under this
vaile cunningly shroud their base hypocrisie.
And One of these have mine aged eyes seene in
these later times.<note place="margin">☞</note> A profest Gallant in his
prime: and one who delighted in nothing
more then a phantastick dresse: sufficiently
conceipted of his own parts: yet strip him
naked, he was neither good Morall, sound

youth, when fortune begun to frowne on him,
and vanity, for want of maintenance, to leave
him: pronounce his divorce from the world.

Besides, your advice may usefully import us
in directing how and in what manner we
may bestow us, to prevent perill, which as my
dearest <hi>Philocles</hi> truly affirmes, is every where
inclosing us. I know my Fathers passion to

Hermit imployed his conceipt a little further:
contriving a course how and where to place
them for the present: till the storme were
over-blowne, and a calmer season might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
some respite to their feares. For that

howbeit, so strongly steeled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
was <hi>Philocles</hi> fancy, as with much

                  <hi>Euryclea,</hi> I have brought back at last your

intended; and had not timely intelligence

a more circumspect eye of her Walkes
then you have hitherto done. Let such attend

privacy may hurt her health: as too much

these prints of youthfull fancy. Imployment
or delightfull company, being such as may
suit with virgin modesty, may finde power to
discampe these dangerous Assailants, which
so mainly work upon the inward quiet of hte

what was to ensue. And in giving her these

<hi>Mellida!</hi> This is no leane love. Happy were
my poor Mistresse, if she might receive but the

Why Mistresse? In what better case am I then

replyed <hi>Doriclea?</hi> Why, pray thee, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
parts doest thou see in him, that
thy love should not deserve him? Didst thou
ever heare any one so highly taken with him,
but thy selfe? That's no matter, said <hi>Mellida:</hi>
but I am sure a nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would poore <hi>Mellida</hi> goe, to receive one

Surely, Wench, thou wouldest gladly play
Pilgrim, to undertake a journey for such a
Lossell. But thou doest weil to be constant,
nor shall I ever perswade thee to change thy
choice. Change my choice, said <hi>Mellida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

No, may I sooner change to Earth. Alas! my
desires are not great: nor my ambition high.
Might I but be entertained to be his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid;
to attend him; though as his unworthy
Consort I might never enjoy him: this would
in some measure content me. yea, quoth <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea,</hi>
but this perchance, would in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in thee discontent. Discontent, said <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida,</hi>
and be in the presence of my <hi>Mardanes;</hi>
how could that be! By seeing other Creatures
of the same Sex, answered <hi>Doriclea,</hi> received,
while thou were't rejected. Indeed, said <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida,</hi>
I should hardly endure to see that:
<q>
                     <l>No earthly crosse may halfe so bitter prove,</l>
                     <l>As to admit Corrivals in our love.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, me thinks, I should never love him
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6652:106"/>
worse: seeing, I could conceive no other cause
of their too much love, but his perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And were it reason that I should hate him,
because others love him: or fall short in my
esteeme, because others did so highly prize
him? And yet, I must confesse, I could not
well suffer another to become too familiar
with him. Patience could beare no more then
it could: and a breast I have ready to embr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grounds of jealousie. Thus privately used
these two to bestow some houres of the day
in discourse: wherein <hi>Doriclea</hi> ever reteined
so admirable a temper: as no extremity of
passion was ever seen outwardly to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her. Love she could, and constantly:
forego the presence of her love she could, and
modestly. Expectance in this only made her
happy: this combate with contrary fortune
would not hold out still; she at last hop'd to
obtaine a victory: and therein more glorious,
in that her bickrings were more grievous. A
suspicious sigh must not leape from her; nor

was none of the best: and what were it then
to enjoy all his estate, and want the comfort

so weak, nor Gods providence so small; as
that the Portion we intend to conferre on her,
may not procure her such a Match, as may
suit with her desires both for competency of

Husband, said she, I never knew any Match
made up for wealth only, that ever begot
comfort to the party. And you your selfe
know Husband, that when at first I preferred
you in my choice, the very least thing that
wrought upon my affection was your wealth:
and yet have we had ever enough, &amp; so much

<hi>Euryclea.</hi> I know <hi>Philocles,</hi> to be poore

might beget in her a neglect of duty, nor a
coldnesse of affection by meanes of poverty.
To divert then the current of her love, I made
choice of one for her, who had sufficient
whereon to live. That by comparing the
want of a Scholler, with the wealth of a
wordly improver, she might the sooner di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

love: and expresse himselfe worthy her choice,
by his faire and affable temper. Yea, said
<hi>Androgeus,</hi> but it was dangerous to give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

you think lying in Bed will serve the turne?
But if you will not be so much a friend to

your selfe, I pray you befriend your selfe
for my sake. Alas, all this time while you
lye sobbing and fighing here, my Suit to
<hi>Mardanes</hi> growes cold. And I must tell you
a secret too Mistresse; but none must know of
it, for if they should, it might be a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
to my credit. Truth is, as truth ever
goes farthest, that since you fell into this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
I became mine own Solliciter: but
I made bold still with your name. And in
very deed, (this you may think to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest
part, but I am sure it came from a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heart) I sought in my Letter directed

would make me his own.</q>

                  <q>Fye, Girle, answered <hi>Doriclea,</hi> thou hast
spoiled all: proffer'd love had never yet good
savour. And in the meane time thou hast
brought me upon the stage in a dainty fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
by making <hi>Mardanes</hi> believe that I am
liberall enough of my reputation. But, pray
thee, Wench, what answer receivedst thou?</q>
                  <q>Nay, Mistresse, said <hi>Mellida,</hi> you shall know
all; but I pray you impute it to my too
much love, if my love h'as wronged your
name. But the harshest answer did I receive
from him, that ever poore Wench received
from any one, loving so dearly as I did.</q>

taking herby the hand,<note place="margin">Eschites <hi>Speech to</hi> Doriclea.</note> said thus unto her.
Mistresse, if I have any judgement, as my
long experience should teach me some, you
may be a Physitian to your selfe, if you
please. Nay, it is in your own hand to kill
or cure.</q> I do not know your meaning (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Doriclea</hi>) but surely, Sir, you have no
such strange conceipt of me, as to think my

but my skill failes me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you may not do much
if you would. I pray you let me ask you one
thing, Mistresse; are you not strongly troubled
with imaginations? I have a phantasie, quoth
she, as others have, and that must needs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature of it, be discursively wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
here and there, but never fixed on any
one Object. I will burne my Books, said
<hi>Eschites,</hi> if that prove so. Come, Mistresse, I
must be round with you; your minde h'as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in your body this distemper: your blood
had never beene infected, had not your minde
beene first to love affected. Be then so much a
friend to your selfe, as either labour to forget
him: or by imparting your thoughts more
freely to your Parents, to enjoy him. This is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6652:115"/>
the best receipt that Art can apply to you;
which if you reject, dye, and who will pitty
you? <hi>Doriclea</hi> wondred much how <hi>Eschites</hi> art

with a winning kinde of reluctancy, after a

am I of your secrecy, as a poore Patient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make her Physitian, her Secretary:
nor am I lesse confident of your care then
your cure: of your care to keepe my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell;
then of your desire to cure my Malady.
I shall here relate to you, what I meant to
have buried with me. It is true Sir, there is
one that I have lodged neare my heart, and
remove him I cannot; and enjoy him I may
not. Nor will I conceale from you any
thing: the Man who h'as taken this place is
<hi>Philocles,</hi> now a banished man to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
which censure he h'as voluntarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
and cheerefully imbraced to decline
my Parents fury. And his absence it is, Sir,
that h'as begot in me this infirmity.</q> No
sooner did <hi>Eschites</hi> hear <hi>Philocles</hi> named, then
he rejoyced much to have so faire an occasion
offered him, both in respect of his <hi>Patient</hi>
whom he desired to recover: as likewise for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6652:116"/>
the advancement of his friend <hi>Philocles,</hi> whose
former acquaintance had ingag'd his respects
more then any other. To palliat all things
then with more art: he intends to work a cure
without applying any medicinall receipt: and
this must be by Argument, for otherwise he
knowes not how to effect it. And now a fit
opportunity is given him: for this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
receipt must not be ministred to his <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
but her Parent. Who desirous to heare
what the Physitians opinion was touching
their Daughter, came in the very instant;
which prevented <hi>Doriclea</hi> from imparting her
mind any more at that time to <hi>Eschites. Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus</hi>
beckning oft to the Physitian, demanded
of him what he thought of his Daughter, and
whether he had hope to recover her or no.
<hi>Eschites</hi> withdrawing himselfe a little from
her bed side, and taking her Parents aside, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
freely to discover his opinion of her in
this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> as it h'as never beene my use in the
whole course of my profession to delude my
Patient with vaine hope, where I found my
receipts could afford no helpe: so I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
tell you what I think without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
you: in cases of this extremity, I finde
small hope of recovery: unlesse her youth be
a meanes to repell the malignity of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
Nature is much weakned in her. Her
sleepe, which is the very dew of the braine,
h'as left her. Nourishment will she take none,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6652:116"/>
and if she did, yet by reason of obstructions in
the Orifice of her stomack, it would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
with her. So as, should I apply purgative
or ligative medicines unto her, yet would they
work small effect, by meanes of those indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poed
humours which have got dominion
over her. Shall I tell you my minde freely?
It is not in the vertue of hearbs that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
her remedy: her malady proceeds from
fancy: which must receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it loves, or no hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>Having delivered his opinion in this sore,
he took <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Euryclea</hi> by the hand:
desiring to know of them whether their
Daughter had not at any time professed love
to some Gentleman or other in those parts:
or whether she had not discovered so much
unto them? yes, answered <hi>Androgeus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too much upon one <hi>Philocles,</hi> whom I
here reteined for her Schoolemaster: one of
knowing parts, but weak fortunes. Then it
seemes, said <hi>Eschites,</hi> you crossed her in her
desires. We did indeed, answered <hi>Androgeus;</hi>
for we conceived that such a marriage would
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> highly to her dishonour, to marry a
poore private Scholler: and therefore sought
to decline her affection that way. Which, like
an obedient childe, she h'as since that time
done; and observed our directions with that
care, as an ancient Gentleman, and one whom
you well know, whose rising fortunes may
highly advance her, h'as lately renued his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6652:117"/>
suit unto her: whom she with all faire respect
entertaines. So as her former indiscreet fancy
seemes wholly banished: and consequently
her Malady, if it should proceed from any
such occasionall fancy, perfectly cured.
Alas, replyed <hi>Eschites,</hi> what your Daughter
may pretend is one thing, but what she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
is another. Affection I must tell you
will be hardly forced: whatsoever her filiall
obedience may enjoyne her; love reteines too
much soveraignty to be so countermanded:
or to extinguish that heat which it first che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
               <p>Thus he, though he professed no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but as an Artist should in delivering his
opinion touching their Daughter, expressed
himselfe an intimate Friend to <hi>Philocles,</hi> by
making show as if he despaired of her recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
closing his judgement with this Maxime:
That no Malady arising from fancy, could
without enjoyment of the Object loved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
remedy. Which much perplexed her
sorrowfull Parents, conceiving by <hi>Eschites</hi>
relation, that the image of <hi>Philocles</hi> had
stamped so deep an impression in their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
affection, as the ground of her distemper
arose from being so imperiously divided from
her Lover.</p>

acquainted them, how those little short

how ever and anon she called upon <hi>Philocles.</hi>
Which so confirmed them, as they presently
gathered that his absence had begot this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
in their languishing Daughter: which
highly aggravated their sorrow. Gladly
would they recall him, so they might regaine
him, but they finde no hope of reliefe to their
weak Daughter; seeing the <hi>meanes</hi> of her cure
(the sole cordiall of her care) was reported
to have enter'd a Regular Order. No hope

               <p>While they were thus discoursing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scanting

<hi>Mellida;</hi> which was a Messenger indeed from

the issue of whose motion her Parents

with that privacy, as upon the delivery and
perusall of the Letter, <hi>Doriclea</hi> knew not they
were there. The Contents of this amorous
Scroule were these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DOriclea,</hi> you may expect that these lines
should have been prevented by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consummate our joyes, which, by how much
the longer delayed, in our fruition will be more
sweetned.</p>
               <p>Alas, good Man, said <hi>Doriclea!</hi> how he
troubles his braines to no purpose? As if his
<hi>personall presence</hi> could do me any good, or
procure me ease! No, no; unlesse he were
transformed into <hi>Philocles;</hi> and then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of his feature would do me an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
pleasure.</p>
               <p>Surely, said <hi>Mellida,</hi> I could with with all
my heart that we had them both in their own
proper shapes: I know who would be the
more pretious pearle in my eye. Well, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Doriclea,</hi> God send thee much good of
him, when thou shalt have him. And if I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my health, whereof as yet I finde small
hope, I should make little doubt but by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I have, to possesse thee of him. I pray God
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6652:119"/>
you may have your health restored you soon,
said <hi>Mellida;</hi> for I am sure you cannot suffer
more in your Fever, then I my selfe do, till I
be made happy by the free enjoyment of
<hi>Mardanes</hi> favour.</p>
               <p>This discourse seemed strange to <hi>Doriclea's</hi>
Parents, for they little knew what their
Daughter intended by that device: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they now perceived that the love she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to <hi>Mardanes</hi> was not reall, but dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
and that <hi>Philocles</hi> was the Man who
was only interessed in her heart: and that
without him she despaired of health. Which
could not chuse but strangely perplexe her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
Parents; who now, so they might
become confident of their Daughters reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
would easily incline to <hi>Philocles</hi> fancy.
But they were out of all hope to procure her
health by this meanes: seeing, retired <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
was now to his Countrey a stranger, and
had enter'd a strict religious Order: which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
them, that he had now disclaimed the

pleasant pastimes would these Countrey

Good Lord, Mistresse, said she, what a stirre

Goodfellow,</hi> I could finde with all my heart to
sip up a Silly-bub with him in my Fathers
Broome-pasture. For I shall on my conscience
never love any one halfe so well. And yet I
know not whether I shall love him when I am
waking so well as when I am sleeping: nor
do I know whether I should know him, if I
should see him: and yet every night I infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love him, and could chuse to live with him,
if he be flesh and blood, as I hope he is; for else

                  <hi>Doriclea</hi> could not chuse but smile within
her selfe to heare this simple Countrey Girle
discover her imaginary love in this manner.
While an other as simple as the former, but a
more reall and substantiall lover, stept forth;
and as one angry that her fellow should spend
so much time in discovery of a Dreame, or
a dreaming fancy, she proceeded in this sort.
Sister, what makes you thus trouble Mistresse

Mistresse <hi>Doriclea</hi> heare my Fortune: for I

Man, I am not ashamed of my choice: a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Dapper Youth, and h'as wonne the best
prizes from <hi>Admetus, Melintus, Palemon,</hi> and
the activest Youths of all our Parish, at our
Summer-Games two yeares together. And
my Father, good Man, h'as promised him,
that if hee come away with the prizes next
yeare againe, he will bestow me on him. And
I could wish with all mine heart, that I were
his now; for a whole yeare will be too long
to languish in love. But one thing now above
all others, there is, Mistresse, that grieves me;
and it is this, Our Neighbours say, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

if Nature will not be so bountifull to him, if
there be a Beard-maker in all our Countrey, I
will want of my will but he shall furnish him.
Your case is happy in comparison of mine,
said the third Girle; one of you loves, and
you know not whom; another loves, and
may enjoy whom she loves: but my Fortune
is harder: for <hi>AEgon</hi> profest as much love to
me, as ever Suiter did to Woman: and I knew

would performe what he had promised. But

                  </hi> I were a Foole to lay
that to my heart, which another lyes to his
heele. A disloyall Man should never break the
heart of a wise Maid. He that can so easily
leave his old Love, may stand in need of the
least graine of it if he live. Meane time, I hope
if I live, to enjoy one who shall more constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love. Thus discoursed these Countrey
Girles; and much content took <hi>Doriclea</hi> in
this relation of their simple loves. But her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother comming in, prevented all
further discourse, for that time. Their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they found still languishing: small or no
hope of recovery ministred least comfort unto
them. Many times they wished, that they had
not opposed her affection, but inclined to her
will; for so they might have enjoyed what
now by all probability is very likely to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them. And as they were thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
their sick Daughter, who daily
grew weaker in strength, but stronger in her
distemper; <hi>Eschites</hi> came into the Chamber,
enquiring how it was with her? Drawing
nearer and nearer to her end, answered her
Father. Small hope of amends appeares yet.
Nor will any probably appeare, to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
said <hi>Eschites.</hi> No cure can be possibly
effected, till the cause be removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though
the cause of her distemper be too far removed,
as the case now stands, the cause must be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or no recovery to be expected. <hi>Androgeus</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:6652:122"/>
desiring to know what he meant, requested
him to explaine himselfe. To whose satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he willingly inclined, and in a grave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
manner, imparted his minde freely to
them: discovering both the grounds first
introducing, and receipts most soveraigne for
curing her distemper.</p>

                     <hi>Eschites</hi> Speech to <hi>Androgeus.</hi>
                  </note> you may remember, how forth of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
grounds of Art, I sometimes told
you, which they shall finde true that have
neare relation to you: <hi>
                     <q>That no Malady ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from fancy,</q> could without enjoyment of the
Object loved, receive remedy.</hi> And though
love rarely work such effects in these dayes:
yet, too neare an instance you have here of
your owne, who confirmes what powerfull,
nay incurable distempers the quality of love
produceth; not only in the affections but
constitutions of such who have received such
deepe impressions of love, as they must seaze
on the person they effect, or cease to live. Too
long have you deceived your selves with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
hopes, expecting that either by
strength of Nature, which you may perceive
much enfeebled in her, or by Physicall means,
which I told you could smally benefit her, she
might recover health. And now you see, how
farre she is from seconding your hopes: as
every day promiseth nothing but a decline
from worse to worse. To prevent this, if you
expect ever to see her in health againe, give
way to my directions: let her enjoy what she
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:6652:123"/>
h'as so unfeignedly desired. It is <hi>Philocles</hi>
that must performe this Cure, or effectlesse is
our Art, fruitlesse our Care. Let him then be
called home, whose returne gives me assured
hope of her health.</p>
               <p>Alas, answered <hi>Androgeus,</hi> if that were
possible to be done, we should easily encline
to such a motion: but as he is not only divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from us, but enter'd a strict-austere Order,
there is small hope that ever his purpose is to
returne hither. For since his departure hence,
I received a passionate Letter from him:
wherein he not only humbly craved my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for his indiscreet pursuit of my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
affection, but advertised me of his late
Conversion. And how that course which he
had now embraced, had aliened his thoughts
from all light love; and that the <hi>choice</hi> he
had now made, should during life admit no
<hi>change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very like, said <hi>Eschites;</hi> But I pray you
how expound you that Clause? His <hi>Choice,</hi> no
doubt, which he meant by was your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which he never intended to <hi>change.</hi> Come
Sir, Discourses in affaires of this nature should
be used as preparatives of what may succeed
after: you desire your Daughters health, and
you perceive the meanes to effect it: but out
of a scrupulous feare you doubt the way is
diverted. What say you unto him that shall
expedite the way: and make you happy (if
nature be not too much debilitated) in her
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:6652:123"/>
recovery? We shall be defective in nothing
that may further it, nor ungratefull to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall labour in it, said her Parents.
With which words <hi>Eschites,</hi> who tender'd
nothing more then the advancement of his
affectionate <hi>Philocles,</hi> became so encouraged,
as he undertakes, upon promise of their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to use his best endeavour for calling
<hi>Philocles</hi> home-ward.</p>
               <p>O said <hi>Androgeus,</hi> fruitlesse will be your
endeavour in an assay of that nature! Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
courses must not be so soone diverted:
Fancie can now have no place with him, I am
perswaded. So as you may to more purpose
desist from any such enterprize, then go on
with it. Be not so definite in your opinion,
nor so constant in your feares, answered <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites.</hi>
Admit his thoughts have entertained
any such conceipt, it is very likely he is not
setled in it: and then I am resolved, how <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles</hi>
time of <hi>Probation</hi> will be quickly expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and his purpose soone relinquished, when
he shall heare the least hope of enjoying his
<hi>Doriclea's</hi> affection. Howsoever, recommend
the carriage hereof to my care, and impute
the error to my neglect, if I faile in the cure.</p>

to enquire after one <hi>Philocles:</hi> you may
be pleased to know that one of that name so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
sometimes here with me: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the same whom you desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to finde, I
know not: but by his description you may
become better satisfied.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman whom I so much desire to
see answered <hi>Euphilus,</hi> was of a middle sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
black hair'd, and sanguine complexion;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:6652:125"/>
and to this Coast, as his friends are informed,
came he; where he was placed in a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
house, to teach, and educate his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
For though his fortunes promised faire
upon some expectance hereafter; yet his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
meanes were so short, that after some
short stay in the University, he retired into
the Countrey: for so free-bred and truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
was his nature, that he could not brook
beholdingnesse, nor relye on others depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
And I must tell you Sir, during all that
time wherein we remained together, &amp; equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
communicated our Studies one to another,
such infinite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent we mutually conceived in
one &amp; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> others company, as nothing appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either so gratefull to me, nor so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him, as the fruition of this Society. So
as in time we became Sworne-Brothers: no
lesse friendly then freely imparting what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comforted us, or by any other occurrent
crossed us, with such confident familiarity to
one anothers bosome, as our comforts by
partaking one with th' other became highly
augmented; and our afflictions, if any such
befell, sweetly allayed.</p>
               <p>This was an excellent argument of unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
friendship, said <hi>Androge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> and such as
deserves approvement with good men. It is
true, replyed <hi>Euphilus;</hi> but this happy ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
condition of ours could not promise to
it selfe any firme nor fixt continuance: for as
his disposition became disheartned by some
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:6652:125"/>
occurrents, so was he enforced to discontinue
those Academick Studies wherein he had so
commendably profited; and to embrace a life
much different to his humour, by accepting
the government of a private charge, as his
friends have been since enformed: a course, I
must ingenuously tell you, which his nobler
thoughts sometimes highly scorned: but there
we heare he was planted, and purchased that
good opinion of the Family where he resided,
as nothing could be accompted too deare for
one whom they so dearely loved.</p>
               <p>There is none that can more truly witnesse
the truth of that relation then my selfe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Androgeus.</hi> For into my Family (as
by your description I am satisfied) he was
hospitably received, affably entertained,
where he for a time lived, none more beloved.
But all this could not content him; for his
more ambitious thoughts could not containe
him, but out of a presuming confidence from
his too familiar entertainment in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he attempted the affection of my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
my only Daughter; one in whom I had
treasured my hopes: and her he solicits with
such instancie, as her indisereet affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to encline to fancie. Fortunes she had
profer'd her, which might highly advance
her; Suiters of eminent accompt, approved
repute, ancient descent in their Countrey; yet
could not all these decline her resolution
from that whereon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he had so strongly fixt
and firmely fancied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:6652:126"/>
Imagine then, good Sir, how this could do
lesse then highly perplexe her too carefull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
and consequently incense them against
his boldnesse: who out of too much presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
desisted from those grounds or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of education, to work in her easie dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
moving impressions of affection! This
resolves me nothing, replyed <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hilus,</hi> where
now <hi>Philogenes</hi> may remaine; whose fight I
so much desire to partake: and to whom I am
to impart such tidings as mainly concerne
him, and which by the just decree of Heaven
are very like highly to improve him.</p>
               <p>I must tell you, said <hi>Androgeus,</hi> and sorry
am I that I must be enforced to tell you so
much, that the goodnesse of his nature and
sweetnesse of his temper was such, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the distaste we took at this his presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
attempt to be great, and our indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
irreconciliable: he voluntarily left these
parts, and as he h'as since further informed
us, devoted himselfe to such a strict-regular
course, as now hee dis-esteemes all light
fancie, and made devotion his choice.</p>
               <p>Your usage, it seemes, answered <hi>Euphilus,</hi>
drove him to these extreames. And unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
you to requite his vertuous affection with
such disdaine. For I must tell you Sir, though
I make no question but your Family is anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
your fortunes faire and eminent, yet had
you knowne his fame and Family, as well as
you were acquainted with his fancie, you
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:6652:126"/>
would have held it no dishonour for <hi>Philoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues</hi>
to match with your Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Androgeus</hi> desired much to heare of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent;
which his faithfull friend <hi>Euphilus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in such manner, as it begot teares in the
Old-mans eyes; repenting much that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
one whose nobler parts so well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and whose generous and ancient linage
seconded those excellent endowments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he stood graced. And thus continued
these two their discourse, till such time as one
came to <hi>Euphilus,</hi> acquainting him how a
Page below would speak with him: which
broke off their conference for that time: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
next day to meet againe, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
of some course, that if too strict a tye
had not engaged him, he might be recalled, to
enjoy what he so much affected, and what
his own fame, family, fortunes, and fancy, so
well merited. Whereto sorrowfull <hi>Androge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
replyed, that a Gentleman of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,

effect, but whether likely to produce any
good end or no he knew not.</p>
               <p>Meane time, <hi>Euphilus</hi> goes downe to the

delivered a Letter written, as this Page pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,

               <p>Now, what was meant by this Letter, our
History must not as yet discover. Let it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that this Page was his own Secretary;
and had lodged <hi>Euphilus</hi> so dearely in his
thoughts, as he accompted it his highest
earthly solace to be admitted to his service.</p>
               <p>Returne we now to <hi>Androgeus,</hi> whom we
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:6652:127"/>
may suppose, upon this relation of <hi>Philocles</hi>
Fortunes and Family, to have his glowing
desires more inflamed to see him returne into
his Countrey. But doubtfull he remaines ever
to enjoy so much happinesse: for the Sea, as
he understands, h'as divided him; and his late
regular profession so confined him: asif his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
stood so affected yet could he see no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
to have it effected, seeing those vowes
(as he conceived, but herein deceived) could
not so easily be dispenced. And highly did
<hi>Androgeus</hi> admire the modesty of <hi>Philogenes:</hi>
who never all the time that he sojourned in
his house, would discover so much either
touching those possibilities which now his
fortunes had conferred on him, or that lineall
descent from whence he was derived. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
argument, surely, of a noble minde;
which desires rather to display his descent by
actions of desert: then arrogantly to boast of
the House from whence he descended; and
by his ignoble expressions to debase that
honour which was lineally derived. For what
is it to glory in guilded Earth; or to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
ones selfe in the generosity of his Race:
when Vertues, which should be the best Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
to distinguish a noble Stock, have lost
their impressure in him? For better is it to be
ignobly derived, and vertuously accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
then Nobly descended, and viciously
affected. And as every thing reteines his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of dignity in goodnesse: so holds it the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:6652:128"/>
same degree of ilnesse when it is abused: for
<hi>honour</hi> never looks so unlike it selfe as when it
is disparraged. But where <hi>descent</hi> and <hi>desert</hi>
meet, they present such a comely structure;
as it becomes an imitable president of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
And in these did <hi>Androgeus</hi> seirously
reflect upon <hi>Philogenes.</hi> So as, a double respect
may seeme mutually to ingage him: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
care of his Daughters cure: and a desire
to have her so matcht, as fame, fortune, and
family, with such loyall arguments of fancy
may joyntly meet.</p>
               <p>He vowes then never to oppose this solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
so his presence may cure her infirmity.
This induceth him to wish all faire successe
to <hi>Eschites</hi> faithfull endeavour; the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
issue whereof (though encounter'd with
some rubs) you shall understand hereafter.</p>

by offering unto them a survey of those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

incredible comforts, which if these relations

And were these deepe Characters of their

took her upon thy departure from her: and
how thy returne, if his judgement faile

               <p>This said, in a private disguise he addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
himselfe for his returne; to the end he
might with lesse suspicion repaire to his firme

with him, be satisfied whether the Coast were
cleare or no. And in short time might he make
his returne, seeing, whatsoever he pretended,

But the wayes of love, when they promise
most smoothnesse, are ever encounter'd with
sundry difficulties. This our <hi>Philocles</hi> felt,
who in his returne walking one evening on
the Sea-shore, to refresh his spirits with the
aire of the Sea, was had in suspicion by some
Seafaring-men for a Spy, and restrain'd that
night by command; with a purpose next
morning to bring him before a Justice, who
had given direction upon notice thereof, that
he should be safely guarded, and early next
morne he would take examination of him:
and upon what occasion he took such serious
survey of that Coast and Vessels within the
Roade. <hi>Philocles,</hi> as it fortuned, having been
formerly acquainted with this Gentleman
who should examine him (for they had been
Cöacademicks) and fearing much lest these
delayes might either be interpreted in him a
coldnesse of fancy, or towards his approved
<hi>Eschites</hi> an opinionate jealousie; to hasten his
departure thence, he prepared his way to this
Justice, in these lines.</p>

               <p>This Letter infinitely pleased the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but when he found it subscribed to by
<hi>Philocles,</hi> the Character pleased him so much
the better. In a word, so farre was he from
entertaining him as a Spy, as he familiarly
embraced him in the armes of a friend. His
Guarders were soone discharged: desiring
nothing more then to heare the relation of his
fortunes. Which done, after his earnest invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to stay longer with him, he accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
him with whatsoever might necessarily
befit him: &amp; with a friendly dismission wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him all happy successe in his love-assay.</p>
               <p>The next evening, he privately came to his
constant friend <hi>Eschites</hi> his house; with whom
he freely conversed, being satisfied by him
that all things were very like to second his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation:
and how nothing was more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
then his speedy and happy arrivall. Yet,
he told him withall, that he held it fitting
that he should not presently approach the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6652:131"/>
presence of his Mistresse, least she, who was
not as yet wholly recovered, by being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by his presence, might make relapse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her sicknesse: which to prevent, he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to prepare her by degrees, to the end his
unexpected comming to her, might through
an immoderate passion of joy, lesse occasion
her distemper. Meane time, while this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Artist was preparing way for his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
accesse to his Mistresse, he neglects not
that office which amity enjoynes him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to his Friend. For having heard where
his faithfull friend <hi>Euphilus</hi> lodged, whom
he so intimately loved; and that for his cause
he was there arrived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could not chuse but
expresse those loyall devotions which his
love so much deserved, and what his travaile
for his sake had so well confirmed. It is not
easie to relate what incredible joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the one conceived in the others presence:
wherewith <hi>Philo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>les</hi> seemed so intranced, as
in the end not able to containe himselfe any
longer, but out of the affluence of his joy, he
burst forth in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Deare <hi>Euphilus,</hi> I now perceive well that
the influence of those Divine Powers, whose
eyes are ever fixed on us, knowes best how
to attemper our greatest discomforts with
rayes of solace. Long it is not since we were
divided, yet during that small distance of
time, never did poore mortall encounter
with more extreames, nor taste lesse of hope,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6652:132"/>
nor partake lesse in helpe. Injoyned I was
to live where I did most loathe; and to be
estranged from that place where I did most
love. Divided I was not only from my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but restrained of my liberty. Those
whom I honoured most for her deare sake
whom I loved best, publish'd themselves my
profest foes: desiring nothing more then
to have me in pursuit; yea, and if the Lawes
would extend so farre, to bring me within
the compasse of my life to recompence the
constancy of my love. Yet behold! how by
the Divine Clemency this storme is cleared;
these menacing Clouds dispelled; these
foggy vapours dispersed; poore <hi>Philocles</hi>
released; his captivity to liberty reduced;
what he least expected now freely offered:
and that humane comforts might come
linked, as my former discomforts came not
singled: behold, a double blessing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
me! The presence of a firme Friend,
with the fruition of a faire Mistresse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euphilus</hi> no lesse rejoyced in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his <hi>Philocles;</hi> to whom, after he had
related the occasion of his repaire to those
parts, and mutually solaced themselves in the
repetition of their former pleasures and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
A Messenger from <hi>Eschites</hi> cut off their
further discourse: for now was <hi>Philocles</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to a more amiable task; the delightfull
visit of his <hi>Doriclea.</hi> The absolute comfort
whereof is more easily conceived, then delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6652:132"/>
for in discoveries of this nature, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ever becomes the best Painter. Let it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that their first salute closed it selfe in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
discourse was supplyed with long-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
looks. Tongues had theit tyes, while
affection became sole Prolocutor for the
heart. One that had seen <hi>Philocles,</hi> would have
thought that he had been some professed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist:
and that he was gathering the symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of her Malady by the motion of her
pulse.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Doriclea,</hi> though she durst not well
forget her Fever for feare of her Father, yet
she found in her selfe no such distemper, but
she might leave her Bed, and admit the style
of a Bride, so this dissembling love-errour
might free her from censure. Nor need she
much fear her Parents displeasure; for so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious

               <p>Yet like a discreet jealous Girle, fearing still a

with my <hi>Choice:</hi> yet must I reserve

youth, when our Studies were communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, but from that continuate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and expression of your love; all which
confirme me yours so long as I have life.
You have been this day a witnesse of my

seazed of her whom you sometimes so much
affected. I meane <hi>Valeria,</hi> one, who though
my Sister, preferred you in her conceipt

her meane fortunes could not content you,
or some aversenesse in her friends distasted
you; or some better hopes of preferment
have so possessed you, as <hi>Ualeria</hi> h'as lost
that place in your heart, which she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

must be content against her will to forego,
what she so entirely desir'd, and leave you

               <p>You reteine a worse opinion of me, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
then my true zeale and affection to your
vertuous Sister ever yet exprest. No, my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
friend, <hi>Ualeria</hi> never found <hi>Euphilus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
to this houre. I have preferred her

in my choice, &amp; fortified my resolves against
a change. Nor was it a weaknesse in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
that declined my love: but the meane
estate of a younger Brother which could not
supply us with meanes how to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This was discreet love, answered <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi>
those who truly love, make it the least
of their feares, how they may afterwards
live. But if that be the only let, I shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supply that want. I have not prized your
love at so low an estimate, as to accompt you
worthy so neare a gage as Brotherhood, and
then exclude you from sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

My Uncles providence shall be unto us an
equall purchase. Be not so unadvisedly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
as to refuse it; you shall accept it, with
her love to boot who may deserve it. And
when your rising hopes shall better furnish
you, then may your modesty requite it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This free and friendly offer forced <hi>Euphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
to reply with silence: which <hi>Philocles</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving;
<q>What, said he do you take this
curtsie so strangely, as if it were not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
office of amity, for friends to have
dependance one of an other in cases of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity?
Trust me <hi>Euphilus,</hi> were you in my
case, I should make bold upon the same
tearmes, to become a sharer with you in
whatsoever fortune with a more bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hand had bestowed on you. Neither
shall your desires be foreslowed; for with
your Parents leave, my deare <hi>Doriclea,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

and my Sister have so long wished, and from
which my aged Father hath not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Delay, answered the Page, breeds danger;
and marriages are the merriest, when they
come together. Pretty Wagge, replyed <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles,</hi>
but where must we finde a Bride? The
least feare of a thousand, answered the Page;
no doubt, but if my Master will finde a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,
and you prove as good as your word,
the Page shall finde one to make a Bride.
Wherewith, <hi>Valeria,</hi> who was supposed to
be <hi>Euphilus</hi> Page, discover'd her selfe to be
<hi>Philocles</hi> Sister: with this excuse, how it was
fancy, with a feare (for so report told her) of
a forraigne Intruder: both which, put upon
her that disguise, and prest her to that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and no immodesty (though too inlarg'd
a love may weare that Livery) that first put
that habit upon her. A generall joy was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
upon this discovery. For <hi>Philocles</hi>

our own Family none knowes of it:
which privacy was only intended for thy

thy selfe, but thou must unmask before the

I must have an hearty desire to take a taste of

               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:6652:139"/>
Thy virgin-modesty, answered her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,

               <p>Thus encouraged <hi>Doriclea</hi> her perplexed
<hi>Mellida;</hi> directing her in every passage what
to do: and advertising her withall, that if she
observed but two particulars, she could not
possibly erre in this Project: <hi>Silence,</hi> and

promiseth to observe: and that she will
not kisse him till she h'as married him: nor

said she, too much love make me forget, and
then I am sure my fame, fancy and fortunes,
shall fare the worse for it.</p>

she is in her desire to have her affectionate

provided: while every houre seemes a yeare

content which she cannot enjoy in a single

whom both youth and fortunes suited for

thankes he gives his <hi>Spurcina</hi> for her <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell'd</hi>

               <p>He holds it not fitting to spin out any need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
time for effecting his <hi>Doriclea's</hi> desires.
He findes too much passion in her lines, to
counterfeit with the disposition of her heart.
But there is nothing that makes delay seeme
more hatefull to him, nor fuller of danger;
then that some may become competitors in
his love; and by her Parents choice, leave
him in the lurch. This makes him stirre his
stumps, and to answer her Letter with such
speedy cheerefulnesse, as <hi>Mellida</hi> can expect
no lesse then all successe to her desires, and to

Neither was there any thing which

thoughts, then that witty device (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it) of suting herselfe in a disguise to
prevent her Parents aimes: which confirmed
the love she profest, and ingagd him to requite
her love in that which he esteemed best. And
that was his substance; wherein, like a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Bridegroome, he resolves so amply to

                  </gap>ffe her; as her large Dower might appear

But indeed this bounty of his proceeded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6652:141"/>
who cunningly told him, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to winne her Parents acceptance after
the private consummation of their marriage,
was to invest her in all his estate before their
marriage. Which would not only be a means
to reconcile them, but highly to inlarge their
bounty towards him. Nothing could be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
whereto <hi>Mardanes</hi> h'as not assented. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it easie to beleeve how he begins to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his crazy carkasse afresh. His crisping
and frizling Irons must be used; his bald head
with a ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ling Periwig furnished; a Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to sweeten his earthy savour prepared;
an Orange stuck with Cloves to restore that
breath which was wholly mortified. And to
publish to the world, that he reteines still
some <hi>colour</hi> of love, he displayes his light fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the lightest colours of loves livery. But
so improperly suited, as his antick habit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
him an unqualified Gallant. Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stands he devoted to his Glasse; and yet
me thinks he should not love it for presenting
him a face so neare him, which might rather
affright him then like him, if he were not too
much besotted on it, for his sake that owes it.
For so strongly had those amorous lines
wrought on his conceipt, as he verily thought
there was something in him which deserved
more love, then either his age could promise,
or the decayes of nature performe. Suppose
him them with as much speed as his Snaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
pace may afford him, addressing his course
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6652:142"/>
towards the place where his <hi>Doriclea</hi> is to
meet him, to consummate those Rites which
incomparably transport him. And meet him
she will, but not as a Bride, but a Maide to his
Bride: for they have chang'd their habits, to
make the Plot passe for currant: that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
in this mysterious disguise might passe
for her Maide, the Maide for her Mistresse.
For howsoever, <hi>Doriclea</hi> was sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to recommend the whole carriage of
this Plot to <hi>Solinus,</hi> who had exprest many
faithfull offices betwixt her selfe and her dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<hi>Philocles;</hi> yet being jealous how <hi>Mellida</hi>
would demeane her selfe in the presence of her

               <p>Love-aged <hi>Mardanes</hi> omits no time, nor
neglects no meane, but provides a Man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish

               <p>This was ingraven the very morning before
by <hi>Solinus;</hi> the perusall whereof did not a
little trouble <hi>Mardanes.</hi> But no sooner was
his <hi>Mellida</hi> unmask'd, then he needed no
<hi>Oedipus</hi> to expound this Riddle. Then but too

must be made of a necessity; and a poore ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Maid may well deserve your fancy. Not
altogether so poore, replyed <hi>Solinus;</hi> for if
she be poore, what will become of <hi>Mardanes:</hi>
who h'as infeoffed her in all his estate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
her in all the meanes hee h'as in the
world? Nay, said <hi>Mellida,</hi> he h'as indowed
me with the personall estate of himselfe,
which I preferre before all the world. And
would you have more, answered <hi>Doriclea?</hi>
Trust me, <hi>Mardanes,</hi> you shall finde more
true love in the Maid, then ever you could
have found in her Mistresse. The one could
give you an hand, but no heart: whereas the
other gives you both hand and heart. The
one was ingaged; the other free, and to your
love devoted. The one might live with you,
but never love you; the other can both love
you, and live with you. Never then in my
opinion did any Witch a better part, then in
bestowing an old fortune on a young heart. A
spirit that can dispose it, and not scatter it: as
your care was to provide and gather it. The
Bridegroome stood as mute as a Fish all this
time: till at last the <hi>Brazen-head</hi> spoke, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>What must be, must be.</hi> But he vowed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ever it were his fortune againe to match, he
would never buy a Pig in a poak, nor wed a
Wench in a Mask. But those that were there,
thought he might save that labour, for by
course of Nature he had married his executor.</p>

After they had accompanied them home;
broke the Bride-cake, and brought the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weldy
Bridegroome to his bed; wishing the
Bride good rest (being all she could possibly
expect) and advising her to take a good life of
that she had, to keep an hank of that she held,
and to supply the want of youth with the
wealth of age; they departed thence; while
<hi>Doriclea</hi> with many thankes commended <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
to his Cell; neare which her dearest <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locles</hi>
with his constant <hi>Euphilus</hi> purposely
retired to bring her home: who upon relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these unexpected newes to her Parents
and Family, rejoyced highly.</p>
               <p>Within some few Moneths, after an heavie
leave and hearty blessing, these two married
Couples returned into their Countrey; where
they were received with great joy by the
Gentry, who admired much the relation of
their amity: and whose constancy to this day,
reteines testimonies of their living memory.</p>
               <p>To close then our <hi>History,</hi> whose ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour
is truth, and consequently deserves to
be entertained with more trust: as <hi>vertue</hi>
playes her Master-prize in every noble enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;
so by her Princely presence and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attendance, these lived together lovingly,
loved neighbourly, and rejoyced mutually:
which happy Period is wished to all faithfull
Lovers by the Compiler of this History.</p>
