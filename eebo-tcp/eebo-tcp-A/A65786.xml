         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I doubt not of more powerful and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonabler
provision against that destructive
contagion of <hi>Pyrronism,</hi> which, not long since,
has begun to take fresh heart: Yet, hearing no
news of any publick Cauterization apply'd to that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> has rag'd now full two years; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
this silence of my Betters turn'd the task upon
my weakness, if not to avert, at least to open &amp; expose to be
torn in pieces by eloquenter Pens the injustice of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
impos'd on the whole Profession of <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
Reflect then O flourishing <hi>Englands</hi> fertilest hope! the
Joy and Crown of your Mother, whose beholding you - <hi>with
pleasure swells her silent breast!</hi> reflect, I say, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
ruminate what you strain to live and grow to; what
persons you hope and covet to become hereafter: whether
wise and skilful to govern Christian Life and Manners:
or a crew of Rhetoricians, pleasantly tattling unknown
and uncertain things; and betraying those under your
Tuition into all Precipices that fall in their way: For, for
<pb facs="tcp:95611:3"/>
such blind ones, and leaders of the blind, He sets you out
to the world, who inculcates to your <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Vanity
of Dogmatizing</hi> or promising <hi>Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not angry with the Man, who, with a great deal
of wit and an unfordable stream of eloquence (which will
ripen with his years) prosecutes what he proposes to
himself, and takes for a truth; not without some savour
of Modesty: for, neither does he derogote from Faith the
power of teaching its <hi>Tenets,</hi> nor disclaim all hope of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Science hereafter through a laborious amassment
of Experiments. But, he points to acertain person (whom
he owns his Master) that, giving us the Heads of some
Books he had written, thus concludes the second, <hi>Here it
is where the chief Foundations of Pyrronism are laid; and
that mainly establisht, that NOTHING IS KNOWN.</hi>
Well, indeed, may the Future despair, if the pains of so
may Ages have brought it but to this, that <hi>there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
known.</hi> Have, then, the so many magnificent stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of your Colledges been devis'd, only to delude the
People with a deal of pretty talk, not a jot advancive of
Reason? Have so many prodigious wits of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
been sent abroad over all the Christian World, but to
sell Smoak and Bubbles for Jewels &amp; Pearls? Have you
yourselves the patience to be till'd on through so many
years exercises, only to the like emptiness? Scorn and
hate that so foul a reproach should be cast on the Fame
of all past Ages, and present industry.</p>
            <p>But, what, at length, has enveigled into these conceits
that great Interpreter of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> a Man never to my
<pb facs="tcp:95611:3"/>
hearing, mis-spoken of, either for Wit, or Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
Since I'm utterly a stranger to his Privy-Councils,
I'le tell you what his Book seems to offer. There are two
Sciences contested about: <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Metaphysick</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which that of the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Morals</hi> take their
places). The First, content with few experiments,
surprises Truth by vertue of Demonstration, and
fixes it by that force which alone is inerrable, <hi>viz.</hi> the
power of our spiritual Intellect. This eye alone pierces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the strength of Contradiction; and is onlily certain and
necessary, as far as it scapes ore-shadowing by the senses:
but, it is not overlavish too, in making use of them; and
advances in growth by <hi>reflecting on it self its inmost
eye. Physick</hi> is more florid, and with a Vernal look, as
it were, sooth's our spirit inclin'd to Body. 'Tis more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
in Experiments, and meer Historical almost, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
assisted and forc'd into Rules by this its Companion.
That many court this gay one, no wonder, and slight her
Elder Sister as 'twere but dry leaves; whereas, yet, on her
'tis the Gallant depends, nor without her help and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
borrow'd from her, is able scarce to demonstrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing and advance by Causes connectedly. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this necessity has bin the ruin of this Author, and
many great Mens endeavours; nay, and will be, 'till the
utter despair of getting forward teach first a retreat back
again to settle Principles.</p>
            <p>Another rubb is the unbridled Impudence of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Moderns, who loudly crack of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi>
as oft as there falls occasion of setting themselves
<pb facs="tcp:95611:4"/>
out. They fill the Book-Sellers Shops with mighty Tomes:
they counterfeit the Highest knowledge by pompous skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
in their own schools; and by wonderful promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
enkindle the native ardour of Science. By these Arts
they heap on themselves the honours and fruits due to
Science; they flourish gayly and are propos'd to be ador'd
in the Chairs. Mean while, look but into the matter, and
those vast Mountains bring forth this solution of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<hi>perhaps I, perhaps No.</hi> Histories are related of
what the Antients, what the Moderns have thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
propos'd <hi>Thesis;</hi> petty reasons for the I or No are shot
out at random, as it were, from bands of Slingers or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:
so their Pages get bredth, their Tomes bulk: but,
when they come to give Judgment, out comes an Edict to
this purpose, <hi>All the Opinions are probable, but, this
last seems to me the more probable.</hi> What could be
look'd for more silly from <hi>Midas's</hi> ears? What blind
<hi>Tiresias</hi> could not as truly give verdict of Colours, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
'tis white, perhaps not?</hi> What wonder now is it, if
that ingenious Person derided such solemn trifles? And
imagining these men, because none contradicted it, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his secrets, wholy neglected and
contemn'd them.</p>
            <p>You, then, O Yong Branches, growing up into Wine to
rejoyce the hearts of Men! remembring that <hi>Vertue's the
Mean hedg'd in by both Extreams,</hi> neither disclaim and
detest <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor superstitiously adore and embrace
him. Those things he has demonstrated, though but few
and seeming contemptible, yet receive. 'Tis the nature of
<pb facs="tcp:95611:4"/>
Principles to appear vulgar and despicable; but there's
not a step can be made in Sciences without them. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Edifices lye buryed under ground, yet 'tis they
sustain the magnificent and towring fabrick. They that
slight <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Grounds must of necessity, being always
in quest of Principles, ever fall short of Science. Yet, far
worse than these are they who feign and profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Aristotelians,</hi> and are Ignorants the while in the
Method of Demonstrating, &amp; neglect what He prescribes:
Circumventers of Parents, Spiriters of Youth; whom,
enveigled with a shew of Philosophy, they betray to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and prattle: worst Enemies of the Commonwealth; to
which owing Youth adorn'd with Science &amp; Vertue, they
pay it foolishly-confident, sophisticate, and fitted by their
education to ill and good alike. For you, let <hi>Aristotle</hi> be
your Master, of few things indeed; but those such as
fructifie into thousands, <hi>viz.</hi> The whole race of separated
substances, the things necessary to be fore-known to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
contemplation, and judgment, in fine, of experiments.
You have now the Pleas of both sides: 'tis your part to
call aside into Council with you that Candour and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
which so weighty an affair deserves.</p>

            <head>An exclusion of
SCEPTICISM
AND
SCEPTICKS
From all Title to Dispute.</head>
            <head>First Plea. There is Demonstration and Science.</head>
            <p>1. SCepticism, born of Old by an unlucky miscarriage
of Nature, for her own Credit, carryed off the
Tongues of the Eloquent where it had long
been fostred, and buryed by the steddiness of
Christian Faith; this Monster snatcht from the Teeth of
Worms and Insects, <hi>Peter Gassendus,</hi> a Man of a most
piercing Sagacity, of neat and copious Eloquence, a most
pleasing Behaviour and wonderful Diligence, by a kind
of Magick has endeavoured to restore again to life. He,
a Person (which is the strangest of all) most tenacious
of Catholick Faith, and never suspected guilty of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Tenets: whereas, yet, this Scepticism is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95611:6"/>
of infinite Errors, and all Heresies, and that very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Philosophy and vain fallacy which the Saints,
warn'd by the Apostles, have taught us to beware of.
Heard, this man, otherwise eminent in his paradoxical <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
against the Aristotelians,</hi> has dar'd to expose, not
vail'd, as before, and wandring like a Quean in the dark,
but bold-fac'd and painted, to the Multitude and Market
place.</p>
            <p>By his Example, the Author of <hi>The Vanity of Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing</hi>
has produc'd her amongst us beauteously trick'd-up
in English: He, too, a great Master of Wit and Eloquence.
Nor indeed are vast mischiefs to be dreaded from Vulgar
heads. This is the occasion of my undertaking; and
this my Design (if Heaven vouchsafe to enlighten and
guide my pen) to force back into her Grave this Carcass
that would be rivalling Science, and deliver her up a Feast
to her former worthy Commoners. Come on then, let's
untie the knot of the Question.</p>
            <p>3. Since, then, 'tis of Science we are to speak, its <hi>genius</hi>
would in some measure be look'd into. Nature her self,
therefore, teaches us, that Man is an Animal endued with
<hi>Reason,</hi> to fit him for governing his Action, and <hi>Reason</hi>
is allowed to be That whereby what before was unknown
is rendred known: dayly Experience also convinces that
our Action consists for the most part in such things as are
subject to an infinite and insuperable mutability and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
whence it comes to pass, that that Vertue which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
to action cannot properly be called Science (since
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95611:6"/>
'tis not infallible, and the effect of demonstrative Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
but a power of conjecturing aptly; and uses
commonly to be term'd <hi>Prudence,</hi> either properly or
derivatively; properly, if it be concerning the thing
to be done, as to its right proceeding from Reason;
analogically, if of the action or thing to be done, as it
regards some other inferior Faculty subservient to the
dominion of Reason. Now <hi>Prudence</hi> depends on two
previous Powers, <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Inference</hi> or <hi>Experiment.
Art,</hi> though it ows its birth to Experience, yet is sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by universall and unfailing Rules: But, it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not the necessary and indefectible efficacy of
its Rule; but is content with the testimony of ever-corresponding
effects. Inference, or <hi>Experience</hi> for
the most part is true, but necessitates not assent, because
not universal.</p>
            <p>4. Setting this therefore aside, 'tis clear the Decrees
of Art, since she is veracious, have necessitating and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
connected Principles, which force the effect
of Art to be not possibly otherwise than as Art teaches
'twill succeed. Whence follows, that the subject
Matter of Science and Art is the same; and every Art
has a proper Science due to it self, if the nature of Man
would stretch to attain it. But, the same warning we
gave before concerning <hi>Prudence,</hi> must be repeated
concerning <hi>Science.</hi> For, as he who behaves himself
prudently in any Artifice, is not therefore esteem'd and
stil'd <hi>a prudent man;</hi> but only he who rightly tempers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95611:7"/>
his Action <hi>in as much as 'tis Humane:</hi> so, neither is
he, with propriety, to be called <hi>a knowing man,</hi> who
skills the demonstration of Duelling, or Versifying;
but he that has the demonstration of those things which
are Principles for governing our life, <hi>in as much as 'tis
Humane:</hi> The chief whereof is that which has merited
the term of Theology, or <hi>Metaphysicks:</hi> the next is
<hi>Ethicks:</hi> then <hi>Physicks,</hi> or Natural Science; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because all corporeal Natures, or the World, is
proposed to the disputation of men; or because, next
Metaphysical Contemplation, nothing so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
our desired Beatitude as Physicks. Nor yet
are <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to be excluded; both because <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
their subject, is the Vesture of those bodies which
Physicks speculate through; as also, because the Rules,
and as it were, the demonstrableness of Natural things
at every step depends on them. Out of all which 'tis
clear, that in nothing Equivocation more lewdly cheats
Man-kind, than in this term of <hi>Knowing,</hi> or <hi>Learned
men.</hi> For, if Masters in Sciences, analogically so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
are not really worthy this name: how much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off meriting so noble a Title are those, whose
ambition streins no higher than, like Parrats, to repeat
others sentiments? and how manifestly pernicious are
they that have the confidence to apply such learning
to the government of humane life; and vent poison,
or at best, smoak, under the Reverend name of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95611:7"/>
5. It follows, that such Science 'tis we propose to
our selves as is beneficial to Humane life. And
concerning this, three things offer themselves to our
enquiry. Whether there be at all any certainty attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
at least of one Proposition or one Reasonment,
which we call a Sylogism? At this hangs the next,
Whether at least, any Habit, or <hi>Series</hi> of more Truths
traced with certainty (such as generally are esteem'd
those which Arithmeticians and Geometricians profess)
may be acquired by humane industry? The last Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
by most (at least in practise) disputed (whate're
in words they pretend) is limited to Physicks and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks;
whether about the objects of these any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
Multitude of Truths may be spun out conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly;
as the Masters in Mathematicks seem already
to have done? And herein consists the usefulness of
my discourse; and the desparation or difficulty of this
Conclusion compels me to clear the former; which of
themselves by their own evidence had stood unscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
had not the step, and almost necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
they afford to the third, terrified those who
feel such difficulty to yield this last.</p>
            <p>6. To work, then; let us fix the first step, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
as invincibly known, and unshakable by any Art
of the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> that <hi>What is is,</hi> or that what termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
and specifies an Identical Proposition as its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is self-evident: as if we should say, that <hi>Peter</hi> is
<hi>Peter,</hi> Wood is Wood, a stone is a stone; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95611:8"/>
others carry as open-fac'd an Evidence. The
Scepticks I imagine, will laugh at this Axiom as foolish:
because Identical Propositions use to be excluded from
the rank of Scientifical ones, and the Sciences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as nothing at all advancing the understanding.
But, by this their very laugh they'l yield us the
Victory; as confessing Evidence in these, however
they be useless: And therefore that wherever the
same necessity shall Intervene, there cannot want E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
One thing in this position occurs a little
cloudy, obscuring it through a Mist caus'd by the
shadow of that most acute Person, <hi>Renatus des Cartes;</hi>
who, severely prying to descry the very first thing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under knowlege, beat it up at length to this,
that the first thing every one knows, is, <hi>that Himself
thinks.</hi> But, the difference of our Opinions, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
has sprung from hence, that, whereas Science
may be consider'd both in its Generation and in its
Subsistence; He has taken the former Method, I the
later. For, really, if we examine by what degrees
Science is born in us, we see, the first thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
is to have a passion made in us by Bodies; and
the first evident thing that strikes us is that <hi>we think.</hi>
But, if, looking upon Science now existing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as its
twere at rest in us, we enquire what 'tis that fasten
truth to our Minds, so that we cannot doubt or, as
were, waver about it: Nothing will appear more
simply or originally manifest then that <hi>what is is,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95611:8"/>
wherein, in a manner, is formally included that what
is so is, that, whilst it is, it cannot not-be; which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
is, that the understander is <hi>certain</hi> that the thing
is, or has a <hi>fixedness</hi> concerning the truth which is in
him.</p>
            <p>7. It being determin'd that an Identical Proposition
is evident, 'tis equally determin'd that Propositions
term'd <hi>self-known</hi> are evident: for, if they be look'd
into, twill be clearly seen, that a self-known Proposition
is in some sort composed of an Identical Proposition
and another otherwise evident, or taken for evident.
For, there are two sorts of self-known Propositions;
one wherein the Generical Notion is predicated of a
<hi>Species;</hi> another wherein the <hi>Species</hi> are predicated
divisively of the <hi>Genus.</hi> Take these for Examples:
<hi>A Man is an Animal:</hi> the sense is, <hi>A Rational Animal
is a sort, or one of the Animals:</hi> The evidence of the
Proposition consists in this, that the word <hi>Animal</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
as it were formally in predication, to be <hi>one
of the Animals;</hi> and the word <hi>Rational</hi> denotes that
whereby a Man is one of the Animals. Wherefore in
this Proposition, <hi>a Man is an Animal;</hi> these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
shrowd themselves, <hi>one of the Animals is one
of the Animals;</hi> and that other, that <hi>Rational is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer
of Animality:</hi> Now this later is not affirmed,
but taken for granted, either from Sense as it were, or
some other way supposed to be known and past doubt;
and in force of the former Identification, tis concluded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95611:9"/>
that <hi>a Man is an Animal.</hi> In like manner when 'tis
said, <hi>Number is either even or odd, Bulk is either finite
or infinite;</hi> and whatever Predicates, contradictorily
oppos'd, are predicated divisively of a Subject; two
propositions lye in them; one an Identical one, for
example, that <hi>even and not-even are all, or comprise all
the kinds of Number;</hi> and another otherwise known,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>such a Number,</hi> for example, <hi>Ten, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Number.</hi> This later is known as it were by sense;
or suppos'd, not affirm'd: The former is equivalent
to this <hi>all Number is all Number;</hi> and one of all the
Numbers, for example; <hi>Ten,</hi> is affirm'd to be one of
the even or odd, because, by force of the contradiction
between even and not-even, even and odd must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
comprise all Numbers, or even and odd and all
Number be the same.</p>
            <p>8. The same force of Identity is also clear in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism:
For example, when in the first Mood, or <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi>
two self-known propositions are taken and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truth, unknown before, is concluded out of them.
As, when tis argu'd that <hi>Every Man is a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because every Man is an Animal,</hi> and <hi>Every Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
is a living Creature:</hi> there's made an Identifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>living Creature;</hi> or rather it is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the double Identification of Animal with the
Superior and Inferior. The force therefore of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism
whereby it fixes the mind in this Identity, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Man is a living Creature,</hi> lies in nothing but this, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95611:9"/>
through the former two Identifications it rests fixed as
to the Premisses. Plain therefore tis, that the light of
an Identical Proposition shews it self both in self-known
Propositions, and in those which are concluded by
Sylogisms: and, which follows, either that the truth of
an Identical Proposition is not evident, or else that
self-known propositions, and such as are concluded
by a legitimate Sylogism are Evident and most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
and, that it cannot be doubted, so many truths
are palpably certain as can be reacht by a legitimate
deduction of Sylogisms. Since, therefore, he cannot
be esteem'd other than a Mad Sot that should deny
the Evidence of an Identical proposition; he cannot
be reputed Rational who should at all reject proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
self-known, or collected by legitimate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>9. Be this, therefore, a Demonstration <hi>a priori,</hi>
as they term it, of this truth, that <hi>there is some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
or Science;</hi> that, since tis undenyable that <hi>what
is is,</hi> or, an Identical Proposition is true, and every
Proposition, whether self-known or Sylogistically-concluded,
has no other necessity than what shews
it self in an Identical one; there can be no doubt
of these, unless Identical ones, too, be called in
question. For, since, in a self-known Proposition,
tis Evident, that the thing signified by one Term is
that which is signified by the other: And in a Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistically-concluded
Proposition, it likewise appears,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95611:10"/>
that because <hi>A</hi> is <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>B</hi> is <hi>C, A</hi> too is <hi>C;</hi> or that, unless
<hi>A</hi> be <hi>C, A</hi> will not be <hi>A;</hi> for 'tis not <hi>A</hi> unless it be <hi>B,</hi>
nor <hi>B</hi> unless it be <hi>C:</hi> 'Tis Evident that whatever is
evinced by a legitimate Sylogism, has the same necessity
as an Identical Proposition. Since therefore 'twere
meer perversness, and such as cannot fall into humane
Nature, to doubt whether an Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be true; tis absolutely manifest that whatever is
concluded by ligitimate discourse out of self-known
Propositions is engrafted, beyond any danger of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity;
or, that there is Science of all such like: And
therefore that <hi>there is some Science,</hi> and that, indeed,
of many truths. Now, that which either in a self-known
or in a Demonstrated Proposition, is assum'd
beyond Identical ones is not capable either of truth or
falshood; but, in a manner, is taken by way of snppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
as if 'twere said, <hi>if he be a Man; if it be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal:</hi>
I say, for as much as <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Animal</hi> are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Propositions or Premisses.</p>
         </div>

            <head>Second Plea. The Scepticks alledge nothing Sollid.</head>
            <p>1. NOw, to the Scepticks, or Scepticism it self.
What says the Sceptick? Though, says he,
nothing be certain, yet many things appear true to us;
and, out of such appearance we proceed to Operation.
Thou entanglest thy self, Sceptick! for, how, whilst,
in common, it most clearly appears to thee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is true; yet assertest thou, in particular, that
<hi>this</hi> appears to thee true? Can these two stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
it appears that none of those things proposed us
are true; and at the same time, it appears that some
of them are true? Besides, if any thing <hi>appears</hi> true,
'tis because it deceives us with the face and similitude
of certain or true, (which two, as to us, speak the
same thing; for, we say, that is <hi>certain</hi> which we know
to be true, or which is true to us): But, 'tis clear, we
cannot affirm any thing to be like another, if we know
not that other: If therefore, there be amongst us no
<hi>Certainty,</hi> or nothing <hi>known to be true;</hi> nothing can
ever be or appear <hi>like</hi> Certainty amongst Men. 'Tis,
therefore, stark folly to joyn these two togther, there
<hi>is</hi> nothing certain, or ther's no Certainty; and yet
some things <hi>appear</hi> certain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95611:11"/>
2. For all that, the Sceptick will stand to it, that at
least this appearance is enough for humane Action:
since all Action is singular, that is, in infinite Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
upon which Demonstration has no force, but
only Prudence, or the power of conjecturing which
is to be prefer'd before other. Notwithstanding, if
the Action be truly <hi>humane,</hi> that is, purely and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
govern'd by Reason, this Sceptical appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is not enough for it. For, first, since Prudence
is an Intellectual vertue, it cannot be indifferent to
Truth and Falsity; but always tenacious of truth. In
Action, therefore, govern'd by Prudence two things
fall under consideration; that which is most conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and spy'd by every one is, whether the Action be
like to attain its immediate and next end, to which
'tis destin'd: And this for the most part is uncertain;
but withall, in this consists not the primary effect of
Prudence, but a certain faculty of guessing, which
they call <hi>Sagacity.</hi> The other thing, wherein espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Prudence plays its part, is whether this Action
be to be done <hi>here</hi> and <hi>so:</hi> For which it suffices that
two things be certain; One, that the Actor is led by
no Passion; the other, that he has used pains, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
enough; which depends on the former; since
that will not fall short, unless some Passion makes the
Actor precipitate. But, as far as the soul proves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in these two, so much, too, she deviates from
the Rule of Prudence. Now, these two may be very
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95611:11"/>
clear to an experienced Person. Farther, this <hi>Tenet,</hi>
again, of the Scepticks fails of <hi>sufficiency for Action</hi> in
the very first root of Acting, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether any thing
be to be done, or whether Action be wholly to be
suspended: For, in vain the understanding tugs at it,
what Action to perform; unless it be first evident
that something is to be acted: They therefore, who
profess not so much as this is known, that something
sometimes is to be done, cannot be mov'd to Action
out of pure understanding. Nor can it be reply'd
that it appears to the Sceptick he is to Act: For, since
Appearing is common to true and false; Nay, since
'tis known that false is oft-times more probable and
apparent, than true; 'tis plain that neither Probability
in general, nor the greater Probability can have any
force at all to cause Assent. But, if one has not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to this Universal proposition, <hi>something is to
be done;</hi> 'tis plain that, as to pure Reason, he has no
principle of Acting: And, if he has any other principle
besides, Reason, the Action, as far as it springs from
that, is not Rational. It must therefore be concluded
that all action of the Scepticks is utterly not-humane,
but only Brutal; as rising purely from sense and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
Or, rather worse than Brutal; in as
much as they force Reason to submit to and serve
sense.</p>
            <p>3. But, that which highlyest crosses this Sect is,
that Professors of Science much undervallue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95611:12"/>
if they vouchsafe to dispute with them or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to hear them babble. For, since in all humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature,
no Sect is to be found more addicted to prattle,
and more greedy of that vanity which follows tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Cymbals: At what a distance will they be from
their Beatitude, if among the adorers of Science they
be not allow'd to vent their trifles? Let us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fairly weigh this, whether they are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among the Professors of Learning. Scientifical
Persons, then, are either Masters or Disciples; that is,
such as have already attain'd the habit of Science, or
such as endeavour after it, or are seekers of truth.
Since, therefore, tis plain, the Scepticks profess not
themselves Possessors of the Science; it remains they
are to be reckoned among the seekers; wherefore, since
this contradicts it self, that one should seek what he
thinks is no where, or at least, which dispairs possible
to be found; in vain they declare themselves Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
or seekers after Sciences. Add to this, that,
since they neither admit self-known Propositions, nor
any legitimate Consequence of Discourse; they have
no way or Method of seeking, or any trace from which
to commence their search: But, if they admit any of
these two, they cannot but acknowledge something
certain.</p>
            <p>4. It ought, therefore, be objected, at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
to such contemners of Sciences; what attempt
you? what's your aim? How have you the confidence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95611:12"/>
to attaque any one that's truly a man? For, whence
shall what you say derive any appearance? Is it not
just to press on you to prove first whatever you assume;
and this without ever coming to an end? You there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
will never be able to assume any thing that can
prove our <hi>Tenets</hi> false or uncertain. Again, will you
use any other form of Discourse then <hi>Sylogistical?</hi>
But, this you deny to be evident and certain. You,
therefore, come but to deride, sillily to play the Rooks,
and chatter figments like Poetical Magpies. You I
reply, perhaps, you dispute <hi>ad hominem</hi> (as they term
it), and shew, out of those things which our selves
have accepted, that what we teach thereupon has no
certainty. What's your meaning? If indeed you
endeavoured this in any one <hi>Tenet,</hi> it might be allow'd
you to try what you were able to do: But, if univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
you assert us unable to make good Consequences,
you call us Beasts and deserve not the hearing. And,
you your selves, how will you evince any one Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to be ill? Will you tell us how it ought to be,
to be good, you I say that grant none to be evident?
'Again, why will ours be false, and yours good? But,
if you affirm your own not good neither; what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
possesses you, that you cannot suffer us to rest
even in our Error; when you neither can nor strive
to exempt us from erring? Tis sweeter, sure, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one-self in the light, then to know one-self in
darkness and all light hopeless.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95611:13"/>
5. In fine, To what purpose do we amass Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against those, who, as far as in them lies, have
put off Humane Nature, and made themselves Beasts?
For, if <hi>to Reason</hi> be to advance our selves, out of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and known things, to things before unknown and
uncertain; and nothing be certain: neither is any
Reasoning possible; nor consequently any power of
reasoning; or <hi>Animal</hi> endowed with it. But, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be <hi>certain,</hi> nothing, too, will be <hi>true,</hi> since that
is <hi>certain</hi> which we <hi>see to be true;</hi> that is, truth had,
our Truth <hi>true to us,</hi> True by which we are true. For,
clear it is, that our Nature is covetous of Truth in it
self; that, when we or our understanding is true, being
impregnated with this Truth, it may be made opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and Master of all things without it; or, that it
may pursue useful things, fear such as are to be fear'd
contemn things contemptible, and reject all manner of
counterfeit scare-crows. He frustrates, therefore, the
whole bent of Nature, that denies there's any certainty;
and utterly evacuates, as Nature her self, so also her
most vehement desire and aim. What need I mention
Humane <hi>Conversation,</hi> but especially <hi>Negotiation?</hi>
for, if there can be nothing certain in Humane matters,
why do we instruct Infants and Boys? why strive we
to perswade Youth into those things which seem True
to us? for, if there be no certainty acquirable, tis to
be judg'd wholly indifferent what every Youth does,
or whither he tends: Especially, since not so much as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95611:13"/>
this is certain, that one thing is more probable than
another; and far less, that what now is more probable
will be so when the Boy comes to choose it.</p>

            <head>Third Plea. Tis imprudent to deny the existence of Sciences.</head>
            <p>1. LEt us raise our Style, and enlarge it to entire
Habits. Can it be believed, that men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
wits should be so fond as to deny those things that
Humane life is full of; and without which there's no
living, at least commodiously? I mean Arts. Let's
consider what part of our Action or Life is exempt
from their service: what Arts go to the providing us
Food, Cloaths, Houses, Delights? Our minds are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
with Liberal ones: the Fields, Mountains,
Seas are mastred by Arts. To conclude, What is there
that falls under mans use, wherein some kind of Art
is not exercised? Art, therefore, what is it, but a
Rule which commonly fails not? This, then (if mens
souls but own themselves) is certain, that <hi>Art, for the
most part, fails not.</hi> What if I should say, that it never
fails? but either the Artificer is unskilfull, or else,
through laziness or knavery follows not the prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Art, as oft as any Error happens. But, be
it so, that Art sometimes fails; at least, the whole
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95611:14"/>
course of our actions is grounded on this that, <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
it fails not: Wherefore since what never fails is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>Art,</hi> which in most cases never fails, in most cases
is certain; and whoever denies this, either out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or stomack, opposes himself to very Nature
and the Order of things. This is, therefore, a through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-attested
Truth, that there are intire and complete
Habits of Certainties: since, both of the several <hi>Arts,</hi>
in common, tis certain that for the most part they attain
their effect; and the same is as evident of the several
Members and Joints in each Art in particular.</p>

again is the steddiness of <hi>Attestatition</hi> to these <hi>Sciences,</hi>
of so many Ages, so many eminent Wits, by shewing and
perpetuating so many Effects, beyond the estimation of
humane Prudence; that there can be no doubt but
they winch against Nature it self that calumniate these
<hi>Sciences.</hi> Let's behold the multiplicity of Sylogisms;
the derivation of far distant Truths by intermediate
Propositions, immediate to one another; and how
many Principles or fore-known Truths are sometimes
made use of towards the search of some one: and we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95611:14"/>
shall see these <hi>Sciences</hi> will not sustain themselvs alone,
but extend their power to others also; and perswade,
nay, evince, that there's nothing but may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
if there want not Industry.</p>
            <p>3. Yet I am not ignorant what uses to be urg'd
against these <hi>Sciences,</hi> especially against <hi>Geometry:</hi>
which though in other <hi>works</hi> I have sometimes repell'd,
yet here too, as in their properest place, they are again
to be repeated; chiefly because the <hi>Scepticks</hi> no
where, in my judgment deserve more applause. For,
plain it is, though nothing be farther from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Geometricians</hi> than what the <hi>Scepticks</hi> lay
to their charge; yet nothing appears clearer in the
Terms they use, than what they mean not: <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
so ordering it, That those things which best
guard themselves by their own evidence should be most
infesed with prejudices; to warn us, in more obscure
points, not to desert evidence, though we be hard
put to't with weighty, perhaps, but obscure Argments.
For, what's more manifest than that Geometricians
require <hi>a streight Line to be drawn from one point to
another?</hi> That they dispute, whole Volumes full, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning
<hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Superficies?</hi> That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>a Line to be drawn out in infinitum?</hi> That <hi>a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
be made? An equilateral Triangle?</hi> And a thousand
such like: That none of all which, yet, can exist in
the world, 'tis either certain, or, at least, so ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that it ought not to be presum'd without Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95611:15"/>
whereas the Geometricians neither attempt
nor promise any such thing.</p>
            <p>4. Notwithstanding in all these, tis no hard matter
to satisfie an attentive Reader. For, I ask, whether or
why tis not lawful for a <hi>Mathematitian</hi> to speak univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
of his Object, in the same manner as both the
Learned and Unlearned talk of theirs? He may then
speak of the body proposed to him, as tis <hi>long,</hi> not
treating at all about it, as tis <hi>broad;</hi> since for a Body
to be <hi>broad</hi> is nothing else, but to be <hi>long according to
two Dimensions.</hi> In like manner, since a Body to be
<hi>deep</hi> signifies it to be <hi>long according to three Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
what an envious part 'tis not to allow the same
to be considered as <hi>broad,</hi> abstracting from the third
Dimonsion? These things being clear to the utmost
pitch of evidence; and so that we cannot speak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
according to Nature; let's see wherein lyes the
fault of the Geometricians. You urge that they assert
there is a <hi>Line</hi> in being, that is, <hi>Longitude without
Latitude;</hi> I deny it: You prove it, alledging they
mark a <hi>Line</hi> with letters, saying the Line <hi>A. B.</hi> I
demand, to what purpose serves this marking? Is it
for any thing but to notifie the Longitude of the Body
they measure? If that be all, then the sense which serves
the Mathematicians turn in the word is, that the Body
propos'd, according to Longitude, is equivalent
to the distance between <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> And, if he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
any more, it must of necessity be something
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95611:15"/>
impertinent to his Discourse, which Geometricians, of
all men, are farthest from.</p>
            <p>5. The very same may be said for their manner of
speaking concerning a <hi>Superficies.</hi> But, for <hi>Points,</hi>
the solution is more evident: For, in stead of this
word <hi>the Point A,</hi> or <hi>the Point B,</hi> put the word <hi>End</hi>
or <hi>Term,</hi> and there will remain no shadow of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For, who can doubt but that a Body, <hi>as Long,</hi>
is terminated: and therefore can forbid an End or
Term to be assign'd it? For the rest, 'twill easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the like Discourse serves: For, when he demands
a Line to be produc'd <hi>in infinitum,</hi> the clear sense of
the Geometrician is to have it drawn out as far as is
necessary for his work; which never does or can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to require it actually infinite. Not an <hi>infinite,</hi>
therefore, but an <hi>indefinite Line</hi> the Geometrician
asks; that he may use any as big a part of it as he needs.
In like manner, if he demands a Circle or streight
Line to be made; 'twere fond to think he expects
them scor'd out Mathematically on Paper or Sand:
Since the Demonstration he intends is Universal and
exists in the understanding only, not in Paper. It suffices
therefore, that the accurateness of the Circle or Line
be in his Mind, to which the paper yields a phantasm;
a weak one, indeed, but fit enough to delineate the
rigorous form in his Mind. Some, too, will not allow
a Line can be cut just in the middle. Nor do I deny
this to be petty work of Geometry: But, neither do I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95611:16"/>
expect the Scepticks should be able to prove this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible:
And therefore, against a perfect Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
such as <hi>Euclid's</hi> is, to listen to slight-bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
reasons were to trifle, not philosophize.</p>
            <p>6. Is not this hugely remarkable, or rather to be
admir'd? That those things which advance Geometry,
above other Sciences, in a great measure are false; taken
for granted in order to use, but not credited for Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
For, Mathematick is not certainer or more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than other Sciences; but easier and more adapted
to fancy, not understanding. For, if in Geometry
we were still to use strick Terms, and always to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
<hi>this Body, as long, abstracting from its Latitude,</hi>
or, <hi>as broad, abstracting from its depth,</hi> the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
losing that inveiglement of clearness by
which it tills on the reader, would be but tedious
work. Now, because we may use the names of <hi>Points,
Lines,</hi> and <hi>Superficies,</hi> as they were Things; and,
according to this gross apprehension, make visible
Figures: Geometrical truths strike almost our very
corporeal Eyes. Whether as much may be done in
other Sciences, at least as to some part, is not
yet clear; but, from the way of <hi>Algebra,</hi> it may be
conjectur'd not utterly out of the reach of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
            <p>7. This, at least, may passe for evident, from the
manner we have expressed of the Geometricalcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation:
that the Geometricians use to draw
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95611:16"/>
their Consequences and Positions, not from the sounds
of their words, but the Notions in their minds. But,
herein kind Nature has been indulgent to those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines;
that they are excus'd from any necessity to
resolve the Equivocation of their terms: but having
once explain'd them, they may, without any rub, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
whence we see that if at any time, they are put
to explicate their words, Geometry grows even as
troublesom as Metaphysick: as appears in that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
bandy'd concerning an <hi>Angle of Contact;</hi> because
they reflect not that an Angle speaks a <hi>Quantum,</hi>
whereas yet they confess it cannot exist without a
space. Plain then 'tis rendred that the first task in
the other Sciences is, to make the question clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the opposite Parties, not only in Term, but
also in meaning: and that this is the main fault of
the weak Managers of other Sciences, that they stick
obstinately at using the words in a fore-received sense,
and that no clear one; nor can be bronght to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
about their explication.</p>
            <p>8. It must be concluded, that, in Physick also and
Metaphysick, there's a capacity of infinite Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
if industry be not wanting. For, who is
so senselesse as pertinaciously to deny, that a formal
Sylogism may be made ev'n about the Subjects of these
Sciences, or, when made, is of force? It must, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be said, either that the Discoursers in these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines
cannot comprehend their own meaning, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95611:17"/>
declare what they feel in their mind when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
such words: or else, that they may reduce
them into a Sylogism and breed Science. Plain too,
it is, that, in that part of Physick, which is truly call'd
such, <hi>viz.</hi> that which treats of sensible Qualities, not
so subject to obscurity through the equivocalnesse
of the Terms, Demonstration will cost lesse pains:
in Metaphysicks 'twill prove harder, because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
the words are, the more they are subject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation.
But, on the other side, because, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
the things treated are, the simpler are their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and consequently, more evident the connexion
of the terms: Demonstrations in Metaphysicks must
needs be most evident and secure, and such as deserve
the evidence of all other Sciences should depend on
them.</p>

         <div n="4" type="plea">
            <head>Fourth Plea Refells the Preliminary Objections.</head>
            <p>1. NOw we must give ear to the Complaints,
(shall I call them?) or rather Reproaches
of the Scepticks: though themselves are no slight
Causes of those ills which they object to the Lovers
of Dogmatizing; who, whilst they even acknowledge
it the entire work of a Man, and one minding his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95611:17"/>
businesse too, to dilate the bounds of any Science;
themselves, pursuing mean studies and the applause
of a smooth-tongue, strive, under pretence of impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
to avert from that Heroick thought the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifically-dispos'd
<hi>Genius</hi> of others. Yet, would they
do even this but solidly, I should think it pardonable:
but, if they fall not on this neither in a legitimate way;
how are they not to be exploded? Now, perhaps, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of mis-seekers may be more; but Ile content my self
with the proposal of three. Let the first be of those
who seek things incapable of Truth; or who, of that
which has no being at all, enquire how it is or may
be made: as if one should require a Triangle, equal
to an assign'd Circle, to be inscrib'd in it. Let the
second be of those, who complain that those things
are unknown, which, though true in themselves, are
yet, either, absolutely, or at least as yet, out of the reach
of human power: as if one should be angry that the
Wars or Government of the Planetary Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
(supposing those Globes planted with Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Creatures) are unknown to us. For, 'tis fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to quarrel at our ignorance of such things, for
reaching the knowledge whereof Nature has afforded
us no Ladder of Accidents. The last defect is of such
as lament those things are unknown, which, by honest
industry, may be searcht out, and will, if the ardour
of inquisition grow ripe. For, 'tis ignorance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to allow no time for encrease of Sciences.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95611:18"/>
Amongst these I reckon not those <hi>self-tormentors,</hi> who
fret that those things are unknown, which are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
known to others, but unknown to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
upon some extrinsecal prejudice, they neglect
inquiring into what others have said: which race of
Men is, at this day, most frequent among the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Science; but withall most insufferable: For,
what can be viler than to shut the eyes against things
most manifest to the understanding; upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of such as profess they know not these things
which others constantly affirm are most evidently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended?</p>
            <p>2. Let now the Complaints themselves speak, <hi>viz.</hi>
Those with which the <hi>Contemner of advancing Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically</hi>
has stuft his 3, 4, 5, and 6 Chapters: But,
first lets examine those things which he indulgingly
reproaches. They are the two, as it were, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<hi>Ne plus ultra</hi>'s of Philosophers, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Causes of <hi>the Seas Ebbing and Flowing,</hi> and of
the Wonders of <hi>the Load-stone.</hi> Ile endeavour to
look into them severally. And, as to the first, though
that may well be reckoned among the things whose
Accidents are not-yet-enough comprehended by us;
and therefore I might justly exact that they, who
think it incomprehensible, should take care to have
the <hi>Phoenomena</hi>'s clear'd, and teach us, by just calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Seamen, what dayes, in the several Regions,
the Sea Ebbs and Flows happen: Otherwise, I may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95611:18"/>
deservedly lay the blame on industry, and excuse Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy:
Yet I will not proceed so rigorously with a
courteous Adversary; but argue, that These things
may be convinced concerning this vicissitude of the
Sea: That the motion is caus'd by an extrinsecal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
That that is no other than the winde: That
what rules the windes is but various aspects of the Sun
and Moon to the divers Climates of the Earth. Which,
if they be true, if evident from the <hi>Phoenomena</hi>'s; what
remains, but that the <hi>Phoenomena</hi>'s be more acurately
traced; and the ignorance of particulars laid to the
charge of Industry, not of Art: and so Philosophy scape
scot-free?</p>
            <p>3. Lets run over our Proposals one by one. The first
is that the Seas motion is from something extrinsecal,
or without it. This is Demonstrated by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in
his Books of <hi>Physicks;</hi> as they who have studyed him
know: The <hi>Dialogues,</hi> too, <hi>De Mundo</hi> have made
this some part of their pains; and, if a proper place
for it occurs in this Treatise, I shall not be loath of my
labour to explicate the same again: here this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be assum'd, not prov'd. That the Author
of this motion is the winde comprehends more than
one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the winde is a sufficient stirrer
of the Sea; and that it, in particular, concurs to this
motion call'd the <hi>Flux.</hi> As to the first part, (not to
mention how many Deluges or overflowings of the Sea
have infested the Coasts by the windes help), we need
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95611:19"/>
not travel beyond the <hi>Thames;</hi> in which, almost
every Winter, the Flood happens, sometimes more
than once in a day, to be beaten back or pour in more
abundantly than ordinary, to the overflowing the
Streets in the Subburbs of <hi>London,</hi> That, again, the
Winde causes this course of the Tydes, besides the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
which the perpetual West-Winde, flowing
from the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> carries
with it; the Six-months strong Currents, which take
their turns constantly backward and forward between
<hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> conformable to the Windes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
keeping the vicissitude there, are a manifest
testimony. Add to these, that, through the whole
Coast of <hi>China,</hi> certain Tempests, with most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Rains and overflowings of Rivers, are daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
at the New and Full Moons; whence the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of the Fluxes at the same just periods is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.
Now, that the Windes and Rains and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Storms depend from the Sun and Moon is so
notorious that 'tis past contest. These things, then being
clear; the causes of <hi>Ebbing and Flowing</hi> cannot be
obscure: though the certain Compasses they fetch be
unknown, because the observations of them are not-yet
exactly calculated.</p>
            <p>4. Nor is the <hi>Magnetical Philosophy</hi> less evident,
if we'l have but patience to look into't by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.
For, it cannot be doubted, from the sudden
turning of Iron-tools fit for the purpose, and other
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95611:19"/>
Bodies apt for Magnetical direction; but that power
of Direction, which we call Magnetical, is attaind by
a flux of unperceivable Atoms deriv'd from one Body
into another: And as little, that because a perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or horizontally-sidelong position of the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
body is apt to beget in it that vertue; the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Magnetical body is the Earth we tread on, or at
least the crust of it next us. Nor, again, is it questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
from the perpetual Motion of corruption
and generation of this Magnetical vertue in those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
but there is a certain perpetual flux of Atoms
upwards and downwards, as also between the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and the Poles; whereby this vertue is infus'd and
fed. Neither, again, will any stick at it, that the
Magnetical Body, if it be set at full liberty, must be
carry'd according to the flux of the like Atoms; as that
which swims in a River follows the violence of the
stream: and consequently, the declination, too, or
variation of the Needle point out the Channel of the
Earth's Atoms, which are proper to it. All which if
we solidly remark, and pursue with a steddy discourse;
I see not what great Mistery lies in this Magnetical
vertue and operation, beyond possibility of bringing
clearly to light. These secrets, therefore, of nature
were, heretofore, like the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> undiscover'd;
but now, themselves attest not the defect but proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Science. These then thus touch'd on, let us fall to
the Objections themselves.</p>

            <head>Fifth Plea Refells our Ignorance of the Soul and Sensation.</head>
            <p>1. IN the third Chapter, therefore, of his most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Discourse, he objects our ignorance of that
thing we ought to be best acquainted with, <hi>viz.</hi> Our
own souls. Concerning which, what a kind of thing
'tis in this our earthly habitation, he neither teaches
nor enquires at all, as far as I can discern; only that
it <hi>is,</hi> he asserts, may be most clearly gathered from its
effects; but, to ask <hi>what it is,</hi> he saies is like the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of Infants, that look behind the Glass for the
Body whose <hi>superficies</hi> they saw painted on its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
And, in my judgment, he had said rarely, had he
stopt here: but in his following <hi>Questions,</hi> he shews
his deficiency even in this. For, he asks farther, whence
the Soul comes? and how tis united to the Body? He
is therefore most manifestly detected, to think that the
Soul, lying hid in the Body, is of it self a certain sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which may directly be made, come, and be
joined to another thing: whence he terms it <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,</hi>
which doubtless denotes a <hi>Thing</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
Now, that this is a most important error in
Philosophy none can doubt, that's able to discern the
opposition of <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Many.</hi> For, tis plain, that either
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95611:20"/>
               <hi>a Man</hi> is not <hi>a Thing;</hi> or else that his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>
are not <hi>two Things;</hi> if one thing cannot at once be
many, nor many one. Nor am I scar'd with the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(which the Boys that gabble Philosophy have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready in their Budget) of a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi>
thing: which saies just nothing, unless <hi>imperfect</hi> signifie
to which somewhat is wanting to make it a thing; which
suppos'd, an imperfect thing is not a thing, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
vanishes. Otherwise, the same cannot be one
thing and more things: Wherefore either a Man is not a
Thing, but a Pair of Things consisting of an Intelligence
and a Beast; or his Soul and Body are not two things.</p>
            <p>2. When, therefore, he asks, Whence comes the
Soul? it must be answered with a question, Whether
he doubts whence the man comes? For, if whilst the
man lives, there be but one only thing which is call'd
the <hi>Man,</hi> 'tis he alone can have come; and he beats
the wind that enquires whence the Soul comes? Nor
am I shaken with the <hi>Authority</hi> of our Fore-fathers,
though never so Reverend: I mean not of those who
profess themselvs unable to grapple with the Question;
for these deliver the Candle into the hands of Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
advising them to pursue on the same Race, that it
may be seen whether any thing purer occur to them
than to themselves, ready to Patronize whoever shall
clear the Truth. But their opposition I resist, who cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
'tis the Faith of all Churches that Rational Souls
are fram'd by God. For, now I'm accustom'd to it, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95611:21"/>
between what's due to the sincerity of Faith,
and what to Scholastical subtilty. If I attribute the
Making of Man, as he's Intellectual, to the singular
power and operation of God, I have submitted my
self to the keys of the Churches Doctrine, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
to the Tradition of the Saints. But, whether
that action, which is the Generation of Man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of two actual parts, or be but one alone, by
more notions equivalent to more really-distinct actions,
is a purely speculative Question belonging to the
Schools. And so it must be said that one Thing, a
Man, equivalent to a Beast and an Intelligence, is
brought into existence, by one action, equivalent to
two, the Generation of an Animal and the Creation of
an Intelligence.</p>
            <p>3. By this truth we are led to the evident solution
of the two following knots; the econd being how
the Body and Soul are united? Which, 'tis plain,
is herein faulty, that it supposes two things <hi>to
be united existing</hi> either before the Compound, or
not destroyd but ty'd together in it: which is clearly
false, not only out of the 'fore-declared Truth, but
also out the definition of a Part. For, Parts are call'd
such, whereof, by a Motion, call'd Composition, one
thing is made; or into which, what was one is resolv'd
by Division, or destruction of the Unity. Now,
Unity, not Union, is the form of what is One: And,
in that which is One, to seek for the colligation or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95611:21"/>
cement, is to seek by what the same is made the same.
The same Error runs through the following Difficulty,
which laments that 'tis unknown how the soul moves
the Body: Which is utterly knock'd on the head, by
denying the soul moves the Body. For, true it is, that
one animated Member moves another; but not, that
any substance, which is a pure soul, moves immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any Member in which the soul is not. I appeal to
other Animals, in which there's frankly denied to be a
Soul independent of the Body: and I desire to have
shewn me what motion there is in man, which is not in
them. I confess freely, that one Member, the Brain
especially, moves the rest after another manner in Man,
than in other Animals; and this by reason of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in their Souls: but first it ought to be made
evident by experiments, that a Humane Soul, without
the help of the Body, or some Member acting together
with it, moves another Member; before we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the manner how this either is or can be
done.</p>
            <p>4. The last darkness which he bemoans in this
Chapter lyes in our ignorance of that Motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the spirits are deriv'd out of the brain into the fit
Nerves for the Animal's natural Action. And, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Objection brandish an Argument common
to all Animals, I should soon quit the field: for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my self not so skilful in Anatomy, that I can lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eyes, why, from the Motion of Anger boyling
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95611:22"/>
in the heart, the spirits should start into those Muscles,
by whose streining the Animal is carry'd towards its
Adversaries; and, from the Motion of Fear, spirits
flow into the opposite Muscles, by which the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
flies fromwards them; whereas they, in a manner,
add strength to and enforce both alike. Yet, I make
no question at all but, by force of the Brain's Motion,
caus'd by the motion of the heart, it comes to pass that
the entrance into one sort of Channels are shut, others
opn'd, and that thence comes this admirable and
as-yet-not-sufficiently-seen-through direction of the
spirits. But, the Authors seems to make Mans case
proper to himself; alledging Will, and perhaps Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be, as it were, the first Author of this direction.
Still, therefore, he slips into the same Error. For, first,
he should demonstrate some act of the will, without
some either precedent or concomitant Motion of the
Heart, (which, when tis violent, we call <hi>Passion;</hi>
when we endeavour at any thing, <hi>Desire</hi> or <hi>Flight,</hi>
or some other such like we stile it): But, if there be no
such, then the cause of this direction is purely Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
as he calls it, and not any certain inexplicable power.
Now, that there cannot possibly be any such exempt
act of the will, 'tis clear enough to them who allow
ther's no knowledge without a beat of Phansies: For,
Phansies cannot chuse but both be stird themselves
and stir others, by the usual ways of Nature. By
Motions, therefore, deriv'd from the heart, whether in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95611:22"/>
Man or in Animals, all Motions, whether Natural or
Free, Universally are perform'd: and, by consequence,
are subject to the contemplation and scrutiny of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
and acurate Mechanicks.</p>
            <p>5. The fourth Chapter objects that the Natures
of <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> are inexplicable. As to the
former, first he acknowledges the substance of sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is seated in the Brain alone: Then he inclines to
<hi>Des Cartes's</hi> fantastical conjecture, shall I call it, or
deviation from the manifest footsteps of Nature; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Motion's being brought down from the Heav'ns
to our Eyes, through the continuedness of a very
thin <hi>Ether:</hi> But, because he esteems <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
too, not incredible, I may be excus'd from that
speculation. At length, therefore, he falls again into
the old Error, enquiring how corporeal things can
have any force upon a naked Spirit? He supposes
therefore, the Soul in the Body to be a kind of <hi>thing,</hi>
not the form or affection of the thing, <hi>Man;</hi> and so, is
upon the same false haunt again, nor needs repeating
former discourses to beat him off it. But, left he should
say nothing new, he objects that, by sense alone;
there's no discerning the Quantities, Distances, Figures
and Colours of things. I wonder, I must confess, at
these Objections from a curious and ingenious Man;
things so clearly explain'd &amp; demonstrated in <hi>Opticks.</hi>
Who is so ignorant, that he knows not that bigger
things, at the same distance, strike the eye in a more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95611:23"/>
obtuse Angle and stronglier? Who knows not that
Figure, if plain, as objected to the eye, is nothing else
but <hi>Quantity</hi> more spacious or contracted this or that
way? but, if it be a solid one and participate of the
third dimension, it borrows its variety from Distance.
Again, that Distance is nothing else, but a certain
Magnitude spread between the Eye and the Object;
which if it be past judging of, neither can the Eye at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
the distance. Lastly, that Colour is nothing else,
but the confused figuration of a <hi>Superficies,</hi> according
to its parts undistinguisht to sense. Whence it remains
clear, that the Eye needs no other <hi>Geometry</hi> for all
these, than what is necessary to judge of a magnitude
from the variety of an Angle.</p>
            <p>6. His next pains is about <hi>Memory.</hi> To shew the
explication of that impossible, he commemorates and
rejects four waies of resolving it. I must take another
path than any of those. First, I must weaken this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that <hi>If any thing about Memory has not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been explicated, we must therefore make account
it never will be,</hi> or that <hi>'tis impossible to be explicated.</hi>
We must be aware too, that alwaies some things will
be unknown; either because their trivialness merits
not the pains of learning them; or in that at length
the bulk of things known will be grown so great, that
more will be burthensome to the understanding.
Now, to complain of such like is to have forgot human
shortness. What, therefore, seems my task in this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95611:23"/>
Queston is, to bring into play those things which are
already establisht and evident about memory; and,
for those that are unknown to make an estimate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
some time or other, they too will come or merit
to be known. First, then 'tis evident, we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
what is <hi>Memory</hi> and what <hi>Remembrance.</hi> For,
<hi>Memory</hi> is only a Conserving of the impressions made
by the objects, whereby the Animal is rendred able
to use them when he lists or needs. But, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
is a certain Motion whereby that power of
using the impressions is reduc'd into Act and Use.
Concerning Memory, therefore, a reason is to be
given both of its station or rest, and of the causes or
manner of its Motion: and of both, if I be not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
Nature and Experience offer evident footsteps, for
tracing them.</p>
            <p>7. In the first place, that all things that move the
sense have certain minute particles of their body shorn
off; as to the Touch, Tast and Smell, is too notorious
to abide contest. He that denyes the same force to
the Light, returning from the things to our Eyes,
must deny, too, that the Sun extracts exhalations from
the Earth and Sea: there being no other diversity in
the operations, but that the one is greater and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the other weaker and less. Now that these Atoms
get up to the Brain, by the waftage of the Spirits, (that
is, a certain liquid and most subtil substance) can
scarce be denied by one never so pievish, that's but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95611:24"/>
put in minde how Waters and Oyles are impregnated.
These Atoms, therefore, must of necessity strike, not
without some violence, upon that part of the Brain,
whose being-struck causes perception. Again, that a
stream or any thing liquid dasht against a resister
should not leap back again is most clearly repugnant,
both to experience and reason. And, that a substance
any thing viscuous, in a viscuous vessel besides (such
as those are about the brain) being repuls'd, should
not stick to any thing solid is equally impossible: as
also, that a notable part of that stream should not cling
together, is against the Nature of gluyness. The
Walls therefore, of the empty and hollow places of
the Brain must of necessity be all hang'd and furnisht
with little threads. Conclude we, then, that through
all the senses, except Hearing, the Animal is enabled,
by Atoms constantly sticking in it, to make use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of the Impressions made by Objects. In fine,
since sound is made by a collision of the Air; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by Anatomy, that it drives the Hammer of the
Ear to beat upon the Anvil, by which beat 'tis not to
be believ'd but certain particles must fly off and strike
the Fancy: the orderly storing up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, of these
is apt to constitute the Memory of sounds. The stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
then, of <hi>Memory</hi> (if I am not mistaken) is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
enough declared.</p>
            <p>8. I cannot see why the like track may not carry us
to the explaining of the Symptoms of <hi>Remembrance</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95611:24"/>
too; or why their Solution should be desparate. For,
there's nothing clearer than that the fore-explicated
motion of the Atoms is set on work by a wind, as it
were. For, that <hi>Passion</hi> is a certain ebullition of Spirits
reeking out of the heart, tis visible even to the eies, in
Anger, and Love, and Bashfulness. If we make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
what effect these motions have on the Fancy, we
experience, that those Objects occur to the mind, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously
and all on a heap, as it were, which solicite
these Passions; so hastily and in a huddle, that they
prevent mature weighing. It appears, therefore, that
the Atoms, rouz'd from their places by such like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
fly about the cognoscitive part, in a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
tumble. If then, there are certain winds and
blasts, which we call Motions of the appetitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
is it not plain, that the cavities of the Brain will
be brusht, as it were, and the Images sticking to the
wals be moved to the place destin'd for attaining their
effect? And that these Atoms are carried neither
meerly by chance, nor yet in a certain order, is evident
by this; that, upon inquisition, the things we seek
for do not suddenly and perfectly occur; which were
a sign of election; and yet manifestly, such abundance
of them suit to our purpose, that tis clear, they could
not run thus without any industry at all. As, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when we treated of directing the Spirits into the
Nerves, we allowed the several Passions each their
waies into certain parts of the Brain: so, here, tis also
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95611:25"/>
manifest, the same Passions have the places and <hi>series</hi>
of some certain Atoms, in a manner more obvious to
them, than others.</p>
            <p>9. But our new admirer of Nature is perplext, how
this multitude of Objects, swimming in the cavities of
the Brain, should possibly be, without entangling and
confounding one another: and by what Art they
shift out of one anothers way, so as to be able to keep
humane knowledge distinct. And here, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I had need crave the help of a <hi>Machine:</hi> for,
really, we have no Candle, nor Spectacles enabling us
to look into the subtile paths by which the Atoms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
and slip by, to escape ruining one another by
shocking. But, in exchange, I ask how many Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
(which Philosophy now questions not to be
Bodies) pierce streight to our eies, through the vast
continuity of Air, and so many little Bodies flying up
and down in it? There's no body, if we credit Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and Reason, without its steams, and a sphere of
vapours derived from it: How do these steams find
free paths to run in and attain such wonderful effects?
The Magnetical, Sympathetical, and smell-producing
streams, have not their courses broken, or ends inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by one another. They that have not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to deny these, why are they loath to allow the
same may happen in the wide passages of the Brain?
But you'l reply, that to multiply a difficulty is not to
salve it; but to profess the rest of Nature inscrutable,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95611:25"/>
when tis our task to clear this particular. Well then,
thus I cut the very knot asunder: In currents of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Atoms, where tis easier to make experiment, tis
plain, that many are confounded, many lost; yet, out
of the very nature of Multitude, that some are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
entire, and those enough to serve Nature's turn.
So it passes even in the Brain: whatever Object enters
requires time for affecting the Sense; which, if it be
too short, the Object is lost almost before it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
if long, it roots in the knowledge by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of the images, and the frequent sight of the
same Object does as much; nay, that knowledge often
repeated, works the same effect, is evident beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
This being so, we must conclude, that such is
the art of Nature as, for things to be remembred, there
shall not want that abundance of images, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and sufficient to force their way through the
Crowd of all others they meet.</p>
            <p>10. 'Tis plain that, in this Answer, I have prefer'd the
<hi>Digbaean Method</hi> before the rest: Because <hi>that,</hi> as neer as
is possible, traces Nature step by step. I concern not my
self in the rest; as studying Philosophy, out of a design
to build, not destroy. Only, I'd remember the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Author that he mis-imposes the third opinion (which
relishes nothing of Philosophy) upon <hi>Aristotle</hi> (who
taught the <hi>Digbaean way);</hi> deceiv'd by the counterfeit
stilers of themselves <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> whereas they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingless.
In this same Chapter, the Author seems sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95611:26"/>
about the will's following the understanding:
But, because, he disputes nothing on't, neither will I;
only, hint that the will, as spiritual, signifies not any
thing else, but the very understanding perfect, or ripe
for action to follow out of it. That Mystery of
<hi>whence comes ill,</hi> I deny not, has bin brought down,
by the contests of the Ancients, even to our ears;
nor question I but 'twill last as long as the bold and
ignorant shall endure: But, as the Author mis-insinuates,
I doubt not that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself has most clearly
convinc'd it; nor can it any longer be troublesome to
any, but those who either know not, or neglect his
Doctrine.</p>

            <p>1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> IN his fifth Chapter he falls upon the obscurity of
the formation of natural Bodies, especeially living
ones: Yet, not so smartly but that what he says may,
with ease enough be repuls'd. I say, then, that there
are two Methods, by which the formation of living
Creatures may be rendred intelligible; without any
farther difficulty than what may, without a Miracle,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95611:26"/>
be refunded into the Wisdome of our Maker. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the first, thus: Let's say the seed of a Plant or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
conteins invisible parts of all the Animals Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
These, lets say, supply'd with moisture, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
with some slight Mutation, whereof the reason
may be easily rendred (for example, that some parts
dryer and harder, others are more throughly water'd
and grow soft); and what great matter will be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the formation of living things? The other
Method is, that, observing the progress in Chymicks,
which must of necessity hold the very same in Nature
if self, we'd see that things concocted with a Gentle
fire result into three more remarkable parts: A kind
of thin and, as it were, fiery one, though conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sablein
to the <hi>Species</hi> of Water; another Oily and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to Air; a third expressing the Nature of Salt
and, as it were, hardned water; with all which ther's
mingled and lyes at the bottom a fourth, that's dry
and of an Earthy quality, however they call it. The
same we ought to expect from Nature; since the
acting of Heat upon Moisture is the End of both For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces.
This laid for a ground, suppose, in a proper
vessel, a Drop of prepared Liquor, so kept warm
and preserv'd that it may be encreas'd, too; is it not
plain that, by the very action, some parts will become
dryer, others more subtil and liquid? And that the
dryer will grow into different figures? Especially into
certain hollow Vessels; if, by the beats of the boyling
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95611:27"/>
moisture, they be extended and thrust out in length?
And that all of them will cling together, where they
begin first to divide? And see you not now the figure
of the Animal and its respectively homogeneous parts
form'd? And that their connexion and variety, and
its other heterogeneous parts follow the variety of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Fire or Liquor.</p>
            <p>2. He that shall comprehend these things well,
will not lament that the Plastick vertue is an empty
name and a word without a thing. But, if he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and conveniently at leisure, he'l either, in
spring time close-observe the breeding Plants in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
or the Fields; or at home pluck up Seeds buried
in Pots, just while they are taking life; and daily
rake into the bowels of Berries and Seeds: and I
dare promise him so manifestly connected steps of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
that, after many experiments, he shall fore-tel,
meerly out of what he sees the day before, what will
be the next days issue. Those things which appear
wonderful confusedly in the whole, taken asunder
discover and fairly offer themselves to view. If one
observe the spreading of figures or Colours, he shall
find the principles of these founded in the nature of
Juice; the reasons of those chalk'd out by some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their production: for both Fruits and even
slips are, by art, variable into any kind of forms.
Much more the figures of different salts or concret
Juices spring, not from any intrinsecal nature, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95611:27"/>
from their usual generation and the diffidulty or facil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their place and Motions. Nor let any be
scar'd by the talk of Artists, that admire and amplifie
those things whose causes they understand not: or of
our Authour, amaz'd at the constancy of natural ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
why our Hens should never be colour'd like
Peacocks-tails or Parrats. For, in different Regions,
great varieties spring from the diversity of Food and
Air: And, for what is out of our reach about these
things, we must be beholden to time.</p>
            <p>3. In the same Chapter he raises two other Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which he thinks absolutely inexplicable: to me,
on the other side, they seem to have scarce any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them. The later in Him is concerning the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Bulk or <hi>Continuum:</hi> A question both debated
by the Antients and desperate to the Modern's. The
former, though the later in Nature, is concerning the
sticking together of parts, or, why one Body is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
another less. The former question supposes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether there be parts actually in a <hi>Continuum,</hi>
whereof the affirmative side, though they wrangle in
words, yet is commonly taken by the Modern's, as it
were a self-or-sensibly-known truth; but, by the whole
School of the antient <hi>Peripateticks</hi> and that of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
following them, hist out, as demonstratively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed.
The issue of the matter is that, about the
Composition of Bulk, the Moderns, after a world of
laborious trifling, confess Philosophy at a stand: The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95611:28"/>
Peripateticks deride them as groping in the dark. For,
if there be no parts til they are made by division; they
are manifestly out of their wits that seek how those
should be united which are-not at all? The arguments
of those that assert <hi>actual parts</hi> cite even sense; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which ther's nothing certainer than that it
cannot discern any <hi>part</hi> in a Bulk; since the term of
each <hi>part</hi> is invisible, whereas sence requires a notable
quantity to judge of. Their other Arguments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
assume our manner of speaking, and end in
Logical trifles, how we ought to speak, not what the
thing it self has really in it. Now, this no-very-dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
contest being decided, all the controversie
concerning the composition of Bulk is over.</p>
            <p>4. About the other question there's even as wise
work. The followers of <hi>Democritus</hi> strive to resolve
it into hooks and corner'd hold-fasts: Not seeing,
that nothing can be imagin'd so one, or an Atom, as
that it self is not compos'd of many parts, concerning
which it must be ask'd how they come to stick so fast
together? But, this difficulty they, at least, slip over,
asserting that these in minutest Bodies, by force of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
resist whatever divisive power, not so the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
of them: That is, the greatest and invincible
coherence of parts they carelesly ascribe to the force
and quality of Nature, and are narrowly inquisitive
about a less. The first resolution, therefore, 'tis plain,
is refunded into Nature it self, and the division of Body
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95611:28"/>
or Bulk into Rare and Dense, or having More and Less
of Quantity in equality of Bulk. Which Differences
most Demonstrably dividing the Notion of <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative</hi>
and constituting more <hi>Species</hi> of it in things;
there remains no greater Difficulty in the Adhesion
of the parts of the same <hi>Continuum,</hi> than whether
there be any such thing or not: For, if there be any,
by its <hi>very being a Continuum,</hi> of necessicity it must
be whereof parts <hi>may be</hi> made, not wherein parts <hi>are;</hi>
else (as we have press'd above) the same thing would
be one and many, divided and not-divided, in the same
Notion. Therefore 'tis that substance, from its very
Quantity, whence it has its refolvableness into parts,
has also its easier or harder resolvableness, which they
call its parts more or less sticking to one another.
But, as soon as ever the speculation is strein'd up to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Notions, these Naturalists's stomack turns: as if
Philosophy enjoyn'd us not to know our own thoughts,
and made it unlawful to understand what we speak.</p>
            <p>5. His Sixth Chapter is all dedicated to the Motion
of <hi>Wheels;</hi> nor, if we believe an Author that wants
for no wit, is it any ways solvable. But, before he
attaques that fatal Difficulty, he objects a certain
previous one to us, which the Antients object to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle;</hi>
but he, I confess, in a clearer form. For, he
considers a Wheel mov'd about its Center, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concludes that no part of it moves; but the whole
is mov'd, and the several parts together change place.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95611:29"/>
But, what inconvenience this conclusion drags along
with it, I am utterly ignorant: For, though he strives
to reduce at large, that one part first quits the place
before another is in it; yet evidently the words, not the
thing, breeds all the contest: For, what hinders that,
altogether and at-once, both the quitter should first
not-be and the succeeder first be in the same place?
Another solution might be given, did the Argument
exact it: But, as I said, the quarrel is about the words
and manner of speaking, not the thing. The Author
subjoyns a second difficulty, how, in a Wheel turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
the parts nearer the Center, in the same time,
come to run over so little a space; whereas they are
connected with the remoter, which fetch so large a
Compass? And, after he has acknowledged it to arise
from hence, because they are not carry'd alike swiftly;
he infers that, if the swiftness of the Motions be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
the straight line drawn from the Center to the
Circumference must be crook'd: Whereas 'tis most
evident, the right line would be crook'd, if the nearer
and distanter parts from the Center were carry'd with
equal velocity.</p>
            <p>6. At length the Author loftily enters upon his
boasted experiment, professing before hand, hee'l stop
the mouth of the boldest obstinancy. Thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
it. Let one Axle-tree have three Wheels on it,
one at each end, both alike, and a third in the Middle
far less. Let the bigger rest upon the floor, the lesse<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95611:29"/>
upon some table. Let them all be drawn in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive
Motion, till, having fetch'd a full compass,
they mark the floor and the table with the very same
points, in which, at first, they rested on them. The
three scor'd lines will be found equal; whereas the
middle one is scor'd out by the contact of a Circle far
less than the other two, yet 'tis as long as them:
Which, with no likely-hood, can be deny'd impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
since, 'tis clear, things that touch, as far as they
do so, are, necessarily equal. This is the knot; this
the evident repugnancy. But, alas! let's observe that
Motion is call'd in to help tye the knot the harder;
and that the motion is of two kinds, a Right and a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
compounding a third progressive motion of the
Wheel. Observe we farther, that the Right (or
streight) Motion of the three Wheels is equal; and
that the Circular Motion of the great Wheels is equal
to the Right Motion; but the Circular motion of the
Middle little Wheel is less than the Right Motion:
And, which follows, that the greater Wheels are
mov'd with the same celerity according to both moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but the lesser is mov'd stronglyer in the Right,
than in the Circular. Now, the compounded Motion is
not that which is scor'd upon the floor or table, which,
'tis clear, is a simple and purely Right one; but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
crooked Motion in the Air, making, with the sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Motion, a certain <hi>Area</hi> (whose quantity, <hi>Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
has demonstrated): as is manifest beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95611:30"/>
to whoever but takes any one point of the Circle
or Wheel; and withall, that the progressive Motion
of the bigger Wheels is greater than that of the lesser
Wheel. These things thus explicated, there appears
nothing in this objection more intricate, than in this
simple Proposition, that <hi>of two bodies, which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
according to one line with equal velocity, one may,
at the same time, be carried swiftlyer than the other,
according to another line:</hi> which is so evident, that
any one, that's a Mathematician, cannot doubt of
it.</p>
            <p>7. Yet still <hi>Galilaeus</hi> presses closer that, in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution,
the several points of the lesser Circle or
Wheel are just fitted, in an immediate succession, to
the several points of the space in which 'tis carried:
And, therefore, that it cannot be understood how the
Right can be longer than the Crooked. But, that
which deceived <hi>Galilaeus</hi> was his not having discussed
<hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, but bin overcredulous to his Modern
Interpreters, or rather Corrupters. For, <hi>Aristotle</hi> has
taught us that a Moveable, in actual Motion, alwaies
possesses a bigger (and not-equal) place to it self;
which is most evident: For, since no part of Motion
can be but in Time; and, in every part of time, the thing
moved quits some place and gets some new; 'tis plain,
there cannot be found any so little motion, wherein
the Body moved, has not possessed both the place in

This supposed, though the Moveable were conceived
indivisible; yet certain it would be that, in whatever
determinate part of time, or by however little a part
of Motion, it would score out not a space equal to it
self, but some line; and, in the conditions of our
present dispute every point of the lesser Wheel will
draw a line proportionate to a part of the Circle of
the greater Wheel. And, since really there are no
either instants in Time, or indivisibles in Motion, or
Points in a Circular Line: 'Tis evident, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <head>Seventh Plea Inquires after the Causes of our Modern
Shortness in Science.</head>
            <p>1. IN some of the following Chapters he, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
enough, searches into the Causes of Errors
and human Ignorance: Yet, me-thinks, I could sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
two which he has over-slipt. One is the Laziness
or rather Vanity of this Age: For, whoever has got
himself but talk enough to weave a learned story a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the ignorant or half-learned, such as understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
unaccostomed to Sciences are apt to be dazled
with: partly out of irksomness to pursue harder things,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95611:31"/>
partly out of confidence of his own wit, he slights de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
into those Mines whence our Ancestors have
dig'd out Science; and to take those pains himself
which alone Wisdom regards and follows. Let this
Author be my witness; who, about the end of his
former Chapter, complains of the Obscurity of our
Speculations concerning <hi>Motion, Gravity, Light,
Colours, Sight, Sound;</hi> all which the <hi>Digbaean Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
makes as clear as day: Whence also (though
there they are more copiously and clearly explicated)
we have borrowed our Discourses of the <hi>Load-Stone,</hi>
the <hi>derivation of the Spirits into the Members,</hi> the
<hi>Memory and Remembrance,</hi> the <hi>Formation of living
Creatures,</hi> and whatever almost we have alledged for
solving the proposed Difficulties: the very dictates of
Nature leading us the way. Such like Philosophers,
therefore, read the eminent and highly elaborate Works
of others, as if they were <hi>Romances</hi> invented for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or as <hi>Spectators</hi> behold a <hi>Comedy:</hi> what on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
takes them they commend; if any thing more
knotty than ordinary occurs, they either out of
<hi>laziness</hi> let it pass unregarded, or break some bitter
jest on't.</p>
            <p>2. Another cause of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> wav'd by our <hi>Author,</hi>
appears to me to be a certain special <hi>Error</hi> in the nature
of <hi>Demonstration.</hi> For, they feign to themselvs a certain
<hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> which should not only have
this force on the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> to render the Truth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95611:31"/>
propos'd evident; but, so, besides, that no objection
can with any likelihood be oppos'd against it. Which
is as much as if they should require this <hi>Demonstration</hi>
to clear whatever follows out of, or any way relates
to it; or, that one Demonstration should be a kind of
entire <hi>Science.</hi> For, otherwise, how is it possible but
opposition may be rais'd against this, out of things
not-yet seen-through and conjoin'd with this Truth?
An Understanding then, adapted to Sciences, out of
very Principles and what it already knows, is secure of
a deduced Truth: nor fears any thing can be infer'd
opposite to the Truth it knows; whatever pains it
may cost to get out of streights. For, it knows, that
those things are certain, which the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> out
of a steddy sight that <hi>a Thing</hi> is <hi>a Thing,</hi> or that <hi>the
same</hi> is <hi>the same,</hi> has fixt to and in it self: and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waits till the distinction between the entanglements
shew it self, and the confusion vanish.</p>
            <p>3. In that these Contemners of <hi>Sciences</hi> endeavour
not at fixing any thing in themselves by a severe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Truth: as soon as any Truth pretends
but to evidence, as if they were incapable of owning
it, they quit their station, and betake themselves to
enquiring whether any one has oppos'd that same:
and if they find Impugners, they assume it for most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that such a Truth is not evident. For, say they,
were it evident, 'twould be so to all; 'twould convince
every understanding. But, they may just as well say,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95611:32"/>
               <hi>the Sun is not visible,</hi> because tis not seen by them who
turn their backs on't, or keep their eies shut. For, as in
corporeal sight, some corporeal motion is necessary, by
which the Ball of the Eye may be set against the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
no less to see and fix in the mind this very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the same cannot be and not-be at once, a
certain Application, and as it were, opening of the
mind is required; even to conceive and give birth to
the very evidentest evidence. And, for want of this,
so many of the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns</hi> have not own'd,
but corrupted, the evidence of that very first and most
notorious Principle. Whence they can never attain
that Scientifical Method which shines so clear in <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi>
and <hi>Geometry,</hi> but are wholly entangled in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi>
and <hi>Equivocal</hi> trifles; and fill babbling Volumes
with fopperies. Let these lusty Compilers of Tomes
shew the world but one leaf, or one page deduc'd, or,
at least, attempted in a Geometrical Method; and
then, let them complain there's no <hi>Science,</hi> or that it
lies hid in an unfathomable Well: now the sordid
Sluggards, only mettlesome at repaoaches, conceit a
Lion in the way, and stir not a foot, so much as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

            <head>Eighth Plea Wards off from Aristotle the Calumny of
special Impiety.</head>
            <p>1. ANd now I seem at an end of the Task set me:
did not the same persons strein, as enviously
as possible, to defame <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with all manner of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies;</hi>
that the ignominy of that one man may
make way for them to tear <hi>Science</hi> it self out of the
hands of the Learned, and throw it into the dirt of
<hi>Probability.</hi> For, he alone, of all the <hi>Ancients,</hi> has
left any Monument of <hi>Demonstration</hi> in <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>
and <hi>Physicks.</hi> The <hi>Academicks,</hi> where they leave the
<hi>Peripateticks,</hi> were <hi>Orators,</hi> not <hi>Philosophers.</hi> For,
<hi>Socrates</hi> himself was meerly a Disputer and a Doubter.
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> divided his School. <hi>Plato</hi> propos'd
to himself, with his wholy-divine Wit and purest Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
to set out <hi>Probability,</hi> and make himself ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
for speaking specious things concerning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
necessary to Human life. <hi>Aristotle</hi> very concise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hunting after truth by Experiments, and Marrying
with the inspection of Nature, the power of deducing
Consequences, design'd to shew the world Science in
<hi>Physicks</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> worthy to vye with <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi>
And, therefore, as long as a Popular form of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95611:33"/>
nourisht the power of <hi>Orators,</hi> He was
less esteem'd. For, those Famous persons affected to
manage Science after the manner of Civil Causes,
without a solid and firm Judgment. The <hi>Orators</hi> at
length, wearing out of credit, the Authority of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
grew stronger; and has been deriv'd from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
to the <hi>Arabians;</hi> from them, to our <hi>Schools:</hi>
the <hi>Italians</hi> first (to our knowledge) re-calling into
the West, the Science of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which the wars
long since had chas'd away.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis highly unjust, and a sign of a Cavilling spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to pry into his Life, whose Doctine you go about
to impugn: For, these Oratorial preventions of the
Reader argue the Writer has no mind a candid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be given of the Truth; but lyes in wait
to distort Justice by stirring the Affections. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
hissing out those things which are tattled against
<hi>Aristotles manners,</hi> let's trace what's objected against
his <hi>Doctrine. Peter Gassendus,</hi> then, in his <hi>Third
Exercitation,</hi> objects it as certain, that 'tis <hi>Aristotles</hi>
Opinion, in his Book of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> that <hi>God is an
Animal:</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, in the 8. Book
of his <hi>Physicks, Chap.</hi> 6 and 10. He so expresly
makes God a substance immaterial, indivisible, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
either by himself or by accident; that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it self cannot be able to deny God, in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not-an Animal. He adds, that God is ty'd to the
out-most <hi>Superficies</hi> of the highest Heaven, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95611:33"/>
is extream-heedlesly said in the <hi>Peripatetical</hi> Way:
Whether you construe <hi>without Heaven,</hi> in imaginary
spaces (whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> most expresly attests there
are no such); or an Indivisible adherent to Heaven;
whereas, both the First Mover must necessarily be said
to be in that which is first Moveable or Moved; and,
tis well known, that, in <hi>Aristotle's</hi> way, the <hi>Superficies</hi>
is mov'd only through the Motion of the Body whose
it is; as also, the <hi>Superficies</hi> (as we have said above) is
a certain <hi>being divided,</hi> or term, or no-farther of a
Body, and not any <hi>Entity</hi> in which God may be
placed.</p>
            <p>3. The next accusation argues <hi>God</hi> bound up to the
Laws of <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Necessity.</hi> But, here, the <hi>Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
is clearly in an Error. For, there are two kinds
of <hi>Fate;</hi> one a <hi>Stoical;</hi> their's who assert that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things are, exist in force of <hi>Contradiction,</hi> since,
of necessity, every thing must either be or not-be; and
this Fate <hi>Aristotle</hi> rejects: The other Fate is a <hi>Course
of Causes.</hi> Since, therefore, 'tis evident and agreed
by all, in the <hi>Peripatetical</hi> way, that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>First-Being,</hi>
and by consequence, the <hi>Cause</hi> of the whole
<hi>Series</hi> of the rest; most clear it is that, in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
School, <hi>He</hi> is not <hi>Subject</hi> to <hi>Fate,</hi> but himself the Fate
of all other things; which is the most wise <hi>Tenet</hi> of the
<hi>Saints,</hi> and the marrow of <hi>Christian Doctrine.</hi> Like
this is the other, that He is Subject to <hi>Necessity.</hi> For,
the term, <hi>Necessity,</hi> is ambiguous: For, as tis attributed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95611:34"/>
to Animals contradistinctly from <hi>Liberty,</hi> so it takes
away perfect knowledge; which no <hi>Peripatetick</hi> ever
deny'd to God, to whom <hi>Aristotles</hi> Doctrine forces
the very top of knowledge to be attributed. There's
another <hi>Necessity</hi> springing from prefect knowledge;
to which nothing lying undiscovered, one perfect in
knowledge, and, consequently, <hi>God,</hi> can take but
one way. But, this necessity implying the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of an Understander to Particulars, out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principles, manifestly speaks <hi>Election</hi> or liberty
actuated.</p>
            <p>4. He is farther calumniated to have taught that
God knows not despicable and petty things; and, the
12. of his <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> is cited, where this is not found
but by way of doubting: But, his best Interpreters
conclude, out of other Texts, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> attributes
the knowledge even of these too, to God. This cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
therefore, argues an ill will, drawing the
words of that excellent person to the worst sense.
Yet, at least, He makes the World increated. But
this may easily be deny'd. He asserted it, indeed, not-generated,
or, impossible to have begun by Motion
and the force of Natural Causes; which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to Christian Faith: But, as to the Creation of
the World, he has not a word on't: Yet, 'tis one thing
not to have acknowledg'd it, or reacht so high; another,
to deny; amongst modest Men that babble not incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties.
Yet, I confess, he thought the World it self
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95611:34"/>
Eternal: But, in his very Error, he shewed himself
the chief of <hi>Heathen Philosophers.</hi> For, whereas, they
all with one consent declared, that <hi>nothing is made of
nothing,</hi> 'twas inconsequent for the World to have
begun by Motion, which could not exist without Time;
and no begining of Time, either out of its own essence,
or by the action of moving Causes, could appear. Tis
plain, therefore, that this Error of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s argues
his excellency above the rest, who by Chance, and not
by Science light on the Truth.</p>
            <p>5. The last calumny about his <hi>Tenets</hi> concerns the
<hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> which <hi>Gassendus</hi> saies, <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
in many places denies: but as disfavourably as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
since, his best Interpreters attest that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
it; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> records him to have written
concerning the Soul, upon <hi>Eudemus</hi>'s death; out of
whom is cited that famous Story of a dead man's Soul
begging revenge of his Friend. Whence is evidenc'd
that those Interpreters err, who, out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
endeavour to conclude the Soul not immortal,
and that this was <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s own sence. It hits strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in fine, that the Author, otherwise very ingenious,
should judge this a fit Objection, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> denyed
the Resurrection of the dead: which, tis most certain,
the light of Faith first discover'd to Mortals; though,
after its acceptation on that account, its conformity
also to the progress of Nature might be discern'd. This
farther, that he concludes, saying, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95611:35"/>
many things wholly disagreeable to our <hi>H. Orthodox
Faith:</hi> as if <hi>Plato</hi> and the rest of the Philosophers had
tendred the World none but <hi>Tenets</hi> agreeable to
<hi>Faith:</hi> which is by so much an unworthier part of
<hi>Gassendus,</hi> in that he himself in his <hi>Preface,</hi> promises
he'l shew that, tis by <hi>Faith</hi> alone, any thing comes to
our knowledge of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Intelligences;</hi> and that
all Arguments about these things, drawn from the light
of Nature, are vain. A worthy <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> indeed,

            <p>1. I Must now return from <hi>Gassendus</hi> to the Author
of <hi>The Vanity of Dogmatizing;</hi> since he has se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the strongest <hi>Mediums:</hi> justly preferring them
before that numerable rabble which <hi>Gassendus</hi> has
heap'd together, even to cloying; out of love to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
rather than Science. Our <hi>English Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick,</hi>
then, first by way of <hi>Preface,</hi> as it were, seems
to decline that envy, which the honourable train of
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Followers would be apt to procure him; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that sentence of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s, <hi>The Multitude is an
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95611:35"/>
Argument of the worst:</hi> so prone we are to err, even in
the plainest things. For, tis evident, the Vulgar, in
some things, follow men of excellence, as it were, their
Captains; in other things are govern'd, or rather hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by their own judgment. The former Method is
that of Nature it self, that many Ignorants may, by the
vertue and Authority of a few, be carried to good:
But, that the Vulgar should judge of things themselvs
know not, and by a tumultuary consent, precipitate
the counsels of the prudent; this is opposite to the
Laws of Nature and Reason. Here now enquire
whence <hi>Aristotle</hi> has got an Authority with the Vulgar?
and twill clearly appear he has been made the <hi>Coripheus</hi>
of Philosophers by the sway of the very Princes of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical
<hi>Theology:</hi> to whom if you compare the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Orators</hi> or <hi>Criticks,</hi> they'l dwindle away to
nothing. The Fathers themselves (those great Persons
pardon me if I say so) are of another different Trade;
nor have fallen upon any Philosophical Explication of
<hi>Faith,</hi> otherwise than as forc'd to it by the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Author subjoins, that in the opinion
of the wise, <hi>Peripeteticism</hi> is a mass of Terms
that signifie nothing. But this Author knew not that
his own Terms are so equivocal, that themselves speak
nothing. For, who has sufficiently fifted this, who, or
by whose judgment they are called wise, that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this of the <hi>Peripateticks?</hi> If we consult <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95611:36"/>
Works themselves, or his ancient <hi>Emulators,</hi>
tis clearer than the Sun, none ever of the Philosophers
so industriously, and by distributing so many of his
Terms into obvious sences, took care for the clearness
of his Dictates, and eluded the entanglement of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</hi>
Tis manifest then, the <hi>Wise men</hi> had little
skill in <hi>Aristotle.</hi> They have mistaken, therefore, for
<hi>Aristotelians</hi> some Apes cloaking themselves with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s
name, and expose other mens <hi>Tenets</hi> for <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetical</hi>
ones: and (which he seems not to know) in
very truth <hi>Pyrronians.</hi> For, whoever, in mighty Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
and Questions piled one on another, teaches no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but, that one part, indeed, is more likely,
but either side is defensible; in such a World of
twattle saies no more, than had he pass'd sentence in
one Word, that <hi>Nothing is clear.</hi> This Calumny,
therefore, touches his own Friends, not <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Then, he prosecutes his Plea against the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi>
by certain Doubts; which either are not,
or seem not, clear to him, in spight of Reason. The
notion of <hi>Materia prima,</hi> which asserts it to have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Quiddity,</hi> nor <hi>Quantity,</hi> nor <hi>Quality,</hi> he contests
is a Description of <hi>Nothing.</hi> 'Strange, that Men be so
humorsome! Are there, perhaps, in all Nature more
usual words than <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Power?</hi> Who is so sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,
that he speaks not thus of a piece of Brass or

but <hi>may</hi> or <hi>will be</hi> a Statue of <hi>Mercury?</hi> Do they not,
peradventure, understand themselves that speak thus;
or, when they say, it <hi>may be,</hi> or has an aptitude to be a
<hi>Mercury,</hi> Do they say the Brass or Marble <hi>is Nothing,</hi>
or, is nothing of <hi>Mercury?</hi> How, then, besides <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
or the Form of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is there not a certain
power or aptitude to be <hi>Mercury,</hi> which neither is
<hi>Mercury actually,</hi> nor yet a notion of No-thing or No-thing?
Or if, in respect of the <hi>Figure</hi> which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<hi>Mercury,</hi> there is some aptitude which neither is
<hi>that,</hi> nor yet a Notion of <hi>Nothing;</hi> why may we not
affirm the same of a <hi>Quantum</hi> or Bulk, and say, a Boy
<hi>is</hi> not yet big, but <hi>may be big?</hi> For he that asserts
this does he not, at the same time, deny Bigness; and
yet clearly he names an Aptitude to Bigness? Nor,
perhaps, is there any difference in respect to <hi>Entity;</hi>
for we scruple not to say that Tallow or Oile <hi>may be
Flame,</hi> and yet that <hi>they are not yet Flame:</hi> the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
therefore, or Oil neither are the <hi>thing,</hi> Flame,
which they <hi>may be,</hi> nor <hi>so big as they will be</hi> when
they are Flame, nor <hi>so hot;</hi> and yet they <hi>may be Flame,</hi>
they <hi>may be greater,</hi> they <hi>may be hotter:</hi> and there is
in them a certain <hi>power,</hi> which neither has <hi>Quiddity,
Quantity,</hi> nor <hi>Quality;</hi> since they are refer'd to all
these, and are in a present state of privation in respect
to them. Now whoever professes this unintelligible,
directly condemns Mankind for a company of Fools,
that know not what they say in their vulgarest speech
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95611:37"/>
and commerces: And, he that denies <hi>Matter</hi> it self
destroys that solemn Maxim of Philosophy, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes nothing of nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There are two other Terms which trouble our
<hi>Sceptick, Form</hi> and <hi>being educ'd out of the power of
Matter.</hi> As for the first, 'tis strangely odd, that too
much speculation should so render ingenious men no
better than the most stupid. Can any man be born
such a Bruit, as not to own that one thing is distinct
from another? or, if it be distinct, can he assert tis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
by nothing? Does the difficulty lie here,
that this, by which tis distinguish'd should be called a
<hi>Form?</hi> what a strange unreasonableness is this, not to
let me call that a Form, which I see distinguish
one from the other? May not I say of two <hi>brazen
Statues,</hi> that they agree in <hi>Brass,</hi> and are distinguisht
by their <hi>Figures?</hi> Or, if there be a third of <hi>Marble,</hi>
shall I be chid for saying, the brazen ones are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
from the Marble one, in that this is of Stone,
those other of Mettal? As, therefore, before, I distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>being</hi> in substance, Quantity, and
Quality; I may, now, in the same, find grounds
for the denominations of Form and Subject in each of
them.</p>
            <p>5. As to the later Term, <hi>being educ'd out of power,</hi>
let the ingenious Man reflect whether that which, out
of some dark hole, softly and by degrees comes forth
n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o open view, is improperly said to be <hi>educ'd or
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95611:37"/>
brought out.</hi> Again, let him remember (if he have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen a peece of Marble form'd by a Statuary) how,
at first it cannot be imagin'd what the <hi>Artist</hi> means to
form: after a little pains, there appears a confus'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of a <hi>Humane Creature;</hi> then, whether it be
a Man or Woman; and at length, what Man it is. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
how a man, which was potentially in the Marble,
and confused in the dark, as it were, is by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Philosophers consider as much in Nature; whether you
observe the seeds of living things, or the Community
of the Elements to be mixt into a compound, or the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
of Matter from the Elements, whence this
Phrase <hi>to be educ'd out of the power of Matter</hi> signifies
Matter out of its aptitude to many, to be determin'd,
by the operation of Nature or Art to one certain
thing; through a motion from confusion to distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and not to be, as it were, infus'd, with a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
from the subject, as this <hi>Anti-Peripatetick</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
out of I know not what Dreamers. For, there are
none of these triflles extant in <hi>Aristotle.</hi>

            <head>Tenth Plea Maintains certain Definitions and Arguings.</head>
            <p>1. NExt they shoot at two of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
either of them most exact, and as clear
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95611:38"/>
as can be, to those that understand any thing in his
way. The first is the Definition of <hi>Light,</hi> in these
words, <hi>Light is the act of a prespicuous thing:</hi> which
seems obscure to this race of people, because the use
of the Word <hi>Act</hi> is fram'd by Philosophers, and not
taken from <hi>Tully,</hi> or found in <hi>Calipine.</hi> Let them
know, therefore, that <hi>Act</hi> is deriv'd from <hi>Agere,</hi> to do,
or <hi>Agi,</hi> to be done, or the Participle <hi>Actum,</hi> done;
and us'd by Philosophers for that, by which what was
intended by the Agent at the end of his Action is term'd
or demonstrated <hi>donc.</hi> In Greek, perhaps, 'tis more
elegantly call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as it were, the <hi>Operation of
the Causes,</hi> taking the <hi>Operation,</hi> not for the Flux
of the Action, but, for that which remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by the Operation, which is such a Flux.
But, because our language affords not a proper word
correspondent to the term, <hi>Act;</hi> our <hi>Sterling Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
is all in choller against <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For, if he
had put but ordinary words, instead of terms of
Art, saying, <hi>Light is a certain perfection of a body,
that has this in its Nature, to let coloured things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
through it, making them</hi> de facto <hi>appear through
it;</hi> as we experience Objects are seen through illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
Air, which are not seen through it darkened:
what had he found worth making such a wide mouth
over? Now because he has spoken most neatly and
briefly, poor <hi>Aristotle</hi> smarts for it.</p>
            <p>2. The other Definition has the same fault. The
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95611:38"/>
Definition is this, <hi>Motion is the Act of a thing in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as in power.</hi> For, since a thing is said to be in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to that it may be brought to by Motion; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
One that's sick, to Health; Wood, to firing, or
to be fire: tis plain, that <hi>Motion</hi> is that perfection, or
<hi>act</hi> with which <hi>the subject</hi> is affected whilst 'tis yet <hi>in
power,</hi> or, till the sick person be in health, or the Wood
be fire; <hi>as in power,</hi> or in that state by which it may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the intended perfection. Behold here a most clear
and learned Definition, and subject to no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
than a certain umbrage, from a ridiculous story
concerning the Greek term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which I believe
fram'd by the Philosopher to express his intention em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically.
The story's this; That a <hi>Critick,</hi> I know
not who, went to one <hi>Ciccus,</hi> esteem'd a <hi>Magician</hi> (I
imagine, because he wrote of <hi>Magick)</hi> to enquire of
the Devil what was the meaning of that word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in <hi>Aristotle;</hi> and return'd as wise as he went, and
mock'd at by the Oracle. That it may appear then
what a Dunce Devil our Philosophers have consulted;
lte them take notice that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a word made up of
three, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with the addition of a foeminine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
which is proper for signifying <hi>Abstractions:</hi>
and so signifies the Manner the subject of Motion is
found in at the end of the action; which is the very
same thing with the term <hi>Act,</hi> as tis explicated above.</p>
            <p>3. In his seventeenth Chapter there is a new Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
forg'd against <hi>Aristotle;</hi> the more unworthily, in that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95611:39"/>
he; above the rest, has endeavour'd at clearness. His
Philosophy is accus'd to be litigious, and through the
wavering use of his Terms, confused and obscure.
This accusation is found guilty of a double Ignorance:
One, of what <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s use is; for he's the carefullest
that ever writ, to distinguish and form the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of his Terms: The other is, that he takes
<hi>Scepticks</hi> for <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> And, that the <hi>Scepticks</hi>
endeavours are the vainest that can be, I easily grant;
that they little trouble themselves about fixing the
use of their words, to be left more at liberty to sell any
trifles they list for Vanity or profits sake; that they are
petty Orators, or rather janglers, not Philosophers;
that they take upon them the name of <hi>Aristotelians,</hi>
to corrupt Youth and draw Disciples after them. I
deny not that these are to be shun'd like the Plaigue,
by all pursuers of Science; nor is any thing of sollidity
to be expected from them: this one thing puts me
out of patience, that Persons, otherwise ingenious
and desirous of knowledge, should be averted by these
Cheats, not only from true Science, but from all hope
of ever gaining any, in the things most necessary to
human life.</p>
            <p>4. They back their feigned Plea against the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
out of his own Words and Actions. Their
first crack is upon that saying of his, that his Books of
Physicks were <hi>so publisht, that they were not made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
The sense whereof was, that the Matter or Subject
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95611:39"/>
handled in them is so abstracted, that, without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of an experienc'd Master, they could not be
understood by those unus'd to his way; which we see
hold to this day: For, scarce any one comprehends
those Books, unless aided by the old Commentators.
Whence our Moderns, for the most part, are quite
besides the Cushion as to <hi>Aristotles</hi> meaning; though
he himself has spoken, as clearly as possible the brevity
He prefixt to himself could bear. The next Calumny
is grosser and more luckless; that those things which
he has collected, to furnish Logical Disputants, and
perfect the Act of Disputing previously to giving Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should be applyed to his Method of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating,
and to his practice not in disputing but defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For, as, in <hi>Plays,</hi> 'tis a commendation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
the story, that it may come off at last with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
admiration: So, 'tis the task of the Inquirer to
confound the Question, with proposing Difficulties
before it, that the Demonstrator may clearly Vnidicate
it, and, as it were, dispelling the clouds, restore it to
Light.</p>
            <p>5. This Plea requir'd Instances out of that work
of his. The Author presses three: Upon <hi>Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>'s
credit, I believe, or some other slight Lookers
into it; for, in the Book it self there's nothing to be
seen: The first runs thus. He proves the World to
be perfect, because it consists of Bodies; that Bodies
are perfect, because they consist of a triple dimension;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95611:40"/>
that a triple dimensions is, therefore, perfect, because
consisting of three; and that three is perfect, because
<hi>two</hi> we call <hi>both,</hi> and never say <hi>all</hi> till we come to <hi>three.</hi>
Look into his First book <hi>De Coelo, Chap.</hi> 1. You
shall find these last words make no part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
but are additional only: and that the
Demonstration, it self is this; Because the World
consists of Bodies, the perfection of the World is to
be perfect in the Notion of Body. Now, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Body lies in this, that it be spread every
way upon three prependiculars, as the Geometricians
demonstrate. And thus are both the several Bodies,
and the World; but in a divers manner; For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Bodies are terminated each to others; whence,
though they are spread according to all the lines, yet
not to the whole, or utmost extent of them. But,
because there is no space beyond or without the World
(as 'tis demonstrated in the fourth of his <hi>Physicks),</hi> the
World is spread according to all and the whole lines,
or, perfectly every way; and by consequence, must be
said perfect in the Notion of Body, and, so, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</p>
            <p>6. The second Instance is, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> asserts, were
there more Worlds, the Moon would fall down upon
the Earth. This consequence the Arguer thinks
sprung from such a fancy as theirs, that fear the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi>
should drop into Heaven. But, he reflects
not how great pains the Philosopher took to establish
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95611:40"/>
the Center of the World in the Earth: Which gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
this consequence would depend not from fancy
but reason, as himself seems to confess.</p>
            <p>7. The third Instance, too (drawn out of <hi>lib. 2.
cap. 5. De Coelo.</hi> Is utterly perverted. For, <hi>Aristotle</hi>
teaches not, that the Heav'ns are, therefore, carry'd
towards the West, because the West is the Nobler,
(as the Argument makes it); but, that the West is the
Nobler, because the Heav'ns are carry'd towards it.
Now, there's this difference betwixt the two; that in
the former Method, 'tis assum'd without proof, that
the West is the Nobler; in the later, <hi>it follows</hi>
out of those things which <hi>Aristotle</hi> had concluded;
<hi>viz.</hi> That there's nothing Accidental in Eternal
Things; and, by consequence, that the Motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West is Natural to the Heav'ns; and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Motion is to the more honourable: whence it
clearly follows, that the West is Nobler than the East.
It follows, I say; for, if the Principles were true, 'twere
a Noble Demonstration.</p>

         <div n="11" type="plea">
            <head>Eleventh Plea Refutes some Topicks babbled against Science.</head>
            <p>1. ABout the end of the Chapter he expresses indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that the learned so employ all their pains
upon Logick, Physick, and Metaphysick; that the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
usefuller to human life, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95611:41"/>
Heav'ns, Meteors, Fossils, and Animals, but especially
Politicks and Oeconomicks, are much neglected. Nor
can I deny that these are neglected in the Schools: but,
what's guilty on't, but the Scepticism that reigns there?
For, if the Sciences were taught in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Method,
there would be room enough for all; nor would nature
be taunted with the usual calumny, that <hi>Mans life is
too short for the Arts:</hi> But, the necessary ones once
known, there would advance still a surplusage of leisure,
to take abundantly, in any of these Sciences, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
which human Curiosity should be drawn to. But,
they are the Scepticks that envy this happiness to men;
confounding all things with endless contests; especially
those common truths which <hi>Aristotle</hi> has demonstrated:
such as are <hi>Formal Divisibility,</hi> that <hi>what ever is mov'd
is mov'd by another,</hi> that <hi>a</hi> Continuum <hi>or Bulk is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
in infinitum, that <hi>there's no</hi> vacuum: and such
like; without the owning whereof before hand, 'tis in
vain to make Experiments for acquiring Science: Since,
they will all come at length to be resolv'd into these
Principles; or else there will be ever a straining after
Science unproffitably, without any Principles at all.</p>
            <p>2. In his eighteenth Chapter, he reproves the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetical
Doctrine as insufficient to solve <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s.
But, this he does out of Error or Spleen: For, if he takes
the Doctrine of our Modern Philosophical Apes to be
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s own, he's strangely in an error; but, if he
denyes <hi>Aristotle</hi> to have taken pains to solve <hi>Problem</hi>'s,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95611:41"/>
he'l be shewn guilty of Injustice by all his Books of
Natural Philosophy, those especially which usually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his eight Books. Which of the Moderns has
more happily unbowel'd Nature than <hi>Digby,</hi> who at
every turn is mindful of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and candidly accepts
his Dictates? The Adversary urges that the <hi>Systeme
of Heaven</hi> is mis-contriv'd by <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Open the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
you'l find the sum and very knot of it to be,
that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had not an Optick Table: else suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those <hi>Phaenomenas</hi> of the Sun, which enlightened
<hi>Aristotle's Age,</hi> his Discourse, in his Books <hi>De Coelo,</hi>
merits all admiration. That the <hi>Intelligences</hi> are the
Movers of the Heav'n is Christian Doctrine. That
there is a certain Fire swimming upon our Air is
nothing else but <hi>des Cartes</hi>'s <hi>Ether,</hi> or a kind of
rarer Element enbracing the convex of our sky. If
<hi>Aristotle</hi> has err'd in a very few things; why, yet, so
much anger? shall we not allow Philosophy its growing
time? If, yet, he may be said to <hi>Err,</hi> and not rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously,
and ingeniously to propose, who professes he
<hi>conjectures,</hi> not <hi>Demonstrates;</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> does in his
Books <hi>De Coelo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. His ninteenth Chapter inveighs against <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Doctrine as unfruitful and barren; but, weakly and
falsely. Weakly, because all the inventions he speaks
of belong to Artificers and Handy-craft-Men; not
Philosophers, whose office 'tis to <hi>make use of</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Science, not to <hi>make</hi> them. Falsly, because
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95611:42"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s way of Doctrine being about Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
without which there's no comprehending Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
nothing is truly invented without it. I, but they
are Generals that are found in <hi>Aristotle.</hi> It must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that he and his Disciples deserve thanks for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging
them, and fixing a step to climb thence farther
and higher. But, (if my Divination fails me not) I see,
were <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Principles pluck'd up, Philosophy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to give an Account of ordinary Effects. I'm sure,
the Philosophy which admits <hi>Vacuities</hi> is reducible to
no Rules for acting: And <hi>des Cartes</hi>'s <hi>Vortices,</hi> I shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suspect no way serviceable to invention. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his <hi>Tenets,</hi> which savour of impiety, we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before. For his contradictions, the places are not
cited: but, whoever is skill'd in <hi>Aristotle</hi> knows, he
uses to draw Examples out of others Books and vulgar
sayings; and that nothing is to be esteemed his own,
which falls not into the Course of his Doctrine.
Whence, 'tis no hard matter to find contrary Opinions
in his works: but, those things alone are to be ascribed to
him, which either are asserted in their proper places, or
brought by him for confirmation of his known <hi>Tenets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The twentieth Chapter renders manifest the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of Peripateticism above all other Methods, by its
very impugnation of it. For, it assumes, it cannot be
known that one thing is Cause of another, otherwise
than because they are found together: which we deny
not to be an occasion of suspecting, but no Argument
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95611:42"/>
of Causality; for, if nothing else be clear, 'twill be still-unknown,
which of the too is the Cause, which Effect.
But, the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> conclude not <hi>A.</hi> to be the cause
of <hi>B.</hi> till, defining both, they find, out of their very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
that <hi>A</hi> cannot be, but it must follow out of its
intrinsecals that <hi>B</hi> is. For example, a Peripaterick col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
that Fire is the Cause of Heat; because Heat is
nothing else but Atoms flowing from Fire: and on the
other side, he knows that Fire cannot exist, but it must
send out such particles. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s paradox, of Light
and the Sun, is just as if we should expect the Skyes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to catch Larks. That wonderfully ingenious Man
is so coelestial, that he has not so much as Sand to found
his structures on. Peripateticks chuse rather to collect
a few Certainties, acknowledging a Multitude of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,
than, grasping at all, to hold nothing. Sure
I am, none more largely pretends Demonstration, than
<hi>des Cartes:</hi> So that, nothing is more unseemly than for
his adorers to profess Scepticism.</p>
            <p>5. Not a jot stronger, to establish the impossibility
of Science, is the argument from the variety of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
amongst those that are call'd Philosopers. For
first, it must be evident that they <hi>are</hi> Philosophers:
before their judgements deserve esteem in Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
matters. Do they profess to Demonstrate? Do
they model their Books in <hi>Euclid's</hi> Method? Do they
interweave Definitions with self-known truths? And
admit no other for proof? All which may be observ'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95611:43"/>
in <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his antient interpreters, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in <hi>Euclids</hi> form. These things if they do, either
they are not rational, or all will be of the same mind; as
Geometricians are. If they neglect these, 'tis not a pin
matter for their judgments in Philosophy. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
tells a story of the power of Fancy, which I doubt
is imperfect: For, it seems, he would have one Man be
able to order anothers thoughts without ever acting by
his senses or Fancy: Since, he relates, that one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd
others, absent from him, to think and speak what
he pleas'd. For, though I allow Men to have a very
large power over Animals, by the help of their Fancies;
for example, to tame or enrage them, by means of
sounds or shewing them figures; perhaps, too, to strike
them sick or cure them, and such like: Yet, that the
Fancy should be mov'd to those things, which move it
not by any sense, 'tis hard to believe. For all that, I do
not altogether deny the Motion made upon the sense to
be every way like, and Univocal to that which is in the
mind; and, when it happens, to be deriv'd rather from
the vehemencie of the affection, than the pure Motion
of the Fancies impressing it.</p>
            <p>6. In this twenty first Chapter, he divines of Future
Science; particularly, of some not-yet discovered man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of acting at distance: which I'le rather await, than
discuss or hope for. About the end of the Chapter, he
assumes, that nothing can be known, unless it be resolv'd
into the first Causes. Whence, he should have seen
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95611:43"/>
clearly that the First Causes, and <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> which
treats of them, is most known of all to Nature, or next
to our first knowledges: And that Naturalists strive in
vain, who negotiate much about the particulars of
Nature; and comprehend nothing through their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of <hi>Metaphysick.</hi> Take for example the stir about
<hi>Vacuum;</hi> which <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> declare as impossible, as for
no-thing to be a thing: about the spring of <hi>Rarity</hi> and
<hi>Density;</hi> which the <hi>Metaphysician</hi> most palpably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
is out of, or, extrinsecal to the things that are Rare
and Dense, and many such like; whose truth those that
essay by Experiments, but without the light of <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi>
shall find an endless work on't. Metaphysical
Principles must be taken from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> not <hi>des Cartes,</hi>
though a Person of most eminent Wit. For, <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
by contemplation, form'd into method those things
which he <hi>found</hi> engrafted in <hi>nature: Des Cartes,</hi> in his
Physical principles (as if he meant to prescribe the
<hi>Creator</hi> an <hi>Idea)</hi> designs in the Air and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
of the Moon, as they say, what himself thought was
to be done, according to Art. From which kind of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
there's no benefit to be hoped for by the Reader.</p>
            <p>7. The next Chapter is sick of that error, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
has very often detected and confuted; <hi>viz.</hi> that
nothing is known unless it be perfectly known: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that we know not <hi>God is,</hi> unlesse we see him,
that any Man cannot make use, and be sure of that <hi>des
Cartes</hi>'s first-known thing or Object of knowledge, <hi>I
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95611:44"/>
think, therefore I am,</hi> unlesse he comprehends the <hi>all
things</hi> of that <hi>I;</hi> so, as to know the Nature of his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Form, the Number of his <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
and the Causes and Motion by which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and in short, whatever is connected with him.
Which is clearly to professe, he knows not the question
in hand: For, none of the Dogmatizers either arrogates
to himself or hopes for so perfect a knowledge. 'Tis a
piece of the same heedlesnesse, not to know that all that
see a <hi>white wall</hi> have the same apprehension of <hi>white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
though their several sensations vary the degree and
perfection of it. Whence, our Author had done more
prudently to have sat down in silence, and pardon'd
the affecters of Science their error; than, by meerly
Topical and Delusory Reasons, to have averted minds,
born to excellent things, from the first desire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and gathering fruit, at least, in some degree; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of the moral Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Though you of <hi>Glycons</hi> mighty lims despair,</l>
                  <l>Do not to keep away the Gout forbear.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>8. For all that, our Academick makes no scruple, in
general, to lay all kind of mischief to those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
dogmatically, <hi>such Art</hi> (as the Philosophers says)
<hi>it requires to find a mean.</hi> First he asserts this Method
is the Daughter of ignorance? who would have look'd

Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?</q>
            <p>Next, he calls it the Inmate of untam'd affections:
upon what title? for, if there be any Science, that will

                  <l>The peaceful Temples keep well fortifi'd,</l>

               </q>
You that profess you know not whether there be any
or no; how rashly do you affirm it to dwell alwayes with
untam'd affections? since, if there be none, it dwells no
where. The third inconvenience of <hi>Dogmatizing</hi> is,
that it stirs men up to controversies. The rising Sun
seems to me guilty of the very same Crime, in disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Slug-a-beds,</hi> and summoning every one to their
work: For, such a kind of falt it is, to inculcate Truth
to those that live in ignorance and error. A fourth
crime is, that one who adheres to any Science,
lays ignorance to the charge of those that know not
his demonstration. I cannot deny it; For, 'tis the
Nature and Title of light to reproach those things, as
dark, which admit not its beams. But, herein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrators
are modester than the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> that, at
least, they except some, and speak well of <hi>Nature;</hi>
whom, with all her Children, the <hi>Scepticks</hi> condemn
to the Dungeon of Darknesse for ever.</p>
            <p>9. Like this is the next, that the confidence of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in error bars the Gates against the liberty to get
possession of truth. How blindly does the <hi>Sceptick</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
these things? who freely owns that truth is no
where, which men might have the liberty to get pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95611:45"/>
of. He concludes at last, the <hi>Dogmatizer</hi> has a
petty and enthrall'd <hi>Soul.</hi> So strangely things are nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd
that are unknown! For, tis <hi>Science</hi>'s part to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Soul, and render it capable of great things:
and this the pleasure of one that <hi>knows,</hi> to look down
on <hi>Scepticks</hi> as all in a tumult below, and
<q>
                  <bibl>Lucret.</bibl>
                  <hi>See them at a loss at every turn,
And breathless hunting out the way of life.</hi>
               </q>
Which to make ones life and Task is the miserablest
of all things, and an utter casting off <hi>Rationality;</hi> and
the whole felicity <hi>Humanity</hi> affords. These things,
as they are all most true, and scarce deniable, even by a
<hi>Sceptick,</hi> to follow out of the possibility of <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that is, if there be any Rational Nature, yet I
would not have them so asserted, as to Patronize pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Scepticks,</hi> who admit, indeed, that there is such a
thing as some both <hi>Physical</hi> and <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Science, in
common; but neither tend to it by any legitimate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
nor own any thing, in particular, demonstrated:
and yet, by the press of the Herd, in a society, thrusting
one another on, and by loads of Scriblers, they most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly
fly at and arrogate to themselves the highest
degree of <hi>Doctorship,</hi> and the top of Sciences and name
of Wisdom. The Father of Nature grant Mankind may
at length be eas'd of this Yoak; which galls the necks
of the Sons of <hi>Adam:</hi> and, that the studious of truth
may understand it alike dangerous to think <hi>every thing</hi>
and <hi>nothing</hi> is demonstrated.</p>
