            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> after the reformation of
Religion did by degrees attaine to as great
perfection both in doctrine &amp; discipline as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other reformed kirk in <hi>Europe.</hi> The sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Doctrine appeareth in her severall
Confessions of Faith approven by all the best reformed
Kirkes in forraine parts. But because puritie of Religion
cannot bee long preserved without that platforme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which the Word of God hath laid foorth unto
us, her nationall assemblies laboured diligently many years
to finde out the same, and after many conferences, and
publick reasoning resolved upon these conclusions, which
are contained in the booke of Policie, or second booke of
Discipline. But shortly thus much for the present.</p>
            <p>Each Parish beeing provided of a Minister (who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
tryalls before his admission to the place, and behoved
to be qualified both for life, learning and skilfull govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
was ruled by him and the Elders thereof, beeing the
men of best life &amp; understanding in the said Parish. Twelve
sixteene or twentie of these Kirks were conjoyned in a Pres-byterie
or classicall meeting, that did meete weekly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their gifts by course, and had the power of ordinary
jurisdiction, ordination, suspension, deprivation, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
or direction to the parish Minister to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat,
after the sight of the processe deduced by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare
Eldership, collation of benefices, visitation of kirks
within their bounds. The enormitie of Ministers either in
life or doctrine were dela<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ed, either by some parochinar, or
neighbour Minister. Persons of whatsoever qualitie in the
Co<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>gregations who would not obey their owne Ministers
and Elders were censured: If verie great difficulties come
before them, or if the Pres-byterie had adoe with great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="tcp:17447:3"/>
who did withdraw any of their number, in these &amp; the
like cases there was recourse had to the provincial Synods.</p>
            <p>The whole Pres-byterie of a shire or two mett twise a-yeare
in their Synod, tryed presbyteries, and ordered what
was disficle for the presbyteries, or might concerne them al
in common. If any difficultie come before them, for which
there was no kirk constitution, they referred the same to the
nationall Assembly, which conveened once a yeere, or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>pro re nata.</hi> Where they gave their judgment in the case
preponed, and made some act &amp; constitution for the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in time comming, and other acts and constitutions need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
received appellations, petititions, grievances, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
some to propone their owne grievances to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
King, Counsellor Convention. This was the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and highest Kirk judicatorie, to which was made the
last appeale, &amp; which was composed of these members, his
Majesties self or a Commissionar representing him, two or,
three Ministers chosen by each Presbitery, one Gentleman
an Elder within the bounds of a presbyterie, A commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for each regall burgh, and two for <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> some one
of these Ministers was chosen to moderat, or preside by the
voices of the whole assembly. This supreme judicatorie so
censured the omissions of the subordinat, that no vice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
person whtasoever escaped censure, no error could soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
set out its head, but it was presently crushed by one of
these, as King <hi>IAMES</hi> confessed in diverse discourses, and
gave that reason why so few errours had appeared in the
kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> because they could not escape the censure
of one of these Ecclesiasticall judicatories.</p>
            <p>This forme of government so comfortable to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and profitable to the kirke was insufferable to many
of higher rank, who did not think this yoke of Christ so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
as to enjoy their wished libertie without controulment,
which made a number of these, with Courtiers, and some
<pb facs="tcp:17447:3"/>
of the Ministers who were more loose &amp; worldly minded
suggest unto King <hi>Iames</hi> of ever blessed memorie, that He
had not so much power in the kirk as in the commonwelth.
because, when any of these libertines committed any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
he could not save them from kirk censure, although
his Majestie had alwayes power to remit the civill censure
&amp; punishment. His Majestie beeing then hopefull of the
kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> they added that reason, that if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Kirke of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be governed by Bishops,
as that of <hi>England</hi> was, he would thereby endeare to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the kirk men there, who might otherwise suspect his
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to their state, being acquainted with another forme
of kirk government, if he should not evidence it, by labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that change. And if he shuld eshablish the government
of Bishops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he might bee as absolute in the kirk
as in the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Thus they kindled in his Majesties heart the des<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e of an
absolute power over the kirk, beeing specially moved by
their owne particular ends. Great men for obtaining ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of kirklands, which then appertained to the Crowne,
in recompense from his Majestie, for assisting the erection
of Bishops in the kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Majestie being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the Bishops consent, &amp; of inferiour kirkmen, in hope
of suceeeding to the said Bishopricks, and of both for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
themselves into a licentious liberty from under the
awfull censure of the Kirk, was so earnest on that designe,
that hee made it his most speciall indevour, but suppressing,
the same withall, that hee might obt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ine it the more easily.</p>
            <p>Where-unto hee attained by degrees, which are heere set
down shortly in some generall heads Wee refer the par<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
to a more large information, which shall contain the
degrees, course of defection, &amp; advancement of Hierar by
in our kirk. First, his Majestie Propounded the necesatie
to have Ministers voters in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the name of the
<pb facs="tcp:17447:4"/>
kirk, who sitting in Parliament might bee carefull, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were done in prejudice of the kirk, and might carrie
the desires of the whole Kirke to the Parliament for such
things as were convenient for them.</p>
            <p>The medling of Ministers in these civill imployments
was extremely disliked, &amp; opposed by the most judicious
in this Kirk. To make the Ministers voting in Parliament
the more plausible, and to move the more easie condiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
therto, they were tyed to such caveats, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
should propone nothing in Parliament, Convention or
Counsell, without expresse warrant from the kirk, nor keep
silence when any thing is proponed there to the prejudice
of the Kirke: That they should give an account of their
Commission after each Parliament to the next nationall
Assembly, and be subject either to their censure of deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
incase they did transgresse: To attend faithfully their
particular flocks as Ministers, in the administration of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
collation of benefices, or other points of ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
government, to usurpe or acclaime no jurisdiction over
their brethren. A number of such caveats beeing agried
upon in the assembly should have beene ratified in the next
parliament. But these beeing suppressed, there was insert in
place there of a number of articles in favours of Bishops ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mentioned nor agried upon in Assembly. These Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
who would have entred the Parliament-house to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that falshood, and protest against it, were holden out
from protesting publickly, but they delivered their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stati
win write to the Estates severally.</p>
            <p>All this time these pretended prelats laboured, that there
should be no generall Assembly at all to censure them for
transgressing their cautions that they might the more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contraveene.
And whereas in these generall assemblies
before their dissolving the kings Majestie or his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner
beeing present did appoint the time and place of the
<pb facs="tcp:17447:4"/>
next assemblie. His Majestiie beeing moved by these Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who could not endure the censure of generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes,
by his owne warrant first shifted the time solemnely
appointed by the last assembly to another time, and then
to no certaine time: which made some of the speciall and
ablest Ministers to keepe the time last prescribed for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Kirks right. These were conveened before the
civill Iudge by commandement, and sentenced with bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
although only the Assembly shuld have judged, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their meeting had beene a lawfull assembly or not: some
others of these were for that same cause imprisoned. The
Kirkmen presented to Bishoprickes were restored to their
civill estate and dignitie in Parliament, voyces beeing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by consenting to erections of sundry Abbacies, and
other corrupt meanes in the year. 1606. Thereafter they
began to encroach upon the kirk government. First they
affected to be constant moderators; &amp; to the end they might
effectuat this point the more easily, they procured a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Ministers at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> not long after, while as
their chiefest opposites in the Ministerie were either bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
imprisoned, confyned or drawne up to Court, being
sent for by his Majestie to give their advice or best overtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
for the peace of the Kirk as was pretended. That meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
consisted of such as were sent for by his Majesties mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives
without mention of any generall assemblies. At this
meeting these who were styled Bishops in respect of their
benefice were made constant Moderators of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
where they were resident, but were unwillingly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the presbyteries. Yet this did not content them, and
therefore they accepted the power of the high Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
allowed them onely by his Majesties command, and
Lords of Counsell, against the act of Parliament inhibiting
any judicatories, but such as should bee established by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17447:5"/>
Thereafter they procured an Assembly to be holden at
<hi>Glasgow,</hi> consisting of such as were given in note to the
presbiteries, and corrupted by sowmes of money, or hopes
of preferment, or awed with the terrour of the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
At this pretended assembly some power in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
and moderation in provinciall Synods upon an
assurance by word, and an implicite condition in the Act
it self for set or yeerely assemblyes, was graunted to those
who were styled vulgarlie Bishops in respect of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
But the office of a Bishop was not re-established,
which before had beene damned by former Assemblies.
Yet went some of them to <hi>England,</hi> and received consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the office of a Diocesian Bishop, returned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrat
their Fellowes deserted their flocks, and governed as
diocesian Bishops without respect to the limitations of the
act of the pretended assembly. And this their usurpation
they maintaine by the power and authoritie of the high
Commission.</p>
            <p>Finding that yet they wanted meanes to make the people
stumble, &amp; so to be brought under their censure, a nationall
assembly was called 1618. Whereunto his Majesty invited
by his letters above thirtie Noblemen &amp; Gentlemen wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Commissions, who voted to the conclusions of that
pretended assembly. Ministers were brought in from the
streets, and some were written for to assist (though never
chosen for Commissioners). These who had Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were neither suffered to reason, nor vote freely. (There
they concluded the five articles, which had beene formerly
condemned by our Kirk as superstitious) promising then
to leave the practise of them arbitrarie. These they procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the like indirect meanes to bee ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Anno 1621. Against the which articles and ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof in Parliament (without the desire and consent of
the assemblyes had thereunto) the most religious and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:17447:5"/>
of the Ministerie did solemnely protest in name of
the reformed Kirk of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> whereunto the most
part of the particular Congregations have adhered, and
never practised these Articles. Notwithstanding heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Bishops did presse them violently, and when any
refused practise, there was matter for their high Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to worke on. This their usurpation even without any
pretended warrant of corrupt assemblyes; and their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
encreased. For they usurpe the moderation of general
Assemblyes which are holden only at their pleasure, at
diocesian Synods they sit as Iudges rather than simple mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators.
They ordaine Ministers not in the presence, or
with consent of the Congregation, but in some remote
place, and sometimes without the presence of any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Presbyterie, or bounds where the Minister is
to serve. They give orders to sundrie without the charge
of any flock, they suspend and deprive Ministers usually
for none conformitie, not in Pres-byteries and in Synods,
where-unto they are tyed, but in the Court of high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
wherein they fyne, confyne, or imprison Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
or professors at their pleasure. They stay pres-by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
from proceeding to the sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They exact subscripiton from intrants to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
unto articles framed by themselves alanerly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre
the best qualified for refusing to subscribe. It doth
not content them to admit according to the oath contained
in the Act of Parliament. They convocate Ministers to
promiscuous meetinges, and direct their mandates from
these, as from the representative Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> They
consecrate Bishops and ordaine Ministers according to a
forme not allowed by this Kirk. They debarre persons
presented by lawfull Patrons, because they refuse to enter
by the degree of a baptizing Deacon. They sit in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
Session, and Exchequer, contrare to the word of God
<pb facs="tcp:17447:6"/>
and acts of the Kirk. They staye processe against <hi>Papists.</hi>
They teach Popish and Arminian pointes of doctrine, or
preferre such as teach the like. They bring in practise of
novations in the royall chappell, not warranted so much
as by any pretended acts of corrupt Assemblies. But to
relate their particular insolencies and usurpations were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a Volume than for this short information.</p>
            <p>And although at Conventions and Parliaments their
oppressions were complained upon, yet neither parliament,
Convention or Counsell, would heare any plaint against
them. By direction of his Majesties private letters the
Counsell all wayes interposed their authoritie to all their
sentences in the high Commission, when it was craved,
and assisted them so far as lay in them, which did increase
their pride, and encourage their undertaking all novelti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
which seemed good in their owne eyes. Thus think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves by thirtie one yeares experience sufficiently
persuaded of the passive disposition of the people to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what they would impose, and of the secret Counsells as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
they obtained his Majesties letters patents for an
high Commission consisting of above an hundreth
persons civill and ecclesiasticall promiscuously, whereof
the Bishop of any Diocie, might assume any six to himself,
and there judge any person of whatso-ever qualitie within,
or without his diocie, whereas only before Arch-bishops
might held Courtes of high Commission. Some of the
Bishops began to put this new Commission in practise, and
and give it life and execution.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1636 the Bishops framed a booke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and constitutions for governing the kirke of Scotland.
Which did quite subvert the order and forme of discipline
established, contained many errours, and opened a doore
for many moe both in doctrinall and disciplinarie points of
Religion, whensoever the Kings Majestie upon the Bishops
<pb facs="tcp:17447:6"/>
recommendation would ordaine the same. In this booke
it was ordained that there should bee no obloquie against
these Canons, or booke of Common prayer, which was
to bee set foorth, notwithstanding such proceedings were
illegall.</p>
            <p>In the next yeare in Iunij 1637 the said Bishops caused
print the booke of Common prayer, compiled by them
for the use of this Kirk, which was appointed by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
letter to bee received, as the onlie forme of Gods
publick worship, where-unto all Subjects either civill or
ecclesiasticall behoved to conforme themselves, and the
contraveeners to be condignly punished. By proclamation
each Minister was enjoyned, and some charged with letters
of horning to buy two of them for the use of the Parish.
Approbation from the Lords of Counsell was given to it,
when few but Bishops were present at Counsell.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> accompanied with two Arch
bishops, and sundrie other Bishops (notwithstanding the
mislik Ministers and Professours had for the manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
&amp; corruptions of the same) began the use of it
in the cheife Kirk of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> upon the 23 Iulij. 1637.
The people much discontented with the former novations,
could not endure so great and sudden alteration, as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a change both of the externall forme, and nature of the
former publick worship, did the most part of them all at
one instant rise &amp; hinder the new service, calling it supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
or idolatrous. The same was also stopped in another
Kirk of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where it was to bee read by the Bishop
of <hi>Argyle.</hi> Notwithstanding heereof they procured by
act of Counsell, the paine of death without all favour and
mercie to bee denounced against all those who should any
wayes raile or speake against the Bishops, or any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
cleargie, or against the Service booke. They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the Ministers and Readers in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (who
<pb facs="tcp:17447:7"/>
refused the Booke,) there wonted service, and interdited
the publicke Evening and Morning prayer, reding of
Scriptures, singing of Psalmes, for a long time, and still
pressing the buying and practising of the said Booke by all
Ministers. Which moved the Ministers first to petition,
and next manie of the Nobilitie, Gentrie, Burgesses, and
Ministers to meete, and to supplicate the Lordes of privie
Counsell against the saids books of Canons and Common
prayers against the illegall and unorderlie waye of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the same.</p>
            <p>The generall Supplication sent to His Majestie by the
Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> (who was then returning to <hi>England</hi>
from the buriall of his Mother in September, 1937.) was
answered in October only by a Proclamation, discharging
the Counsell to meddle in Kirk matters, and charging all
the Supplicants to depart out of the Town within twentie
foure houres, under the paine of rebellion, as also the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories
of Counsell, and Session to remove, but no
wayes answering the petitions, which the Supplicants
did patiently expect, notwithstanding the matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the service of God. The Supplicants gave in then a
Complaint against the Bishops, offering to prove these
bookes contained the seedes of Superstition and Idolatrie
&amp;c. and craved justice upon the Bishops, as authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and guiltie of lies, betwixt the King and his Subjects,
and many other crimes censurable by Law.</p>
            <p>The affection of people drawing so many together to
waite for the answere to their Supplications gave offence
to the Lords of Counsell, whereupon the Supplicants for
giving them satisfaction, did with their consent choose
but a few of their number to attend the same, who after
long expectation, were answered only by a Proclamation
upon the seventh of December, declaring his Majestie not
to be inclined to Popery, which the Supplicants did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb facs="tcp:17447:7"/>
They beeing then earnestly required, by such as
had power from his Majestie, to divide the supplications
severally by shires, to restraine them only to the bookes of
Canons and Common prayer, and to passe from the high
Commission and the pursuite of the Bishops, the suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
gave sundrie reasons, why they could not doe so,
shewing also, that if the Bishops keeped their boundlesse u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
power, they could soone frame and bring in the like
bookes within a short space, and offered to prove they had
all deserved exemplare punishment by their usurpation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Law, and by their heavie tyranny unlawfully exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on the Subjects for many yeares.</p>
            <p>All this time the Supplicants could obtaine no answere
to the supplications sent to His Majestie, nor move the
Counsell to receive them, and recommend them to His
Majestie not for the space of a whole Moneth, although
they continually attended, till they were ready to make
protestation against the Counsell for not hearing them in
so important a businesse.</p>
            <p>Vpon the twentie one daye of December, 1637. the
Counsell' received the generall Supplication, and sent it to
his Majestie, at which time the Supplicants declined the
Bishops from being their Iudges, as beeing now their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The answere to the particulare and generall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
was returned by a Proclamation made in Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie,
1638. Whereby his Majestie had declared hee had
ordained the booke of Common prayer to bee compyled,
that hee had approved the same as a ready meane to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the true Religion, and beate out all Superstition and
Idolatrie, and doubted not to satisfie the minds of all the
Subjects. Heere-with charged them all to depart from
these Townes where the Counsell or Session should sit, and
to abstaine from all meetings any where under the paine of
Treason. A verie great number of the Nobilitie and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb facs="tcp:17447:8"/>
made a proestation on the mercat Crosse of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
immediatly after the Proclamation was red, against
the bookes of Canons, and Common prayer, high
Commission, and all other Novations introduced in the
Kirke against or without the Word of GOD and lawes of
the Countrey, and against the Bishops as their parties, &amp;
that in no judicatorie they should sit as their Iudges, till
they were tryed by Law. That their whole meetings were
lawfull &amp; necessare, &amp; that they might have their recourse
to his Majestie. The Supplicants were then forced to
forbeare any futher dealing with the Counsell, because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law of Nature and Nations they would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their declinatour against the Bishops their parties from
sitting as their Iudges, whereas they offered under the
paine of their lives, to prove many haynous crymes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and such as were palpable to the World. as
their introduction of Poperie, and Arminianisme, &amp; their
many publick transgressions against Law.</p>
            <p>The whole Nobilitie, Gentrie, Burrowes, Ministers,
and Commons, who had now so often supplicat, and so
long attended, were cast into great difficulties considering
their Religion so well warranted by Gods Word, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by the lawes of the Kirke and Kingdome, was
now begunne to bee changed, both in doctrine and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
at the pleasure of the fourteene Bishops, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Countrie like to bee infringed by their usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
and that having complained often upon them to
his Majestie by his Counsell, were answered by the former
declaration approving these Popish bookes, their wicked &amp;
unlawfull proceedings, and condemning the Supplicants
lawfull and peaceable meetings, and humble waye of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating,
as prejudiciall to regall authoritie, prohibiting
also their necessar meetings in time comming, All these
did move the Supplicants, to bethinke the renewing
<pb facs="tcp:17447:8"/>
of the nationall Covenant of this Kirke &amp; Kingdom,
(the breach whereof hath beene a speciall cause to bring
these evills upon them) to bee a good meane for obtaining
the Lords wonted favour, having many examples in holy
Scripture that the people of GOD have happily renewed
their Covenant with GOD.</p>
            <p>This their Covenant containeth nothing in substance
but that which is contained in the Confession of Faith, and
generall band formerly made for maintenance of Religion,
&amp; acts of Parliament made at sundie times. The Confession
of Faith was approved by diverse Acts of secreet Counsell,
and generall Assemblbes. It was first subscribed by King
IAMES himself, and his whole House-hold, after by all
his Subjects, commanded by publick Proclamation to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.
Subscription to this Confession hath beene in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
practise, when any persons suspect of Papistrie were
to be tryed, &amp; likewise masters of Schooles &amp; Colledges
were ordained by act of Assemblye to cause their Schollers
subscribe when they were to passe their degrees, which
hath beene observed to this day.</p>
            <p>The practise of subscribing beeing in continuall use to
this time was a sufficient warrant for the Supplicants to
subscribe the same for manifesting their affection to GODS
trueth, and holding out all Popish superstition. To the said
Confession are subjoyned such acts of Parliament, as ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the heads thereof, and were made in favours of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
professed in the same, Together with a part of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
band formerly made and subscribed by authoritie of
King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Counsell, binding all the Subjects to
the defence of Religion, and his Majesties person, and each
to other in these two causes. The Supplicants bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to forbeare all approbation or practise of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and innovations brought in this Kirk, till the forme of
their entry their lawfulnes, or expediencie be tryed in a free
<pb facs="tcp:17447:9"/>
generall Assemblye, and to labour by all meanes lawfull to
recover the puritie and libertie of the Gospell, as it was
professed and established before the entrie of the said No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
But withall they declare that the novations and
evills contained in their Supplications, complaints &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
have no warrant in the word of God, and are con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trare
to the articles of the forsaid confession, &amp; acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
They promise to forbeare the practise and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of novations already entred, till a free assembly and
Parliament, because they were never condiscended upon,
but in pretended Assemblies, and upon conditions which
have not beene observed, besides that protestations have
beene made contrare to the same.</p>
            <p>This Covenant was subscribed by many thousands in
Februarie last, yea, in a very short time, by almost the
whole Kingdome. It was publickly read and sworne in
most Kirks with great motion, prayers, and teares, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
repentance for their sinnes, specially for their breach
of Covenant to God in suffering the puritie of his worship
to bee thus tainted. The desire of true knowledge
wrought by it in the hearts of the people may approve it
to bee a speciall meane appointed by God for reclaiming
this Nation to himself.</p>
            <p>The supplicants having now both by oath &amp; subscription
manifested their desires to be religious, &amp; their hearts loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and faithfull to their Prince, beeing now barred from
dealing with the privy Counsell, who admitted the Bishops
to sit as Iudges in the cause, after the Supplicants had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
them as parties, and beeing desirous his Majestie
should bee rightly informed, that hee might give a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
answer, they thought it expedient to write to the Duke
of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortoun,</hi> as
speciall members of this state, because they had neere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to his Majestie, not doubting that they could not but
<pb facs="tcp:17447:9"/>
bee very sensible of these evills complained upon, desired
them to learne from his Majestie, if hee would bee pleased
to receive a new petition from the Supplicants immediatly
or if they should make their desires knowne to his Majesty
by their Lordships. This supplication was sent to have been
delivered if his Majestie would have received it, and also
some articles containing their just desires for their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
information. His Majestie was not willing to receive
the supplication, but perusing the articles did remit his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
answere to bee delivered by the Marquesse of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi>
who was to bee sent as his Majesties Commissioner,
with instructions and power for settling the peace of this
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Vpon the thirtie day of May a ship arrived at the road of
<hi>Leith,</hi> carrying a great deale of munition, as Cannon, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with Cannon ball, musquets, Pikes, and match for the
Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> foretold &amp; threatned by the Bishop
of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and his followers, who affirmed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
that Castle, and fortifieng the towne of <hi>Leith,</hi> to
bee the onely meane to beate down <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and force
them to undergoe any thing should bee injoyned, as also
to hold the supplicants out of it &amp;c. Upon suspition that
the putting of this munition in the Castle would be stayed,
the Lord Thesaurer did convey it quyetly to <hi>Mussilburgh</hi>
harberie and from thence to <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> The people remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
the threatnings preceeding, and considering that
such provision had not beene made for these places these
thirtie yeares by past, began to suspect danger The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants
suspecting that the same would bee imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the bodie of the Kingdome, who were ayming at no
thing but the preservation of Religion, and the Subjects li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
resolved without giving offence, to keepe a watch
lest any of that provision should bee conveyed into these
places against the wonted custome: For these are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb facs="tcp:17447:10"/>
forts in the Countrie appointed for her sastetie, and not
for her hurt.</p>
            <p>The Marquesse of <hi>Hamilton</hi> being appointed his Majesties
Commissioner did send a number of missives to his friends,
followers &amp; acquaintance in <hi>Scotland</hi> from Court, to meet
him at <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> and <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> the fifth day of Iunij.
Where-upon the Papists applauding to the Service booke,
bragged that they with some neutralls, and such as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in matters of Religion, would assist the Bishops, &amp;
used all their meanes to conveene the greatest numbers they
could.</p>
            <p>The Supplicants moved with the provision intended for
the Castle, and these frequent meetings of Papists &amp; neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals,
resolved not to joyne with them at their meeting with
the Commissioner, because they would impudently ascribe
the most part of these whom hee had required, to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
and these neutralls, for these and some other important
reasons, the Supplicants resolved to send out some few of
their number to make their excuse to my Lord Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.
The Supplicants together &amp; the Towne of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
apart by their request procured his comming to <hi>Haly-rood-house</hi>
as the most convenient place for their attendance.</p>
            <p>Vpon the seventh of Iunij at his entrie hee was attended
by a great number of the Supplicants on horse, meeting him
three myles from <hi>Haly-rood-house,</hi> and all the way betwixt
by many thousands on foot, amongst the which were six or
seven hundreth of the Ministerie. In hope that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
would not offer to furnish the Castle with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
during the treatie, the numbers appointed for watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were diminished even before his entrie.</p>
            <p>The Supplicants renewed their former desires of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assembly and Parliament to the Commissioner, as the
only meane to redresse the evills complained upon. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
himselfe unable to grant either, till first the
<pb facs="tcp:17447:10"/>
Countrie were in a peaceable condition, &amp; till they should
first rescind and render their subscribed Covenants to his
Majestie. To the first it was answered, the Cuntrie was not
unpeaceable, there was many humble supplications desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
remedie of these pressing grievances, the Supplicants
could not be moved to stay from meeting, and supplicating
till they should receive a gratious answere, and the onely
meane to content them was the granting of a free generall
Assembly, and a Parliament, for the second, they could
not draw on themselves the guilt of perjurie before God, &amp;
gave the Commissioner sufficient reasons of their refusall,
which are extant in print.</p>
            <p>The Commissioner excepted against that clause in the
Covenant, bearing mutuall defence, as if the Supplicants
had combyned themselves to maintaine each other in their
owne private quarrells, howbeeit the clause bee cleare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neugh
of itself, yet for his Majesties satisfaction they gave
in a Supplication to the Commissioner, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their mutuall defence of each other, was only in the
defence of true Religion, of the lawes and liberties of this
Kirk and Kingdome, and of his Majesties person, and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
in preservation thereof, where-with his Grace acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esed.</p>
            <p>The Commissioner professing, that all his instructions
did runne on the hope of having the Covenant surrendred,
and this failing, hee could doe no more but returne, and
deale with his Majesty for obtaining a free generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and Parliament. Withall did shew that before his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hee behoved to publish his Majesties gratious declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so first made that proclamation of returning the
Counsell, and Session to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to make a faire way
for the other, professing also, that the other should bee full
of goodnesse, promising only a generall Assembly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and discharging all novations introduced. Where
<pb facs="tcp:17447:11"/>
upon a protestation was provided only to give thanks to his
Majestie, and to protest that some short and convenient
time might bee appointed for holding the Assemblye and
Parliament.</p>
            <p>But the Supplicants attending the publishing of this faire
and smooth declaration, when it was proclaimed upon the
fourth of Iulij they found it so grievous, as it necessitat the
Supplicants to make that protestation, which is extant in
print.</p>
            <p>As the Supplicants were grieved at the Proclamation,
so their griefe was augmented when they heard that the
Lordes of Counsell had approved the Proclamation by a
particular Act. For the Counsell had approved that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
as satisfactorie, and so full of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so that it might satisfie all men. Whereas it gave
saisfaction to none of the Supplicants desires, and did
condemne their lawfull meetings. Therefore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a supplication for the Commissioner, which did bear
their just exceptions at the Proclamation, and farre more
against the Counsells act of approbation. But the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
considering better of their Act, did teare it after it was
subscribed, and before it was put upon record. The next
day the Commissioner was supplicated and earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make some act to cleare, that the Counsells subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of the Kings Majesties declaration was no approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof from them, but only a warrant for the Clerke
to cause proclaime it. The Commissioner and most of the
Counsellers declared the same solemnely by their oaths,
wherein the Supplicants acquiesced. My Lord Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner
promised to recomend their desires earnestly to his
Majestie, and returne at the fifth of August next, or before
the twelft at the furthest.</p>
            <p>The Commissioner reported that it was written from
<hi>England,</hi> that these of this Nation were comming with
<pb facs="tcp:17447:11"/>
armes towards them. The Supplicants protested bef<gap reason="illegible: in crease" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>re
God, it never entred in their mindes to doe them the least
harme, but that they carried toward them all due respect
of Brethren, if they should not bee first invaded by them,
which was as farre from their expectation, as it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their deservings.</p>
            <p>But on the contrare, whereas such of the Bishops as
were chiefe authors of these evills, apprehending danger
from the Panick terrours of their guiltie consciences, &amp; not
from any just occasion offered by the Supplicants, when
they and their adherents, had acted the part of Incendiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
at the Court of <hi>England</hi> betwixt the Kings Majestie and
his Subjects, did thereafter retire themselves out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as hopelesse to find a partie for them there, these
who have not subscribed the Confession, excepting Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,
not beeing a considerable part, and the most part
of them no favourers of Bishops. And they bragged that
his Majestie will make the people of <hi>England</hi> come in
armes against <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is neither to bee expected
from so just a King against his own native subjects only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
for the preservation of true Religion, and liberties
of the Countrie established by lawes, nor from so good
and wise a people with whom the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> is
not more neerely conjoyned by marches, than all true Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
hearts have beene these many yeares past. It should
be an high and fearefull dissimulation, if any such spytefull
intention were keeped up against brethren, whose naturall
freedome and ingenuitie cannot admit the least suspition of
any such thoughts: seing they live in one Iie, under one King
&amp; have intertained commerce with as litle contoversie, or
debate, &amp; with as much affection and peace, as ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two Nations, yea, they are so far from intention to
offer wrong to the English, that they are resolved never to
suffer <hi>England</hi> to be wronged by any other Nation, so long

to wrong that Countrie, wherein so many worthie
Preachers and professours have given both by writing and
suffering abundant testimonie to the cause they plead for in
all the particulars thereof, which now they maintaine. My
Lordes of the Clergie in <hi>Scotland</hi> as they have borrowed
somethings from <hi>England,</hi> to wit, high Commission, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and such other stuffe not warranted by law, as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
thought to have repared that loane by establishing
the new Service booke first heere, that thereafter their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats
might thrust out that service so long continued in
<hi>England,</hi> for if it had not been for that end, it shuld not have
goten so much help and approbation from thence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
from <hi>Rome.</hi> But that current is stopped heere, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be God, and we wish it might be also there, If some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Bishops, seeming to compassionate their Brethren
heere, have a desire to further the plot, though it were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Nationall Perills, &amp; so may move the English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
as persons furthest disappointed, to undertake the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie
of their cause, by giving their whole assistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which beeing once suppressed, all may bee
setled there, and then undoubtedly in <hi>England:</hi> The king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> (with reservation of all due respect to the
true English) craveth they maye not onely have help from
good Christians there, in case of such invasion: but also leave
to root out these <hi>Cananits,</hi> who are pricks in their sides. And
this much shortly, to give satis-faction to the better sort,
that there bee no mistaking amongst brethren. Cursed bee
these that doe not wish and pray for peace, if it can bee had
without that great losse of the Gospell of peace, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and power thereof according to the word of God.</p>
