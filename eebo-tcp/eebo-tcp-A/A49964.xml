            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IN order to my laſt promiſe, I have been, and now am as good as my word to you, though you have not been the like to me, for give me leave to tax you with breach of promiſe, not writting to me, ſince your laſt which bore, date the</hi> 2<hi>d. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, according to your ſtile; which I take moſt unkindly from you. But by the way you ſhall not tax me with the like ungratitude, for I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to continue that ſuccict accompt I promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49999:2"/>
you in order, to what you were pleaſed to deſire of me, in Relation to his Grace,</hi> James <hi>Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>who being now more remoate, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, if my relation be not to ſo particular as it otherwiſe ſhould have been, what I now give you ſhall be impartial unbiast, and without flattery I ſhall be ſo generous with you, as to communicate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you, but what is a certain reallity. Sir I hope you will accept it, and ſo I will aſſure you it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my laſt I gave you an account of the Dukes arrival, ſince which time he hath thought fit to take a journey to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and the places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent, I am informed by perſons of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quality, his reception there, was every way coroſpondent to his Quality and Birth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not to bely the buſineſs, perſons there as well as elce where were on the contrary faction; in his paſſage, he and our Agent dined with our Prince, being entertained very Coldly, upon what accaſion is not yet known neither ſhall I ſo far intermedle with the concernes as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs it. It ſeems his Grace hath not behaved himſelf ſo ill, but that he was complimented by the cheif Majeſtrates of this place, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places where he made any conſiderable ſtay It is thought he will cut is journey ſhort, and retire to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> but until better informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I dare not affirme it for a truth; though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more talked on at preſent, and that by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49999:2"/>
the moſt ſollid Heads: truth it is, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved himſelf from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and deſignes to Viſit <hi>North-Holland,</hi> but whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to fix at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> or not, I as yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affirme in relation to the proceedings there, it is conceived there will be an accomodation. But upon what terms is not known in Publique, to give you ground for what I ſay, the <hi>Danes</hi> has withdrawn Five Sail of his Men of War from the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and ſome part of his land forces from before the Town, and not only ſo, but admitted them to convey in Five Hundred head of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ſmall and great, which was as a thing unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as I conceive, had not an accomodation been privately concluded, ſo that in any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable perſons judgment, nothing can poſſibly be imagined, but the Ratification of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Articles already concluded and agreed on: which what they are may be imagined but not affirmed, or at leaſt wiſe Confirmed, until my next, as far as I can inform my ſelf the Articles are theſe following. Firſt that the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> will admit of his Majeſty as Supream, not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him either the priveledge of his progenitors or prediceſſors (always excepted) their antient Liberties may be reſerved, intire without any Diminution. Secondly that for ſatisfaction of the <hi>Damages</hi> by them ſustained; they ſhould be duly and faithfully reinburſed ſuch Charges as they had laied out in their own defence, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49999:3"/>
this preſent Siege. Thirdly that no perſons whatever, either Foreigners or Natives, ſhould be exempted from free pardon upon all accounts whatever, in relation to the Vindication of the intereſt of the City. Fourthly that his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> should not only paſs his royal word, but publiſh the ſame by Proclamation, within few daies after theſe Articles ſigned. Fifthly, that all things relating to this place ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſame Nature as they did before the beginning of this late War, and no perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever should ſuſtain any damage for their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according to the Five Articles above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Sir, This is what I can aſſure you from this Weeks abſervations as to the Articles, although I have them from a good (and I think Infallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author) yet I will not affirm them, until my own eyes convince me of their truth, which a few daies I will certainly do, till then excuſe me from a further Relation, which ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amplified in my next, by.</p>
