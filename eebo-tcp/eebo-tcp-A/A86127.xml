            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O deadly Life! O immortal Death! what ſhall I term thee? Life, wherefore then doſt thou kill Death, and wherefore doſt thou then endure?

All things that are finite, I may be compared together; but between that which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and that which is infinite, there is no compariſon.</p>
               <p>Neither is it any piece of Injuſtice to inflict Eternal Puniſhment for ſins that were done but for a time; becauſe the juſt and ſevere Judge doth not weigh the Actions only, but the Hearts of Men: For, therefore do the wicked ſin for a time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have but a time to live; but they are deſirous to live for ever, becauſe they are deſirous to offend for ever; being more deſirous to ſin than to live, and not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, but only to enjoy the Pleaſures of ſin; and therefore it is juſt that they ſhou'd never want puniſhment who ever had a will to offend, that they ſhould never find an end of Revenge, who would never have made an end of ſin. Again, as God is infinite both in Majeſty and Mercy, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that every Offence againſt that Majeſty is alſo infinite, and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy infinitely to be puniſh'd. And ſurely if a Man that is ſharply pinch'd with ſome

               <p>The Will of God ſhall be the Will of the Saints; as they ſhall give a full and free Conſent to the Will of God, ſo ſhall God in all things conſent unto their Will; for how can the Head diſagree from the Members, how can one perfect Spirit be contrary to it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as the Sea receiveth all Streams, and yet hath proper Waters in far greater abundance, ſo in God there is a Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all the Perfections of all Creatures, yet his own Perfection doth infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, with the Preſence whereof all the Powers of the Mind ſhall be filled, all the Senſes of the Body ſatiated; inſomuch as they ſhall neither in deſire ſeek, nor in hope aſpire, nor in imagination create any greater Pleaſure: For therefore hath God made <hi>Man,</hi> that <hi>Man</hi> ſhould receive by him
