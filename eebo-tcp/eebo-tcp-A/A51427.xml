            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The first is the presentment of a Schismatick, in these words [<hi>If any seem to be Contentious.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The second, of a Renouncement and rejecting of him in the next words [<hi>We have no such Custome, nor the Churches of God.</hi>]</p>
            <p>In the first place we are to learne the Presentment, [<hi>If any</hi>] doth the Apostle doubt hereof? He sheweth in the former Chapters that he had information there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65744:3"/>
and doth he now question it? Let us consult with himselfe in the 18 <hi>verse,</hi>

the which I am now to deliver to you paraphrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>this Contentious Man,</hi> saith he, <hi>maketh ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own worthinesse</hi>; his Character here it selfe conceitednesse, rank poyson at the first,<note place="margin">Prov. 24.12.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his <hi>Wisdom</hi> thought of it: <hi>Seest thou one conceited in himselfe</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is more hope of a foole than of him:</hi> especially if it be of the worthinesse of his own wisdom: And if he be given to <hi>Ostentation,</hi> then sure he will seeke our some company among whom he may boast it: That is the next <hi>carrying people after him</hi> (saith <hi>Augustin</hi>) alluding to the words of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning like <hi>contentious, drawing disciples after them,</hi> this Character is popular ambition, that that company may be dependant upon them, and then it is odds he will carry and draw them from the Church, which is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the next words. <hi>Affecting Divisions:</hi> This Character is black mallice, affecting divisions, that is, delighting in divisions, even for divisions sake, as much as to cut off the Limbs of a Man, only to cut them off: And when this division is wrought, what will this boaster think of himselfe trow ye; It is told us, <hi>He swelleth with Pride,</hi> You have his Character na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is swelling Pride. And no marveile, for when this ostentator shall look behind him and see, as a Leader, what Troops of People he <hi>carrieth,</hi> or, as a <hi>Rabbi,</hi> what number of Disciples he <hi>draweth</hi> behind him: Is it any wonder that being cryed up by their acclamation, their breath should be a full Gayle (He hoysing up his top-sayle) to carry him, he knoweth not himselfe whether, being now destitute both of the Helme of discretion, and Anchor of moderation, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65744:4"/>
will now appeare by his other Characters, in respect both of Church and State: Church how? He is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully slanderous:</hi> You see the Character is lying <hi>deceitfully:</hi> And so it must needs be; for doth any separate themselves from any Church, but will cast dirt with their heeles upon the face of that Church by imputations (albeit never so false) against their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conversation, as prophane, their Doctrine Erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their worship as Superstitious, or Idolatrous, whereof we shall have occasion to speake hereafter. Nor shall the Civill estate escape them. Therefore doth <hi>Auguistin</hi> note them to be <hi>Trecherously seditious: Germany</hi> gave the world sufficient Arguments hereof, by the miserable combustions raised by the <hi>Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi> faction among them: And something I could say concerning the same among us; If the report of <hi>Pamphlets</hi> were worthy the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> only this one thing, which I have read in divers of their printed Books; that in their invective against Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Service, they excite their Auditors by such Texts of Scripture as speake directly of massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring: One I have yet in memory, the words of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, Cursed is he that doth the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,</hi> where immediatly followeth, <hi>And cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from Bloud:</hi> wherby was ment the vengeance which God would have execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon <hi>Moab,</hi> as if they who are now Thorns in the Eyes of States, would afterward prove Goads in their sides: But can any imagine how these contentious ones can presume to shew their faces in broyling the world in this manner? Be it known unto you that however ostentative such Men are, yet they disguise
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65744:4"/>
themselves, as the same Father will have us observe. <hi>Least they may seeme</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be destitute of the light of Truth.</hi> Destitute then they were of Truth, which is the Character of Ignorance, although they would not seeme to be such; next they arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>the shadow of Austerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Not true austerity, but a shadow of it, which is a Character of <hi>Hipocrisie?</hi> The Devill himselfe could not deceive Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as I may so say) in his own likenesse, and not putting upon himselfe the semblance of an <hi>Angell of Light.</hi> And notwithstanding all this, his Austerity is but a a shadow, Why so? Because it is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall in them; for what is the substance of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is it not Charity? <hi>If I give my body to be burnt, and have no Love, I am nothing</hi>:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>If I give all my goods to the poore, and have not Charity, I am nothing.</hi> So that these men having but a shadow of goodnesse, they themselves are transparent; so that a Man (in respect of Charity) may look thorow them, and then their Character must be just <hi>nothing,</hi> otherwise our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle will give them a proper one: where hee saith of such contentious spirits, <hi>Whilst you have Schismes are you not</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Carnall?</hi> When therefore wee are to discerne of these, we are not to regard there outwards; because their <hi>Austerity</hi> is but a pretended singularity of Devotion in themselves, and tigidity against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which how spirituall soever it may seeme to be, yet it may be <hi>Carnall:</hi> For <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> are Notionals; and yet by the Apostle are listed among the <hi>Fruits of the Flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.20.</note> which are the corrupt Acts proceeding from the rationall power of Man, even as <hi>Heresie</hi> it selfe is there termed, which beside attribute
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65744:5"/>
               <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> what the appetite of Schismaticks hath always been this way is notorious, whereof somewhat hereafter. I have reserved for the last place a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter which maketh his case most desperate, called by <hi>Auusten maddish obstinacy,</hi> of which kind <hi>Augustin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had full experience, when he said <hi>Convincere cos possum, convertere non possum,</hi> convince them I can, although I cannot convert them, which is not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, although they be perswaded, <hi>Aristotle</hi> his sothisters just whose scope in all Disputes was not verity but victory, especially by holding there one conclusion</p>

               </gap>, what shall we do with him? What, but send him to receive his doome from the Apostle in his next words in the second part of this Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have no such custome nor the Churches of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As much as to say, that the Schismatick by raysing contentions in the Church, he is an adversary both to the Apostolicall Order, and also to the Custome of all Churches of God: And therefore he justly incurreth that judgement from God, which he is liable unto: In a word, these contentions being rise in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the scope of the Apostle herein was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the reputation and dignity of this Church.</p>
            <p>I must first being with this scope of the Apostle, who finding these contentious persons seeking divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Church will have them know that departing from it, was to depart from the Church of God; but stay a little, could the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then the Church of God? Did S. <hi>Paul</hi> think so; Nay, did he not reprehend some in that Church for

their impetuous transferring of their Civill jars, and suits of Law unto the Courts of Infidels? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 7. Others for their wicked connivance and indulgence towards the <hi>Incestious,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. Others for their vile prophanations in the sacred <hi>Assemblies,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. Yea and other some for <hi>Heresie</hi> to boote, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 Now is there any Schismatick, yea or not Schismatick almost who at the first hearing of thus much would not judge this <hi>Corinth,</hi> to have been a Sinagoge of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, rather then so much as to carry the title of a Church, what would our Apostle have said to this objection if he had been now a live; verily the same which he said in the inscription of this his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he wrote thus, <hi>Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the Church of God</hi> (where) <hi>in Corinth: Corinth</hi> therefore was then the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Hereby we have this Doctrinall point,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> to wit that we are not to depart from any Church of Christ, for any scandall given unto us by any members and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors therein, but either for extreame Errours of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or Godlesse practises as being professed by it. You have heard of the resemblances which have been made of Gods Church, as namely that it is compared unto a Field, wherein are sowen Tares as well as Wheate; to a Net, wherein are conteined dead fish as well as living; and to a Fould, having in it Goats as well as Sheep: Yet is not the Field to be spoyled because of the Tares, nor the Net to be rent, because of the dead Fish; nor the Fould to be broken, because of the Goats. But the example of Christ may be our best direction, who since his Ascention into Heaven, sent his Messages to the seven Angels of the seven
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65744:6"/>
Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> charging five of them with their severall faultes, <hi>Apo.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. Saying, <hi>I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against thee: And I have something against thee, and thee:</hi> And in each of these every <hi>Something</hi> was a crime of a large cise. These Angels by Antiquity were termed <hi>Bishops,</hi> albeit ill Bishops, now let us see the processe of Christ against them, doth he deprive them at the first; No, but gives them their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar admonitions, denouncing their removall, except they should <hi>Repent.</hi> Nor doth he threaten the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents together with the Delinquents: much lesse doth he denounce eradication of the Office, because of their abuse of it; no, but by reprehending their vices only, he thereby justifieth their Offices. As we read of the Lord of the unjust Steward in the Gospell, he said to him, because of his injustice, <hi>Thou shalt be no longer Steward:</hi> Out with the unjust Steward then; but will the Lord therefore have no Steward and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all Steward-ship ever after? There was no such meaning, neither had Christ here: Because the other two good Angels were still continued and conserved. In a word, I should but aske any of these refractories, wherein all their reading of the book of God, from the beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> unto the end of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips,</hi> they ever found a free and visible Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was not a mixture of Godly and Wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</p>
            <p>Now that we have vindicated this Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> you will expect (I suppose) how wee shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our own <hi>Corinth, the Church of England.</hi> This must be our next endeavour, by retourning to our Text again.</p>

               <head>We have not such Custome, nor the Churches of God.</head>
               <p>Which words we say, did consequently infer both a confutation of the errors of Schismaticks and likewise a condemnation of their practise; we begin with our confutation.</p>
               <p>But first, we must understand their criminations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Church, the principall are these; her <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, Episcopacy, Ceremonies and Liturgies:</hi> The Imputations they lay upon her in these respects are towfold, one is the unlawfulnesse of them, as being no matters indifferent, the other is their other vicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, as being either <hi>Popish Superstitious</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous</hi> respectively.</p>
               <p>Against the first, we shall answer by way of appeale, as our Apostle instructeth, namely, unto the <hi>Custome of the Apostles</hi> themselves, or of other the acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are <hi>Constitutions</hi> unlawfull? We appeale to the Apostles and there Constitutions against eating of strangled or bloud, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and for brevity sake, we challenge all our opposites, to bring us the example of any one publick peaceable constituted Church in all the Christian World, wherein there were not inacted <hi>Constitutions</hi> to regulate the Churches by; and wee shall as easily retorne unto them a perfect body of a Man without joynts or sinews; we shall not except herein the Church of God at <hi>Geneva:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beza <hi>Epist.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Beza</hi> a famous Pastor in that Church, wished that, <hi>They who oppose the Constitutions of the Church might be punished as the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Church.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65744:7"/>
Secondly, <hi>Episcopacy</hi> had the next Crimination, of which I shall not say many words, but yet much, for we (for the lawfulnesse thereof) dare appeale unto the Apostles institution of it, to Christ his approbation already spoken off, to the universall practise thereof throughout the whole Christian world, as <hi>Jerome</hi> speake, even the compasse and breadth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for this time as also for its length in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it Vniversally, untill this last Age: We adde (for the justification of the same lawfulnesse) to the Iudgement of all Protestant Churches of former times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, concerning the lawfulnesse of <hi>significant Ceremonies,</hi> likewise we appeale to this our Apostle, who saith here against the Schismaticks, <hi>We have no such Custome:</hi> You need not turne many leaves to find his Iudgement, it is expresly set down in the 14 and 15 Verses, immediatly before this Text as an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, requiring that <hi>The Man should be uncovered,</hi> in the Assembly for Divine service, to represent his soveraignty over his wife; <hi>The Woman to be uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> betoking her subjection to her Husband, both these Ceremonies <hi>significant,</hi> and used in the publick worship of God; shall any say this was by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Apostolicall authority, and therefore not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable in this point to after Churches: Then was the the Angell of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> out when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from this Text, a confutation of such refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then, as we do against the Zelots of our times; saying, (They are the words of <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>Tales sunt illi qui bonos ac utiles Ecclesiae ritus covellunt: Such are they</hi> (saith he) <hi>who abolish the good and usefull rites of the Church.</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65744:7"/>
Beside that the Apostle hath prescribed rules for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the <hi>Ceremonies of the Church,</hi> one whereof is <hi>Edification,</hi> and what is edificant the same is also <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant:</hi> whereunto we say, all the chiefe Protestant Divines of severall Churches have subscribed.</p>
               <p>One word of the by, What if the uncovering of our Heads (as then) were continued in our Church still, could it be called an <hi>Innovation,</hi> which is not now invented, or <hi>Popish,</hi> which rather should be an expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration to <hi>Papists,</hi> to see our devout and reverend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portement, at the hearing of Embassages from Christ.</p>
               <p>Lastly our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> because a set forme of Prayer is falne into their crimination; as though we might not appeale herin to our Saviour Christ, delivering the the <hi>Apostles</hi> that set forme, which we call the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> saying, <hi>Pray you thus our Father,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Math. 6.9.</note> Yea (say they) it is said, <hi>Pray Thus,</hi> not pray <hi>This,</hi> that is, to make it a Patterne for othe Prayers, and not to be used as a Prayer it selfe, we desire that S. <hi>Luke</hi> may moderate the matter, who related Christs Words in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz. When you Pray say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Luke 11.2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> And is not there that [<hi>Our Father, This,</hi>] which now they were commanded to pray? Again although it were a forme for other Prayers, yet this hindereth not but it may be our Prayer too: The standing measure of the Land for proportioning all other like measures for Graine, May, notwithstanding, be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by. It must be some new conceipt sure, which hath ingendered this <hi>Innovation,</hi> They thinke perhaps that the command, being <hi>Pray Thus</hi> or <hi>This,</hi> in our former sense, would exclude all other formes of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er excepting This, which scruple ariseth from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65744:8"/>
not to observe that Christ his Answer was directed to the intention of the Apostles, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to have a prefixt forme of Prayer of Christ his own conception, as <hi>John's</hi> Disciples had from their Master: The sense then is, <hi>When</hi> you shall use a Prayer of mine own prescription, <hi>Pray thus,</hi> so that this kind of direction for that one forme can be no exclusion of all other: He that taketh from his friend own hand a speciall token of Remembrance in his absence, is not thereby forbid to make use of other <hi>Memorandums,</hi> which he might have had otherwise.</p>
               <p>One thing more would be demanded of them, to wit: when ever they knew in all their Reading any Divine that made this Glosse upon that Text, as to say <hi>These words, Pray Thus, import as much as to have said, Pray not This Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Easie it were to mention the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> of the antient Churches, I rather shall instance in one, which may be satisfactory in it selfe: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Trajan</hi> appointed <hi>Pliny</hi> to be one of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to search out the behaviours of Christians, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they were exercised in their Religious Assemblies and Devotions, and to certifie: His cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat was this, <hi>The Christians</hi> (saith he) assembling in private places, among other Prayers, have one for your Highnesse, <hi>Praying God to grant you long life, a faithfull Senate, a strong Army, and a Peaceable People:</hi> These was the Collect of those Saints and Martyrs, to avow their Allegiance unto those Emperours albeit Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. I have done with the first imputation against these particulars, touching the simple unlawfulnesse of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65744:8"/>
The second criminations, I told you, was against their pretended vitiousnesse, judging two of them <hi>Popish,</hi> two <hi>superstitious,</hi> and two <hi>Idolatrous</hi>; In all which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, wee finde that Character visible which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> noted then in his Schismatikes, when hee called them <hi>slanderous:</hi> as first for calling our <hi>Constitutions,</hi> concerning Doctrine, <hi>Popish</hi>; notwithstanding they manifoldly and manifestly make against both Pope and popery; And shall Episcopacy bee also called <hi>Popish</hi> without a slander seeing, that the Pope himselfe wil be reddy herein to give the Schismatike the lye, telling that he doth allow for Popish Bishop, none but such as shall have immediate dependance upon himselfe, their Pope, by acknowledging him the universall Bishop of all Bishops: A transcendent title which all our Bishops since the Reformation, have utterly abhor'd, and have abandoned h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s whole Papall jurisdiction, all of them even unto death, and some also by their death and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Superstitiousnesse</hi> the next crimination, and is one degree above Popish, because wee cannot say that every Popish act is superstitious, this they impute to our Liturgie and Ceremonies; Let us pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie their ignorance, who never yet knew what formall superstition meant; let them then learne it? <hi>A supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious act</hi> (say we) <hi>is that which is founded upon a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious opinions.</hi> It was not meerely the Pharises of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten washing, but their opinion of some especiall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereby, which Christ reprehended in them; nor was it the having of an Alter for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when he called them <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Aols</hi> 17. but the opinion of honouring a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65744:9"/>
God thereby, they knew not whom: And is it not in our Law to hold it no fellonie or treason which is not done in a felonious or trayterous intention? Let us but opening our eyes, and we shall easily see their slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lying also, for behold our Church in her service Booke, doth make knowne to all the world that shee doth detest the superstition of the Romish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by condemning their superstitious opinions. First, in making them necessary parts of Gods worship. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ascribing an efficacious sanctitie unto them: Thirdly, by arrogating a meritorious condignity from them unto themselves. Yea and besides she instructeth her Reader that she hath professedly purged her Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of all those Lees and dregges of superstitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Papists; which makes this their slander farre more slanderous.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding they persist in condemning the said Ceremonies as having bin either used or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Popery, stil bewraying their ignorances, for even this our Apostle did make use of the saying of Poets, <hi>Menander Aratus,</hi> and <hi>Epimenides,</hi> all <hi>Heathens</hi>; And shall therefore such Divine sentences be called <hi>Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</hi> I cannot omit, the peece of Prayer in our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, which is: <hi>That God will accept of our bounden duetie not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offences</hi>; the same hath been continually used in the Romish Masse, beseeching God that hee would admit of them and their devotions, <hi>Non tanquam aestimater meriti, sed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam veniae largitor, Not as an esteemer of merit, but as a giver of pardon</hi>; wherein the Romish, will they, nill they disclaime all conceipt of merit in their publike Liturgie, which is a condignity of a work by the exact
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65744:9"/>
Law of Gods; justice deserving an eternall reward, which merit notwithstanding they maintaine in their new Romish Creed, and bookes of controversies as an Article of their faith; howbeit, This sentence was that which brought the great Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees: when after his long and large dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout justification by perfection of workes; hee was inforced at last to cast Anchor absolutely upon the mercies of God, as (for so hee saith) <hi>Tutissimum, The most safe</hi> refuge of mans soule; this being granted, the same sentence serveth us, both for a testification of this our saving truth to our selves, as also for a confutation of the Popish error of merits, which is a judging <hi>out of his owne mouth:</hi> Wee demand then? ought our Church to have used this sentence or not? if so, then is not this prayer therefore to be called Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, because used in Popery, but ought she not? Then doe they fondly affirme shee ought not use a forme of prayer, which is both wholsome for him that prayeth, and usefull to convince the Romish Church of Error in her superstitious opinion of merit; But our Saviour hath taught us a more Divine lesson, saying;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Wisdom is justified of her Children:</hi> to let us understand, that truth is truth wheresoever it soundeth, even as a Pearle is a Pearle of price, although it be taken out of the head of a toade: I have insisted on this point, because it may justifie our whole Liturgy against the censuring of a rite Popish for that it was used in that popish Church.</p>
               <p>But there next blow is harder, condemning such rites, because abused by Papist<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, albeit not ignorant that herein wee can justly appeale not onely to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of ancient Churches of Christ, but even to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65744:10"/>
their owne schismaticall assemblies, for the Primitive Fathers, at the first dawing of publike peace in the Church, began to convert the <hi>Temples</hi> of Pagans, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had beene the brothell houses of devils) into the Houses of God consecreated to his worship; And our opposites themselves can sometimes bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to use these Churches wherein was professed and practised that Popish Liturgy, which they (and justly) inveighed against as indeed <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> which is the blackest brand that can bee put upon any worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: and which these opposites cast upon our Church as their last filth and dung.</p>
               <p>This they do because of two kind of kneelings, one at the administration of the holy Communion, the other of bowing at the hearing of the name of <hi>Jesus:</hi> To the first our answer is, that Papists will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to our Sacraments; Or if any doe, yet it is in opinion that our consecration doth not operate their faigned transubstantiation, and also the professed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, believing that there is therein no corporall presence of Christ, cannot adore that as Christ which they know is not Christ, and therefore can as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible bee Idolatrous, as the Papists in the worshipping their breaden God, cannot possibly but be, our reason is that that was an Article of Faith in the Primitive Churches of God, whereunto we may justly appeale in a doctrine never to be repealed.</p>
               <p>It is this: That it is impossible for any Creature to be in two places at once, not excepting the sacred bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, which their Catholike doctrine they professed for two causes, one to avouch the prerogative of God, to whom the existence in diverse places at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65744:10"/>
one time is properly essentiall: and this they groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that divine foundation the Scripture of <hi>God, Psalme</hi> 39.6. wherein the Psalmist in professing the Diety of the spirit of God, saith, <hi>Whether shall I goe from thy spirit, if I goe up to Heaven, thou art there, if downe to Hell, thou art there also, and if to the outermost part of the Sea, thither shall thy hand lead me:</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thus: The spirit of God is here, and there, and yonder, therefore it is in diverse places at one time, and consequently GOD, because by the same essentiall property, hee is as well in three Millians of places, and indeed every where as hee is in any three or two: and this they confirme by two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>First, that the spirit of God was at one time in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Prophets, <hi>Jeremie</hi> in <hi>Judea, Daniell</hi> in <hi>Babylon, Ezechiel</hi> in <hi>Chobar,</hi> this in the Old Testament, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the New, the same spirit of God, at one and the same time, was in the Apostles, when they were dispersed in diverse nations in the world for preaching the Gospell of Christ.</p>
               <p>There second reason of this their dispute was to preserve the integrity of the body and humanity of Christ. According to that caution of <hi>Augustine, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendum est, ut ita divinitatem Christi astruamus, ne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitatem ejus auferamus. Wee are so to defend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature of Christ, that we destroy not his bodily and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore they distinguish both natures (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of locall existence) arguing thus. Although the Deity be in Heaven, yet is it then on Earth also, and if on Earth, then is it in Heaven; but the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65744:11"/>
of Christ, if it be on Earth, it is not in Heaven, and when in Heaven, then is it not on Earth; This was the Catholique Faith in those perfects and purest times of Christianity; and that this was believed of them as an Article of Faith is as plaine: Because they maintained that Truth against the Hereticks of their time, who impugned the essential properties of <hi>Christs</hi> body, with one Article of ancient Faith doth strangle more all the virall parts of the Romish Masse worship.</p>
               <p>When we speak of impossibility of this or that, you are not to imagine that we thereby derogate any thing from the Omnipotence of God: God forbid, no, but that which we say of Impossibility, is truly for the dignifying of his Power; as when we say of the God of Truth; It is <hi>Impossible that he should lye, Heb.</hi> 17. or for the Lord of Life, and in himselfe Immortall, that he <hi>should dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not have brought disputes into the Pulpit, if the importunity of this our unseasonable Season had not exacted it of me.</p>
               <p>The next and last brand falleth upon the Reverence given to Christ at the hearing of the name of him our Saviour <hi>Jesus,</hi> and therefore Iesus, because our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which they call (ô black tongue) Idolatrous; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brethren, I appeale to every Conscience of Man when I heare mention of my Saviour, my heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly lift up to reverence the person of Christ in my soule, now on the Throne of Majesty; shall it not then be lawfull for me to expresse the same prayse of him, which my body, who hath redeemed me both body and soule for his prayse. But reasons will not down with these men, except such as may seem to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65744:11"/>
Divine: We shall offer them not an only seeming, but even a convincing reason from God himselfe, who to preserve his people from Idolatry, least they might make any Image of him (the high way to an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship) commanded them to remember, that when he manifested his presence among them, <hi>you saw no shape</hi> (said hee,) how then did they perceive his presence? he tells them, <hi>you heard only a voyce:</hi> as if God had said unto them, <hi>pinge sonum: Let your Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters picture a voyce,</hi> or any man <hi>adore</hi> a voyce if hee can, how <hi>impossible</hi> this is: you may know by this my every voyce, which while I utter, is transient, past and flowne, before you can fasten your thoughts upon it, and yet in despite of truth it selfe, they will have us Idolaters.</p>
               <p>Before I can end the point of kneeling, I cannot silence my griefe, to see all gesture of kneeling almost shut out of the Church; And yet wee all know that kneeling in prayer time was the Decorum practised by Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and <hi>Christ</hi> Himselfe; now what gout it is that hindereth, whether of prid, or lasinesse or perversnesse, I know not, This I know, that take away the outward forme of Devotion, the inward will sooner coole: hetherto we have beene exercised in the first consequence of this Text, which is, the confutation of the errors of the Schismaticall faction: Our second remaineth, which is the condemnation of their practises, yet before I can enter upon it, I would gladly be understood concerning the premises, namely that I have not so pleaded for Ceremonies and Littur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as to prejudice the wisdome of them, who by just Ecclesiasticall Order shall so regulate these matters, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65744:12"/>
may be most conducible for peace unanimity and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Church. In the interim, it cannot be offensive that the Child after so much vile ugly asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions cast upon our Mother, should vindicate her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by whom, through the blessing and mercy of GOD; hee hath his soules spirituall birth and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <head>Wee have no such Custome, nor the Churches of God.</head>
               <p>These words necessarily implying that they who are contentious against the Customes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Churches of God, doe by their separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from her, make themselves Advesaries against the Church, against her members, against <hi>God</hi> and against their owne soules these foure. For the Church is thereby left to a vexatious destruction, breach of Christian libertie, loade of infamy, and lurch of spirituall maintenance as much as can possibly bee wrought.</p>
               <p>First, The very separation it selfe is to the Church as a rupture in the body of Man; which did make <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to burst out into this hyperbole. <hi>These that raise contentions in the Church, are worse than they who pierced the sides of Christ:</hi> In which figure there is this truth, That Christ, who gave his naturall body for His Mysticall body, which is his Church, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a severe accompt of them who shall rent the peace of the Church.</p>

The liberty of the Church (by the confession of all Christian Churches, none excepted) is a power in GODS Church to order things indifferent according to the Apostolicall rules, <hi>of Decencie,</hi>

                  <hi>order and edification,</hi> whereupon wee make bold to call these contentious men, for their contrary opinion of judging this liberty of Gods Church unlawfull, <hi>superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> strange will some say: They who enveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst superstitions so bitterly, and in that pretence fall into separation from the Church, to bee termed <hi>superstitious.</hi>

               <p>Yes Beloved, and we need not to straine a gnat in proving it: That Admirable Man of God, and Pastor in the Church of God in <hi>Geneva,</hi> whom without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of honour, I cannot name, to wit <hi>Calv.</hi> upon the words of <hi>Deutronomie,</hi> wherein Gods People were forbid to make any compacts with the Heathen: which (being no morrall but onely a judiciall Law, and therefore was not to bee exacted now of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) reflecting upon the libertie of Christians in their use of Ecclesiasticall rites, gave this caution, that none urge to vehemently this against Ceremonies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the Apostles doctrine; wherein condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them who tooke away the Christian libertie of eating meates by these and their contrary prescripts, <hi>Eate not, taste not, handle not:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2:</note> which is all one with <hi>moove not, reade not,</hi> and other cases of indifferency: Are not then these men fit objectors of superstition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Churches Ordinances, who are themselves so grosly superstitious, pardon us, for who is their in these times that will not stand zealously upon his right of libertie.</p>

Infamy is (after mortall) the most grievoust of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions which they have multiplyd outragiously by their infamously famous Libels and Pamphlets; beside the slanders which, as have bin alleadged, by imputing Idolatry the vilest of Adulteries unto her, as if cursed children should call their mother whore: whereas our Apostle held it necessary to admonish all Christians to take heed they give no scandall to the Church of <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. bee this spoken to the Sectarists who make themselves scandalous against the Church, rather than endure any the least of this which they call the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls in the Church.</p>
               <p>The injuries to the members of the Church are the next mischiefes of separation: the first is the breach of <hi>Unitie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.4.</note> O how many obligations did our Apostle put upon his <hi>Ephesians</hi> for preserving of <hi>Unitie</hi> in the Church; the first is because it is <hi>one body</hi>; second <hi>one spirit,</hi> which is the spirit of <hi>Union:</hi> third <hi>one hope of our calling:</hi> that is to say the hope of one heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; after followeth <hi>one Lord</hi>; which is our Head Christ, and <hi>one faith,</hi> the soule of our soules, and <hi>one Baptisme,</hi> the Seale of the said Faith, and last and chiefest <hi>one Father</hi> of all who above all things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the unanimity of his Children; for take away <hi>Unitie,</hi> and all <hi>Sympathy</hi> is dissolved, which is a compassionate assertion one to each other, which the Apostles sheweth in his comparison betwixt the Church of God and Mans body, wherein the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers doe mutually rejoyce and greene at the joy or griefe of each other, in so much as, if the Heele bee prickt the tongue cryes I am hurt, and every part of the body if it were a tongue would cry the same, I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65744:13"/>
am hurt, this is called the sympathy of the members of the body: but when Members are dislocated and disjoyned then mutuall affection is deaded; and where Sympathy ceaseth, fare well all <hi>Charity,</hi> which necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily seperateth it selfe together with the separation; now, I beseech you, losses of <hi>Unitie, Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are not these <hi>injuries?</hi> And commonly all these spring from one roote <hi>envie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Ecclesiasticall records tell us that the Originall of Schismes hath been that he who (according to the first Character of the contentious person) did make <hi>ostentation of his owne worthinesse</hi> and found not respect from Governours in the Church; did thereupon picke quarrels with her in one pretence or other, even as <hi>Aerius</hi> the Head of a faction, because he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to bee made Bishop, was the first that spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the degree of Episcopacy it selfe; But yet there was peradventure some title of worthinesse of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such kinde of men in ancient times: But what now? Our Apostle, according to the former compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of members of the Church and parts of mans naturall body, wishing the contentation of every part, and to avoyd <hi>envie; The hand</hi> (saith he) <hi>will not say because I am not the eye, I am not of the body</hi>; meaning every part of the body contenteth it selfe with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Order it hath in the body, else their would be a dissolution of the whole body: But in these times the hand and foot both mutine cause they are not eyes and except our Coblers and Weavers bee allowed for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, they will acknowledge no head nor member; how these should receive so much tolleration any where within this Church I know not, except men
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65744:14"/>
thought themselves worthy to bee led with blinde guides: when as there might be as true Doctrin some time expected from Bedlam, whereof some examples might be given, if such Doctrines were not fitter for a Stage then a Pulpit.</p>
               <p>But to speak one word of them who arrogat the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit themselves by their extemporall faculty w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they bragge of; and enveighing against Popery: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing make themselves Popish, yea very Popes, for this is the excellency which the Pope of Room boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, that he is the supreame and sole infallible Iudge in matters of Doctrine; a priviledge thus expressed by the Iesuite <hi>Valentianus: Papa sive diligentium adhibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, sive non adhibuerit tamen infalibiter judicat</hi>; that is, <hi>whensoever the Pope determineth any doctrine, his judgement is infallible, whether he use diligence to try the Truth or not,</hi> which is flatly the heresie of <hi>Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the impiety against God, it is evident in this that the Churches, wherein Schisme is made, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Churches of God</hi>; And the God of these Churches is called the God of Peace; and so stiled by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> almost in every Epistle, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Sacriledge was the last Character wherewith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> decyphred this contentious man; And Sacriledge being a depriving the Ministers of God of their due. God by the Prophet accounteth it a <hi>Robery</hi> to Himselfe. But is it possible that devout men, who are so great enemies to Idolatry, and assume to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others spirituall, should become Sacrilegious. The Apostle sheweth this was no newes in his dayes, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thou that abhorrest Idolls, Committest thou Sacriledge.</hi> Match we now an Idolatrous, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Man together, as the Apostle doth here, and the Sacrilegious will thinke that the Idolatrous is farre more execrable then he himselfe can be. This Text which I have alleadged will say no: for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the most excellent disputant that hath bin knowne, knew his Logicke, in reasoning, for when hee condemne, the Sacrilegious Iew in comparison of the Idolatrous <hi>Gentill,</hi> it must bee held either (as the Schoole speaketh) an argument <hi>ab aequali:</hi> that is, thou Sacrileger, art as ill as the Idolater is: or else <hi>a minori:</hi> thou art worst, wherefore how ever these contentious men may maske themselves, under the visard of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Austerity in abhorring popery, superstition, or Idolatry, yet are they in one respect farre worse than the other, in as much as experience of all times hath proved that the Idolater was alwayes a Reverencer of some Diety, nor ever was a Superstitious Atheist heard of, although contrarily when hath been of any Atheist
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65744:15"/>
who was not Sacrilegious, that is, a rober of Gods right.</p>
               <p>Seeing now that contentiousnesse for separation is every way so pernicious: how shall the Seperatist sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himselfe? shall he think to make a Church of his own which shall be a Church of God, let us try this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. speaking of this Church of God at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.27.</note> he saith, <hi>You are the body of Christ, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your part:</hi> Wherein we are two have to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> one as it was a particular Church, and compared with that which is called the Catholike and universall Church of Christ: And so it is but a Member thereof. Secondly, as it is compared with its owne Members, so is it <hi>The body of Christ</hi> in it selfe; whence it followeth that Members broken from this Church of God in <hi>Corinth</hi> did ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by devide themselves from God Himselfe: <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> had to deale with such contentious persons in their times, and either of them proclaimed this saying: <hi>None can have God for his Father, who hath not the Church for his Mother</hi>; meaning them who were separated from their own Churches: The <hi>Papists</hi> you know arrogate this saying to the Church and Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> but vainely, because <hi>Cyprian</hi> at this time was at difference with <hi>Stephen</hi> the then POPE and contemned his excommunication, and <hi>Augustine</hi> was one of them, who withstood the Popes usurpation of appeales to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is time to conclude, the contentious men being Authors of too many miseries, the greatest mischiefe will bee against their own soules, because whosoever by contention maketh himselfe an adversary to the

Church of the God of Peace, doth therein make the God of Peace of the Church an Adversary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and what must his reward then bee but here sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and anguish of soule, and in the end, endlesse woe: As for you (Beloved in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>) bee you exhorted in the words of our Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <q>
