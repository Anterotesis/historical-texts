            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TRead ſoftly; peepe under theſe Curtaines, and view the moſt lively Pictures of theſe Times, for <hi>Innovation of Religion,</hi> that ever thine eyes or the Sun himſelfe beheld. A ſubtile Ieſuite, like a crafty Cat, luſtily plaies on his Fidle: Ieſuited States-men like ſo many ſilly Rats and Mice full a dauncing after him, as if they were mad. The Ieſuit laies his plot (with no ſmall cunning) how to reduce a State to Romiſh ſuperſtition, from the true Religion eſtabliſhed therein by law, and that without any noyſe, under pretence <hi>of bringing backe the true Relig on.</hi> By the true Religion (ſo often by our Author men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned) he meanes that Deviliſh fardel of Popiſh Idolatry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which never accounts it ſelfe in its proper element, till it ſwimme in blood; nor ever ſet foote in any State once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of it, but it certainly overwhelmed (if not the whole Common-wealth, yet) the perſon and progeny of the Prince that gave it any entertainement or harbour, with a dreadfull ruine. The uſe which, at the preſent, ſome Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks in ſome Countries improve it too is to leade in Arminianiſme. With this, the Politicke Heads of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faction are well content; as holding thoſe men the fitteſt Miniſters, and Arminianiſme the beſt Engine to bring the Grand Plot to the wiſhed perfection with moſt ſafety and ſpeed. How exactly theſe have kept their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in dauncing after our Ieſuits Fidle, and how punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they have obſerved his Rules and with what ſucceſſe, thou needeſt not goe farre for proofe; ſcarce any State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and maintaining the reformed Religion, but can produce evidences enough and too many of their unwearied

That levity of the Vulgar, to admire new things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne old, is fatall. Hereſie, therefore, which while it was in the firſt carrire, could by no force be ſtayed; nor by Art reſtrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterwards growing weary and faint, goes on more leaſurely: and being in it ſelfe divided and bruiſed, the violence of it abates, and ſo at laſt it comes backe to the ſame point from whence firſt it departed. Many Provinces of <hi>Germany</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured many Religions: now they retaine none at all, being more intent to the will of their Lords. One cauſe of this is, as I ſaid but now, Levity, and ignorance of the Truth. Another the impoſſibility of holding the people long ignorant of the leudneſſe of Hereſies, and Heretickes: and that they finde thoſe men to ſhift their opinions almoſt every yeere. Of their owne accord they depart aſunder into divers fractions, ſo that they cannot ſtand long. It is as if you ſhould ſet out a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of blind men to runne a race: ſooner would they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44763:4"/>
all miſſe, then any one get to the marke. This Argument, if a prudent Magiſtrate pleaſe to take up his people, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo many intricate mazes into which they have beene led, and having made triall of the ſraudes of ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apoſtates, will readily ſuffer themſelves to be reduced into the way.</p>
               <p>With this lenity muſt the firſt proceedings be layd: unleſſe the Hereſies be of that nature, that (without perill) they admit no delaies, Such are thoſe of the <hi>Muncerians,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">A Caution. Thomas Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, the firſt ring leader of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, he began at Alſtet in Tharing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Duke of Saxony.

For theſe, like ſharpe diſeaſes, deny place and opportunity to a ſlow courſe of Phyſicke, and therefore muſt be repreſſed with a ſwift and dangerous remedy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Arch-hereticks, and Teachers of Hereſies, are to be baniſht the Common-wealth, at once, if it may ſafely be done, but if not, then doe it leaſurely and by degrees. There needes no proofe to make this courſe appeare needfull. For turbulent and boyſterous winds being ſent packing, that Sea whoſe very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome they ſeemed to lay bare, will of it ſelfe againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come calme and ſtill: and that Error which hath loſt its Protector, will without oppoſition, put it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ruine. Never therefore can thoſe Emperours bee praiſed enough, who with baniſhment puniſhed <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Neſtorius, Nigilantius,</hi> and other Heretickes. But yet the Vandals deſerve execration, who having gotten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the Prieſts and Biſhops in <hi>Africa,</hi> ranne upon them with their Horſes, or elſe utterly baniſht them unto deſert places. There are many faire reaſons of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling ſuch as (being private men) attempt alteration in matters of Religion, albeit the people ſhould hugge them whiles they ſcatter their poyſons. But a Prince may undertake ſuch an enterprize lawfully, and juſtly, having meanes enough, not to ſuffer himſelfe to come under reproach for ſo doing. Three mighty Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Platine</hi> Elector, the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44763:5"/>
                  <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> an Elector alſo, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a change of the Lutheran Religion, into that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> or as themſelves terme it, the Reformed Religion. And albeit almoſt all their Subjects hated Zuinglianiſme, yet did theſe Princes without any tumult (ſave onely that <hi>Berline</hi> tooke upon him the boldneſſe to be angry) full accompliſh that commutation.</p>
               <p>In theſe alterations, theſe things for the moſt part, out of the Hiſtory of the change of Religion in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> the Act of <hi>Marpurg,</hi> and the Edict of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> I have obſerved. Firſt, they conceale their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of altering Religion, and rooting out of Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme: not in ſuch manner that the wiſer ſort could be kept hood-winkt, but that the multitude might not tumult. Scondly, by the Art of the Zuinglians, ſome were ſuborned who ſhould crave the exerciſe of the Reformed Religion, and that with many and ſugered words, that the Prince might not be thought to bee of his owne accord inclined to odious novelty, but onely gratiouſly indulgent to their conſciences, and to love and cheriſh the liberty thereof. Facility in a Prince to the prayer of the People uſeth to be extolled, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thoſe things which were fitter to bee denyed, hee ſhewes himſelfe exorable. Thirdly, one Church, or ſo, (and not above) was craved by them, that this ſuite might not ſeeme harſh to the multitude, which in the meane time were ſtill to hold many moe, not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſollicitous of any. Fourthly, here, notwithſtanding, the jealouſie of the Lutherans oppoſed it ſelfe, becauſe they could not but perceive that, with the Church, the profits and maintenance would bee withdrawne together. Nor was the quicke eyed providence of the States-men ignorant that this would happen. Therefore now they beginne to deviſe of a Conference, and of a Pacification. They aſſemble in the Court, the matter is debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Princes Councell: all notaries and witneſſes are denyed them. But this courſe is by no meanes to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44763:5"/>
be approved: for if a Conference be once appointed, each part ought to have its liberty and all advantages allowed entire, becauſe, if men ſhall be borne downe by the power of the ſtronger ſide, the Victors ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be eſteemed to have had the worſt cauſe. This was the caſe of the Arminians in <hi>Holland:</hi> whereas they, who had the oddes of the Princes favour, if they did indeed believe the goodneſſe of their cauſe, ought to have entred the liſts upon equall tearmes, and weapons. Fiftly, an Edict was publiſhed, that none ſhould caſt aſperſions upon, or contentiouſly brawle with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nor condemne one another of error; but, by all meanes cheriſh peace and concord. This Edict of the Princes proved an effectuall Engine to further the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended mutation. For by this meanes it was brought to paſſe, that no man durſt to contradict the Calviniſts, Zuinglians, Sacramentarians; no, nor ſo much as to name them. And now had error made a large ſtep, when it ſo wrought, that none might dare to diſcover, and lay it open to view. Notwithſtanding, all this, even then did not any man make any ſtirre, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, who are otherwiſe more temperate, would eaſily hold quarrelling and contumelious Sermons in deteſtation. And for this reaſon the Prince was not traduced as a Patron of Hereſies, but applauded as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of peace, eſpecially for that he ſtill permitted the bare and naked Poſition of the one, and the oppoſite Tenent of the other, to be freely taught by each party. Sixtly, a Diſputation in the Vniverſity was appointed, a Calviniſt conſtituted Moderator, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ordained Ordinary Profeſſor. Seventhly, in all theſe proceedings there was no open appearance of carrying in them any deſigne, of making Zuinglianiſme Heire to Lutheraniſme; but only this, that peace might be ſettled: for at that time nothing was deſired, but that the Lutherans, reteining all their dignities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes, would vouchſafe to ſit in Conſiſtory with the Reformed, and conſult together with them, as Brethren,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44763:6"/>
of Church affaires: which when they refuſed, they were accuſed as proud, contumacious, and diſobedient to authority, and ſeemed to deſerve a diſmiſſion from all, becauſe they deſpiſed their collegues and peace.</p>
               <p>All theſe things were hitherto thus carried, that trial might be made what the people would beare. For if any tumult ſhould have beene raiſed, if the Gardians of <hi>Iohn Caſimire,</hi> ſet about him for this very end that hee might not alter Religion, ſhould ſtir themſelves, there was a faire excuſe of all theſe doings at hand. Eightly, when the people of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> petitioned for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Lutheran Preachers, the matter was paſſed over in ſilence without anſwer: and in the meane ſpace, care taken that thoſe particular men which the people petitioned for, ſhould be traduced as too furious and heady. The people therefore eaſily let that ſuite fall, onely requeſting that, if thoſe they ſupplicated for, gave diſtaſte, yet at leaſt they might obtaine others more temperate and apt unto peace. For they ſuppoſed the deniall to ſpring onely from ſome offence taken at the men, not out of hatred of Lutheraniſme. Wherfore they ſtill fed themſelves with hope: and whiles hope of obteining liberty by prayers remained, they abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from armes, till at length they laid aſide all care of Lutheraniſme, and hope together. Ninthly, when all things now ſeemed ripe and ſafe, the Lutherans were commanded to depart from their Parochiall charge; and all the Churches beſtowed on the Calviniſts. Nor durſt they complaine; for, they that did, were baniſhed. But now turning themſelves to domeſticke cares, they only ſued for a poſthumian and honorary penſion, immunity from Taxes and the like: the Calviniſts in the meane time exceſſively laughing in their ſleeves, to ſee a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great bulke and height brought ſo humble, as to put up ſuch meane and abject Petitions. Tenthly, whereas the Auditors (or yonger Schollers) of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity were Lutheran, upon them they alſo practiſed with divers Arts. To Stipendaries ſuch as wete main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44763:6"/>
at the Electors charge, Calviniſme was offered or a diſmiſſion preſented. For the Catechiſme of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the Zuinglian was obtruded upon all: ſo as even in a moment an exceeding great alteration happened, as it were without any motion: for the Preachers of the Country changed their opinions with the Prince, in a trice. Eleventhly, in the Huſſian change, I obſerved this alſo, that when the Lutherans, as well Profeſſors in the Vniverſity, as Country Preachers, refuſed to yeeld up their Offices and Dignities, the Prince told them hee wondred at them, ſeeing he had never taken them into his protection, nor given them any new poſſeſſion of their places: for there, the Prince dying, all places and Offices become void, and the power of beſtowing them anew, is in the ſurviver, Twelfely, in <hi>Haſſia</hi> they went on very ſlowly, and by little and little. Nor was all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſme offered them at once; but only a ſmall pittance thereof: as namely, the reviving of the precepts of the Decalogue, and the breaking of the bread at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Therefore, although at the beginning thoſe of <hi>Marpurg</hi> zealouſly flockt to the Lutheran Preachers (who, as they had heard, were to leave them) that they might receive the Supper: nevertheleſſe afterwards they ſtirred nothing, but by degrees fell off to Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. And the people much more willingly come on, if at the ſame time they be whiſtled another way: as, to Arminianiſme, <note n="*" place="margin">This ſhort touch is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who ſet the Arminians on work, who foment the quarrell, and whether they tend: not that they hope thereby to fetch over the Miniſters, but onely to breed a diſtraction among the people, who will hereby be more eaſily moulded to their deſignes upon them.</note> or ſome other Sect that may ſeeme more odious. Thirteenthly, both ſides fell to writing: but that party which was moſt favoured at Court, quickly prevailed. Alſo the wickedneſſe of the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans in their converſation being upon all occaſions made knowne did much advance the cauſe of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Wherefore they exautorated ſome of them with great diſgrace, even under the Gallowes it ſelfe.</p>

But let the rigor of the lawes be ſlowly drawne out, unleſſe where there is danger of contagion. Let ſuch as be moſt dangerous bee taken away; the reſt, the authority of the Prince will ſoone lead home. For, of theſe, ſhame hold back many; feare, many: but vaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that no better way can be ſhewed them, prevailes with moſt to ſtave them off from the truth.

Princes that have aſſayed to draw his Subjects on to unity with the Catholiques, hath ever met with any power reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his decrees in that behalfe made and executed. Onely the Netherlanders broke out into rebellion. But the cauſe thereof was not Religion alone: nor was that pretended. Their Priviledges and liberty was made the cloake. The Dominion of a forraigne Nation over them, (a thing ever abhorred of ingenious men) and the exaction of tenths ſtirred up that people to that ſedition. <note n="*" place="margin">Marke this paſſage from the pen of a Ieſuite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note>

               <p>The received opinion of Politicians otherwiſe minded, namely, <hi>That men are not to be compelled,</hi> yet remaineth. The ground of their opinion is this; becauſe by that meanes men will ſtill continue as impious in heart as before, adde hypocriſy to their former impiety, and ſpread their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe the further abroad. So may you make them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the purple robe, indeed: but never of God. But theſe men are farre from the marke, and give counſell againſt, not the ſafety of Religion alone, but even the peace of the Common wealth. For firſt, by a wholſome Law they are over-ruled that they ſhall not doe evill, not ſacrifice to the Divell, not ſpoile Churches, not contemne holy things, not entitle God to their leud practiſes, not oppugne the truth. And albeit they obey againſt their wills, yet ſafer is it that men, ſo compelled, ſhould offend onely in heart: then breake out into villanies, in deed as well as in will, by being permitted to do as they liſt, without coactive reſtraint. It would be in this, as in other caſes, wherein the ſecular lawes deterreth many (who in heart and conſent of wil are guilty,) from attempting their purpoſes and enjoying their lewdneſſe projected.</p>
               <p>Nor doth a law only take men off from evill; but, brings them, uſually, within the Schoole and Chappell of vertue. For it enjoynes things honeſt and pious, and prohibites the contrary. It commands, I ſay, things pious; and to doe them in a pious manner, not fained manner. If any man ſhall play the counterfeit, let him impute that hypocriſie to his owne wicked heart; not to the law. Contumacious offenders are compelled by law to honor the Magiſtrate;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44763:11"/>
and rightly is it ſo ordained. Nor is the law therefore not to command things honeſt, becauſe an Hypocrite mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es them in the doing; but to admoniſh them to performe willingly what their duty calls upon them to doe. And for the moſt part, when they are brought on leaſurely by power, they ſet about good things in a good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and apply their minds to vertue, as well as their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when they ſee that they muſt needes lay their hands to the worke. If it ſo fall out that the obſtinacy of ſome particulars ſhall at firſt, make reſiſtance: yet even thoſe men, by time will be wrought more pliable. As for thoſe who being of tender yeeres, are either not at all, or but newly tainted with evill, a good Law will ſoone cauſe that their riper age ſhall yeeld a ſweet ſavour of goodneſſe. Verily, I have knowne many Children Authors of their Parents converſion, who alſo when they are growne up, and changing the cloake for the gowne, have undertaken either a tribe, or a place of judgement, approve themſelves excellent ſervants to the Common-wealth. This we finde many thouſands in <hi>Germany,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Bavaria, Stiria, Carinthia,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to make good before our eyes. If therefore compulſory reformation ſhould doe no good upon old ſtandards in error, yet it renders the younger ſort a Catholique Fry.</p>

of the Poſt, draw them before Tribunalls as if other mens fault were reaſon ſufficient why they ſhould not finally ſhake hands with their hereſies: who can doubt, but that the wicked prankes of Prieſts made publique, cannot be tolerated without infinite damage to Religion? The filthy life of Clerkes, of Clerkes; I ſay it againe, of Clerkes; I meane evill ones, made, augmented, and ſtill doth uphold the hereſies that are. I have often entred diſputation with Hereticks, or their diſciples: and, after that with a very little labour their Arguments have bin anſwered and retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon themſelves, they betake themſelves to accuſations of our Clergy, and object ſuch things as can neither be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor defended. What therefore ſhall a Common-wealth doe in this caſe? Firſt, let it labour earneſtly that ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prelates be choſen as are chaſt, liberall, ſober, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, faithfull diſpencers of Gods law, and ſuch as will doe their utmoſt for reformation of manners. Let the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves alſo bring all the power they can to the work, and ſo the cure wil not be difficult. Let a Regular who is either a drunkard, or a whoremonger; let a ſcandalous Pariſh-Prieſt, be oppoſed in his wickedneſſe: let another capable of the ſame place and dignity, be ſet up in his room: he that is convicted, let him be caſhiered, and his Biſhoprick let another man take. If the Prelates ſeeke to cloake and diſſemble their vices, and not reforme the ſinnes of their Clergy, let the Vicar of Chriſt grant full power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Kings and Princes to reforme the Clergy it ſelfe, as of late he hath done, to a certaine renowned Prince to the great benefit of his Country. But becauſe I have ſpoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this matter, to wit, the peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and that this place requires the ſame things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, I chooſe rather to transfer hither the things there ſpoken, then in other words, here, to ſay over the ſame things againe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I put downe the reſtitution of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Diſcipline where it is decaied, and the keeping it ſtill on foote where it is in vigor, as the moſt neceſſary thing, without which, peace can neither be at all procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44763:12"/>
nor continue long, if it were recovered. The almoſt onely cauſe of all hereſies and perſecutions both ancient and moderne, hath been, the diſſolutneſſe of the Chriſtian Clergy and people. An old ſoare in the Church, and ſtill ſo much breaking out afreſh, that in the whole world it could never yet be any where found to wax ſo decrepit as to die away, nor will ever be perfectly cured. <hi>Our Lord</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian, would that his family ſhould be tried,</hi> when he ſuffered perſecution to breake in upon it. (he ſpeakes of that, which was under <hi>Decius,</hi> when a peace of 38. yeers in <hi>Africa</hi> had gone before.) <hi>And becauſe a long peace had corrupted that diſcipline which was given us of God, a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from heaven rouzed againe that faith which had growne ſluggiſh, and, I had almoſt ſaid, which ſlept the ſleep of death. And yet whereas we by our ſinnes deſerved to ſuffer far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evills, the moſt mercifull Lord ſo moderated all, that all that was done againſt us ſeemed but a triall, rather then a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. Now every man turned his ſtudies only to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of his poſſeſſions; and men, forgetting their faith, their former zeale and good works which in the Apoſtles times ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently ſhined, and what conſtantly they ſhould have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, with unſatiable covetouſnes gave themſelves wholy up to the enlarging of wordly pelfe. In the Prieſts there was no devout relion; in inferiours, no ſound faith; in mens actions no mercy; in their manners no diſcipline. In men might be ſeene a diſguiſed beard; in women, a painted beauty: The eies, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from what Gods hand had made them; the haire, coloured into a lying hue. To deceive the ſimple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cunning frauds abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and treacherous hearts, to circumvent their brethren. They joyning in marriage with Infidels, and proſtituted the members of Chriſt to Pagans. They took liberty not only to ſweare raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but, which is yet more, to breake out into perjury: with proud ſwellings of heart, to contemne thoſe that were ſet over them; with venomed mouthes, to ſpeake evill of them; and with endleſſe hatreds, to rend themſelves in peeces one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Many of the Biſhops whom it would have well became to reclaime others by earneſt exhortation, and example, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the adminiſtration of holy things, tooke upon them the</hi>

The cauſes of our calamities have been yet more grievous: to wit, a greater decay of diſcipline, a mightier domineering of ſinnes, which at length brake out into hereſie, and rebellion. Nor is it to be wondred at: for, without care to keep diſcipline on foote, not onely not the peace of religion, but even religion it ſelfe cannot be held faſt. <hi>Diſcipline is the guardian of hope, the ſtay of faith, the leader of the way to life, the nouriſher and feeder of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly diſpoſition, the miſtreſſe of vertue; it cauſeth a man to abide in Chriſt, to live unto God, and brings to the poſſeſſion of all celeſtiall promiſes and rewards.</hi> Cyp. <hi>De Diſcrip. &amp; hab. virg.</hi> Nothing in theſe daies keeps back the moſt from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the ancient religion more then the wicked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuch as are already in it. For the common people eſteeme of Doctrine by the converſation of ſuch as profeſſe it, nor can they be brought to beleeve it poſſible to learne the doctrine of liberality, chaſtity, modeſty, from them whom they perceive to be ſlaves to their riches, burning in luſts, and even burſting with pride. Doeſt thou wonder why ſtraying ſcules be not brought home? Doeſt thou mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile why thou laboureſt therein without ſucceſſe? It is thy manner of living that makes them to doubt. Thy faith (if thou have any) is mewed up in thy breaſt: but thy ſinnes are laid open to the view of all, and theſe prevaile more to draw them into hatred of religion; then thy uncertaine faith, to bring them into love with it. Thou promiſeſt the food of Gods Word to ſuch as are hungry, but reacheſt it out unto them with an uncleane and feſtred hand: and ſo thou cauſeſt them to grow jealous: and enemies, to blaſpheme Gods name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thy ſinne, certainly, is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

They are turned away from that God whoſe Miniſters they diſcerne to be deſiled with ſo many abominations. By nothing in the world doe Hereſies increaſe more, then by the lewd practiſes of the Clergy, and the ſinnes of the Laity, who do ſo infect their children with their owne vices, that they know not how to turne their hands to any thing that is good. This, very Heretiks themſelves may confirme; who, being convinced by Scriptures and reaſons, betake themſelves to accuſations of the Court of Rome, and of the whole Eccleſiaſticall State.

O Good God! <hi>If it be beter for him that offendeth but one of theſe little ones which beleeve in thee, that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, and that he were drowned in the bottome of the ſea:</hi> What mountaines or ſtones may be ſufficient to hang about the necks of ſo many, for the drowning of them, who ſo often ſcandalize not a few little ones alone, but even the whole world; great, and ſmall: little ones that doe beleeve in thee; great ones that they may caſt off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveing: and unbeleevers, that they might not beleeve at all. To all Chriſtians is that ſpoken; <hi>Be yee blameleſſe and harmeleſſe, the Sonnes of God, without rebuke in the</hi>

But to the Biſhops and Prelates it is ſaid: <hi>Be thou an example of the beleevers in word, in converſation, in charity, in faith, in purity.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. And, <hi>in all things ſhew thy ſelf a patterne of good workes, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity, ſound words that cannot be condemned.</hi> Tit. 2. And why ſo? he addes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>That he that is of the contrary part many be aſhamed, having no evill thing to ſay of you.</hi> The Apoſtles themſelves converted the world, not by the Word alone, but chiefly by their example. And by examples it is that it now falls backe againe unto infidelity: for while men put away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they make ſhipwrack of faith. Becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that they live wicked in the ſight of the people, they doe as much as in them lies, murder thoſe of whom they are obſerved to lead ſuch a life. Every one that lives ill in the preſence of them over whom he is ſet, doth what he can to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>What then? will you (may ſome ſay,) proclaime an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting warre againſt all thoſe parts of the Church where the diſcipline of it is caſt aſide? Either warre, or bondage, or utter deſtruction. If mens manners be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, abuſes taken away, ſcandalls removed, the warre will be very ſhort, and a ſolid peace ſhall give us entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if God ſhall be further provoked by our ſinnes, ſuch as erre ſhall be confirmed in their hereſie, thoſe that yet are but wavering and doubtfull ſhall be altogether turned away from the faith, and God will certainely drive out that licentiouſneſſe and laſciviouſneſſe (ere he leave us) as in many places he hath already done. If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prelates, through the wickedneſſe of ſome, be growne peereleſſe, the jealous God will lend the ſtronger Revenger upon them; whereby he may cut off both the wicked and his wickedneſſe together. So the Turkes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped <hi>Aſia, Egypt, Greece,</hi> while the inferior Clergy refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to obey the Biſhops, and while the Biſhops fell off from the chiefe Paſtor, and their manners exceeded the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44763:14"/>
wickedneſſe of the very Barbarians themſelves. And ſo we ſee it for the moſt part to come to paſſe, that when ſinnes have once attained to the height, all things ruine together: and then are they to be accounted to have come to the height, when they be committed by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique law, cuſtome, and approbation; or if they come to breake through all power and force of law, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Magiſtrate. Religion will periſh in <hi>Europe,</hi> unleſſe integrity of converſation become correſpondent to the purity of the Religion. What then may ſome one that both feareth and needeth a reformation, ſay unto me, doe you thinke needfull to be reformed?

And when I had demanded the reaſon, how they came ſo to fall off from Lutheraniſme in plaine field, the Zuinglian reformation ſtill gayning ground: they returned anſwer that now thoſe Youngſters did frolicke themſelves in the liberty of youth, not much ſetting by the threats of a raging Miniſter; but there would come a time wherein they ſhould finde themſelves under yoke. For when once they begin to aſpire the married eſtate, they muſt then give place to the Conſiſtorian violence, and, together with a wife, bee content to accept of a ſhameleſſe Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine; to wit, Calviniſme. So hard is the condition of thoſe that marry and are given in marriage among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, that ſtill a new infection and ſpreading peſtilence (in hope to beget a new brood of the ſame kind) muſt bee led into the marriage bed. How then can an Orthodox Prince excuſe himſelfe to God, if hee doe not plot a more effectuall meanes of ſaveing ſoules? and, by a publique law, command, that men together with the ſanctity of that Sacrament and individuall nuptiall knot, joyne alſo the truth of ſincere and undefiled religion: eſpecially conſi, dering that the marriage Covenant is contracted without blemiſh of ſinne, onely among thoſe of the Orthodox faith.</p>

For if any man liſt but to read thoſe ſcolding Bookes of the Lutherans againſt the Calviniſts; or of the Calviniſts againſt the others, he will verily perſwade himſelfe that thoſe be not the invectives of one man againſt another; but rather, the rages and bellowings of Devils againſt Devils. From theſe practiſes, juſt occaſion of alteration, as alſo of enquiring into the original of ſo great diſorders, wil be offered to the Prince: that ſo, if he finde the acculations true, he may chaſtiſe the guilty; if falſe, the accuſers. For the truth of errors will ſhew it ſelfe in the publique.</p>
