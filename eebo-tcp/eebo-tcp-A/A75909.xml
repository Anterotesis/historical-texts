            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT, Concerning the Right Way and Manner of practiſing the <hi>new Art</hi> of Improving of BEES in the Form of BEE-HOUSE, BOX, and COLONY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas Mr. <hi>John Gedde</hi> hath invented a new way of ordering and Improving of Bees by a Form of <hi>Bee-houſe</hi> and <hi>Boxes</hi> digeſted into <hi>Colonies,</hi> (deſcribed in a book intituled <hi>A New diſcovery of an excellent Method of Bee-houſes</hi> and <hi>Colonies, &amp;c.</hi> lately print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) which doth infallibly prevent both the <hi>Swarming</hi> of Bees (or their ſeparating and flying away in Companies from their native Hives) and likewiſe their <hi>deſtruction</hi> by <hi>ſtifling</hi> and <hi>drowning</hi> or violent driving at the time of taking their honey, or by Cold, Cattel, Vermine and other Caſualties; as alſo the Charge and trouble of attendance, loſs of time, and the other Inconveniencies of the old Forms; which Method is Approved by the Kings Majeſty, practiſed by ſeveral perſons of Quality and many others of all ranks, and divers years experiene'd by himſelf to be far more Commodious and profitable than any former way whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And whereas His Majeſty being willing that all his good Subjects ſhould have the benefit thereof, hath granted his <hi>Letters Patent</hi> to the ſaid Mr. <hi>John Gedde,</hi> in order to the diſcovering and diffuſing the ſaid Art throughout his Dominions, ſtrictly forbidding all perſons under the Penalties appointed by Law, the uſe of the ſaid Invention during the ſpace of Fourteen years, without the ſpecial Licence of him the ſaid Mr. <hi>John Gedde</hi> under Hand and Seal firſt had and obtain'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe therefore are to inform all ſuch as are deſirous to enjoy the benefit of the aforeſaid Art for Improvement of Bees, in the right way and manner of practiſing the ſame.</p>
            <p>YOur Bee-houſe being built of Timber, Brick or Stone, and ſcituate in a convenient place, is next to be furniſhed with Colonies of Boxes made of proper materials, and thoſe Boxes with Bees, according as is directed in the aforeſaid Book.</p>
            <p>In Addition whereunto take theſe Following Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It's neceſſary that ſuch as are not furniſh'd with Bees already do provide themſelves ſtocks of good old Hives of ſtrong Bees, always betwixt <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and <hi>Candlemas,</hi> that being the moſt proper ſeaſon for tranſporting of Bees.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Your Bees being once ſetled in the place where you intend them, muſt be tranſplanted from the old form of Straw. Skeps into their new Colonies of Boxes at or before the beginning of <hi>March</hi> as the ſeaſon ſhall favour, that ſo they may both begin their labour with the early Spring, and their Owners may at the end of ſix or ſeven months of the ſame year both reap the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and make proof of the Contrivance. Therefore whereas in the printed book (page 16) <hi>the beginning of Summer</hi> is recommended as the fitteſt ſeaſon for tranſplanting Bees, you are to take notice that that relates only to the time of <hi>Swarming:</hi> Where you are deſired far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obſerve, that Swarms of Bees may be hived in your Boxes after the ſame manner that you uſe to hive them in your Straw Skeps, they being fitted and clapp't upon them; yea Shaking them off from the bough of a Tree into your Boxes, may prove a very ſucceſsful way of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, provided they be good early Swarms.</p>
            <p>The manner of <hi>tranſplaming</hi> your Bees out of the Straw Skeps into the Boxes, is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> Take one of your Boxes dreſs'd after the ſame manner as you uſe to dreſs your old Skeps when a Swarm is to be put into them: Then having open'd the ſquare-hole in the top of your Box, and your Colonies placed at an equal diſtance from each other in the houſe; take your ſtrongeſt and beſt furniſh'd Straw hive and place it upon the top of the aforeſaid Box with its front to the front of the Box, and Plaſter it round, ſo as to ſtop all paſſages from the Bees Coming out any other way than through the little-holes in the lower part of the front of the Box. Let all windows of the Boxes and all doors of the Houſe be ſhut and kept cloſe, except at ſuch times as you have occaſion to look through them to obſerve what progreſs the Bees make in their work, or for pleaſure and delight; only the ſmall ledge at the bottom muſt alwayes be kept open ſave in Winter.</p>
            <p>When you perceive your firſt Box to be full of Work and Bees, take another Box prepared as the former, and liſting up the firſt Box with the Straw Skep ſtill on the top of it, place the ſecond under it, which when you obſerve to be filled as the former, you muſt in like manner ſupply a third, except it be very late in the year; which <hi>continual ſupply of Boxes</hi> as often as occaſion requires, and <hi>conſtant Cricle and ſucceſſion of work</hi> therein, is an infallible Expedient (which many have attempted but none ever heretofore attain'd) for preventing the <hi>Swarming</hi> of Bees, which are known never to Swarm ſave for want of room and fitting accommodation for themſelves and their work. But if any be ſo deſirous that their Bees ſwarm out of the Boxes in order to the planting of new Colonies, this you may eaſily effect by forbearing to ſupply them with an additional Box when needful; ſo you may be at once furniſhed both with a ſtock for a new plantation, and with a convincing proof that want of room is the only reaſon why Bees ſwarm. Where it is not once to be queſtioned but that the Bees will deſcend and continue their work out of the Straw Skep, down into the Box upon which it's plac'd, and out of that into the next under it, and ſo on in purſuit of their labour; it being <hi>natural</hi> for Bees ever to begin their work at the top and upper end of the place where they dwell, and from thence to work downward.</p>
            <p>The manner of <hi>taking your Honey</hi> according to this new way is briefly thus—<hi>viz.</hi> Regard muſt be had to the ſeaſon, and to the richneſs of the ſtore, and ſtrength of the Bees, that is, If there be two Boxes full of Wax and Honey before <hi>Auguſt,</hi> you may remove the Straw Skep when you pleaſe, wherein will be no Bees but Wax and Honey, and there will be no more uſe for any Straw Skeps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> which is the uſual time for taking of Honey, if the third Box be plac'd before and the Bees in it, and any work with them, you may take off the upper Box which will be alſo full of Wax and Honey, and after a right Judgment made of the ſtate of your Bees, you may take half or whole of the Honey and Wax therein according to diſcretion; this for the firſt year, and ſo yearly as the ſeaſons prove good or bad.</p>
            <p>The way of <hi>removing the Boxes</hi> when full of Honey, is this—<hi>viz.</hi> To open the little door in the ſide of that Box which is ſtill uppermoſt and with the ſhutter at once to cut the work, (perfectly dividing betwixt the Bees and upperwork,) and cloſe the ſquare hole of the ſame, thereby ſecuring the Bees and their Work in the lower Boxes; ſo that by this dextrous and Commodious way of removing the Honey the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the Bees by ſtifting, drowning, violent driving or otherwiſe (the uſual but unkind requital of their Induſtry) and one great reaſon of the ſcarcity of Honey and Wax and the adulteration of both) is prevented; and ſufficient Winter ſtore reſerved for the Bees according to the ſame, Judgment being made thereof by inſpection through the Glaſs Windows.</p>
            <p>All which Conſidered, it may be very eaſily Computed what great Gain, Profit and Advantage may redound to the publick, from this new Form and Method of Apifactory, beyond any other whatſoever, through <hi>excelency of the Honey and Wax,</hi> being freed from ſmoak and water, its great <hi>encreaſe and quantity,</hi> and <hi>expedition in point of time,</hi> two entire Months at leaſt and that in the Chief ſeaſon of the year, being gained by this new way which was wholly loſt by the other through the great confuſion and unſetlement of Bees before in and after Swarming.</p>
            <p>All that are deſirous to reap the benefit of this <hi>new way of Improvment of Bees;</hi> Are to take notice, That theſe Eight Counties of <hi>England, Cheſhire, Herefordſhire, Gloſterſhire, Wiltſhire, Somerſetſhire, Dorſetſhire Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> withal the Cities and Towns Corporate within the ſaid Counties, and together with the whole Dominion of <hi>Wales;</hi> Are lett in Leaſe unto <hi>Richard March, Perriwig-maker</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Richard March</hi> and thoſe Impovered by him, has the only liberty to grant and diſperſe the ſaid Licences within thoſe Counties above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, under the ſaid <hi>Richard March</hi>'s Hand and Seal as if the ſaid <hi>John Gedde</hi> did grant the ſame himſelf.</p>
