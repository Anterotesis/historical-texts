            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If we be not ſafe conducted to heauen by the predeſtinate on of God in Jeſus Chriſt, if followeth that we are carryed thether by ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of our owne, or elſe that wee neuer come there at all, it were a ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſhould hale them from this opinion, and yet is Chriſt heereby made altogether Jacke out of office. Let vs not wonder at theſe men, ſo much as pray for them: let vs not quarrel ſo much with them, as perſwade with them, nor laugh ſo muck at theyr folly &amp; wickednes as lament theyr ignorance: for this is true, if they be right, we be wrong, if we
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17086:66"/>
be wrong, we are already ſold vnder ſin: contrary wiſe if we be right (whereof let vs not doubt, becauſe the ſpirit of truth hath ſealed vs vppe in the Prophets and Apoſtles) then are they wrong: if they be wrong, there is nothing more certayne then theyr iuſt damnation, vnleſſe they turne to God with hearty repentance (which God for his ſon ſake euen ſpéedily grant them) if it be his will.</p>
            <p>And although they are not aſhamed to denounce againſt vs, that we are Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines and deſpiſers of good works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we preferre our fayth in free iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: be it as farre from vs to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at thoſe falſe ſuggeſtions, as we are frée of that fault, we know &amp; confeſſe, that Gods deareſt children, haue ſmal féeling of God without righteous doing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee profeſſe that if wee ſée no good workes in our hands, if we perceiue not that the preaching of the Goſpell hath mortified in our concupiſcence, and made vs to hunger &amp; thirſt after righteouſnes, we haue ſmal teſtimony of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may talk til we are weary of our hope and faith in Chriſt, we may prattle till we ar hoarſe of the Goſpell and our

profeſſion, and we may deſie the Pope and his accomplices to the bottome of hell. But except our ſelues loue the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, and we exerciſe the ſame, Satan doth féed vs forth, with the ſtrength of illuſion: for Godlineſſe is not made of talke as bookes are of leaues nor as woods are of trées, but it is ſuch a holineſſe as doth clime, from vice to vertue, and from one vertue to another without ceaſing.</p>
            <p>Good ſir, this being true, we haue néed to looke about vs, and euery man haue an eſpeciall eye to Gods glory in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our actions: and if we haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome knowledge in the ſchoole of Chriſt; we ſée in the Goſpell, that he is condemned, that hideth his talent, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel as the other, that riotouſly waſted it, I pray you apply this to your ſelfe whom the Lord hath loued with long continew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of his goodneſſe, and you ſhall find out a right Chriſtian exploit euen in the man, that ſat next at your elbow. Set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, or if you haue begon giue it not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, for the winning of one ſoule to Chriſt is more acceptable in the ſight of GOD, then to offer the whole world for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;

what though he be a man, the ſpirit of GOD is able to encounter him, if hee bee neuer ſo wyly or peruerſe in opinion. God who is able to rend the heart, and to pierce the marrow in the bones, is alwayes preſont in his owne worke.</p>
            <p>What though hee happily may commaund your ſilence, your ſpirit muſt bee touched with his ſinnes, you may not ſuffer him to reſt in vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for they that are of CHRIST are alwayes carefull to bring others to Chriſt-ward, but eſpecially thoſe that are ſo neare vnto them, as hee is to you, you know that in proceſſe of time, the ſoft drop of raine doth break the hard flint, the ſilly worme doth throw downe the mighty oake, and the ſlow ſnayle doth attayne to the top of Mountaines. Therefore let nothing diſcon age you.</p>
