            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A preface to the
booke here folowing.</head>
            <p>THere came to my hands of late a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
litle boke, bearing the title: An
instruction hovv to be bold vpon gods
promise, &amp;c. VVhich boke being tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
aboue xxx. yeeres since, for a deere father of
mine, one Richard Melton (to recompence hym
with some fruite of my studyes, for the charge
which he more like a naturall, then a stepfather
bestovved vpon me in setting mee to schoole) and
being broughte to mee by the Printer, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to take a litle paines in perusing the same.
VVhereunto, to satisfie the request both of hym,
and certaine others, which semed desierous of the
booke, I vvas contented to graunt. And so much
the more, both for the authors sake, being a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vvriter of Luthers yeeres and standing, and
especially for the argument of the booke, whiche
in these our dayes I see greatly expedient &amp; much
needefull, for comfort of the simple ignorant.
For vvhat doctrine can be more excellent, then
of saluation? vvhat more sure, then the promise
of God? vvhat more certaine then the veritie
thereof? vvhat more comfortable, then to stand
firme and ascerteined of the same? or vvhat more
needefull, then the same doctrine to be taughte a
broad? And that so much more nedefull, by how
much vvee see the aduersaries of this doctrine in
these our dayes to growe, both strong and many,
but none more strong, then mans owne naturall
sence and iudgemente, vvhich f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lowing nothing
<pb facs="tcp:6408:4"/>
but his ovvne originall capacitie. vvithout the
vvorde of the gospell, can comprehend litle or no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing,
of thys mysterie.</p>
            <p>From the vvhich our naturally ingrafted blindnes
little differeth the scholediuinitie of the papistes,
who albeit they do seeme outvvardly to hold the
nam of christ: yet the promises made to vs in christ,
they hold not: the freedome of his grace they see
not, but make doubts vvher none is, teaching also
that no man ought to be sure of his saluation, but
to stand in feare and doubt. And no great maruel
if they so teach,<note place="margin">Difference between the Papist and the Protestant.</note> for if iustification as they say doe
stand by workes vvith faith, and not by faith with
out vvorkes: by merites: and not by promise fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by our selues partly, and not by Christe onely,
how can any certainty c be holden vvithout feare
or doubting? And yet neither is feare altogether
excluded from this certainty, vvhych we hold, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vvorkes also from fayth. The feare of God
I meane,<note place="margin">How feare &amp; confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce stand togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a true christian.</note> vvhich is and ought to be in euery good
childe of God. And yet not vvithstanding his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce
standeth fast and sure. As a sonne and
heyre feareth and reuerenceth his father, and yet
doubteth not of his heritage: So God is alwayes
to be feared, but his couenant neuer to be mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
Neither doe they rightly consider the causes
of our saluation, whiche teache this docttrine of
feare and doubting.</p>
            <p>Touching the explication vvhereof, thre cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are especially to be noted.<note place="margin">Three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> declared</note> VVhereof the one
resteth in the promise of God, the other in the
bloud of Christ. The third in the fayth of man. All
vvhiche three, bee causes together concurrent for
our saluation. For both gods promise saueth, and
<pb facs="tcp:6408:4"/>
Christes passion saueth: Also faith saueth, but in
sundry and diuers respectes, by promise and grace
vve ar saued, as being the cause purposing, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.
By Christ, as cause material &amp; meritorious.
By faith as cause instrumental or conditional. Of
these three, the promise, (the thinges promised I
meane) is to come. The death of Christ, vvherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the promise standeth, is past. Faith which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the person of him that dyed,<note place="margin">Assurance of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hovv it resteth.</note> endureth.
And hereupon resteth the true assurance of salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
in the hearts of all the faithful, for as it is true
that the suffering of Christ is past: So no lesse true
it is, the thinges promised vpon his suffering, are
to come.</p>
            <p>And for so much,<note place="margin">Hovve faith bringeth in hope.</note> as all these promises of God
are in Christ, and made to them that beleeue in
him: therefore fayth in Christ, to vvhich fayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
the promise is made, may boldlye call hope
vnto her, and so most certainly assure himselfe of
vndoubted saluation. And here riseth vp the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peracion
of fayth, and of hope, with difference
betvveene them both. VVhich tvvo albeit moste
ioyntly knitte together, yet they differ<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene faith and hope discussed.</note> some what
in the obiecte. For as hope<note place="margin">The obiecte of faith and of hope con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sidered.</note> properly respecteth the
promise of God, and respecteth things to come:
euen so faythe properly looketh to the person of
the sonne of God, and in him taketh present iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
Thus then the obiecte of hope is the
vvorde of promise. The obiecte of fayth is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
the person of the Sauior. And though it
may be sayde truely, speaking in righte terms,
that wee beleeue the promise of god to bee true:
yet it is not so truly said, that vve beleue in the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mise,
but hope in the promise of almighty god.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6408:5"/>Faith then,<note place="margin">The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith and hope.</note> touching his obiect, runneth to the
person of the sonne, in whom the promise is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Hope holdeth fast in the promise giuen in
Christ, vvhereby hope assureth, faith f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cause he hopeth vvell, therfore saued, but because
he beleeueth vvell, (that is in the sonne of God)
therefore is he saued. VVho so is freely saued by
bloude, as boldlye may hope of saluation by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and nothing doubte. Albeit notvvithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

vpon them to purchase the fauour
of God, the forgiuenesse of sinnes, and
the kingdome euerlasting, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary from our christian fayth.
For our christian fayth doth grounde vs
vpon a more substanciall stone, which is
Christ the true forgiuer of sinnes,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our faith.</note> and
our onely reconciler, which hath obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

consciences not to wauer nor doubt anye
thing of the grace of God. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of this fayth is to quiet our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The true catholike and liuely fayth
is this,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> when a man grounding vppon

            <p>This faith purifieth our hearts.<note place="margin">Acts. 15.</note> This
faith is alwayes working throughe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and hath the holy ghoste which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

vs in all honeste vertues, whereby
we bee not able to liue so vprightlye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gods commandements as we would
Wherefore when our sinfull conscience
<pb facs="tcp:6408:12"/>
or the feare of death doth come vpon vs,
we can not trust to our works, nor finde
any comfort therein, but (if we will bee
saued) we must needes cry with the holy
king Dauid. <hi>Enter not Lord into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with thy seruant, for in thy sight no
liuing flesh shall be iustified.</hi> Our good
workes thoughe they bee neuer so holye
and excellent, yet the value of them is
not such, neither oughte wee to doe them
for any such purpose, neither doth God
require them to be done of vs for that in
tent, that we should be iustified and saued
by them. For no man can trust anye
thing to his workes, neither be they able
to deliuer vs from our death. That thing
only the works of Iesus Christe is able
to doe and nothing els.</p>
            <p>This glory and honoure is onely dewe
to him and to no man else,<note place="margin">Our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation only belongeth to Iesus Christ.</note> to be a Iesus,
that is by interpretation, a <hi>Sauiour.</hi> For
hee onelye taketh away our sinnes iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
and saueth vs by his workes, &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
This is his office, his worke &amp; duty
onely, for the which hee was sent hither
of his Heauenlye Father and oures to
doe. Therefore if the holye workes and
commandements of God, can bring no
<pb facs="tcp:6408:12"/>
peace of conscience, then what shall a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
sinner doe in the distresse of hys
tentation? Whether shall he goe? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall he turne himselfe? Wher shall
he find helpe, and succour and comforte?
so then if we looke for any saluation, we
must firmelye beleeue and perswade our
consciences, that our sinnes be pardoned
vs, and cleane taken away.</p>
            <p>But now howe shall we be so certified
in our mindes. I answere, in such tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
a man must needes sette aparte the
lawe, and all his good deedes that euer
he hath done, all his strength, all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and merites, and let them all stande
a side in this case. For here nothing can
succoure vs, but onely the workes and

we must appeale from the law,<note place="margin">Appeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lavve to Christ.</note> streighte
to the riche and mercifull promise of our

            <q>My truth and my mercie shall euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore

Thou art my father my god, &amp; the rescue

And if his children transgresse my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes,

I shall visite &amp; chastice their iniquities

            <p>This promise is also read in the ii.

speaketh of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eternal kingdom of Christ
<pb facs="tcp:6408:14"/>
which perpetuall mercy, peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
is, for in Christe he hath reposed &amp;
layd vp his truth and mercy. Therefore
in no other thinge can this promise of
grace be found or obtained saue onely in
Christ. In him God hath promised to vs
saluation freely through his mighty mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye:
Therefore who soeuer beleeueth in

In Christ we haue the veritie of Goddes

in this temporall lyfe, call vs again

beleue this <hi>Dauid Christe</hi> to be our king,

            <p>And here is to be noted and considered

no consolation. But whosoeuer wil bring
men to God in deede, and will quiet their
consciences, muste alwayes teach these
two together, the lawe and the promyse,
as the prophets, Christ, and the Apostls
euer did.</p>
            <p>By the lawe they broughte men to the
knowledge of their sinfulnes,<note place="margin">The vse of the lawe.</note> their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines,
their infirmitie and vnability

themselues before God, whereby
they being iustly stroken with the feeling
of Gods right iudgement, might ernest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forethinke them of their sinnes, &amp; call
for mercye. They taughte not the lawe so
as though it were ynough to know, what
were to be done, or not to be done, or as
thoughe of our strengthe wee coulde doe
good and eschewe yll, and so by the lawe
and by our owne workes be founde iuste
before God, and put away sinne. They
taughte not the lawe I say, for no suche
end and purpose,<note place="margin">VVhy the lavv vvas giuen.</note> neyther was the lawe
geuen therfore that we should be iustified
thereby before God, but it was giuen
for this, to require of vs all righteousnes,
<pb facs="tcp:6408:17"/>
and to threaten vs, that by the requiring
of this righteousnes, &amp; we being nothing
able to performe it, we mighte the better
learne thereby our vnright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and confesse our owne wretchednesse, to
thintent y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> being thus contrite &amp; humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in heart we might seeke to Christe
for succoure the which by his works and
passion doth onely iustifie vs.</p>
            <p>We bee nothing able to deserue anye
saluation by the law or our works. That
is an higher and a more excellent thinge
then that our rotten workes bee able to
procure. God hath promised to giue vs
that freelye by his mercye for Christes
sake, and dooth giue it of grace to them
that beleeue in Christe, as S. Paul to the
Romaines<note place="margin">Rom. 6</note> doth call euerlasting lyfe the
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft of God. And likewyse to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians<note place="margin">Gala. 3.</note>
dooth put a cleare difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, and sheweth playnlye hys
minde of the law and of the promise how
they concurre to our iustification. Let vs
weigh well his words, for all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> weight &amp;
foundation of our iustification dooth lye
vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His wordes be these. If our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
stand of the lawe, then it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="tcp:6408:17"/>
not of promise. But God did geeue
it to Abraham.<note place="margin">Marke this vvell.</note> If the lawe had bene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto vs, which mighte haue iustified
<hi rend="margQuotes">vs, then our iustification might be of the
lawe. But the scripture hath wrapped al
thinges vnder sinne, that the promise
might come by the fayth of Iesus Christ
to all that beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">And agayne in the second to the Gal.<note place="margin">Gala. 2.</note>
If our iustification sayth he, coulde come</hi>
by the lawe, then Christ dyed in vayne.
Therefore I saye where as men thus by
the lawe were brought to the knowledge
of their sinnes, and so stroken with great
sorowe and heauinesse of conscience, for
their sinfull and vicious nature, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
the gospell put and set before them, that
is to saye grace promised in Christ.</p>
            <p>And than did they beginne to beleeue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
and to reioyse in their hearts truly
for this grace promised in Christe,
that God had geeuen them for Christes
sake, forgiuenes of their sinnes. Thus s.
Paule in the place afore recited, dooth
comfort with true consolation wretched
and desperate sinners, for he leadeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
only to the promise of GOD and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that into them, for thereby only
<pb facs="tcp:6408:18"/>
our consciences be cleane and quieted.
And doth teach the law &amp; Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
also, exhorting vs diligentlye to
the study of good workes, and is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
content with that, but also doth shewe
where and how to come by the corage &amp;
iust to doe these good works.</p>
            <p>Thus first they taught the lawe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
but streighte after they ioyned
with all the promise of God, to bring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the knowledge of the moste rich grace
of God giuen and promised vs in Christ,
teaching withall where wee shoulde get
the strength to fulfill the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
where our sinfull nature was not able to
fulfil it. In consideration whereof, the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>postles
euerye where declared and sette<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foorth
the exceeding and passing riches
and treasures of Gods mightye grace
which he hath giuen and promised vs in
Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> if we beleeue vpon him, and so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth did leade wretched sinners from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
lawe to Christ. This great grace of god,
so offered they receiue then and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
greatlye: and thus beleeuing were
pacified in their consciences.</p>
            <p>The law doth threaten and affraye, but
than shee is not able to heale or comforte
<pb facs="tcp:6408:18"/>
them being greeued, or to deliuer them
from their agonye, wherefore wee must
needes flee to the promise. And ther shall
we find righteousnes, peace, life, &amp; health
ynough. Here vpon S. Paule to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lathians<note place="margin">Gala. 3</note>
saith. The lawe was as it were
our schoolemayster vnto Christ,<note place="margin">The ende of the lavve.</note> that wee
should be iustified by Christ, for the lawe
doth force vs, doth straine vs, doth call
vpon vs, doth manace vs, and lyeth vpon
our necks, requiring of vs all manner of
good workes, perfecte iustice, perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie
of heart, perfecte feare and loue
of God, and also of our neighbour. But
we of our owne strengthe bee not able to
accomplish that which it requireth, and
thus it driueth vs to Christe, and is our
schoolemaister vnto Christ. He than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
vs comming to him, helping vs,
and giuing vs all suche thinges that the
lawe requireth of vs, so that the law shal
not be able to damme vs.</p>
            <p>For this cause S. Paule dooth call
Christ the ende of the lawe:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> Or as Saint
Augustine doth expound it, the fulfilling
of the lawe. He that hath Christ is iuste,
he that beleueth in Christ, hath al things
which the lawe requireth. Christe hath
<pb facs="tcp:6408:19"/>
reconciled for vs God his Father, hee is
our mediatour and euerlasting priest, hee
hath obteyned for vs grace, the holye
ghost wyth all his giftes, remission of
sinnes, and all manner of goodnesse, with
life euerlasting, he as Ieremye<note place="margin">Iere. 11.</note> writeth
doth giue vs a newe hearte, and a softe
heart, and the holy ghoste to moue vs to
doe well. And where as yet we be partly
fleshly, nor can not be al mortified in this
body, nor thorowly fulfill the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God, there is hee made oure
wysedome, our iustice and redemption, so
that his innocencie and all that euer
hee hath, is made ours by fayth, for after
that we put on Christ vppon vs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we beleeue in him, there is no ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
can hurt vs, thoughe we be neuer so
weake and frayle, so that we do not walk
purposely after our appetite of the fleshe
and runne still headlong in sinne, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
repentance, for oftymes it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that good and most godly men doe
fall as well as other,<note place="margin">Good men doe sinne.</note> but yet they lye not
still, but get vp againe, and be stil delited
with the lawe of God inwardly in theyr
heartes, euer calling for remission of
sinnes by Christe, and obteyne also the
<pb facs="tcp:6408:19"/>
same which we desire.</p>
            <p>All these things we may see very well
expressed in Abraham, for Abraham saith
Paule is the father of all the faithful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers
in Christe, therefore wee haue in
Abraham a clear figure, and an example
howe that a sinner may be iustified, and
what is the nature of a christian fayth,
what is the power, the propertye and
working of the same, and also howe that
our consciences may be quieted, whither
by faith or by workes. Therefore he that
is the true child of Abraham, that is a
good man in deeede, or that woulde bee a
true member of Christ, let him loke vpon
Abraham his father, and there he shal se
how God doth with vs, how he tendereth
vs, and how we oughte to doe againe for
him, as Paul also teacheth vs. Firste
of all Abraham hearde the greate and

saued, not by the workes of the lawe, but
by his faith in God &amp; in the blessed seede

            <p>Secondarilye the faithe of Abraham y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
he hadde vpon Christ, made him a newe

for he reioysed onely in the Lorde, and in

well that God is his father, which

nothing that God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull

hauing this faith, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp to the hill at the

and offered his sonne.<note place="margin">Iacob. 2</note> For true
faith can neuer be with out good works,<note place="margin">Gala. 2.</note>
but euer will be occupyed, in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God. In the meane season Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
heart and conscience was nothing
vnquieted for all that, but still quiet by
reason of his fayth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he had in Christe, for
he was euer sure of the fauour and loue
of God toward him.<note place="margin">Roma. 4.</note> Wherfore s. Paule
full well describeth his whole thoughte
<hi rend="margQuotes">and cogitation, where as he sayth that
Abraham did neuer shrinke in his fayth,
nor doubted in the promise of God, but
euer stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in his fayth, did giue glory to
God, knowing well this that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee whiche
promised him was able to performe it.
And therefore he sayth that it was impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
to him for righteousnes, that is for
his iustification, for this Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought
and perswaded himselfe, that God was
almighty and true of his promise, which
would not defeate nor deceiue his people</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6408:21"/>
And if he had so thought in himselfe (as
nowe our papists doe teache) I can not
tell surelye whither God loue mee or no,
peraduenture he is not freendly vnto me,
nor careth for me, nor regardeth me. &amp;c.
If Abraham I say, had thoughte on thys
maner, or had shrinked so in his faith, I
thinke hee would neuer haue intended to
offer vp his onely sonne, nor would haue
bene persuaded to goe from his Fathers
house out into a strange land, but rather
would haue thought thus: It is good to
be sure of that a man hath already, this
I haue and am sure of, the other is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
what should I kil my onely and wel
beloued son? who will giue me another?
What shall I goe out of mine owne
house into a strange land, I can not tell
howe farre? what folishnes were it? I
will not so, I will tary still her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wher I
am in my Fathers house, neither will I
be so cruell to my sonne for to slaye hym.</p>
            <p>Thus I say he had thoughte if hee had
not beleeued constantlye, but when hee
went out so boldly and mearily out of his
Fathers house, into a farre and a strange
countrey, and with so lustye cheere went
vppe to the hyll with his Sonne to offer
<pb facs="tcp:6408:21"/>
him vp to God, which no na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure of man
can doe, for what naturall man can finde
in his heart to offer vp his sonne. Than
be like he did onely hang of the hands of
God, onely did trust vppon God, vppon
his grace, vpon his helpe, nohing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his conscience, but that God was
able to performe all that hee had promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
for why no doubting heart can be so
willing to doe as Abraham did, nor yet
once thinke to doe it. So quiet was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams
conscience by faythe in Gods
promise, that Paule in his Epistle to the
Romaines,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> dooth giue him an excellent
prayse therefore, that we all should mark
<hi rend="margQuotes">it, and wel bear it away. Abraham, saith
he, neuer did shrinke in his faith, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
strong in his beleeuing trusted
surely. Why did he trust surely? because
God promised, for this he did knowe and
was fully perswaded that God was true
of his word and promise, what soeuer he</hi>
promiseth hee performeth of his grace,
and is well able to performe it, for hee
is almightye, nor dooth not promise for
our deseruinges, but of his grace one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
that nowe wee may be bold to trust
vnto it. For if he shoulde promise after
<pb facs="tcp:6408:22"/>
our deseruinges any thing, hee coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
performe it, for our merites be none,
and nothing worth. And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
hee dooth promise vs infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in Christ without our merites, onely
of his owne pure grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>And therefore writeth Paule y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> God
promised Abraham the blessing cccc.xxx.

because no man should think so, this

or that he could not enioye this free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and blessing of God, before he did
fulfill all the lawes of Moses. Wherfore
for the loue of God let al good men here
marke, that Abraham neuer fayled nor
did shrinke in fayth,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> nor euer doubted at
the promise of God, nor of the loue and
grace of God toward him. For so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy

               </gap>his well: Yf it were a firme
perswasion he had, then it was no opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or doubting, but fully did he trust and
beleue, &amp; he went not whether, increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
and doubting did bydde him to goe,
(which doubting papistes haue taughte
vs) neither thought be thus, be it true or
not true, I will doe it: but his conscience
<pb facs="tcp:6408:22"/>
was fullye perswaded that it was true
which God had promised, and that God
woulde be good and mercifull vnto him,
had forgeuen his sinnes, had iustified him
and would neuer forsake him nor abiecte
him, and after this life also woulde giue
him euerlasting life, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ede sake that
was promised him, which was Christe.</p>
            <p>If God hadde sayde thus to Abraham.
Heare Abraham: I wil be merciful vnto
thee, I will forgiue thee thy sinnes, and
alwayes be present with thee and helpe
thee, so on this condition, that thou keepe
and fulfill all my commandements, thus
I saye if God had geuen hym hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse
vnder thys condition of fulfillyng
his commaun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ementes, then Abrahams
conscience hadde neuer bene merye nor
quiet, but alwayes doubtting of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grace
of God and for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iuenes of his sinnes, nor
should euer haue bene certaine of his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>For thus hee mighte haue thoughte: I
haue done all that I can with al dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to fulfill Gods precepts, yet I coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
fulfill them so perfectly as I ought,
nothing like. Wherefore this promise of
God is vncertaine to mee, neither can I
<pb facs="tcp:6408:23"/>
test whither I shall take it or no, because
I haue not performed all was inioyned
and commaunded mee, and God did giue
me his promise no otherwise, but of this
condition if I kept his commandeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts
and I am not able so to do. Wherefore I
am not sure whether he wil giue me these
things y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hee promised. I can do nothing
on my parte, and therefore howe can hee
keepe his promise with me, wherefore
what hope can I haue nowe of health.
It is but lost labour all that I go about.</p>
            <p>Thus I saye if God had promised hys
blessing vnder this contition to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
then hee might well haue despeared
but nowe hee addid no suche condition,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise came vvithout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition.</note>
and all because wee should not doubt, but
that his promise remaineth alwayes sure
and stable. And this it is that god requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
onely of vs, that wee should neuer
doubt nor question of his free grace, but
to be bold and trust vpon it, that hee is a
louing father vnto vs, and that we be his
children.</p>
            <p>But wee could neuer be so bolde of thys
grace of God, if any such condition<note place="margin">Condition. excluded.</note> of ful
filling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe were giuen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al, as if thou
kepe my commandements wel, then shalt
<pb facs="tcp:6408:23"/>
thou haue thy sinnes forgiuen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> promise of thys
blessing stand w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out al conditions, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
all respect of workes or merites, but
onely in the free grace of God, or els we
could neuer be sure of it, nor certain, but
alwayes in doubt &amp; mistrust. For if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our sins should stand in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the lawe, then our fleshe being so
weake and fraile, and not able to fulfil the
lawe, howe shoulde wee be sure that god
is good to vs, or that wee were in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God, but rather shoulde thinke,
that he were angry with vs, because wee
neuer fulfil his commandementes, as we
should doe. And thus the free promise of
God shold stand voyd &amp; in no effect. For
why, no man were able to obtaine it.</p>
            <p>But thanks and prayse be to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lorde the father of our Lorde Iesus
Christ &amp; ours, the father of mercye &amp; the
god of all comforth, who hauing mercye
vppon vs and tendering our weakenes,
hath not bilded our health and saluation
vpon any such brickle &amp; weak foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our hope.</note>
as vpon our works and our fulfilling of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, for so we cold neuer be saued. But
the foundation y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be grounded vpon &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:6408:24"/>
preuaile against the gates of hell, is the
great grace and mercy of God in his son
Christ. For in him God hath promised
vs all, remission of our sinnes, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life. This promise is onely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
all our comforte, which boldlye wee
doe and may trust vpon.</p>
            <p>So thus you see howe God promiseth
vs remission of our sinnes and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
not vnder any condition of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Grace free vvithout condition.</note>
and fulfilling the lawe, but he giueth
it frely, of his fre grace I say, only &amp; alon
thorow Christ, and not for any workes of

without any condition of our workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the promise might stand firme and
stable, that is, that we may be sure of the
fauour of God, and of remission of oure

with Paule:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <q>This I knowe and is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted,
that neither death, nor life, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
angels, neither princes, nor pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
neither things present nor things
to come, neither height nor depenes, nor
no other creature is able to seperate vs
<pb facs="tcp:6408:24"/>
from the loue of God, which is in Iesus
Christ our Lord.</q> Here may we playnly
see that Paul had a bolde and a confident
trust of the forgiuenes of sinnes, and of
his health to come, plentuouslye perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the grace of God towarde him, or
els how could he so feruently reioyse and
tryumphe in spirite against all creatures
bothe in heauen and in the worlde, so
mightelye, defying them all, being right
sure and certaine, that nothing neyther
aboue nor beneath, coulde anoy him. And
why? because he beleued in Christe, and
was sure of the mercye of God towarde
him thorowe fayth, and therefore was
his conscience so quiet, and triumphant.</p>
            <p>And euen so may euery Christian man
likewise take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same courage &amp; the same
mind in himselfe.<note place="margin">Marke and learne.</note> Howbeit no man can
doe this vnlesse he put away all respecte
of his own merites and workes and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trust vnto the free mercy and grace of
God,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> which grace is giuen vs only tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
Christ and not through our selues.
Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding yet that good works of
ours consequently do folowe and springe
out of this faith, and promise of God. So
that where as the same doe not folowe,
<pb facs="tcp:6408:25"/>
and may folow, ther is no true nor liuely
fayth, but a deede, and barraine opinion
of fayth, but where this true and liuely
faithe is, there is workes and miracles
and thynges farre passing the possibility
of naturall working. For as saynt
Paule sayth, wee receiue the holy ghost,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note>
not by our working, but by hearing of
the Gospell, thys holye Ghoste, wyll not
suffer vs to doubte after the papists fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or as they woulde haue vs not to

And as Paule to the Ephesians sayth,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.</note>
they that beleeue in Christe bee sealed vp

of our inheritaunce and possession
which we haue got and be redemed vnto</p>
            <p>Therfore with al faith &amp; trust we must
euer looke vpon the promise of God, and
vppon Iesus Christ onely. And so in
thys promise of God our conscience may
<pb facs="tcp:6408:25"/>
finde comforte and peace plentye, but in
our workes we shall finde none. And
therefore marke well this text of Paule
and keepe it well in your remembraunce,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>
where hee sayth: <q>Abraham had thys

that he should be the heyre of the world,

for his beleeuing in fayth, for if they that
belonge to the lawe, bee the heyres,
then is fayth voyde and the promyse of

by reason that if there were no law,
ther were no traunsgression, therefore
the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is giuen by faythe as by
