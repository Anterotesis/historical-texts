            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Great deserved fame that followed this noble work of yours (the due recompense of all eminent performances) engaged me to peruse the same, with much eagernesse of minde, and yet with no lesse attention; I being one of those, that professe themselves much more willing to learn, then able to teach. And that you may see some <hi>specimen</hi> of the fruits of your labour and my
<pb facs="tcp:55764:3"/>
proficiency, I thought fit to present you with these few <hi>Observations.</hi> Which, considering the barrennesse of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> (as you Chymists love to call it) in which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, may bee termed rather many then few: And that imputed to the alone vertue, or Magicall Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Theomagicall fecundity of your Divine Writings, not at all to the sterility of my disfurnished Braine. Which now notwithstanding, having gathered both warmth and moisture from the heat and luxuriancy of your youthfull phansie, findes it selfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner transformed into your owne complexion, and translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same temper with your selfe. In so much that although I cannot with the height of a protestation in the presence of my glorious God (as your self has gallantly done (<hi>in pag. 50. lin. 17. of Anthropos. Theomag.</hi>) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the affection and Zeal to the truth of my Creatour has forced
<pb facs="tcp:55764:3"/>
mee to write, yet I dare professe in the word of an honest man, that nothing but an implacable enmity to immorality and foolery, has moved mee at this time to set pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And I confesse my indignation is kindled the more, having so long observed that this disease is grown even Epidemicall in our Nation. <hi>viz.</hi> to desire to bee filled with high-swoln words of vanity, rather then to feed on sober truth, and to heat and warm our selves rather by preposterous and fortuitous imaginations, then to move cautiously in the light of a purified minde and improved reason. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I being heightened with the same Zeale of discountenancing of vanity and conceitednesse, that your selfe is of promoting the truth, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to mee the same freedome in the prosecution thereof. For as wee are growne near akin in temper and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, so we ought mutually to allow each other in our actings alike, according
<pb facs="tcp:55764:4"/>
to our common temper and nature, and the accustomed liberty of the <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alethean</hi> Family. In confidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, till wee meet againe in the next page, I take leave and subscribe my selfe,</p>

            <head>Observations upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throposophia Theomagica, and Anima Magica Abscondita.</head>
            <p>AND now, brother <hi>Philalethes;</hi> that we are so well met, let us begin to act according to the freenesse of our tempers, and play the Tom Tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troths. And you indeed have done your part already. My course is next. Which must be spent, in the <hi>Observations</hi> I told you of, upon those profound Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of yours, <hi>Anthroposophia Theomagica,</hi> and <hi>Anima Magica Abscondita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And my first and generall Observation is this, That the genius of my brother <hi>Eugenies</hi> Magicall discourse is such, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi>-like, he seems to have a very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55764:5"/>
liquoursome desire to be thought to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, some great man in the World. And for the prosecution of this main end, he layes himself out chiefly in these three subordinate designes. First, to be thought to have found out some new concerning truths, hitherto undiscovered. Secondly, to be more learned and knowing then <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> that great light of these European parts for these many hundred years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and not only so, but to be so far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, that he may be his Master, that he may tew him, and lugge him, and lash him more cruelly, then any <hi>Orbilius</hi> or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Pedagogue, his puny scholars. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lastly, that he may strike home for the getting of a fame of profound learning indeed, he do's most affectedly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously raise in the Reader a strong surmise and suspicion that he is very deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen in Art Magick, and is a very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Disciple of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and puts in as far for the name of a Magician, as honesty will permit, and safety from that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome fellow, <hi>Hopkins</hi> the Witch-finder.</p>
            <p>And indeed the very clatter of the title of his Book, <hi>Anthroposophia Theomagica,</hi> sounds not much unlike some conjuration, or charm, that would either call up, or scare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55764:5"/>
away the Devill. And <hi>Zoroaster</hi> forsooth, at the bottome of the page, that old repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Magician, must stand as an Assistent to this preludiall Exorcism; with this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in his mouth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Audi ignis vocem.</hi> That is in plaine English, Hear the voice or noise of fire. Methinks I smell out a Gunpowder-plot. What can this voice of fire be? Why! how now <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throposophus!</hi> you intend certainly to make the Rosy Brotherhood merry with squibs and crackers. For certainly your Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousnesse does not mean those lesser or greater fire-squirts, Carbines or Cannons. So might the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> be received with like solemnity that those Apostles at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinals. But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (which implyes a subsultation, or skipping this way and that way) which is in the context of this Oracle, seemes to allude to, and prognosticate of fire-crackers and squibs rather then Cannons or Carbines. But how ever if this dog-trick fail, <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posophus</hi> has another as puerile and innocent a present, to entertain that Reverend Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. And that's a very queint and trim Latine Epistle, which he, like a good School-boy, to shew them what a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient he is grown in his Latine Grammar,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55764:6"/>
presents to their assembled Gravities. 'Tis a good child, <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> and 'tis well done. <hi>Qui necit obedire nescit imperare.</hi> He that knows not how to submit himself in the form of a breeching boy to the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> how can he know so unmercifully to whip and domineer over poor <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> when the Rosy brethren, ride swooping through the Air in their Theomagicall chariots, they will hail down sugar plums, and Carua's on thy blessed pate, if thou haft but the good hap at that time, to walk abroad with thy hat off, to cool thy heated nodle.</p>
            <p>But stay a while, I am afraid I am mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. It may well be, that <hi>Anthroposophus</hi> rides along with them, as being the Proloquu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of their Assembly. For he writes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>Oratoris vestri.</hi> How can that belong to a short Epistle, unlesse it were some title of office? But it may be my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being not so dextrous and quick in Latine as in English, measured the length o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it more by his labour then the lines, and thought that that which took him so much pains could not prove so little as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle; and therefore would insinuate that it was an Oration made to the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55764:6"/>
               <hi>I</hi> suppose at their meeting at Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> brasen head in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! be it what it will be, my observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, <hi>Anthroposophus,</hi> is, that you would also by your addresse to the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> make the world beleeve, that you are now mellowing apace, and are not much unripe for admission into that Society. And then <hi>Anthroposophus</hi> would be a rare Theomagici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an indeed. But enough of this vein of mirth and levity.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Philalethes!</hi> your brother Tel-troth, intends to fall more closely on your bones, and to discover whether you have not a greater minde to seem to be wise then to be so indeed, or to make others so. But yet you may assure your self, I will only find flaws not make any in you; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther candidly passe over what may receive any tolerably good interpretation, nor touch the soar any where, but where I may hope to heal it, either in your self or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And that this may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tedious taking a peeces of what you have put together, I shall fairly passe from page to page without any Analytical Artifice.</p>
            <p>And truly from the first page to middle of the fourth page of you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55764:7"/>
to the Reader, there be many pretty, smart, elegant, humorous contextures of phrases and things. But there, presently after Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> Fool and his fellow, you fall upon our Peripateticks as such superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Philosophasters, because they cannot lay open to you the very essence of the soul. Why! <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> can you tell the very essence of any substantiall thing? Hereby you show your self very raw and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in meditation, in that you have not yet taken notice what things are knowable, what not. And thus may you have as ill a trick put upon you, for want of this discerning, as the old dim and doting woman had, that with her rotten teeth endeavoured to crack a round pebble stone instead of a nut, which was a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. Nor will any mans understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be it as sharp as it will, enter the bare essence of any thing. But the nearest wee can get, is, to know the powers, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the respects and fitnesses that things have in themselves or toward others. Which is so true, that any man in a little search, will presently satisfie himself in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof.</p>
            <p>From the middle of this fourth page to the middle of the six, is continued a dance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55764:7"/>
of Anticks, or various ridiculous shiftings and postures of phansie, to make <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers contemptible. But such generall railings, as they are mis-beseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writer, so they teach the Reader nothing but that the Authour of them is a Mome, or a Mimick, and more like an Ape by far then him that he compares to one. If this man clap the wings so when hee has really got the foil (for hitherto hee has charged <hi>Aristotle</hi> with no particular piece of ignorance, but of what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be known) what would he doe if he had the victory?</p>
            <p>The second particular taxation (for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals I hold nothing, <hi>Dolosus ambulat in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversalibus</hi>) is that the Peripateticks fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy God to have made the World, as a Carpenter of stone and timber. But this is false: because they give an inward principle of motion to all naturall bodies, and there is one continuity of all, as much as of the parts of water among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But their grand fault is, that they doe not say the World is Animate. But is not yours far greater, <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> that gives so ridiculous unproportionable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Tenet? The whole World is an Animal, say you, whose flesh is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55764:8"/>

And beside this, how shall this water which you call bloud, be refreshed by the air that is warmer then it? And then those waters which you place in the outmost parts towards his dappeld or spotted skin the <hi>coelum stellatum,</hi> what over-proportionated plenty of them is there there? In so much that this creature you make a diseased Animall from its first birth, and ever labouring with an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarca.</hi> Lastly, how unproperly is the air said to be the outward refreshing spirit of this Animal, when it is ever in the very midst of it? And how rashly is the Flux and Reflux of the Sea assimilated to the pulse, when the pulse is from the heart not the brain, but the flux and reflux of the Sea from the Moon not the Sun, which

But see how slow this Snail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the herbs is, in finding out the truth; when he confesses it was the work of one whole Spring to find out, that the Earth or seeds of flowers are nothing like the flowers. There's not any old Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeder in all <hi>London,</hi> but without a pair of spectacles will discover that in four mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which he has beene a full fourth part of a year about. But certainely, he intends a great deal of pomp and ceremony, that will not take up such a conclusion as this, (<hi>viz.</hi> That things that are produced in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are out of something in Nature which is not like the things produced) but upon the full experience and meditation of one entire Spring. And now after this whole Springs meditation and experience, hee is

But presently blots his credit again with a new peece of folly, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hee will finde it it out by experience. Which is as good sense as if hee should say, hee would see it when his eyes are out. For it is alike easie to see visibles without eyes, as to see invisibles with eyes.

And that no man is to measure his wisdom by his devotion, but by his humility &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of mind and unprejudicate reason; nor that any man is wiser by making others seem more contemptibly foolish, as your juvenility has thought good to deal with poor <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and his Orthodox Disciples all this time. Nay, and that you may not take Sanctuary at <hi>Moses</hi> his Text, let mee also tell you, that before you prove any thing thence, you ought first to make good, that Scripture is intended for naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy as well as a divine life. But we need not arm our selves so well yet; for from the fourth page to the eight page nothing is said, but that God from a knowing Principle made the World. Which <hi>Aristotle</hi>

And this must help us coconceive, that upon the breaking through of the light, the divine idea's shone in the waters, and that the holy Spirit, not being able to see till then, by looking then upon those images, framed the matter into form. But I pray you tell mee, Mr. <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posophus!</hi> that would be so wise as if you stood by while God made the world, doe not you think that God can now see in the dark or behold his own idea's in the depth of the Earth?

Which is a very lank satisfaction to the noble rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of man. Nay, <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> I beleeve you have spoke such stuff that will amount to little better then a contradiction to free reason. For you make as if the Masse did contain in a far less compass above all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, all that was after extracted. Where fore there was, (for these are all bodies) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a penetration of dimensions then, or else a <hi>vacuum</hi> now: and the ascending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Masse, lye some distance one from another.

So these pretended inspired men though they flye high, and seem to feed of nothing but free truth, as they draw it from Gods own breathing, yet they took their ground first from the Text, though they ran a deal of phansyfull division upon it, and if a man watch them, he shall finde them fall flat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text again, and be but as other Mortalls are for all their free pretensions, and extraordinary assistences.

            <head>Observations upon his Advertisement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe first thing you require is, that hee that attempts your booke, should make a plain and positive Exposition of all the passages. Why man? that is more assuredly then your selfe can doe. For you are so weak and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine in many things that are intelligible that I am confident you are worse in tha: which you have made lesse intelligible. For as <hi>Socrates</hi> reading an obscure Authour, when he found all things he understood ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, did charitably conclude, what be understood not was much better: so I fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this obscure Treatise of yours, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things very ill, I also in charity will think you had the wit, to conceal those things which are the worst; or which will serve the turn, that you understand them not your self. But have an itching
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55764:24"/>
desire that some Reader skilfuller then your self, should tel you whether you have wrote seuse or nonsense. Like the Country clown, that desired his young Master to teach him to write, and being asked how he would be able to read his own writing, being as yet never acquainted somuch as with the christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crosse-row, made answer, he would get some body else to read it for him. And so you <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalethes!</hi> though you can read your own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet you desire to get some body else to understand it for you, or to interpret to you what you have writ.</p>
            <p>Your second Request is not much unlike the former, and too big a businesse for your selfe to doe, and therefore you beg it of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>Your third Request is, to have your book handled after your owne manner and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Which is as ridiculous, as if you should request your enemy to smite softly, or to strike after such a fashion, and at such a part as you will appoint him. Can it bee reasonable for you to expect from an <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telean</hi> (for you must think it would be they of all men that would fly about your ears first) when you have used their Master <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> as they would not, to be used of them as you would? But notwithstanding <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethes!</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55764:25"/>
you see I have been very fair with you, and though provoked I shall continue the same candour in my observations on your following peece. But before I passe, I must take notice of your two admonitions to the ingenuous Reader, for I suppose you mean mee, <hi>Philalethes!</hi> The first is, that I would not despise your endeavours, because of your years, for they are but few. Why man! who knew that but your selfe, if you could have kept your own counsell? Your name is not at your book, much lesse your age. But indeed many things are so well managed of you, that if you had not told us so, we might have shrewdly suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, you have scarce reached the years of discretion. But you are so mightily taken with your own performance, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease admiration, and for the bringing in a phrase or sentence out of <hi>Proclus,</hi> you could not with-hold from telling us that you are but a young man, and so we easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve it. But the more saucy boy you to be so bold with Reverend Mr. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> that grandevall Patriarch in points of Philosophy. For the second admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is little more then a noise or clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of words, or if you will, a meere rattle for a boy to play with. And so I leave it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55764:25"/>
in your hand to passe away the time, till I meet you againe in your <hi>Anima Magica Abscondita.</hi>

You tell us also of a radicall vitall liquor, that

is of like proportion and complexion with the superiour interstellar waters, which is as learnedly spoken, as if you should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the sack at the Globe-Tavern, with certain supernall Wine-bottles hung round <hi>Orions</hi> girdell.

Is not the nature of the Soul far better known from the proper operations thereof (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> has defined it) then from this phantasticall metaphoricall way? But if you will say that the soul is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Light or Air, then be they never so thin, or never so simple (unlesse you will again use a metaphor) the Soul must bee a Body. And how any corporeall sustance thick or thin, fluid or dry, can be able to think, to reason, to phancy, &amp;c. nay to form matter into such cunning and wise frames and contrivancies as are seen in the bodies of living Creatures, no man of lesse ignorance and confidence then your selfe will dare to endeavour to explain, or hold any way probable.</p>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55764:36"/>
Letanie? What profane boldnesse is this to distort that high Majesty of the holy Scripture to such poor and pitifull services, as to decide the controversies of the World and of Nature? As well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming it is, as to set pies and pasties into the oven with the sacred leaves of the bible? This is but a fetch of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Melancholy and Hypocriticall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, that under pretense of being more holy would prove more Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and leave the understanding of man free in nothing at all, but bring in a philosophy too, <hi>Jure Divino!</hi> And I can further demonstrate to you (beside what I have intimated from the transcendency of the Scripture and high scope and aim thereof) that the Scripture teacheth no secret or principle of Philosophy, of which there is any doubt amongst men in their wits. For either (as where it seems to speak <hi>ex prefesso</hi> of any such things) it do's it so obscurely that men rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own notions fetch'd from else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, upon the Scripture; or else if it speak more plainly and literally, yet it being allow'd by all sober men as well Jews as Christians, (as it is indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably evident from the passages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55764:36"/>
in Scripture) that it speakes so ordinarily according to the rude and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar use and apprehension of men, there can bee no deciding collections in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Philosophy safely gathered out of it. Though I will not deny but that some Philosophick truths may have an happy and usefull illustration and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from passages in Scripture. And their industry is not to be vilified that take any pains therein. But I doe not beleeve that any man that has drove the proper use of the Scripture home to the most full and most genuine effect of it in himself, but will be so wise and so discreet, that hee will bee ashamed in good earnest to allow any such Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick abuse of. But questionlesse the Scripture is the beginner, nourisher and emprover of that life and light which is better then all the Philosophy in the world. And he that stands in this light the firmer and fuller hee is possessed of it, he is the more able to judge both of Nature, Reason, and Scripture it self. But hee that will speak out of his own rash heat, must needs run the hazard of talking at randum, And this I make the bolder in charity to pronounce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55764:37"/>
I observe that the reverentiall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use, and religious mis-application of the holy Writ to matters of Philosophy, for which it was not intended, do's in many well-meaning men eat out the use of their reason, for the exercise whereof Philosophy was intended. And hence so much spurious and phantastick knowledge multiplies now adayes, to the prejudice of mans understanding, and to the intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him in vain and groundlesse imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, fortuitously sprung up from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumspect Melancholy, dazled and stoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the streamings and flashes of its own pertinacious phansie. Which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is so powerfull as to over-master the Melancholist into a credulity, that these flarings of false light in his dark Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are not from himself, but from a Divine Principle, <hi>the Holy Ghost.</hi> And then bidding a dieu to Reason, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got some Principle above it, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snres all truth meerly by the greatnesse and powerfulnesse of the Stroke of the Phantasme. What ever fills the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation fullest, must bee the truest. And thus a rabble of tumultuary and crasse representations must goe for so many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and every heaving up by an
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55764:37"/>
                     <hi>Hypochondricall</hi> flatulency must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited a rapture of the Spirit; they professing themselves to receive things immediately from God, when they are but the casuall figurations of their anxious phansie, busily fluttering about the Text; which they alwayes eye (though they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it) as Hauks and Buzzards, flye they never so high, have their sight bent upon on the Earth. And indeed if they should not forge their phansies into some tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable suteablenesse with the letter of the Scripture, they would never be able to beleeve themselves, or at least to beget beleef in others, that they are inspired. And so that high conceit insinuated into them by that wonderfull yet ordinary imposterous power of Melancholy would fall to nothing, and they appear not so much as to themselves either Prophets or inspired. But this I have touched upon elsewhere. I will let it goe. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let me cast in thus much: that he that mis-beleeves and layes aside clear and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reason in things that fall under the discussion of Reason, upon the pretence of hankering after some higher principle, (which a thousand to one proves but the infatuation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55764:38"/>
and a superstitious hallueina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is as ridiculous as if hee would not use his naturall eyes about their proper object till the presence of some supernaturall light, or till hee had got a pair of Spectacles made of the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline Heaven, or of the <hi>Coelum Empyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> to hang upon his Nose for him to look through. The truth is, hee that layes aside Reason, casts away one of the most Soveraign Remedies against all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick impostures. For I conceive it would bee very hard for men either to bee deluded themselves, or to delude o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their conceited inspirations, if they would expect that every Revelation should bee made good either by sound Reason, or a palpable and conspicuous Miracle. Which things if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the inspired people when they come to seduce, surely they would sneak away like the common Fidlers, being asked to play a Lesson on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, or on the Theorbo.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55764:47"/>
As for example; instead of due vigilancy you might learn from the fishes eyes never closing, to sleep and dream waking; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being as mute as a fish when you have nothing to say, to say nothing to the purpose, or to expresse your self as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligibly as if you had said nothing.

But what doe you mean by trusting? To give faith and credence to them as to Holy Writ? If so, I perceive you have also a Triplicity of Bibles, <hi>viz.</hi> the usuall one, <hi>Mich. Sendivow,</hi> and <hi>Physica Restituta.</hi> But we ordinary Mortalls hope to be as wise and as happy with our single one, as you with your advantage of three.</p>
                  <p>Lin. 13. <hi>With the Whymzies of Des-Cartes.</hi> This young man, has as little manners as wit, to speak thus reproachfully of the most admirable Philosophy, that ever yet appeared in these <hi>European</hi> parts since <hi>Noahs</hi> floud. Certainly, <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> you are set upon it to demonstrate your self a pure pitifull Novice in Knowledge, whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Ignorance makes so magisterially confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But for thy want of due sagacity, I will take thee by the Nose, O <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes!</hi> with this one Dilemma, which shall pinch thee as hard, as St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> did the roaring Fiend with a red-hot pair of tongs. Thus; Either thou hast read <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his naturall Philosophy, or thou hast not. If thou hast read it, thus to contemn it and term it a Whymzie, (whereas there was never any thing proposed to the World, in which there is more wary, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, and close contexture of reason, more coherent uniformity of all parts with themselves, or more happy conformity of the whole with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature) is to proclaim to all that understand <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carte's</hi> Philosophy, that thou hast a very broken, impatient, and unsteddy Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, or a very dull and slow wit, and such as cannot discern when it lighteth upon what is most exactly rationall, and when not. But what is most exactly rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, as his Philosophy indeed is to any competent Judge of Reason, is least of all whymzicall; but whymzies more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lodge in their brains that are loosly phansifull, not in theirs that are Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and severely wise. So that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55764:49"/>
returnes upon thine own addle pate, O inconsiderate <hi>Philalethes!</hi> But if thou didst never read his Philosophy, and yet pronouncest thus boldly of it; that is not only impudently uncivill, but extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and insufferably unjust.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lin. 8. <hi>Some Peripatetick perhaps whose</hi> Sic probo <hi>shall serve mee for a Comedie.</hi> So it seems if a man had seriously argued with you all this time, you would only have returned him laughter instead of a solid answer, and so from Tom Fool in the Play, you would have become a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Fool. But we have had the good hap to prevent you, and instead of <hi>Sic probo's</hi> to play the Fool for company, that is, to answer a fool according to his foolishnesse, that is, to rail and call names, and make ridiculous. Into which foolish postures as often as I have distorted my self, so often have I made my self a fool that you may become wise, and amend that in your self, that you cannot but dislike in me. Nor would I ever meddle

with you, as merry as I seem, but upon this and the like serious intentions. And must needs reckon it amongst the rest of your follies, that you expected that some severe <hi>Peripatetick</hi> would have laid bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery against you, with syllogisme upon syllogisme, and so all confuted your Book, that there had not been left one line en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. But assure your self <hi>Philalethes!</hi> the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> are not altogether given so much to scolding, that they will contest with a shadow, or fight with the winde. Nor so good marks-men as to levell at a Wilde goose flying. You are so fluttering and unsetled in your notions, and obscure in your terms, that unlesse you will bee more fixt, and sit fair, &amp; draw your Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks head out of the bush or thicket, they will not be able to hit your meaning. Which I suspect you will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to doe, that you may keep your self more secure from Gunshot.</p>
                  <p>Lin. 13. <hi>And the best way to convince fooles,</hi> &amp;c. How wise <hi>Anthroposophus</hi> is to what is evill! Here he makes sure of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him fool first who ever shall attempt to write any thing against his Book. But it is no such mischief, <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> to bee called fool. The worst jest is when a

man is so indeed. And if you had but the skill to winnow away all the chaffe of humorous words, and uncouth freaks and fetches of phansie, and affected phrases, which are neither the signes nor causes of any wisdom in a man, all that will be left of this learned discourse of yours; will prove such a small moity of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your presumptuous minde conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in her self, that you would then very sadly of your owne accord (which would bee your first step to become wise indeed) confesse your self a Fool. And this I understand of your knowledge in Nature. Now for that in Morality; It is true you often take upon you the gravity to give precepts of life, as espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the 52 and 55 pages of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate. But you doe it so conceitedly, with such chiming and clinching of words, Antithetall Librations, and Symphonicall rappings, that to sober men you cannot but seem rather like some idle boy play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a pair of Knick-knacks, to please his own ear and phansie, then a grave Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist speaking wholesome words and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving weighty counsell of life and manners. So that the best that you do, is but to make the most solemn things ridiculous, by your
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55764:50"/>
Apish handling of them. I suppose because a Religious Humour has been held on in some Treatises, with that skill and judgement, or at least good successe, that it has won the approbation and applause of most men, an eager desire after fame has hurried you out upon the like attempt. And though you would not call your Book <hi>Religio Magici,</hi> as that other was <hi>Religio Medici:</hi> yet the favourable conceit you had of your own Worth, made you bold to vie with him, and in imitation of that, you have stuffed your Book here and there with a tuft of Poetry, as a Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Bacon with green hearbs, to make it tast more savourly. But all will not doe, poor <hi>Magicus!</hi> For now your designe is discovered, you are as contemptible as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Juggler is before him, that knows all his tricks aforehand. And you run the same fortune that <hi>AEsops</hi> Asse, who inept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to imitate the Courtship and winning carriage of his Masters fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaping Spaniell, in stead of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour found a club for his rude perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. But you, <hi>Magicus!</hi> do not only paw ill-favouredly with your fore-feet, but kick like mad with your hinder-seet, as if you would dash out all the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> brains.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55764:51"/>
And doe you think that they are all either so faint-hearted, that they dare not, or so singularly moralized, that <hi>Socrates</hi> like, if an Asse kick, they will not kick again? Yes certainly next to your self they are as like as any to play the Asses, and to answer you kick for kick, if you will but stand fair for them. But you have got such a Magicall sleight of hiding of your head, and nipping in your buttocks, like the Hob-gobling that in the shape of an Horse dropt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren off one by one of his tail into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they cannot finde you out nor feel where about you would be, else cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they would set a mark upon your hinder parts. For if I, my dear <hi>Eugenius!</hi> who am your brother <hi>Philalethes,</hi> am forced out of care and judgement to handle you so seeming harshly and rigidly as I doe, what doe you think would become of you, <hi>st incideres in ipsas Belluas,</hi> if you should fall amongst the irefull <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> themselves? would you be able to escape alive out of their hands? Wherefore good brother <hi>Philaletbes!</hi> hereafter be more discreet, and endeavour rather to be wise then to seem so, and to quit your self from being a fool, then to phansie the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> to be such.</p>
