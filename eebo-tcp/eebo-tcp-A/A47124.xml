            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>DIvers Weighty Reaſons have induced me to this Undertaking. One whereof chiefly is; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as moſt of theſe Men, have not only run out with bitter Invectives againſt theſe Divine Inſtitutions; but have Fathered their Bold Oppoſition to them upon the Holy Spirit, (as they commonly do their other Groſs Errors) a Witneſs whereof, is <hi>W. Penn,</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> called, <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing</hi>; who ſaith in p. 109. concerning theſe Inſtitutions, <hi>We can teſtifie from the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which</hi> Paul <hi>Renounced Circumciſion; that they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as not now required.</hi> Now if upon due Tryal, their Arguments they have uſed, and ſtill uſe againſt them are found to be Vain and Invalid, Grounded upon groſs Wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings and Perverſions of Holy Scripture; and that it be proved by ſound Arguments, that they were, and are true Divine Inſtitutions under the pure Goſpel Diſpenſation; not only their too Credulous Followers; but the Teachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuch of them as are alive, may have occaſion to reflect upon the Spirit, which had acted their firſt Leaders to oppoſe thoſe things, as well as other great Truths of the Goſpel;
<pb facs="tcp:101541:3"/>
and thereby diſcern that it was not the Spirit of God, but a Spirit of Untruth, and may judge it forth from among them, and be humbled before the Lord for entertaining it. Another Reaſon is, (which is indeed my chiefeſt Reaſon) That whereas I had formerly been Swayed and Byaſſed by the undue Opinion I had of their chief Teachers and Leaders, who had Printed Books long before I came among them, as being greatly indued with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations and Inſpirations; and that I too Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulouſly believe their Bold and Falſe Aſſeverations; that what they had ſaid and Printed againſt the <hi>outward Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>outward Supper,</hi> was given forth from the Spirit of Truth in them; by means whereof, I had been drawn into the ſame Error, (as many other well meaning, and ſimple Hearted Perſons have been, and ſtill are by them) to oppoſe theſe Divine Inſtitutions, and have in ſome of my Printed Books uſed ſome of the ſame Arguments which they had uſed; I having in a Meaſure of Sincerity (I hope) Repented, and been humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, for that my ſaid Error; whereof I have given a Publick Acknowledgment in Print, in my late Book, called, <hi>George Keith'</hi>s <hi>Explications and Retractions</hi>; and wherein I have not only Retracted my Errors in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>; but in Relation alſo to divers other Particulars therein mentioned (but withal holding cloſe to my Teſtimony in all Principles of Chriſtian Faith and Doctrin, delivered by me in any of my former Books) I judged it my Duty, (beſides my Publick Acknowledgment and Retracttation of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) to endeavour according to the Ability given me of
<pb facs="tcp:101541:3"/>
God, of a better Underſtanding, to undeceive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from the ſaid Error, any into whoſe Hands my Books have come, Treating on that Subject; who have been deceived, or hurt by them. For as the Law of God requireth Reſtitution for any Wrong done to a Neighbour in Worldly Matters; ſo I judge it no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the like in Spirituals. And as the Law required an Eye for an Eye; the Goſpel requireth, that whom we have in any degree been acceſſory to Blind, or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform their Underſtandings, we ſhould labour to our outmoſt Ability (after we are better Enlightened our ſelves) to Enlighten and duly Inform them; ſo far as God ſhall be pleaſed to make us his Inſtruments in ſo doing, to whom it chiefly belongs. Know therefore, Friendly Reader; that what Arguments I have uſed in any of my Books againſt the <hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Supper,</hi> particularly in that, called, <hi>Truth's Defence</hi>; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, called, <hi>The Presbyterian and Independent viſible Churches in New</hi> England, <hi>and elſewhere brought to the Teſt,</hi> Cap. 10. and in another, called, <hi>The pretended Antidote proved Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>; and in another, called, <hi>A Refutation of Pardon</hi> Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghaſt, <hi>who pleadeth for</hi> Water-Baptiſm, <hi>its being a Goſpel Precept.</hi> As I hereby declare them to be void and null; ſo I do in this following Treatiſe ſhew the Nullity and Invalidity of them; by anſwering not only them, but divers others of other Perſons (together with them) as above named in the Title Page of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. And ſo far as the Arguments are the ſame, which both they and I have uſed; one Anſwer will ſerve to both; though I never was ſo blind, as not to ſee the
<pb facs="tcp:101541:4"/>
Weakneſs of divers Reaſons of ſome of their Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors againſt theſe Inſtitutions. But the Truth is, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Weakeſt and moſt Impertinent Arguments. I never heard nor read, till of late, that Providence brought to my hand ſome of their Books I never heard of before.</p>

               <head>SECT. I. An Impartial Examination, and Refutation of their Arguments againſt Water-Baptiſme.</head>
               <p>IN a Book of <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s, whoſe Title is, <hi>The Authority of the true Miniſtry in</hi> Baptizing <hi>with the Spirit, and the Idolatry of ſuch Men as are doting about Shadows and Carnal Ordinances</hi>; [here note his ſevere Charge] p. 13. he bringeth three Reaſons or Arguments to prove that in the Commiſſion which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave to his Diſcipless, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 29.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> was not intended, but the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument is, <hi>If the</hi> Baptiſme <hi>which</hi> Chriſt <hi>commanded in</hi> Matth. 28.19. Mark 16.16. <hi>was a</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>without which a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved; then it was not the</hi> Baptiſme <hi>of</hi> outward Water, (<hi>for</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſme <hi>is not of neceſſity to Salvation, neither is there any ſtreſs for Salvation laid upon is) but it was that</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>without which Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved, which</hi> Chriſt <hi>commanded,</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>therefore not</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſme, <hi>I prove</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Minor Propoſition thus: No man can be ſaved without being</hi> Baptized <hi>into the</hi> Name <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>and his Son</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>for his</hi> Name <hi>is the Word of</hi> God <hi>by which Salvation comes, and by no other</hi> Name, <hi>and the</hi> Lord <hi>is one, and his</hi> Name <hi>one, and it was into his</hi> Name, <hi>that the Diſciples were commanded to</hi> Baptize <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> would appear to be ſome body in Logick (though it is judged by many of his Brethren to be little better than a piece of the black Art) but he has in this ſufficiently diſcovered his Ignorance, both in true Divinity and true Logick. The Fallacy of his Argument is in this apparent, that in his ſuppoſed Proof of that he calleth the <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> he confoundeth <hi>Baptiſme</hi> into the <hi>Name,</hi> and the <hi>Name</hi> it ſelf, for <hi>ſaith he,</hi> his <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>the word of God</hi> by which Salvation comes. But though Salvation cometh by the word of <hi>God,</hi> and none can be ſaved without that Word, yet it doth not follow, that none can be ſaved without ſuch a <hi>Baptiſme</hi> as the Apoſtles did Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with into the <hi>Name</hi> of that Word; for as they were to Baptize
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101541:6"/>
into the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in the <hi>Name</hi> of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So they were to Teach in that <hi>Name,</hi> but this proves not that they were not to teach outwardly, and they were to work Miracles in that <hi>Name</hi>; it doth not therefore follow that they were not to work outward Miracles viſible to Men's outward ſight. Again, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> uſeth the <hi>Name word of God,</hi> in a too narrow and limited Senſe; for the full <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not the <hi>word only,</hi> but <hi>the word made Fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>word having aſſumed the true Nature of Man,</hi> and that by the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here is underſtood the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Man Chriſt</hi> who was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, is clear from <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to the <hi>Corinthians: Was</hi> Paul <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for you, or were ye Baptized into the</hi> Name <hi>of</hi> Paul? Signifying, that they were Baptized into the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, which hath a neceſſary Relation to the <hi>Man Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſidered as truly as <hi>Man,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> and thought <hi>the word is</hi> a <hi>Name</hi> proper to the <hi>Son,</hi> yet it is not the <hi>Name</hi> either of the <hi>Father,</hi> or of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for that were to confound, and wholly to deſtroy the diſtinction of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Properties</hi> of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which was the <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hereſie</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Minor thereof of his Argument is Fallaciouſly proved by him, and his Aſſertion is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> without which Men cannot be ſaved was the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Apoſtles, if by the words <hi>cannot be ſaved,</hi> he means, <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible</hi>; for he hath not in the leaſt proved that it was not <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Commanded; but whereas his Argument ſeemeth to depend on this, that becomes <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> is not <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not Command it. But he ſhould learn better to diſtinguiſh things <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and things <hi>neceſſary in ſome reſpect,</hi> and very profitable, though not of <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> and the like diſtinction <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with reſpect to his and his Brethrens Miniſtry, Preaching, and Writing which they ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> has Commanded them, and yet he will not ſay his and their Miniſtry Preaching and Writing is <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary</hi> to any Man's Salvation. Beſides it doth <hi>abſolutely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s declared Principle concerning the <hi>Sufficiency of the Light within every Man to Salvation without any thing elſe</hi>; to affirm that Men could not be ſaved, unleſs the Apoſtles had Baptized them according to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Command, even ſuppoſing it had been the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the Spirit, which the Apoſtles had been Commanded to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, for this World have made the Salvation of Men depend upon the Miniſtry of Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors in the outward Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101541:6"/>
of their Spiritual Gift of Preaching and Prayer; now before the Apoſtles Adminiſtred this <hi>Baptiſme</hi> (ſuppoſe it be that of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) the Men to whom they were ſent had the <hi>Light</hi> in them, which was <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Salvation without any thing elſe,</hi> according to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and conſequently without all Miniſtry of the Apoſtles; and had they never heard or ſeen the Apoſtles, or any other Men, had they given due Attendance and Obedience to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight within, that that would have ſaved them (according to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Divinity) without any other <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> outward or inward, that the Apoſtles could Adminiſter unto them.</p>

               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>Next, as to his ſecond Argument from that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved</hi>; theſe words do not prove that this was not <hi>Baptiſme with Water</hi>; for its a true Aſſertion, he that <hi>believes</hi> and is <hi>Baptized</hi> with Water ſhall be ſaved; but it will not prove, that therefore <hi>Baptiſme with Water</hi> is of <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> to Salvation, the most it proveth, is, that <hi>Baptiſme with Water,</hi> when and where it can be duly had is a <hi>means of Salvation,</hi> as outward Hearing, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Holy Scriptures are means of Salvation, yet not of ſuch <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity,</hi> but that Men may be ſaved without them; even as it may be truly ſaid, he that believeth, and frequenteth the Meetings of the Faithful ſhall be ſaved, and yet in divers Caſes Men may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without frequenting ſuch Meetings, as when they are hindred by Sickneſs, or Impriſonment, or ſome other Reſtraint, as when li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a Country where no ſuch Meetings are to be found, and that the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> mentioned, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>is not that which is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to Salvation,</hi> is evident from the following Words, where the word <hi>Baptized</hi> is omitted; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſay, <hi>he that is not baptized ſhall be damned, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned</hi>; the varying of the Expreſſion ſufficiently proveth that he did not mean the inward <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> but the outward; and whereas not <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> but <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> argue from the Particle in Greek, that ſignifieth in English <hi>into,</hi> that therefore it muſt be the <hi>Baptiſme with the Spirit,</hi> it is indeed very weakly and fallaciouſly argued, for the ſame Greek Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is found Acts, 8.16. where it is ſaid, that theſe of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who were Baptized <hi>into the Name of the Lord Jeſus</hi> had not <hi>received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> when ſo Baptized, till for ſome time after, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came unto them, the Greek Particle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the ſame here, and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101541:7"/>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. And any who have but a little skill in Greek know, that the Greek Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath often the ſame ſignification, with the Greek Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſignifieth as well <hi>in,</hi> as <hi>into,</hi> ſo that their ſo arguing is built on a Grammatical Quibble that is altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. And for them to argue, that it was not <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> which Chriſt commanded to the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, becauſe of the words <hi>Baptizing into the name,</hi> &amp;c. with as much colour of reaſon they might argue, that when in <hi>James</hi> 5.14. It is ſaid anointing them with Oyl in the name of the Lord, that the <hi>anointing</hi> there meant was not an <hi>outward anointing</hi> but an <hi>inward,</hi> and that the <hi>Oyl</hi> was not outward but inward.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas <hi>G.W.</hi> ſaith on this ſecond Argument, for the Saints were ſaved by that <hi>Baptiſme, which was not the putting away the filth of the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> which Chriſt commanded in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that doth no wiſe follow that therefore it was not <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi>

               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <p>AND becauſe I find that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in that Chapter of his Printed <hi>Apology,</hi> reprinted by his Son <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> 1696, doth much inſiſt upon this place in <hi>Peter,</hi> as if it did effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually prove that <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> is no <hi>Goſpel Inſtitution,</hi> and it is a common Text the Teachers among the Quakers bring to oppoſe <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme with Water</hi>; therefore I think fit the more fully to examine the Arguments brought by him from this place againſt it. But in the firſt place, I do apologize for my medling to anſwer or correct any Paſſages in the Books of <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> whom as I did greatly love and eſteem, and who, I believe, was one of the foundeſt Writers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among the People called Quakers, ſo I do truly honour his memory, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as to the main, he was a true Chriſtian, though in divers things, he was byaſſed and miſled, as I alſo was, by the too great eſteem that he had, and too great credit he gave, (as I alſo did) of thoſe called his <hi>Elders,</hi> whoſe <hi>groſs perverſions</hi> and <hi>miſinterpretations</hi> of Holy Scripture, we both did upon their <hi>Authority</hi> take for <hi>Divine Inſpirations,</hi> and I hope it may be a <hi>juſt Apology</hi> to me, and defence againſt the injurious Clamours of ſome, that may and will object it againſt me, as a breach of Friendſhip, to cenſure or correct any thing of that my <hi>deceaſed Friend: That I do no otherwiſe in this Caſe; than
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101541:7"/>
I would be done by</hi>; for, if after my deceaſe, (as well as before) any Friend of mine ſhould cenſure and correct any Paſſages in any Books of mine that did juſtly need ſuch <hi>Cenſure and Correction,</hi> I and all that love me ſhould take it, as a <hi>true act of Friendſhip</hi>; it being the beſt way to cover the Faults of our Friends, or were it of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to <hi>correct them,</hi> and though Men may be dear to us, yet <hi>Truth</hi> ought to be more dear; nor do I thus cenſuring and correcting what I judge amiſs in <hi>R.B.</hi> on theſe Heads, do any more wrong to him, than I do to my ſelf, whom I have impartially cenſured, and now again do, freely declaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatever I have ſaid, or writ any where againſt <hi>Baptiſme with Water,</hi> and the <hi>Outward Supper,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Goſpel Inſtitution was erronious, and which therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and correct. And where I have uſed divers of the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which <hi>G.W.</hi> and <hi>R.B.</hi> hath uſed, which I find <hi>R.B.</hi> hath been more large upon than I have any where been in any of my Books; therefore I ſhall rather conſider theſe Arguments as brought by him, than by me, eſpecially for this cauſe, that he is jugded by many of the Quakers to have writ more forcibly againſt theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than moſt have, or then I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.B.</hi> thus argueth from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. (ſee pag. 16. of his <hi>Sons Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> called <hi>Baptiſme and the Supper ſubſtantially aſſerted) The Apoſtle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tells us firſt negatively, what it is not,</hi> viz. <hi>not a putting away of the filth of the Fleſh, then ſurely it is not a waſhing with Water, ſince that is ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer, That the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> there deſcribed is not a putting away the filth of the Fleſh is granted, but it doth not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> for though <hi>ordinary waſhing with Water</hi> is a doing away <hi>Bodily filthineſs,</hi> yet <hi>Baptiſme with Water</hi> is not, not ever was, nay not <hi>John's Baptiſme with Water</hi>; for <hi>John</hi> did not ſay that he <hi>baptized</hi> his Diſciples to <hi>waſh away</hi> the <hi>filth</hi> of their Bodies, but unto Repentance. The deſcription of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> here given by <hi>Peter,</hi> is taken from the <hi>end,</hi> as is very common both in Scripture and elſewhere, to deſcribe a <hi>thing</hi> from <hi>its end</hi>; now the <hi>end of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſme,</hi> as it was commanded by Chriſt,. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. was not to <hi>put away the filthineſs of the Fleſh,</hi> but to ſignifie the <hi>inward waſhing by the Blood and Spirit of Christ</hi> upon the Soul and Conſcience, the which when ſo waſhed is a good Conſcience, and the effect of that inward waſhing is the anſwer of a good Conſcience, and indeed to me it is evident, that <hi>Peter</hi> in this deſcription of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101541:8"/>
                  <hi>negatively,</hi> what it is not, doth refer by way of compariſon to the <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal purifyings</hi> under <hi>Moſes Law, by Blood,</hi> and the <hi>Aſhes of an Heiſer with Water ſprinkling the Unclean,</hi> which as the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſanctified to the purifying the Fleſh,</hi> Heb. 9.13. and yet even this <hi>waſhing</hi> was not to <hi>cleanſe</hi> the Body from <hi>natural filth,</hi> but from the legal uncleanneſs that Men had on divers occaſions, as when they touched a dead Body they were <hi>legally unclean,</hi> and becauſe of that they were not to come into the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> until they were <hi>cleanſed</hi> with this <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>purifying ſprinkled</hi> on them. But the <hi>Baptiſme with Water</hi> under the Goſpel, had not that but a greater ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and being duly received had a greater and more <hi>noble effect) viz.</hi> to <hi>ſignifie</hi> the <hi>ſpiritual cleanſing by Christ,</hi> and to be a <hi>means of Grace,</hi> far greater than under the Law.</p>
               <p>Again p. 17. He thus argueth, <hi>If we take the ſecond and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive definition, to wit, that it is the Anſwer or Confeſſion of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then</hi> Water-Baptiſme <hi>is not it, ſince as our Adverſaries will not deny,</hi> Water-Baptiſme <hi>doth not always imply it, neither is it any neceſſary conſequence thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. This Conſequence alſo is not good, becauſe though <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> in the <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> ſtrictly taken, without any <hi>Metonymy</hi> is not the <hi>anſwer of a good Conſcience,</hi> as the <hi>Lamb was</hi> not the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> but a ſignification of it, yet the <hi>Lamb</hi> is called in Scripture the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the Sign put for the <hi>thing ſignified,</hi> that is very common in Scripture, as in other Authors, ſo the <hi>Baptiſme with Water, metonymically</hi> may be called, the <hi>anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> being the <hi>thing ſignified</hi> thereby. That he ſaith, their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries will not deny, that <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> doth not always <hi>imply it,</hi> neither is it any <hi>neceſſary conſequence</hi> thereof; in that he was under a miſtake, for they will ſay, and do ſay, that <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> doth always imply it, to ſuch as <hi>duly and worthily receive it</hi>; and that it is always a <hi>neceſſary conſequence</hi> or concomitant thereof upon due and well qualified Receivers. And if nothing appear to the contrary by words or actions, but that the receivers are duly qualified (tho' ſome of them be not ſuch really) yet in the judgment of Charity, even according to <hi>Scripture rule,</hi> they are called ſuch, as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth theſe of the <hi>Churches</hi> to whom he writ <hi>Saints,</hi> and yet no doubt all were not <hi>real Saints</hi> in the <hi>Churches,</hi> though by Profeſſion they were ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101541:8"/>Again, whereas pag. 18. he argueth thus: Peter <hi>calls this here which ſaveth the</hi> Antitypos, <hi>the Antitype, or the thing figured, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is uſually tranſlated, as if the like figure did now ſave us, thereby inſinuating, that as they were ſaved by Water in the Ark, ſo are we now by</hi> Water-Baptiſme, <hi>but this Interpretation</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>croſſeth his ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. His Argument from the Greek word uſed by <hi>Peter, viz. Antitypos</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the neuter gender) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed altogether <hi>weak and groundleſs,</hi> as if it only ſignified the thing and could not be underſtood of the Figure of the thing, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof appeareth from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. where the holy Places made with hands are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Antitypes of the true, which are truly tranſlated the Figures of the true holy Places made without hands.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas he argueth, <hi>that</hi> Water-Baptiſme <hi>is not meant</hi> (p. 19.) <hi>in</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. <hi>that the</hi> Baptiſme <hi>there mentioned, is ſaid to ſave us; but Proteſtants deny it to be abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
               </p>

But finding their Pretences to be palpably falſe in many other things of greater weight, occaſioned me to examine their pretended Inſpirations in this alſo, which (I deſire to praiſe God for his true Illumination) I found to be falſe. Now that <hi>Paul's</hi> Circumciſing <hi>Timothy</hi> was not by <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> is certain, becauſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101541:10"/>
ſometimes afterwards he did earneſtly oppoſe the practice of it, but we never find that he, or any elſe in Scripture oppoſed the practice of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme with Water,</hi> or ſpoke ſo ſlightly of it, as he did of <hi>Circumciſion</hi>; he did not ſay, if any of you be <hi>Baptized, Chriſt</hi> ſhould profit you nothing, as he ſaid, if any of you be <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> and he ſubmitted to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and received it. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.18. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. Though I find that <hi>W.

And whereas, <hi>R.B.</hi> ſaith, p. 32.33. <hi>Let it from this be conſidered how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Excludes</hi> Baptizing, <hi>not Preaching, though the abuſe (mark) procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from that, no leſs than from the other; for theſe</hi> Corinthians <hi>did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate themſelves from thoſe different Perſons, by whoſe Preaching (as well as from thoſe by whom they were</hi> Baptized) <hi>they were Converted; as by the</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. and 8 <hi>Verſes of the third Chapter may appear.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101541:10"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> Excluded <hi>Baptizing</hi>; the moſt it proves, is, that he preferred, his <hi>Preaching</hi> to his <hi>Baptizing,</hi> as being the greater and more principal Work enjoyed to him.</p>
               <p>Page 33. <hi>And yet for to remove that Abuſe (ſaith</hi> R.B.) <hi>the Apoſtle doth not ſay, he was not ſent to Preach, nor yet doth he Rejoyce that he had only Preached to a few, becauſe Preaching being a</hi> ſtanding Ordinance <hi>in the Church, is not becauſe of any Abuſe that the Devil may tempt any to make of it, to be forborn by ſuch as are called to perform it by the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All this is exceeding weak Reaſoning, and proceeds upon a falſe Suppoſition; that becauſe <hi>Baptiſme</hi> was abuſed, therefore it was ſimply to be forborn, or laid aſide; no ſuch thing appears mentioned in Scripture; for though <hi>Paul Baptized</hi> but a few of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he did not tell them that few were <hi>Baptized</hi> by any others. But the contrary appears from his words, that all the <hi>believing Corinthians</hi> were <hi>Baptized,</hi> though not by him, yet by ſome other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>If ſome of them had not been</hi> Baptized <hi>at all, it had been improper for him to ask them were they</hi> Baptized <hi>in the</hi> Name <hi>of</hi> Paul? And though Preaching be the greater Ordinance, as practiſed by the Apoſtles, and is not ſimply to be forborn, yet occaſions might and may happen that might cauſe it to be forborn at ſome certain time and place: As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſome had certainly informed <hi>Paul,</hi> that if he <hi>Preached</hi> at ſuch a place, and at ſuch a time, ſome that did lay wait for him, would lay hands on him and kill him; on this Advertiſement, who will ſay, but <hi>Paul</hi> might feel in himſelf, not only a Liberty to forbear going to <hi>Preach</hi> at ſuch a place, and at ſuch a time, but even a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> laid on him not then to go; for we find, that not only <hi>Paul,</hi> when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that ſome ſought his Life, did ſeek to eſcape; but our <hi>bleſſed Lord himſelf</hi> for a certain time did withdraw from ſuch as ſought his Life, becauſe his time to ſuffer was not then come. And as in that caſe, upon ſuch certain Information, <hi>Paul</hi> might have lawfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to have <hi>Preached</hi> to People at that place when his Life was in danger; ſo the Report being confirmed, that ſuch a Deſign was laid againſt him, he might have <hi>lawfully rejoyced</hi> and <hi>thanked God,</hi> that he did not go to <hi>Preach</hi> at that place, at that time. And many the like Examples might be brought to prove, that <hi>Preaching</hi> it ſelf may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be forborn, though not ſimply, yet at ſome occaſion which might render the <hi>forbearance</hi> of it at ſome certain place and time, both <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary</hi>; and ſuppoſe a Preacher did foreſee that his <hi>Preaching</hi> at ſuch a place, at ſuch a day, ſhould occaſion by <hi>accident</hi> ſome <hi>Schiſm

or Diviſion</hi> among ſincere Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith, he might very lawfully forbear to do it at that time, yea it were his Duty to forbear, and he might very <hi>juſtly rejoyce and thank God,</hi> that he did not Preach to them in that place, and at that time; this needed not to have been ſo largely inſiſted upon, but for their ſake, who through their great Ignorance and Prejudice) lay ſo great ſtreſs on this ſort of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as becauſe <hi>Paul thanked God, he had</hi> Baptized <hi>but a few of the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>therefore</hi> Baptiſme <hi>is no Goſpel Inſtitution</hi>; the weakneſs of which conſequence, I ſuppoſe is ſufficiently manifeſt: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a good Argument may be brought for <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> that ſeeing the abuſe of it at <hi>Corinth,</hi> or any where elſe, was no cauſe or occaſion of laying it aſide to any, but that it was univerſally practiſed on Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Apoſtles Days, inſomuch that it cannot be inſtanced where any Church, Family, or Perſon that did believe was not <hi>Baptized,</hi> that therefore it was practiſed by Divine inſtitution, and not by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſuch as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was; for neither <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> nor any other <hi>Jewiſh Rite</hi> was univerſally practiſed, as <hi>Baptiſme</hi> was; the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Argument, taken from <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>he thanked God he</hi> Baptized <hi>none but ſuch and ſuch,</hi> I find uſed by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> in his Book, called <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Railing,</hi> p. 110. to which let the above mentioned Anſwer ſerve.</p>
               <p>But I find ſome new Arguments uſed by <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi> to prove that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> was not commanded to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. p. 120. <hi>Lo I am with you always, to the end of the World</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what for? to enable them to</hi> Baptize <hi>with</hi> Water? <hi>No that many can do without him, or the leaſt ſenſe of his Preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Of all the Arguments I ever heard againſt <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> this is one of the weakeſt, and too much favouring of Profanity, that (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) many can do without him, but can they do it in Faith without him, and in true Obedience to his Command? This Scoff of his, has equal weight againſt <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> when in force, which he grants was with <hi>Water</hi>; and thus, as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> argueth, <hi>John</hi> could, and did <hi>Baptize</hi> without <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s inward Preſence, and the leaſt ſenſe of it, and it has the like force againſt all External Acts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commanded of <hi>God,</hi> both under the Law and Goſpel; for all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Acts ſimply conſidered, as ſuch without regard to Faith, or the inward Frame of the Mind, can be done as much without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> with <hi>Water</hi>; but none of them can be done as they ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. Hath <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> forgot <hi>Christ</hi>'s Saying to his Diſc<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101541:11"/>
                  <hi>without me ye can do nothing</hi>; that he hath ſo boldly contradicted him, to ſay, they could <hi>Baptize</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> without him. This is more Prophane and Scandalous, than what <hi>Samuel Jennings</hi> ſaid at a Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for which he was reproved by diverſe in the Meeting, and of which there is an account in Print. <hi>To do our own Buſineſs as Men, we need not the help of the Spirit, but to do</hi> God's <hi>Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we need it</hi>: But here according to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> when <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> which was <hi>God's</hi> Buſineſs, it being commanded of <hi>God,</hi> he could do that without him.</p>
               <p>Another Argument of his in the ſame Page, is, <hi>It is not go Teach, and then</hi> Baptize <hi>them with</hi> Water, <hi>but go teach all Nations,</hi> Baptizing <hi>them; and there was a Divine and Spiritual</hi> Baptiſme <hi>immediately atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and preſent with their Ministry.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument is alſo weak, and grounded upon a Quibble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſaid, <hi>go Teach, and then</hi> Baptize, <hi>but go Teach,</hi> Baptizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe the word <hi>Baptizing</hi> is a Participle; but this hath not the weight of a Feather, it is ſo light, and yet with ſuch light airy Stuff have deceived many: For as the word <hi>Baptizing</hi> is <hi>a Participle,</hi> both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>; ſo the word Tranſlated <hi>go,</hi> ſet before <hi>Teach,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> is a Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> going (or having gone) Teach. Now by the like Argument, becauſe it is not ſaid, firſt go, and then Teach, but going, Teach; therefore every foot of their way, where ever they went through, tho' they were not in ſight or within hearing of any People, before they came to them, they were to Preach; and by the like Argument, where it is ſaid, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.5. <hi>And, were all Baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confeſſing their ſins.</hi> It is not ſaid, they firſt Confeſſed, and then were <hi>Baptized,</hi> or they were firſt <hi>Baptized,</hi> and then Confeſſed, according to <hi>G.

But that there was a Divine and Spiritual <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> that attended their Miniſtry to ſome, will not prove that they did <hi>Baptize</hi> them with the Divine and Spiritual <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which was the Work of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and promiſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and other Believers; but was never commanded them to give it to others.</p>
               <p>His Third Argument, is from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Received ye the ſpirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he therefore that miniſtreth to you the ſpirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he it by the works of the law, or by the preaching of faith?</hi>

               <p>I Proceed in the next place, to examine all the other Arguments I find uſed by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> againſt theſe Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſeem to have any ſhadow of weight.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Argument I find uſed by <hi>W. Penn, in his Reaſon againſt Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> in p. 107. is, <hi>firſt, ſaith he, we know, and they confeſſ that they were in the beginning uſed as Figures and Shadows of a more hidden and Spiritual Subſtance.</hi> 2. <hi>That they were to endure no longer than till the Subſtance was come. Now the time of the</hi> Baptiſme <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Chriſt's <hi>only</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme <hi>therefore called the</hi> one Baptiſme, <hi>has been long ſince come, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the other, which was</hi> John<hi>'s, was fulfilled, and as becomes a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner ought to ceaſe; the like may be ſaid of the Bread and Wine; for as there is but</hi> one Baptiſme, <hi>ſo there is but</hi> one Bread. This ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Matter, but in different words, is uſed by <hi>R.B.</hi> in the above ſaid Treatiſe, p. 7.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:101541:12"/>Anſw. The Concluſion they both draw, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>John's Baptiſme</hi> is ceaſed, may be granted, and yet it will not follow that <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> as it was practiſed by the Apoſtles and other Miniſters after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection and Aſcenſion is ceaſed; ſeeing there is great ground to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>water-Baptiſme,</hi> and the Apoſtles, in divers weighty reſpects; as firſt the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after he roſe from the Dead, having all Power given him in Heaven and in Earth, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned the Apoſtles to <hi>Baptize,</hi> and that with <hi>Water,</hi> as ſhall be afterwards proved more fully, but <hi>John</hi> had not his Commiſſion from the Man <hi>Christ, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>John</hi> did only <hi>Baptize</hi> them of his own Nation, and was only ſent to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the Apoſtles Commiſſion reached to all Nations. 3. <hi>John</hi> though he taught them to believe in him who was to come, to wit, <hi>Chriſt</hi>; yet he required not Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as any condition to qualifie his Diſciples to receive his <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi>; but the Apoſtles required Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in all the Men and Women, as a condition qualifying them to receive their <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> 4. We do not find that the Holy Ghoſt was given or promiſed, to them who received <hi>John's Baptiſme,</hi> but the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt was given to ſuch as did duly and worthily receive the Apoſtles <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> therefore <hi>John's Baptiſme</hi> was called the <hi>Baptiſme of Repentance.</hi> 5. It ſeems greatly probable, that ſome who had received <hi>John's Baptiſme</hi> were again Baptized with the Apoſtles <hi>Baptiſme, Acts</hi> 19.3.4, 5, 6. But whereas they both argue, from <hi>John</hi>'s Words, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, but he muſt increaſe; it hath a further underſtanding, than barely as in relation to <hi>John's Baptiſme,</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 4.12. that <hi>Jeſus</hi> made and Baptized more Diſciples than <hi>John,</hi> tho' <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf Baptized not, but his Diſciples; thus, <hi>John</hi> decreaſed, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when both <hi>Water-Baptiſmes</hi> were in force, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had more Diſciples than <hi>John,</hi> even when <hi>John</hi> was living, at which he rejoyced; and as the number of Chriſt's Diſciples increaſed above the number of <hi>Johns,</hi> before <hi>John</hi>'s deceaſe, ſo ſtill after, and will encreaſe; and ſo will the Glory and Honour of Chriſt encreaſe above <hi>John,</hi> to the end of the World. But whereas they both argue, as they think ſo ſtrongly both againſt <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>outward Supper,</hi> becauſe of the Scripture Phraſe, <hi>one Baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>one Bread,</hi> which I confeſſ did formerly carry ſome weight with me, and I have ſo argued in ſome of my former Books; but I have ſufficiently ſeen the weakneſs of that Argument, as well as other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought both by them and me, againſt theſe Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101541:13"/>
But let it be conſidered, how things are ſaid to be one in divers ſenſes and acceptations. God is one in the higheſt ſenſe, yet this doth not infer that there is no diſtinction of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in their <hi>relative Properties,</hi> which are incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is one, and yet this doth not prove that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not two <hi>Natures,</hi> one of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> another of the <hi>Manhood</hi> moſt gloriouſly united. 3. Faith is one, yet there are divers true ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of Faith in Scripture, as 1. the ſaving Faith, 2. the Faith of Miracles which every one had not who had the ſaving Faith, 3. Faith objectively taken for the Doctrine of Faith, either as it is outwardly Preached or Profeſſed, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.24. Now if one ſhould argue, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, there is one Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. that conſequently there is but one Faith, and that is the Doctrine of Faith outwardly Preached and Profeſſed, and conſequently deny Faith as it is an inward Grace and Virtue of the Spirit in the Hearts of true Believers, his Argument would be falſe, ſo on the other hand, if another ſhould argue, true ſaving Faith, that is, of <hi>abſolute neceſſity to Salvation,</hi> is an inward Grace or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of true Believers; and therefore there is no Doctrine of Faith to be Preached or Profeſſed, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be alſo falſe, and as falſe is this way of reaſoning, that becauſe the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> therefore that <hi>one Baptiſme</hi> is only the inward of the Spirit, excluding the outward <hi>Baptiſme of Water,</hi> or as to ſay therefore it is only the outward <hi>Baptiſme of Water,</hi> excluding the inward <hi>Baptiſme of the Spirit.</hi> Now, as the one Faith mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. Suppoſe is meant the inward Grace or Virtue of Faith in the hearts of all True Believers, doth not exclude the Doctrine of Faith, outwardly Preached and Profeſſed; ſo nor doth the inward <hi>Baptiſme of the Spirit,</hi> ſuppoſe there meant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. exclude the outward <hi>Baptiſme of Water,</hi> both being true and one in their kind, as the inward Grace of Faith is ſpecifically one in all true Believers, but numerically manifold, even as manifold as there are numbers of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſo the Doctrine of Faith is one in its kind, though conſiſting of many parts; therefore to argue as <hi>W. Penn</hi> doth, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is one in the ſame ſenſe as God is <hi>one</hi> is very inconſiderate, which would infer that though God is <hi>one</hi> in ſpecie, yet that there are as many Gods numerically as Believers. And notwithſtanding that in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. it is ſaid there is one <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> yet it is not ſaid there or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that there is but one <hi>Baptiſme</hi>; for another place of Scripture
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101541:13"/>
mentions <hi>Baptiſmes</hi> in the Plural Number, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. And indeed as weak as their Argument againſt <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> is from the Scripture words <hi>one Baptiſme</hi>; no leſs weak is their Argument againſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Supper, practiſed with Bread and Wine, in commemoration of our Lord's Death, becauſe of the Scripture words, <hi>one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.17. for in that ſame verſe, <hi>Paul</hi> tells of <hi>one Bread</hi> in a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſignification, even as far as the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>Chriſt; we</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>being many are</hi> one Bread; but doth it therefore follow that there is no other <hi>Bread</hi> than the Church; nay, for they are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that <hi>one Bread,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and there is a <hi>third Bread</hi> that he mentions in the ſame Chapter, which is neither the one nor the other, <hi>one Bread,</hi> and that is the outward <hi>Bread</hi> that they did eat, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>the bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> Even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid concerning the outward <hi>Bread</hi>; that it was his Body, to wit, Figuratively (ſo by the like Figure it was the Communion of his Body) but not the Body it ſelf, which too many have been ſo fooliſh, as to imagine, that the outward <hi>Bread</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Chriſt's</hi> real Body, and as if <hi>Paul</hi> had foreſeen that many would become ſo fooliſh and unwiſe, as ſo to imagine; therefore to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt any ſuch folly, he had ſaid, I ſpeak as to wiſe Men; judge ye what I ſay. But whereas, many of the People, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> by <hi>Bread,</hi> in that part of the Verſe; the <hi>Bread</hi> which we break, is it not the Communion of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Body? Will have to be meant, not the outward Elementary <hi>Bread,</hi> but the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> it ſelf, in this they are under a great miſtake; for that would render the words to have a moſt abſur'd Senſe, as to ſay, the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Body; but the Body is one thing, and the Communion of that Body is another, and it were as little ſenſe to underſtand it thus; the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Figure of the Communion of his Body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true ſenſe of the words is the outward <hi>Bread</hi> which we break is a Figure, or Sign of the Communion of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Body: But theſe Men are under another great Miſtake, as if by the <hi>Lord's</hi> Body, here were not meant his outward Body that was Crucified, and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again; but the Life, which is the Light in them, and in every Man, whether Believer, or Unbeliever. But of this great Error, I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to take notice, only at preſent let it be remembred, that by the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in theſe above-mentioned words, is to be underſtood the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was outwardly Crucified, Dyed, and roſe again, and is a living Glorious Body, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101541:14"/>
is the Body of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit, of the Virtue of which, all true Believers partake; and by their having the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Body (whether when eating the outward Bread, ſo that they eat with true Faith, or when they do not eat, yet believing; for the Communion of his Body is not confined to the outward eating) they have the Communion of his Spirit alſo, and enjoy of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Spiritual Bleſſings of Grace, Life, and Light, ſent and conveyed into their Hearts, by and through the glorified Man, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who hath a Glorified Body; and though this Communion of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body is hard to be expreſſed, or to be demonſtrated to Man's reaſonable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet by Faith it is certainly felt and witneſſed, with the bleſſed Effects of it, cauſing an encreaſe in Holineſs and Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience in all true Believers; nor is there any thing in this Myſtery, or any other Myſtery of the Chriſtian Religion, that is contradictory to our reaſonable underſtanding. But yet a little further to let them ſee the folly of that Argument from the Scripture Phraſe, <hi>one Baptiſme, and one Body</hi>; when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. There is <hi>one Body and one Spirit</hi>; it doth not bear this Senſe, as if the Church were but one numerical Body, or one ſingle Man, or as if there were no Body of the Man, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven, though ſome of their Teachers have ſo falſely argued; that becauſe the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> has no Body but his Church, and as falſe ſhould their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be; there is but one Spirit, and that Spirit is the Holy Ghoſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no Soul or Spirit of Man in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers have no Spirits or Souls of Men in them that are Created Rational Spirits, both which are moſt falſe and fooliſh conſequences; alſo when the Scripture ſaith, there is one Father, and one is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it would be a very falſe conſequence to infer, that therefore we have never had any outward or viſible Fathers, and as falſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is, from one inviſible <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of the Spirit, to argue againſt any outward and viſible <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> or from the outward viſible <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> being one in its kind to argue againſt the inviſible and inward <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which is one in its kind alſo; this is an Error called by Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, a Tranſition from one kind to another, as becauſe there is one kind of Animal on Earth, called a Dog, therefore there was not any thing elſe ſo called; whereas, there is a Fiſh that hath the ſame Name, as alſo a Star in Heaven.</p>

               <p>BUT whereas <hi>W. Penn,</hi> in his above mentioned Argument ſaith, <hi>firſt we know, and they confeſs, that they were in the beginning uſed as Figures and Shadows of a more hidden Spiritual Subſtance.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this he is very ſhort and defective in his Expreſſion, they were both appointed and uſed in the beginning, I mean from the time of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, to be Figures and Signs of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> outward Body that was broken for us on the Croſs, and his Blood that was outwardly ſhed. In the firſt place, and conſequently of the inward Graces of the Spirit, and Benefits coming to Believers by his outward Body and Blood, and by the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> wholly conſidered, both in Soul and Body; and whereas he ſaith, 2. They were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to endure, than till the Subſtance was come: All this ſheweth <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s great Miſunderſtanding of the Nature of theſe Inſtitutions, both of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the Supper, as if they only ſignified ſome inward hidden Virtue, which he calls a more hidden and ſpiritual Subſtance that was to come; and ſo were only as he calls them in his <hi>Defence of his Key,</hi> called, <hi>a Reply to a pretended Anſwer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prenuniative and forerunning Signs,</hi> but were not <hi>commemorative Signs,</hi> as well of things paſt, as of things preſent; for this is utterly falſe, that <hi>Water</hi> in that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> which the Apoſtles, uſed after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was prenunciative, and not commemorative; for on the contrary it was not ſimply prenunciative, but commemorative, as commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and ſignifying the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that had been ſhed outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Remiſſion of our Sins, and the ſame commemoration and ſignification had the Wine, in the practiſe of the Lord's Supper, and the Bread that was broken in the Supper, ſignified (after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death and Reſurrection) his Body that was outwardly broken on the Croſs, and that outward practiſe was Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of his Death and Sufferings, which all true Believers in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ought to have freſh and lively in their Minds; to which the outward practiſe both of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the Supper is of great uſe; and the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the practiſe of the Supper is, being duly uſed, as with Faith, Reverence, and Devotion, the more profitable it is. Therefore ſaid <hi>Chriſt, as oft as ye eat this bread,</hi> &amp;c. As if one did ſay, as oft as ye Pray with true Faith and Fervency, it turns the more to your Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Advantage. And though the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in true Believers is the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101541:15"/>
great and principal rememberer unto them, yet he oft doth remember them, in the uſe of that outward Practiſe, uſing it as a means, and bleſſing it unto them, even as the Spirit uſeth the frequent outward Inſtitutions and Exhortations that Miniſters give to Believers as a means, and bleſſeth that outward means unto them alſo, the more to quicken and enlighten them; and as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, to ſtir up the pure mind in them, by way of remembrance, which was the end of his Epiſtles, and alſo of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles unto the Churches; and therefore it is but weakly and falſly argued by many of the People, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and their Teachers; the Spirit in them is their remembrancer, and they have the more hidden and inviſible ſubſtance in them; and therefore there is no uſe of theſe outward Signs to them; for this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument has the ſame force againſt all outward Teaching, and External Acts of Worſhip. And indeed, as I have oft obſerved and conſidered the chiefeſt Arguments uſed by theſe Men, againſt theſe outward Practiſes of the outward <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the Supper may be as much brought againſt all outward Teaching, and External Acts of Worſhip, and againſt all uſe of Books, yea, of the Holy Scriptures themſelves; and the like may be ſaid of theſe Arguments, that are commonly in the Mouths of the People, called <hi>Quakers; that Bread, and Wine, and</hi> Water <hi>are carnal things, and viſible, which may be touched, taſted, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; whereas the Scripture ſaith, touch not, taſt not, handle not, which are all to periſh with the uſing, and the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt? Again, we look not at things ſeen, for they are temporal, but at the things unſeen, which are eternal; and</hi> Col. 3. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things which are above, and ſet your affection on things above, not on things on the earth; but Water, Bread and Wine, are things on earth; and let no man judge you in meats and drinks,</hi> Col. 2.17. <hi>which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ</hi>? All theſe, and the like Scriptures (I ſay) may with as great ſhow of reaſon be brought againſt all good Books, and outward Teachings, Inſtructions, Exhortations, yea, againſt the Books of the Holy Scriptures, which <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath called the Carnal and Earthly Letter, that he touched, and handled, as much as <hi>Water, Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and is viſible; and conſequently by their Argument, is not to be look'd into, nor is the Scripture, nor the beſt of words uttered in Speech, or Written, the Kingdom of God, or the hidden inviſible Subſtance, as neither <hi>Water, Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> yet all theſe have their uſe, when duly uſed on a Spiritual Account; for as words ſignifie, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101541:15"/>
hold forth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the inward and ſpiritual Benefits that Believers have by him, to the outward hearing, ſo do theſe other hold forth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his ſpiritual Bleſſings to their Sight, Taſt, and Feeling; for which reaſon, antient Writers did call the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and Supper, <hi>verbum viſible,</hi> i.e. the <hi>viſible word.</hi> God having ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in his Wiſdome, that the Knowledge of Divine and Spiritual things, after a ſort ſhould be given to us by outward Signs and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, that affect our Senſes, and by our Senſes, as by ſo many Doors and Windows ſhould be let into our Souls, by means whereof, through the inward Operation of the Holy Spirit, the inward and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Faculties of our Souls and Minds are awakened and enabled to apprehend the Spiritual things themſelves, whoſe Symbols and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems theſe outward Elementary things are. And none of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures above mentioned, have any relation to the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and Supper, which were the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but to ſuch outward things, the obſervations of which were after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men, as not only the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, but <hi>Gentile</hi> Cuſtoms and Traditions, alſo were touching Meats and Drinks, and other things, which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20.21, 22. <hi>the Rudiments of the World,</hi> which as they are of a periſhing nature, ſo the uſe and ſervice of them; but ſo is not the uſe and ſervice of the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and Supper, which is a holy Commemoration of our <hi>Lord's</hi> Death and Sufferings, and of the great benefits we have thereby, tending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our ardent Love and Affections to him, and to raiſe them up to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to him in Heaven; therefore though true Believers at <hi>Chriſt's</hi> command uſe the outward things, yet neither their Minds, nor Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are ſet on them, but on him, and the heavenly Bleſſings they have by him; which holy Commemoration we ſhould not let dye or periſh in us, but keep alive for our ſpiritual Benefit and Advantage; and as concerning, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.17. The things there mentioned, are called ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of things to come, ſuch as the Types of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law were; but <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> and the Supper, which the Chriſtians were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to practice, were ſimply, not ſhadows of things to come, but are commemorative Signs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he hath already come in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that was prepared for him, and of his Body and Blood which he hath given for us, together with the ſpiritual bleſſings of Grace, Life, and Light that we have by him, to make us comformable to him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as well as to give us the pardon of our Sins, and to juſtifie us, and give us a right to eternal Life. But it bewrayeth ſtill great in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101541:16"/>
in <hi>W. Penn,</hi> to argue againſt the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as he doth in his <hi>Defence of his Key,</hi> above-mentioned, p. 154. <hi>They that perſonally</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>enjoy their deareſt Friends, will not repair to their Pictures, though drawn never ſo much to the life, to quicken their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them.</hi> His ſimilitude of a <hi>Picture,</hi> to which he compareth the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and Supper is a good Argument againſt him, the Saints on Earth have not the Man, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> perſonally preſent with them, they have not his Body that ſuffered Death for them, and roſe again a preſent object to their outward ſight; therefore did he in his great love appoint theſe outward Signs to be a Memorial of him, until they ſhould have himſelf Perſonally preſent with them, as they will certainly have in the time appointed, and to as little purpoſe is his arguing in that ſame page, <hi>That the true Believers were come to Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>and ſit in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, which muſt be an attainment above ſigns of inviſible grace, being the life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion; and ſo the Period and Conſummation of Types, Shadows, and ſuch ſort of Signs or Significations as are in queſtion.</hi> Anſwer, It is a great Miſrepreſentation of the State of the Queſtion in <hi>W. Penn,</hi> ſo to place it as well as a weak Argument, as becauſe true Believers are come to Spiritual Attainments above Signs of inviſible Grace; that therefore there is no uſe of Signs in Religious Matters. Why then doth he ſpeak and writ ſo much in Religious Matters, for all his Words and Writings are but Signs; and he thinketh that his Brethren are come to higher Attainments than theſe Signs, yea, why doth he kneel in Prayer, and diſcover his Head when he Prayeth; what are theſe but Signs? And why ſo much ſtrife and contention about <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Papers of Church Orders, and Womens Dreſſes? Are not his Brethren come to higher Attainments than theſe outward things? But it is an obſervation of many, that after <hi>G. Fox</hi> had taught his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to throw down the outward Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he ſet up among them his own, and ſo did perſuade them to exalt them; that whoever did not comply therewith, were to be judged by his zealous Admirers to be Apoſtates; thus <hi>Phariſee</hi> like, ſetting up Humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions above Divine Precepts, and in ſo doing, <hi>W. Penn</hi> has had no ſmall ſhare, who hath as eagerly promoted <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Inſtitutions about outward things, as he hath laboured to throw down the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>TO avoid the Argument for <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> it being an Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>them into the name</hi> &amp;c. he ſaith, <hi>but no water is mentioned</hi> page 106. Reaſon againſt Railing; <hi>and therefore he concludes in the next</hi> p. <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>commanded the Apoſtles to</hi> Baptize <hi>with the</hi> Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and the like evaſions is made by</hi> R.B. <hi>in the aboveſaid Treatiſe</hi> p. 26. <hi>where he putteth them who underſtand it of</hi> Water-Baptiſme <hi>to prove, that</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>is here meant ſince the Text is ſilent of it.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As <hi>Water</hi> is not mentioned, ſo nor is Baptizing with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> mentioned, and at this rate of arguing uſed by them, nor muſt <hi>Baptizing with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> be underſtood, which yet they ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately affirm muſt be meant here.</p>
               <p>But <hi>R.B.</hi> thinks to prove, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is here meant, arguing from the literal ſignification of the Text, which we ought not to go from, except ſome urgent neceſſity force us thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but no ſuch urgent neceſſity forceth us thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The literal ſignification of the Text, is not <hi>Baptizing</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt; but on the contrary, the word <hi>Baptizing</hi> literally ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to Waſh with Water or Dip into Water; <hi>Yea</hi> R.B. <hi>grants p.</hi> 49. <hi>If the etymology of the word ſhould be tenaciouſly adhered to, it would militate as well againſt moſt of their Adverſaries as the Quakers.</hi> When it is transferred from the literal ſignification to a Metaphorical, as to ſignifie the Inward and Spiritual <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the Holy Spirit, it is never when ſo transferred applied to Men, as having any command ſo to <hi>Baptize,</hi> but wholly and only to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I challenge any Man to give but one inſtance in all the Scripture, where <hi>Baptizing</hi> with the Spirit is ever referred to Men, either by way of Precept or Practiſe, as if ever any Man but the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did <hi>Baptize</hi> with the Holy Spirit, or were commanded ſo to do; the quibble from the Greek Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is anſwered and refuted above, as alſo his arguing from the word <hi>one Baptiſme</hi>; and whereas he ſaith the Name of the Lord is often taken in Scripture for ſome thing elſe than a bare ſound of words or literal expreſſion, even for his Virtue and Power. I anſwer and ſo is it oft taken otherwiſe, as the Name of God in Scripture ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth himſelf, ſo the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that both conſidered as he is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and yet one <hi>Christ,</hi> and that to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101541:17"/>
                  <hi>Baptized</hi> into the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> did not ſignifie the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt; I have proved already out of <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16. Beſides the <hi>Name</hi> of the Father is not the Holy Ghoſt, as neither is the <hi>Name</hi> of the Son, for as the Father is neither the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt; ſo, nor is the <hi>Name</hi> of the Father, nor the <hi>Name</hi> of the Son, the <hi>Name</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, as they are diſtinguiſhed by their relative properties, ſo by theſe <hi>Names,</hi> though the <hi>Name God</hi> belongeth to each of them, and who are one only <hi>God</hi> bleſſed for ever. But that he further contends, that the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> commanded here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own <hi>Baptiſme</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>John</hi> makes mention, and of which he is the author and giver, is indeed the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, which he promiſed unto the Apoſtles to give them, and accordingly did perform; but we no where find that ever he promiſed to give them Power, to give it to others, or commanded them to give it, that is wholly an unſcriptural Phraſe, and ſcandalous. if not Blaſphemous, to ſay, that poor mortal Men hoever ſo Holy could give the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of the Spirit, this is to give to them what was proper only to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> why did <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>he that comes after me ſhall Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> he did not ſay, they who ſhould come after me, but he, intimating none had that Power and Dignity but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was <hi>God</hi> as well as Man, and as he was <hi>God</hi> had this power belonging to him, and which did belong to no Men nor Creature whatſoever; and thus indeed the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the Spirit is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> not which he commanded Men to do, but which he promiſed to do, altho' the <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> which he commanded his Apoſtles to practiſe in his <hi>Name</hi> is alſo his, in a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſenſe, as the Apoſtles teaching is his, becauſe commanded by him; yet when we ſpeak of <hi>Gods</hi> teaching according to the ſenſe of that Scripture, they ſhall all be taught of <hi>God,</hi> it is not meant the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching of Men, but <hi>Gods</hi> inward teaching in Mens hearts; As touching his third Reaſon to prove that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt is meant Matth. 28.19. <hi>The Baptiſme which Christ commanded his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was ſuch that as many as were therewith baptized, therewith did put on Chriſt, but this is not true of Water-Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As concerning that place of Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7. from which this Argument ſeems to be taken, the place it ſelf reſtricts it to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Galatians,</hi> as v. 26. <hi>For yee are all the Children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and all ſuch as beings <hi>Baptized</hi> with outward <hi>Water,</hi> put him on by a publick Profeſſion, ſo by true Faith they inwardly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101541:17"/>
put him on. To make a publick Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> is to put him on, in a common Phraſe of ſpeech, as when a Man is ſaid to put on the <hi>Souldier,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> by putting on the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Souldier</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in which ſenſe <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaid, <hi>Romae Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum indui,</hi> i.e. <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>I put on Chriſt,</hi> ſignifying that he was there <hi>baptized,</hi> and it is to be noticed how <hi>Paul</hi> generally in his Epiſtles to the Churches he wrot to, calls them Saints, they being ſo by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, though there might have been Hypocrites among them, and as by outward profeſſion Men are ſaid to be Saints, ſo they may be ſaid to have put on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when nothing by Word or Deed can appear to the contrary in a judgment of Charity.</p>
               <p>As to his 4th. Argument that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> was <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> I have above ſhewn, that <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> commanded to, and practiſed by the Apoſtles after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, diflered in many reſpects, and tho' both required Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as a condition in order to receive the <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> yet the later required Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified and Raiſed again, as a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in order to receive <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> but the former did not require that Faith. Again his arguing from their not uſing that form of <hi>Baptiſm, In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who did <hi>Baptize</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> in thoſe days of the Apoſtles, is as defective as his otherways of arguing on this Head.</p>
               <p>But how doth he prove that they uſed not this Form? Why <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all theſe places, where Baptizing (with Water) is mentioned,</hi> there is not a word of this Form, and in two places <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16. and 19.5. <hi>that it is ſaid of ſome that they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> But it ought to be conſidered, that oft in the Scriptures what is not expreſt, is underſtood, yea that very Form expreſſed 8.16. is comprehenſive of the other, and if no more be expreſſed by him that is the Adminiſtrator, if he be ſound in the Faith, and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be <hi>Baptized</hi> hath a ſound Faith, that Form is ſufficient, it is not expreſt that the Eunuch gave any other confeſſion of his Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was <hi>Baptized,</hi> but that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Son of <hi>God</hi>; but will it therefore follow, that he believed no other Article of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith but that, and confeſſed no other. In his further Eſſay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his aſſertion, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded the Apoſtles to <hi>Baptize</hi> with the Spirit, he ſaith, Baptiſme <hi>with the Spirit, tho' not wrought without</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his Grace, is inſtrumentally done by men fitted of God for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore no abſurdity follows that</hi> Baptiſme <hi>with the Spirit ſhould be expreſſed as the action of the Apoſtles; for tho' it be Chriſt by his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101541:18"/>
Grace that gives Spiritual Gifts, yet the Apoſtle</hi> Rom. 1.11. <hi>ſpeaks of his imparting to them Spiritual Gifts, and he tells the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>that he had begotten them thro' the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>To convert the heart is properly the work of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and yet the Scripture oftentimes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes it unto Men, as being the Inſtruments, and</hi> Paul<hi>'s commiſſion was to turn Men from Darkneſs to Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I acknowledge ſuch like anſwers I had formerly given in ſome of my former Books to the like Objection; but I am come to ſee the weakneſs and defect of it; in order therefore to detect the fallacy of this aſſertion, that the Apoſtles might be as well ſaid to <hi>Baptize</hi> with the Spirit, as to Beget, to Convert, to Impart ſome Spiritual <hi>Gift,</hi> &amp;c. Let it be conſidered that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the Holy Spirit, is not only another thing than Converſion, or imparting ſome Spiritual <hi>Gift,</hi> &amp;c. that it is incomparably greater; for <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the Spirit is equivalent to the miſſion of the Spirit, and his Inhabitation in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and his being given to them; all Spiritual <hi>Gifts</hi> of Faith, Converſion, Regeneration, however ſo true and real, are but works and effects of the Spirit, with whom Men may be ſaid Inſtrumentally to work; but the giving the Holy Spirit, to which <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with the Holy Spirit is equivalent, is of a higher Nature, than any or all theſe Spiritual Gifts, differing as much as the Giver differs from his Gifts: For as to Create is only proper to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> to Redeem by way of Ranſome and Satisfaction to Divine Juſtice is only proper to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without any concurrence of Men or Angels, ſo to <hi>Baptize</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt or endue therewith, or give or ſend the Holy Ghoſt, is only proper to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> and not to Men ſo much as Inſtrumentally, there is no ſuch Phraſe to be found in all the Scripture, as that any Man did <hi>Baptize</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, in any caſe or ſenſe, we ought not to allow ſuch odd Phraſes ſo forrain to Scripture, otherwiſe the greateſt abſurdities might follow, and a Power of Creating and Redeeming might be given to Men at this rate, by adding the word Inſtrumentally, but as we are to allow no <hi>Inſtrumental Creators or Redeemers,</hi> ſo no Inſtrumental giver of the Holy Ghoſt or <hi>Baptizers</hi> with the ſame. The Holy Ghoſt is <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and it is too arrogant and wild to ſay, that Men who in reſpect of <hi>God</hi> are as Worms, can give their Creator and Maker. The Scripture indeed tells us, that the Holy Ghoſt was given thro' the laying on of the Apoſtles hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16. and ſometimes in Preaching, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Prayer, the Holy Ghoſt was given; but it was never ſaid,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101541:18"/>
that Men gave it or <hi>Baptized</hi> with it. Beſides, at this rate, they may ſay, the Teaching that <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. was not outward Teaching but inward, and then call it Inſtrumental; but what ſenſe would be made of ſuch an aſſertion, the Apoſtles were ſent not to Teach outwardly but inwardly, by Inſtrumental Teaching; and one might argue as ſtrongly, that it was not outward Teaching that <hi>Chriſt</hi> meant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. why, not the leaſt word is mentioned of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching, therefore it is not underſtood but only inward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If it be fit to anſwer, this wild inference thus, the Teaching there commanded muſt needs be outward, becauſe its only Mens work to Teach outwardly, and <hi>Gods</hi> work to teach inwardly; the like anſwer is as proper to be given in relation to <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as it is Mens work to <hi>Baptize</hi> outwardly with <hi>Water,</hi> ſo it is the work of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> inwardly with the Spirit. And if Men be reſolved to quibble and embrace any wild notion, rather than the ſimple Truth, had there been expreſs mention made of <hi>Water,</hi> Matth. 28.19. that quibbling Spirit would have made a new objection, and ſtill argued it was not material or outward <hi>Water,</hi> but inward and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, becauſe in many places of Scripture, <hi>Water</hi> ſignifieth not outward material <hi>Water,</hi> but inward and Spiritual.</p>

               <p>THERE is yet another Argument uſed both by <hi>W. Penn</hi> and <hi>R.B.</hi> againſt both <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I ſhall recite it in <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s words (being the ſame in effect with theſe of <hi>R.B.</hi>) Thirdly <hi>ſaith</hi> W. Penn, <hi>they were but the more noble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Meats and Drinks, and diverſe Waſhings that the Apoſtles ſaid, were but ſhadows of the good things to come; for I would not that any ſhould be ſo ſottiſh as to think that Christ came to aboliſh thoſe ſhadows of the Jews, and inſtitute others in their room, by no means. He came to remove, change and aboliſh the very nature of ſuch Ordinances, and not the particular Ordinances only, to wit, an outward Shadowy and Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Religion; for it was not becauſe they were Jewiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Meats and Drinks, and diverſe Waſhings, but becauſe they were Meats and Drinks, and outward Waſhings at all, which never could nor can cleanſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead Works, nor give eternal Life to the Soul, elſe wherein would the change be? A continuance of them, would have been a judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Spiritual Evangelical Worſhip, the Goſpel would have been a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101541:19"/>
ſtate of Figures, Types and Shadows, which to aſſert or Practice, is as much as in ſuch lies to pluck it up by the roots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This whole way of Arguing proceeds upon a ſuppoſed Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that is falſe, and becauſe the Foundation is falſe, therefore is his Superſtructure alſo; both which I ſhall briefly ſhow: Firſt, His ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Foundation is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> No Signs that is no outward things that are Symbolical, or Significative of greater and more excellent things do by any means belong to the Goſpel, and Chriſtian Religion, otherwiſe (as he argueth but very weakly) there would be no change, and no difference betwixt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion and the Chriſtian, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Law and Goſpel; but this doth by no means follow. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that ſome Signs belong to the Goſpel, yet there is not only a change and difference betwixt them two, but a very great change and difference, even as much as betwixt the Light of the Twilight, and the clear Light of the Sun after he is riſen, or betwixt the Sun in the Morning, and the Sun when he is high in the Firmament; and if he will have the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and <hi>Supper,</hi> called Shadows as well as Signs; is there no difference betwixt the Shadow that the Sun caſts early in the Morning, when he is but low above the Horizon, and when he is high; we know that the higher the Sun riſeth, the Shadow is the leſs, yet ſtill there is ſome Shadow; however high the Sun riſeth until he come to the Zenith, or Vertical Point, at which Point there is no Shadow, but this never happeneth to us in theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts; and to apply the ſimilitude of the Sun and Shadow to the caſe in hand; admit the Sun to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he enlightenth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, or the beſt Chriſtian Congregation that ever was on the Earth; did any ſuch Church or Congregation know that Divine Sun to be riſen upon them ſo high as the Vertical Point in this Spiritual Senſe? Is not that rather the State that is reſerved to the future Life? When the Shadows ſhall flee away, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.17. and 4.6. What was the State of the Church in the Apoſtles days, after they had received plentiful Illuminations of the Holy Ghoſt? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf and them, now we ſee darkly as in a Glaſs, <hi>tanquam in aenigmate</hi> the ſeeing Face to Face, being reſerved to the future State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death; and as he ſaid again, we walk by Faith, not by Sight, which is to be underſtood comparatively; for though it is granted that the Saints while living in the mortal Body have often ſweet and precious ſights and taſts of the glory of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; yet it is not ſo always with them and their higheſt Illuminations of Knowledge do
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101541:19"/>
admit of ſome defects and obſcurities, and the condition of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal State, as it implyeth ſomewhat of Shadow, with reference to their defects and ſhortneſs, in reſpect of the much higher and more full and perfect Attainments of glorified Saints and Angels. So in this State of the mortal Body, Shadows and Symbolical things may be, and are really of that Service to them, as the Shadow of a Curtain is, that is interpoſed betwixt the brightneſs of the Sun, and the frail ſight of our mortal Bodies; And what are all words but Signs, <hi>verba ſunt ſigna rerum &amp; conceptuum; words are Signs of Things and Thoughts:</hi> So are words properly defined by Logicians and Philoſophers. Now if the Goſpels Diſpenſation under Chriſtianity be all life and ſubſtance, and nothing elſe; then not only all Books and Letters, but all words poſſible to be uttered by the Mouths of Men, muſt be rejected from having any uſe in Goſpel Worſhip, and inſtead of ſilent Meetings at times, there muſt be not other Meetings but ſilent Meetings; nay, nor any Meetings at all of Bodies of Men and Women outwardly Aſſembled; for by <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s way of Arguing, there is no uſe of them; ſuch Meetings of Bodies reach but to the ſight, and all that is or can be ſeen is but Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and cannot reach to the Soul; all Meetings muſt be only within, and all Teaching within, and all Prayer and Worſhip within, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without. But if it be granted that outward words, though Signs may be uſeful for the encreaſe of ſpiritual Knowledge, by the ſame reaſon the outward Signs of <hi>God's</hi> appointment may be uſeful alſo; yea, in ſome ſort they are more uſeful, when the ſignification of them is underſtood; for Example, <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> hath a nearer reſemblance to the thing ſignified by it, than any words whatſoever; for words ſignifie only by humane Inſtitution, but viſible Signs that are not words, bear ſome Similitude and Analogy to the things ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are as it were ſo many Hieroglyphicks of Divine Myſteries. In ſhort, the difference betwixt the Judaick and the Chriſtian Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſtands not, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> would have it, that the Judaick Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was an outward Figurative and Shadowy Worſhip, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the Goſpel hath nothing of outward in it, nothing of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Sign, or Shadowy; for in both theſe Deſcriptions he is under a great miſtake, the Judaick Religion had Subſtance, Life and Vertue, and an inward Glory belonging to it as really as the Chriſtian, yea, the very ſame in Nature; and therefore it is not a fit Definition he gives of the Judaick Diſpenſation and Religion; that it was an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Figurative and Shadowy Worſhip and Religion, the outward
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101541:20"/>
part of it was the Shell and Cabinet, but it had an inward part that was as the Kirnel and Jewel, as all the Faithful did know, who were under that Diſpenſation, while it ſtood in force. Again, it is as really an Error on the other hand to define the Chriſtian Diſpenſation to be all inward, all Life and Spirit, and Subſtance; that is, too Chymical and Subtile, and no wiſe Saits with a mortal State at leaſt; for as our natural Bodies cannot Eat and Drink all Spirit, but require a Food more Bodily, ſo our Chriſtian Religion requireth a Bodily part as well as a Spiritual. And ſuch who through an ignorant Preſumption throw away the Bodily part of the Chriſtian Religion, loſe the Spiritual, or rather never find it, but in place of the true Spirit of Chriſtianity em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace an inward Shadow and Imagination, and oft an Antichriſtian Spirit, and ſuch, I have known who had been once very Zealous in the <hi>Quakers</hi> way, who upon ſuch ignorant Preſumption, would come to no Meetings, hear no outward Teaching, nor joyn in any External Act of Worſhip; alledging all was inward, and they needed no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, and God was only to be Worſhipped in the inward, which are the true and proper Conſequences of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Reaſonings here; His Diſtinction of Prenunciative and Commemorative Signs I have above examined, and ſhewed that <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> and the outward Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are not meerly Prenunciative but Commemorative, as commanded to be practiſed after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection. The true diſtinction betwixt the Judaick and Chriſtian Diſpenſation and Religion, conſiſts in theſe following Particulars: That the Judaick Diſpenſation and Religion had much more of outward Figurative and Shadowy things than the Chriſtian, the former had much, as beſt ſuited to that Time and State, the latter had but little in compariſon to the former. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Figures and Shadows of the Law were indeed many, perhaps ſome hundreds there were of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Laws, commonly called Ceremonial, relating to Meats and Drinks, Waſhings or <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Places and Times, as Days, Weeks, Months and Years, but the Symbols and Signs under the Goſpel are but few, as <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the Supper, kneeling or ſtanding up in Prayers, and the Men uncovering their Heads may be called Decent Religious Signs of our Worſhip. Secondly, The Typical and <hi>Moſaical</hi> Precepts were not only many, but conſiderably chargeable and painful; the multitude of their Sacrifices were a great charge, and the Males coming there every year to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> very Laborious, Circumciſion of the Male Children painful, but <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> and the Supper very

eaſie, and with very little charge, and little or no pain; which charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and painful Service of the Law among other things, occaſioned <hi>Peter</hi> to call it a Yoak; which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>And God in his wiſdom ſaw it meet to put that yoak upon them, as ſuiting to that legal and typical ſtate; and our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from that Yoak is a great bleſſing of God.</hi> Thirdly, Theſe Signs and Shadows of the Law did not near ſo clearly and plainly hold forth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Spiritual Bleſſings of Remiſſion of Sins, Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification through <hi>Chriſt</hi>; as theſe few plain Signs and Symbols of <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Supper</hi> do; the words in the Form of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> do plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that Great Myſtery of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and how theſe three are concerned in the things ſignified by the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi>; as namely, in the Pardon of our Sins; the Father giveth it, the Son purchaſeth it, the Holy Spirit in our Hearts perſuadeth us of it: Again, the form of words in the Inſtitution of the <hi>Supper, take, eat, this is my body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and this cup is the new Teſtament in my blood ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of many; drink ye all of it.</hi> There are no ſuch plain and clear Forms of Speech holding forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the ſpiritual Bleſſings we have by him, that were annexed to, or uſed with any of the Figures and Shadows of the Law. Fourthly, The Figures and Shadows of the Law in the uſe of them, had not that Plenty of Grace, and Divine and Spiritual Influence of the Holy Ghoſt, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them generally to Believers under the Law, as doth generally accompany Believers under the Goſpel; for as <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, it was reſerved unto the days that were to come after the Judaical Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ended, wherein <hi>God</hi> was to ſhow the exceeding Riches of his Grace; and in the latter Days, <hi>viz.</hi> under the Goſpel the Spirit was to be poured forth, as was accordingly fulfilled; and on theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, eſpecially the two laſt, it is, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> and the outward Supper ought not to be numbred among the Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Judaick Diſpenſation; for though the material things in ſome part be the ſame, yet the manner ſo differing, and the Grace and Spirit more plentiful abundantly, as is above declared, gives juſt cauſe, that the outward <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the Supper, when duly Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, as they ought to be, and were in the Apoſtles Days, ſhould not be numbred among the Carnal Ordinances, nor yet ſo called, but rather Spiritual; for things receive their denomination from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better part: Holy Men in Scripture are called Spiritual though
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101541:21"/>
having Bodies of Fleſh; and why may not things be called Holy and Spiritual, that are uſed and practiſed by Holy Men, wholly for a Holy End; although the things themſelves be Material and External: All which being conſidered, it will plainly appear how weakly and raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>R.B.</hi> have argued in this Point, and what an Impertinent Conſequence <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath made, to infer, that to allow <hi>Water-Baptiſme,</hi> and the outward <hi>Supper</hi> to belong to the Goſpel, is to make the Goſpel a State of Figures, Types and Shadows, which doth no more truly follow, than to allow, that becauſe <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath a Body of Fleſh and Blood; that therefore he is a Carnal and Bloody Man; or becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Fleſh and Blood as other Men; therefore there Church is a Carnal and Bloody Church; and as raw and defective is <hi>R.B.</hi> his way of Reaſoning, p. 25, 26, 27. of the above ſaid Treatiſe; that where the Author is the ſame, the Matter of Ordinances is the ſame, and the end the ſame; and having the ſame effect, they are never accounted more or leſs Spiritual, becauſe of their different times. For all this is not a ſufficient enumeration, to prove the one not to be more Spiritual than the other; there are diverſe other great Conſiderations or Arguments, beſides theſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him ſo generally and overly; as in the reſpects above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, relating to their Form and Manner, and greater Efficacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the greater plenty of Grace, accompanying the latter than the former, and having greater and more excellent Effects; for who that knows, what a true Chriſtian is, but will ſay he is far beyond an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Religious <hi>Jew</hi> that had ſome degree of Faith in the promiſed <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>; the Scripture comparing the <hi>Jew</hi> and the Chriſtian, as the Child and the Man. And who but will ſay, that the true Goſpel way of Miniſtry, as it was in the Apoſtles Days, and wherein they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in Preaching and Prayer, did far excell the Miniſtry of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſincere <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts and Scribes, although they had one Author, and one Doctrine for Subſtance, and one end in their Miniſtry at large and in general, and alſo one effect in general and at large, <hi>viz.</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct in Righteouſneſs ſuch as heard them. And though in one ſenſe the <hi>Jewiſh Baptiſms,</hi> and that practiſed by the Apoſtles after <hi>Christ's</hi> Reſurrection had one Author, <hi>viz.</hi> God, yet in another ſenſe there was a conſiderable difference, it being <hi>God</hi> or the word Incarnate, or <hi>Chriſt God</hi> Man that was the Author of the latter, but not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And though the <hi>Jewiſh Water-Baptiſms,</hi> and the Chriſtian <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſme,</hi> which is but one, do agree in relation to their end in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101541:21"/>
ſome ſort, yet there is a great difference in that very reſpect; for tho' the remote end of the <hi>Jewiſh Baptiſms</hi> was to ſignifie Remiſſion of Sin through Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; yet the proximate, or next end of thoſe <hi>Baptiſms</hi> was to make them legally clean, ſo as to be allowed to come into the Congregation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; but the end of the Chriſtian <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> even proximately and nextly conſidered, is to ſignifie Remiſſion of Sins, and the ſpiritual Cleanſing by <hi>Christ,</hi> and alſo to indicate ſuch <hi>Baptized</hi> Perſons, and recognize or acknowledge them to be Members of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is more excellent and honourable as far as the Chriſtian Diſpenſation excelled the <hi>Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick.</hi> But that they farther argue, that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> cannot reach the Conſcience to cleanſe it from Sin; that therefore it ought not to be practiſed; and becauſe <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Supper</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not nouriſh the Soul; therefore ought it not to be uſed in the <hi>Supper</hi>; they might as well have argued againſt the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>God's</hi> command ſhould not have looked to it when they were poiſoned with the Serpents in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; becauſe there was no inherent Virtue in that piece of Braſs to effect any Cure; and they might argue as well againſt <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s going to waſh in <hi>Jordan</hi> to be cured of his Leproſie. I know none that plead for <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the outward <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> that think there is any inherent Virtue in theſe outward things, either to waſh or feed the Soul; the Virtue is wholly in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Grace, Power, and Spirit doth accompany the due and right uſe of theſe things, as they are practiſed in Faith, and in Obedience to <hi>Christ's</hi> command. And the like way they might argue againſt all vocal Miniſtry which abounds among the <hi>Quakers</hi>; for no words have any inherent Virtue in them to Cure or Cleanſe the Soul, or profit any more than <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; it is only the Grace and Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when it goeth along and accompanieth theſe outward things, whether Words, or thoſe outward Elements, that is effectual, and maketh the uſe of them effectual; without which they are all but as empty Ciſterns that can hold no Water.</p>

               <p>ANother Argument of <hi>W. Penn</hi> againſt the outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Supper</hi> is, <hi>that therefore they are to be rejected now the falſe Church has got them; yea the Whore hath made Merchandize with them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101541:22"/>
and under ſuch Hiſtorical Shadowy and Figurative Christianity, has ſhe managed her Miſtery of Iniquity unto the beguiling thouſands, whoſe ſimplicity the Lord will have a tender regard to.</hi> Anſ. In this way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing alſo he is very inconſiderate, for his Reaſon is of equal force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Scriptures, and all the Doctrinal and Hiſtorical part of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming in the Fleſh, his Death and Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why! the falſe Church has got all this, and makes Merchandize therewith, and therefore the Bible and the whole Hiſtorical and Doctrinal part of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming in the Fleſh, and his Death and Sufferings muſt be rejected; alſo all Preaching, and Praying, and Meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all external Acts of Worſhip muſt be rejected, for the ſame reaſon, becauſe the falſe Church has got them all. Tho' I think it may be ſaid, the falſe Church has not got either <hi>Baptiſme</hi> or the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> in the true Adminiſtration of them; but rather a falſe ſhow and likeneſs of them: But what hinders that the true Church may not Practiſe theſe things aright, tho' the falſe Practiſe them amiſs? Should the abuſe of any thing commanded by God, take away the uſe of it? Muſt Meat, Drink and Cloathing be rejected, becauſe that many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them?</p>
               <p>But he continueth to argue againſt them p. 110. <hi>Reaſon againſt Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Let it be conſidered that no other Apoſtle recommends theſe things, nor <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf to either the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (in his firſt Epiſtle) the <hi>Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians, Theſſalonians, Hebrews,</hi> nor to <hi>Timothy, Titus</hi> and <hi>Philemon. Anſ.</hi> If ſo it were that in none of theſe Epiſtles <hi>Paul</hi> had mentioned them, nor any other of the Apoſtles, which yet is not ſo, for I have anſwered it at large, what was objected from <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. as that <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> is not there meant; and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Galatians, Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and in that to the <hi>Hebrews, Baptiſme</hi> is mentioned, and he hath not proved that it is not <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> that is there meant, yet it will not follow, that therefore they are to be rejected, ſeeing other places of Scripture mention both the command and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, ſo that he cannot inſtance one, profeſſing Chriſtianity, that was not <hi>Baptized,</hi> any where in the Scripture, after the command of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was given by <hi>Christ</hi> to the Apoſtles; ſuppoſe there were but one Text in all the Scripture, that clearly proveth ſome Doctrin of the Chriſtian Faith, were not that enough for its proof? As that one Text, that God is a Spirit is it not ſufficient to prove the truth of it? And we find but one Text of Scripture, and that is in <hi>John</hi> 6. that mentions the eating of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and drinking his <hi>Blood,</hi> in order to eternal Life, is not that one place enough to prove that Truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101541:22"/>Another Argument he uſeth is, p. 110. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit hath troden them under foot ſo long, being part of that outward Court of Religion given to them, which were left out at the meaſuring of the Evangelical Temple of God,</hi> Rev. 11.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was not the outward Court, but the Holy City that the Gentiles did tread under feet: The outward Court indeed, is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that time, was not to be meaſured, but left unmeaſured, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, during the time of the great Apoſtacy. But this argueth, there was an utter Court; the not Meaſuring of it ſeems to ſignifie, that it was ſhort and defective of the juſt Meaſure, that was originally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, as it was in the Apoſtles dayes and for a long time afterwards, until the great Apoſtacy began, at leaſt for the ſpace of three Hundred Years and upwards from our Saviours Reſurrection; But this is ſo far from proving, that outward <hi>Baptſme</hi> and the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> ſuppoſe they were a part of the outward Court, were no Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that it proves they were, for the outward Court was a part of the Temple, under the Law, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that the Church of <hi>God</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was to have that which by way of Analogie anſwered to it, as accordingly it had till the great Apoſtacy came in, that made it to be for a time to be left unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But we find that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Temple, there deſcribed, Chap 42, is deſcribed with its outer Court, and is meaſured; which Temple there deſcribed, it not any material Temple, but the Church of <hi>God</hi> as it ſhall be raiſed up after the Apoſtaſie, which ſhall have her outward Court in its juſt meaſure; and ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> take themſelves to be the Church come out of the Wilderneſs, and got free from the Apoſtaſie, and that <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> belongs to the outer Court, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> will have it; by the ſame, or like Argument, they ought to reſtore the true and due practice of them. But why may not their Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline be reckoned as much belonging to the outer Court, as <hi>Water-Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>? and if ſo, why have they ſet up that, (that is as much outward as <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>) and not the other, which has far leſs ſhow of warrant than the other?</p>

               <p>THE laſt Argument <hi>W. Penn</hi> uſeth, or at leaſt the laſt that I ſhall bring, and I think I have omitted none, either of his, or of <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> that I could find, that ſeem'd to require an Anſwer, <hi>is

taken from</hi> Chriſt's <hi>waſhing his Diſciples Feet, and commanding them to waſh one anothers Feet; and</hi> James <hi>commanding to anoint the Sick with Oyl; and the Apoſtles commanding to abſtain from blood and things ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and that the believers ſold their Poſſeſſions, and had all things common, p.</hi> 111.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Upon a due conſideration of things; this laſt Argument will have as little force as any of the former againſt the <hi>outward Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded the Diſciples to waſh one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Feet, giving them an Example from his own Practice; as it was an Act of great Love and Humility in him ſo to do by his Example, he did enjoyn to his Diſciples to practiſe the like Acts of Love and Humility one to another; ſo that what was here enjoyned the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was not any commemorative Sign of his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but a real Act of Love and Humility which is not tyed or confined to that particular Action that was peculiar to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and an ordinary practice among the People of that Country; for the Country being hot, they uſed Sandals on their Feet, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which, their Feet; who uſed to Travel (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles frequently did) needed waſhing, not only for making them clean, but for refreſhment; and when they came to lodge or ſtay at a place after Travel, it was uſual for Travellers to have Water brought, and their Feet to be waſhed; as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and 19. and what was done to them in bringing Water, and having their Feet waſhed; was a real Act of Love and Kindneſs in them that received them into their Houſes, though they performed not that Office themſelves, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be done by their Servants, which was a ſervile Act, and more uſual to Servants than to Maſters. But if done by the Maſter of the Houſe, or by one that was not a Servant, was an extraordinary Act of Love and Humility; ſo here was nothing in all this of Ceremony, Sign or Figure, but all a real Act and Office of exceſſive Love, and moſt profound Humility in our Bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> towards his Diſciples, and by this exemplary Act of his, he both taught and commanded them to perform both that, and alſo other the like Acts and Offices of Love and Humility towards one another, which they were to do ſimply as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101541:23"/>
Acts of ſingular Virtue after his Example; and not as any Symbolical or Commemorative Sign of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death and Paſſion; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find it numbred among the Virtuous Acts of ancient Chriſtian Widows and Matrons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If ſhe have waſhed the Saints Feet.</hi> And the like was that Cuſtom of giving a Cup of cold Water (or of cold, as the word is beſt Tranſlated) to Travellers, which was a great Act of Kindneſs and Hoſpitality in thoſe hot Countries; but none of theſe Actions, the one of waſhing the Feet, the other of giving a Cup of cold, is any ordinary Act of Friendſhip, Love, or Humility, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away in cold Countries, where there is either no ſuch ordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or uſual Cuſtom: For to do any ſuch thing hereaway, would be rather a Ceremony, than any ſubſtantial Act of either Love or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. But in all caſes, when occaſion is found for one Chriſtian to perform the equivalent Acts of Love and Humility towards another, or others, the Command of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no doubt obligatory. But to make a Ceremony of that which was then no Ceremony, but a ſubſtantial Act of Love and Humility were altogether improper and impertinent. Next, as that in <hi>James,</hi> recommending the Anointing the Sick with Oyl; nor was this commanded to be done as any ſymbolical Act, or commemorative Sign, but as a mean that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had appointed his Diſciples to uſe towards the Sick, when he gave them power of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them miraculouſly, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. The abſtaining from Blood and things ſtrangled, was certainly a part, if not of the Ceremonial Law; yet of the poſitive and Judicial Laws given by the <hi>Jews,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles thought fit to enjoyn to the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> at that time, to prevent the giving of Scandal to the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> who would have taken offence at the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for ſo doing. And that the practice of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from eating Blood, continued among the Chriſtians until <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, is clearly evident, out of his Apology for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; where anſwering that abominable Charge againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they did eat the Blood of Infants, ſhewed that they were ſo far from that, that they did abſtain from the Blood of Beaſts. Now this abſtaining from the Blood of Beaſts, and things ſtrangled, belonging to the poſitive <hi>Judicial</hi> Laws given to the <hi>Jews</hi>; the Apoſtles might, and no doubt did ſee cauſe to enjoyn that Abſtinence to the believing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> for a time, to prevent the Scandal of their Brethren who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But notwithſtanding the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly teach, that whatever was ſold in the Shambles might be eaten; and that nothing was now unclean (provided it be not unwholſome and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101541:24"/>
prejudicial to Health, as ſome things are) for ſaid he, every Creature of God is good, being Sanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer, and to be received with Thankſgiving. And laſtly, as to that of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Community of Goods, it was only practiſed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was a voluntary Act, not enjoyned to them, or any others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not oblige Chriſtians to practiſe it; nor do the <hi>Quakers</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it more than any others. But when it was practiſed, it was not any ſymbolical Act; or commemorative Sign of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and of the ſpiritual Bleſſings that Believers have thereby; ſuch as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> was; and therefore to argue from the ceaſing of that, or any other of the above-mentioned things, their ceaſing is altogether impertinently and groundleſly argued. Before I cloſe this Head of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> I think fit to take ſome notice of this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given by the Son to his Fathers Treating againſt the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Supper, <hi>Baptiſm and the</hi> Lord's <hi>Supper ſubſtantially aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> A Man might as well having writ a Book againſt all outward Teaching and Miniſtry, and againſt all vocal Prayers, and all external Acts of Worſhip, and againſt all outward Meetings of the Bodies of Believers, give it this Title; <hi>True Teaching and Miniſtry, true Prayer and Worſhip, true aſſembling together, ſubſtantially aſſerted</hi>; and all this by throwing aſide all outward Teachings of Men, however ſo well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Gifted and Qualified, and all outward Miniſtry, and all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts of Worſhip and outward Aſſemblies of Perſons, and telling us the true ſubſtantial Teaching and Miniſtry is only inward; the true ſubſtantial Worſhip is inward; and the true ſubſtantial Aſſemblies and Congregations of Believers is only inward in the Heart and Spirit; which manner of dealing, as it would not a little tend to the decay, if not rather the total deſtruction of the inward and ſubſtantial parts of all theſe things; ſo it is againſt the Practice of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who are as much for outward Teaching, and an outward Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry after their own way, and external Acts of Worſhip in outward Meetings and Aſſemblies, and other outward Forms of Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, ſet up by their Leaders, and eſpecially by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> as any other People, divers of which outward Forms ſet up by them, and greatly contended for againſt others of their Brethren, who ſaid, they ſaw no need of them, but thought the inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple abundantly ſufficient without theſe outward things, have leſs ground from Scripture than the practice of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the outward <hi>Supper</hi> have. And if only the ſubſtance of things muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101541:24"/>
and all uſeful and convenient adjuncts and accidents of them rejected and thrown off; then all the <hi>Quakers</hi> (at this odd way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing) may throw away their Cloathing and go naked; pretending they are no ſubſtantial Parts of them, but only accidental; and by the like Reaſoning they may throw away their Eſtates and worldly Goods, as being no ſubſtantial Parts of them as they are Men, or rational Creatures. But what hurt Religion would ſuffer, by throwing off, and laying aſide all outward Teaching, and all outward Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, all ſober and intelligent Perſons, that have the leaſt true ſenſe of Religion, do know. And though the true Chriſtian Religion may conſiſt without theſe External Things of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> as in reſpect of its Eſſentials, and Men and Women may be true Chriſtians without them, and they may be more tollerably wanted at certain occaſions, than outward Teaching, and other External Parts of Religion, as where they cannot be practiſed without great mixtures of Superſtition and Idolatry, as in Popiſh Countries, or other Places where they cannot be duly had and practiſed according to their due In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or where fit and due Adminiſtrators are wanting to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter them; yet all this is no Argument againſt their being divine Inſtitutions, and really ſerviceable to all, who can have the due and right uſe of them; they being proper and uſeful means to preſerve the Chriſtian Doctrin Faith and Religion in the World, as duly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed as uſeful Appendices and Concomitants to the outward Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Preaching of the Word; and it is not to be queſtioned, had the right and due practice of them been continued among Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and a due regard had been preſerved among them, chiefly and primarily to the things ſignified by them, and ſecondarily to the outward Signs, ſo that all poſſible care had been uſed, that <hi>Power and Form</hi> had gone along together, and all ſcandalous and unworthy Perſons plainly known to be ſuch, as well as ignorant Perſons, not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the Eſſentials of Chriſtian Religion had been excluded and debarred from the uſe of them; that the continuance of them in the manner, as above deſcribed, would have been of ſingular uſe to have preſerved the Chriſtian Doctrin, Faith and Religion, ſound and free from the great Corruptions that have crept in to the great Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Adulterating both the Doctrin and Worſhip as it hath been for many Ages paſt among Profeſſors of Chriſtianity; as it hath been already proved, and yet may be further proved againſt them.</p>

               <p>In p. 65 of that Book, they bring in one <hi>Chriſtopher Wade,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Chriſtopher Wade</hi> affirmeth that our bleſſed Saviour doth inſtruct Men to lay faſt hold of, and to abide in ſuch a Faith which confideth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>being without Men</hi> To this they anſwer.</p>

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:101541:25"/>Again, They bring in <hi>C. Wade</hi> (ſee there page 66) ſaying, <hi>C. Wade,</hi> p. 14. hath affirmed that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath bought us, and Redeemed us with the precious Blood of his Humanity; and ſaith, your imagined <hi>Chriſt</hi> being a mere Spirit, never had any Humane Blood to Redeem you with; and to prove it, he brings 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. now ſee their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Haſt thou perverted, as thou haſt done other Scriptures, to thy own deſtruction; for there he witneſſed to the blood of the Lamb, which redeemed them from their vain converſation</hi>; but doth not tell of humane Blood to Redeem them with. For that which is Humane is Earthly; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> whoſe Blood is Spiritual, is <hi>Lord</hi> from Heaven; and he is not an imagined Spirit, but a true Spirit. And what ſay'ſt thou to this? Was that Humane Blood, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>except a man drink he hath no life in him</hi>; and which cleanſed the Saints from all Sin, who were Fleſh of <hi>Christ's</hi> Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone? Note, Any intelligent Reader cannot but know that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Wade</hi> by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Humanity, meant the Blood of the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was born of the Virgin; and by the Humanity, he meant the Manhood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which of late years <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath in Print owned, even the words Humanity of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to this day hath retracted his vile Doctrin in this and other his Books, whereof I have given ſome account in my firſt and ſecond Narrative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Turners-Hall.</hi> Nay, it is below him to retract any Errors that would reflect upon his Infallibility; he is not changed, <hi>as God is the ſame, and Truth is the ſame, ſo the</hi> Quakers <hi>are the ſame,</hi> and by conſequence ſo is <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> the ſame, as <hi>John Pennington</hi> hath affirmed in one of his late Prints.</p>
               <p>Again, In p. 23. of that above mentioned Book, they anſwer a Queſtion thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 43. When you tell us that you have Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; do you mean <hi>Chriſt</hi> whoſe Perſon is now aſcended into Heaven above the Clouds; or do you mean only a <hi>Chriſt</hi> within you?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here thou wouldſt make two <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> a <hi>Chriſt</hi> whoſe Perſon is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Clouds, and a <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, but how proveſt thou two ſuch <hi>Chriſts</hi>? We have Faith in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> that deſcended from the Father, who is the ſame that aſcended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things; and this <hi>Chriſt</hi> we witneſs in us who is not divided. Note, I need not make any Commentary on theſe words; the Man that asked the Queſtion did not in the leaſt inſinuate that there were two <hi>Christ's,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101541:26"/>
but 'tis plain it was <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Senſe; that to own <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Perſon is now Aſcended unto Heaven above the Clouds, and to own <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, is to make two <hi>Chriſts:</hi> But ſeeing there is but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, only (according to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Notion) within, and not a Perſon now Aſcended above the Clouds; it is plain, he doth not own any ſuch Perſon Aſcended into Heaven above the Clouds, nor Faith in any ſuch Perſon; and no wonder that he oppoſe Faith in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Perſon without us, when he oppoſeth the Being of any ſuch Perſon; for the object of Faith being deſtroyed or denyed, the Act of Faith muſt be deſtroyed or denyed alſo; both which we ſee he hath plainly done in this Book; and if in ſome of his latter Books he ſeems to be of a better Faith; yet who can believe him to be ſincere, until he retract and comdemn the vile Errors in this and other of his former Books which have infected thouſands of the poor ignorant People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom he hath led into this Ditch of Unbelief? and yet for danger of looſing his Reputation of Infallibility, and of being ſound from the beginning; he will not do any thing to confeſs his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ignorance and Unbelief, which might be a great means to lead that poor People out of that Ditch, into which he had formerly led them. And how he will anſwer it at the great Day of Judgment for this great Sin and Neglect, to make amendment, ſo as to correct his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer groſs Errors, and labour to undeceive thoſe whom he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived; he has great need to conſider it; and I ſincerely wiſh that a Heart may be given him to do it, and that by true Repentance he may be humbled before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and obtain forgiveneſs. But he hath given us a very late Inſtance that he is not changed real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his falſe Faith and Perſuaſion from what he was when he wrote that Book, near 40 years paſt, which inſtance is this. He hath blamed <hi>G. K.</hi> for undervaluing the Light within, as not ſufficient to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or not ſufficient without ſomething elſe, that is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, Suffering and Dying outwardly for us, as in his late Antidote, Printed 1697. p. 28. compared with p. 27. <hi>ad finem.</hi> Judge Reader, of what little neceſſity or value he makes of the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us, and of his Death and Sufferings, Reſurrection and Interceſſion in Heaven, by this moſt unſound Notion of his, for which he hath got a late Patron and Aſſiſtant, a Clergy Man of the Church of <hi>England</hi> formerly, though not in preſent Office, one that calleth himſelf <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Ely</hi>'s, who hath Printed lately two half Sheets in Vindication of <hi>G.

Title of one of his half Sheets being this; <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s ſaying that the Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be contrary to the Foundation of the Chriſtian Religion. Theſe two half Sheets are printed and ſold by <hi>T. Soule</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> Printer, next door to their Meeting-houſe in <hi>White-heart</hi> Court in <hi>Grace-church-ſtreet,</hi> 1697. By which it appears they are very fond of this Patron to their Cauſe, and particularly that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> is ſo, by the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he gives of him in his late printed Antidote.</p>
               <p>However this may ſeem to ſome an improper Digreſſion; yet if they well conſider the occaſion of it, they will (if Impartial) acknowledge it both proper and convenient.</p>

               <p>AND hereby it may eaſily appear what Spirit hath Acted the firſt Teachers that appeared among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as chiefly <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> to oppoſe ſo keenly and earneſtly the practice of thoſe two Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>; namely, to draw People into a forgetfulneſs of all Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us, as he dyed and roſe again, and is Aſcended into Heaven; for the proper Memorials of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, being rejected and laid aſide as well as the Doctrin it ſelf not only, not Preached but oppoſed, as contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the drift and aim of that Spirit that hath Acted them both againſt the one and the other, is plainly manifeſt, and how its oppoſing the Doctrin of Faith in the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us, is the great cauſe of its oppoſing theſe external Practices which are ſuch proper means, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Doctrine to propagate and preſerve the true Chriſtian Faith in the World. And indeed upon that Hypotheſis, or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid by their principal Teachers, that there is no need of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith in the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without, for Remiſſion of Sin, and eternal Salvation; but the only thing needful is the Light within, as it univerſally enlightenth all Mankind, either to be Preached, or Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as a late Writer againſt them hath well obſerved, theſe outward Practices of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the outward <hi>Supper</hi> are uſeleſs and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Formalities, for they were never appointed to ſignifie Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin, Juſtification, and Salvation, only by obedience to the Light within; excluding the neceſſity of Faith in the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; whoſe alone Obedience unto Death for us, is the only meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſe of the Remiſſion of our Sins, of Juſtification, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101541:27"/>
Salvation; and of all that inward Grace and Virtue of the Holy Spirit whereby we are inwardly Sanctified, and made meet to receive that eternal Inheritance. But though the Spirit that firſt appeared to Act in theſe Men, the firſt Teachers and Leaders of that People, did prove it ſelf to be Antichriſtian, by oppoſing the Memorials of <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us; yet many ſimple and honeſt hearted People knew nothing of this deſign, and however in part leavened with that Spirit in reſpect of its oppoſition to theſe outward Inſtitutions of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>; yet by <hi>God's</hi> great Mercy were preſerved from being prevailed upon by it, to oppoſe the Doctrine and Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Suffered, Dyed, and Roſe again, and is in Heaven, our Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, among whom I can juſtly and uprightly number both <hi>R.B.</hi> and my ſelf; both of us having been preſerved ſound in our Faith, as touching the Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us, however otherwiſe hurt and byaſſed by them, in relation to theſe two outward Inſtitutions of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>; and my Charity leads me to believe that, if <hi>R.B.</hi> had lived in the Body to this day, to ſee the ill effects that his Writing againſt theſe Divine Inſtitutions have had, and the bold oppoſition that many have of late, more than formerly made to the neceſſity of the Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, and the Preaching of it even here in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, ſince the Queſtion hath been more diſtinctly ſtated betwixt my Oppoſers and me, touching the neceſſity of the Faith aſſerted by me, and oppoſed by them, he would have plainly ſeen and readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Error in Writing againſt theſe Divine Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>There is yet another of their Teachers, who is of late years become a Perſon of no ſmall Note among the Quakers, <hi>viz. John Gratton,</hi> whom I cannot well paſs without obſerving his Ignorant and Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate way of Arguing againſt theſe Divine Inſtitutions, eſpecially as touching one of his main Arguments he hath framed from a moſt falſe and perverſe Underſtanding of that place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Therefore leaving the Principles of the Doctrin of Christ, let us go on to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; where in his Book called <hi>John Baptiſt decreaſing,</hi> Printed many years ago, and Re-printed in the year 1696, he layeth the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Argument againſt <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> upon the word in that place LEAVING, which he hath cauſed to be Printed more than once in his Book in Capital Letters (for a Monument it will be of his groſs Ignorance, and yet bold Preſumption thus to pervert the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) from thence inferring that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is to be left off and laid aſide; for thus be argues, p. 47. of the laſt Edition, 1697. If they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101541:27"/>
had been commanded by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have been uſed to the Worlds end; then why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> for ſo I call that Author) have been ſo earneſt at that day, which was ſoon after <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Aſcenſion, to have had them then <hi>to leave them,</hi> and to go on to a more Manful, Powerful, perfect State? Anſ. At this rate of Arguing, not only <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> but the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Holy Spirit is alſo to be left; for the Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Doctrin of <hi>Baptiſms</hi> in the Plural Number; which <hi>John Gratton</hi> moſt unfairly and falſly quotes in the Singular; <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for <hi>Baptiſms:</hi> Alſo by the ſame Argument, <hi>Repentance from dead works and faith towards God, the reſurrection of the dead and eternal judgment,</hi> are all to be left off from being Preached or Believed: But the true Senſe is obvious, of the word leaving, <hi>i.e.</hi> not to Treat, or Write upon theſe firſt Principles further at preſent, but to Treat of other things; as when a Man hath laid the Foundation of a Houſe, he goeth on to Build a Superſtructure upon it.</p>
               <p>And as Ignorant and Impertinent doth he diſcover himſelf to be in his other Treatiſe (preceeding the other) of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>; where from the Word <hi>Elements,</hi> uſed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3, 9. he concludes that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is one of theſe beggerly Elements <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed; becauſe <hi>Water</hi> is an Element; and after this rate divers others of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have Argued; but the Word Tranſlated Elements there, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3, 9. hath no relation to the <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> nor to the Element of <hi>Water</hi>; but to Principles and Doctrins of the <hi>Jews,</hi> relating to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies; the <hi>Greek</hi> Word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is applyed no leſs to the Principles of the Chriſtian Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Oracles of <hi>God</hi>; which therefore by his Argument, being Elements, are to be thrown aſide. As for his other Arguments in thoſe two Treatiſes againſt the outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>; they are no other that I can find, but ſuch as are above mentioned in my Reply to thoſe of <hi>William Penn,</hi> and <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> and therefore one Anſwer will ſerve both to them and him.</p>

               <p>THus having finiſhed my Examination, and Refutation of the Arguments of the above mentioned Perſons againſt <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and the outward <hi>Supper</hi> in general, I think fit to bring to the like Examination, what <hi>R.B.</hi> hath more particularly Argued againſt the outward <hi>Supper</hi>; as being not any longer to continue, but until <hi>Chriſt's</hi> inward coming, to ariſe in their Hearts, and give a plain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Chapter, or Head, wherein he diſcourſeth concerning the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> although he ſaith truly, that the Communion (<hi>i.e.</hi>) the Participation thereof is inward and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; yet he was under a great miſtake, to affirm that the ſaid Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereof true Believers do participate, is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which he afterwards explains to be that Light and Seed in every Man; as he expreſſeth plainly in ſeveral places, as p. 61, of the above ſaid Treatiſe, and p. 65, where he ſaith—and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> underſtands the ſame things here, (<hi>viz. John</hi> 6.) by his Body, Fleſh, and Blood, which is underſtood, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>by the light hath enlighteneth every man, and the life,</hi> &amp;c. And p. 77. he chargeth it to be an Error to make the Communion, or Participation of the Body, Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to relate to that outward Body, Veſſel, or Temple that was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and walked and Suffered in <hi>Judea,</hi> whereas it ſhould relate to the Spiritual Body, Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Celeſtial Light and Life, which was the Food and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Regenerate in all Ages, as we have (ſaid he) already proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this he was in a great Error, to make the Eating, or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Fleſh and Blood to have no relation to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body of Fleſh and Blood that was Born of the Virgin, and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Death for our Sins on the Tree of the Croſs. For the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers, and Juſtification, with all the Spiritual Bleſſings of Life and Light, and inward Divine Virtue and Might, wherewith
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101541:28"/>
they are inwardly Refreſhed and Nouriſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath a moſt near and immediate Relation to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> outward Body and Blood, and to his coming in that outward Body; becauſe that moſt Holy and Perfect Obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which he performed in that Body, and became Obedient to the Death of the Croſs, was and is the procuring and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of all that inward Grace, Virtue, Light and Life, whereby Regeneration was wrought in any, in any Age of the World, either before or ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> came in the Fleſh, as well as it was and is the procuring and meritorious Cauſe of their Juſtification, and the Remiſſion of their Sins. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died as well for the Sins of thoſe who lived in the Ages before he came in the Fleſh, as ſince, and they had the ſame Benefits by his Death, and by his Body and Blood, that we have; the ſame inward Grace and Light to Regenerate them, as the ſame Mercy and Favour to Juſtifie them, and give them the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Sins, which they received through Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he was to come in the Fleſh without them; and whole <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Food of true Believers; I mean <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only conſidered as the Word ſimply, but as the Word made Fleſh. And having taken or aſſumed the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the true Nature of Man into ſuch a high Union, as that the Godhead of the Word, and the Manhood aſſumed thereby is but one <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and as ſuch is the Food of all true Believers, both as he outwardly came in the Fleſh, and as he is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come the Light and the Life in them; and Believers Eating of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is their Believing in him, and by their Faith being United to him, and he to them; ſo that he dwells in them, and they in him. And though it may be owned, that Believers Feeding upon <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Light and Life, Metaphorically and Allegorically ſpeaking, that Light and Life may be called according to Scripture, Meat and Drink, and Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it hath many other ſuch Metaphorical Names; ſuch as, Milk, Honey, Wine, Marrow and Fatneſs, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which Names are given, becauſe of Men's Weakneſs; and that they have not proper Words to expreſs Divine Things by; yet that ought not to make us reject and lay aſide <hi>Chriſt's</hi> outward Body of Fleſh and Blood from having any Relation to the Saints feeding upon him. Nor do the Arguments brought by <hi>R.B.</hi> here, prove in the leaſt what he intends, as the following Examination of them will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently (I hope) manifeſt. He begins with a Quotation out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> in his Tractat, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 98. <hi>The words which I ſpeak unto you are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life, underſtand ſpiritually what I have ſpoken; ye ſhall not eat of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101541:29"/>
this body which ye ſee, and drink this blood which they ſhall ſpill that ſhall crucifie me. I am the living bread which have deſcended from heaven; he called himſelf the bread which deſcended from heaven, exhorting that they might believe in him,</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. It is evident from theſe laſt Words; that by <hi>Eating, Auguſtine</hi> meant in one Senſe Corporal <hi>Eating,</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſe Believing as elſewhere <hi>Tract.</hi> 25. <hi>ad cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Johan. Hoc est opus Dei,</hi> ut quid paras dentem &amp; ventrem? crede &amp; manducaſti: Credere enim in eum, hoceſt, comedere panem &amp; vinum, qui credit in eum man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat eum; in <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus, <hi>why prepareſt thou thy Teeth and Belly? believe and thou haſt eat; for to believe in him is to eat the Bread and Wine; who believeth in him eateth him.</hi> Both theſe Quotations are good againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi>; who hold that Believers eat the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Corporally with their Mouths; but ſay nothing againſt this Spiritual Way of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body, but plainly confirm it: The plain Senſe therefore of <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Words, Quoted by <hi>R.B.</hi> is this; <hi>Ye ſhall not eat Corporally with the outward Mouth, the Body of Chriſt which ye ſee, but ye ſhall eat it Spiritually, that is, believe with a ſincere Faith, which the Spirit of God worketh in you; that Chriſt ſhall give his Body that ye ſee (ſpeaking then to the</hi> Jews) <hi>to be broken for you, and his Blood, even the Blood of that Body to be ſhed for you.</hi> And in ſo Believing ye ſhall eat my Body, and drink my Blood, that is, ye ſhall be united to me, and I to you, that I ſhall abide in you, and ye ſhall abide in me; which Senſe doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently agree with our Saviour's Words, <hi>John</hi> 6.29, 47. And indeed to Exclude Chriſt's outward Body of Fleſh and Blood, from having any Relation to this place of Scripture, as no way concerned in the Senſe of theſe Words of it, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. is plainly to Exclude <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he outwardly came in that outward Body, from being the Object of our Chriſtian Faith; for ſeeing Eating here ſignifieth Believing by <hi>Agustine</hi>'s Quotation, approved by <hi>R.B.</hi> if this Spiritual Eating, which is our Believing, reſpects not the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was outwardly Slain; then <hi>Christ</hi> as he came and Suffered in that Body, is no Object of the Chriſtian Faith, which is moſt abſurb; and none that is in the leaſt acquainted with <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Writings, can ſay it ever was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to deny the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> that was outwardly Slain, to be any wiſe Concerned in the Chriſtian Faith; for <hi>Augustine</hi> was a moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Aſſerter of the Neceſſity of Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he came in that Body, in order to our Salvation, againſt the Hereſie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> who denied it, and Writ many Books againſt that Hereſie, now Revived by many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Teachers; tho what <hi>R.B.</hi> hath Writ here, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101541:29"/>
to his Inadvertency, and do not charge him with the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie for the ſame, becauſe from other Places of his Writings, I can prove that he made the Faith of <hi>Christ's</hi> giving his Body to be Slain for us, neceſſary to our Salvation, and a part of the Chriſtian Belief.</p>

               <p>AND as Inadvertent and Miſtaken as <hi>R.B.</hi> was in his Quotation of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Fleſh and Blood; no leſs hath <hi>W. Penn</hi> been, [p. 314. <hi>of his Rejoynder to</hi> J. F.] in his Quotation of Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> in his Sermon upon <hi>Joſ.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. Who ſpeaking of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Wilderneſs, ſays thus: <hi>Chriſt had not yet taken upon him a Natural Body, yet they did eat his Body; he had not yet ſhed his Blood, yet they drank his Blood? St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, all did eat the ſame Spiritual Meat; that is, the Body of Chriſt, all did drink of the ſame Spiritual Drink, that is, the Blood of Chriſt; and that as truly as we do now.</hi> And whoſoever did then ſo Eat, lived for ever, I think (ſaith <hi>W.

Jewel</hi> meant only the Light within in theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> and by his Body and Blood only, that Light within, or Seed or Principle, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> would have it. All that are in the leaſt acquainted with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which <hi>B. Jewel</hi> was a Zealous Defender, as in his Apologie for the ſame appeareth, or with <hi>B. Jewel</hi>'s Writings, know well that the Senſe which <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath here put on <hi>B. Jewel</hi>'s Words, never came into his Remoteſt Thoughts; but it is no wonder that he ſhould ſo miſunderſtand and miſconſtrue <hi>B. Jewel</hi>'s Words, when he doth ſo uſe the Scriptures themſelves. <hi>B. Jewel</hi>'s Senſe is Obvious; <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not taken upon him a Natural Body, yet they did Eat his Body, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith, believing that in the time appointed of <hi>God,</hi> he would take a Body, and give up that Body to be Slain for their Sins; he had not yet ſhed his Blood, yet they drank his Blood, <hi>viz. By faith believing, that after he ſhould take fleſh and blood in the fulneſs of time, he would give his blood to be ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſins; and by this faith all the faithful among them had Chriſt dwelling in them by his ſpirit; and did know and witneſs his ſpirit to regenerate and ſanctifie them, to quicken and refreſh them, and nouriſh them, as meat and drink doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and nouriſh the body of man.</hi> As for his Quotations out of <hi>Joſhua Sprig,</hi> and others; its no wonder he doth ſo Magnifie them, ſeeing

its but too evident the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſucked that Poiſonous Milk out of the Breaſts of ſuch Men who have been in the ſame Errors before them. But to return to <hi>R.B.</hi> his Arguments, whereby he laboureth, but to no purpoſe, to prove that the Fleſh there mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. &amp;c. hath no Relation to his outward Fleſh. Firſt, ſaith he, (p. 63) <hi>becauſe that it is ſaid, both that it came down from Heaven; yea that it is he that came down from Heaven.</hi> Now all Chriſtians at preſent, generally acknowledge that the outward Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not down from Heaven; neither was it that part of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which came down from Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By Himſelf that came down from Heaven, who is called by <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> from Heaven, Heavenly, the quickning Spirit, cannot be meant the inward Principle of Light in Men, abſtractly conſidered from the Fountain of it, which dwelt in the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but chiefly the Light as in him; and conſequentially that which Men receive out of his Fulneſs, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meaſures: And as our Regeneration and Salvation have a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Dependance on that fulneſs of Light, Life and Grace that dwells in him, out of which we receive our ſeveral Meaſures; ſo they have a neceſſary reſpect to the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both Soul and Body, in which that Fulneſs dwelleth; becauſe the Soul and Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (even his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible Body) was concerned in that great Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in what he did and Suffered for us. Therefore <hi>God</hi> hath Exalted the ſame Man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> both in Soul and Body, in Unity with his Godhead, to be a Prince and Saviour to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sin, Grace and Glory, and all Spiritual Bleſſings to all that ſhall be ſaved. This, ancient Writers have explained by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a red hot Iron exceedingly burning and ſhining; the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> in the ſame anſwering to the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and the <hi>Iron</hi> anſwering to the <hi>Manhood.</hi> Now when this fired Iron burns, or lightens any Stick of Wood that is applied to it; it is not the Fire only without the Iron, nor the Iron only without the Fire; but both joyntly that have an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the Wood to Kindle and Lighten it; even ſo, it is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Unity with his Manhood (conſiſting of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,) that wrought that outward Redemption for us, and doth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce in us the bleſſed Effects of it by his Spirit, in Renewing and Sanctifying us, Juſtifying us, and giving us Eternal Life and Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>Chriſt's</hi> outward Body of Fleſh was Miraculouſly Conceived by the Power of the moſt High, and in that reſpect had a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101541:30"/>
Heavenly Original, as well as that it was really the Woman's Seed, and part of the Virgins Subſtance; therefore it may be ſaid to be from Heaven, and to be Heavenly as well as Earthly, as Wheat and Barly, and other Grains that Grow in <hi>America,</hi> which come Originally from <hi>England,</hi> are called <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grain, even in <hi>America,</hi> though they are alſo <hi>American</hi> Grain, being produced out of the Soil of <hi>American</hi> Earth. Secondly, ſaith he, p. 63. and to put the Matter out of doubt, when the Carnal <hi>Jews</hi> would have been ſo underſtanding it, he tells them plainly, <hi>v.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Anſ. Nor doth this prove his Aſſertion; the Error of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Jews</hi> was, that they ſuppoſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> meant they were to eat his Body Corporally with their Bodily Mouth; but if they had underſtood that he meant not a Corporal Eating, but a Spiritual and Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, they had not erred in ſo thinking; his Quotation approved by him out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> proves that by eating here, <hi>Chriſt</hi> meant believing in him, as he was to Dye for the Sins of the World, and as he was to give his Body to be broken for them, and his Blood to be ſhed for the Remiſſion of the Sins of all that ſhould believe in him, and for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Eternal Life to them both in Soul and Body. Thirdly, (Saith he) p. 63.64.) <hi>This is alſo founded upon moſt ſound and ſolid Reaſon; becauſe that it is the Soul, not the Body that is to be Nouriſhed by this Fleſh and Blood; now outward Fleſh cannot Nouriſh nor Feed the Soul; there is no Proportion nor Analogy betwixt them; neither is the Communion of the Saints with</hi> God, <hi>by a Conjunction and mutual Participation of Fleſh, but of the Spirit; he that is joyned to the</hi> Lord, <hi>is one Spirit, not one Fleſh; for the Fleſh (I mean outward Fleſh, even ſuch as was that wherein</hi> Chriſt <hi>lived and walked, when upon Earth; and not Fleſh, when tranſpoſed by a Metaphor, to be understood Spiritually) can only partake of Fleſh, as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Spirit; as the Body cannot Feed upon Spirit, neither can the Spirit Feed upon Fleſh.</hi> Anſ. Here alſo he Argueth very Weakly and Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly; that which deceived him, and occaſioned his great Miſtake, which he embraced as a ſolid Reaſon; was by Arguing from the ſtrict literal Senſe of Nouriſhing and Feeding, to the Metaphorical and Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; which all true Logicians, and Maſters of ſolid Reaſon will ſay is unlawful; as alſo to Argue from the <hi>natural Feeding</hi> or <hi>Nouriſhing</hi> to the <hi>Spiritual.</hi> To his Argument then I anſwer; outward Fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Feed the Soul Naturally, I grant; Spiritually and Metaphorically, I deny; now the Eating, Feeding, and Nouriſhing meant, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. is not Natural, but Spiritual and Metaphorical; the Word Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101541:31"/>
ſignifieth Believing. And whereas he ſpeaketh of the Feeding of the Spirit, or Soul of Man, that it cannot be the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that can Feed it, but the Spirit, ſo as to be its Food; by Food here we muſt underſtand it Metaphorically, even as <hi>R.B.</hi> hath confeſſed; that the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not properly, but Metaphorically called Fleſh. So the Souls of Believers Feeding upon the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is alſo Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical; for if by the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> he meant the Godhead; how can the Godhead, which is an <hi>Infinite Being</hi> in all reſpects be the Food f the Soul or Spirit of Man that is Finite, ſtrictly or literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood without a Metaphor? much more may I uſe his Argument againſt his own Aſſertion; there is leſs Proportion or Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie betwixt the Infinite Creator, and the Soul that is a Finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than is betwixt the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Soul. Beſides, if we argue from the ſtrict and literal Nicety of the Words <hi>Food, Feed,</hi> and <hi>Nouriſhment</hi>; that which is the Food and Nouriſhment of a Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a part of its very Subſtance and Being; ſhall any therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that becauſe <hi>God</hi> is the Food and Nouriſhment of the Souls of the Saints; that therefore he becomes a part of their Souls? We know <hi>George Fox</hi> was blamed for ſaying the Soul was a part of <hi>God,</hi> or of the Divine Eſſence; ſurely it is as juſtly blame-worthy for any to ſay that <hi>God</hi> is a part of the Soul; therefore when <hi>God</hi> or his Spirit is ſaid to be the Souls Food, it is not to be underſtood Strictly and Literally, but Metaphorically and Figuratively; as when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, my Soul thirſteth after <hi>God.</hi> But if it be ſaid, that not the <hi>Godhead,</hi> but that which <hi>R.B.</hi> calleth the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> is the moſt proper and immediate Food of the Souls of Believers, as a certain Divine Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or Efflux; nor can that Strictly and Literally, without a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor be called the Souls Food; for that Divine <hi>Emanation,</hi> or <hi>Efflux,</hi> doth not become any part of the Souls Subſtance, but is more Noble than the Soul, of any Saint, upon the Hypotheſis; that there is ſuch a thing, (which to diſpute, is forrain to the preſent Queſtion) for the Soul of Man in its own Nature is capable of Sin, and ſinful Defilements, which this Divine Seed, or Principle in the Soul is not; therefore it can never be Convertible into the Souls Subſtance. The Feeding of the Soul, therefore in whatever Senſe we take it is Metaphorical, and not to be meaſured or determined by the Feeding of the Body, yet beareth ſome Analogy or Similitude thereunto, as all Metaphors do to the things, from which they are transferred; for as what Feeds the Body, doth Refreſh and Comfort it, maketh it Lively and Vigorous,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101541:31"/>
Fat and Beautiful, and doth ſtrengthen it, and is united with it; So the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Divine Influences in the Souls of Believers have the like Effects in them, they do wonderfully Refreſh and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them (and that moſt ſenſibly) make them Lively and Vigorous, Fat and Beautiful, and do mightily ſtrengthen them, and make them Fruitful in Divine Virtues and Fruits, and are United with the Soul.</p>

            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <p>BUT there are two other things that need Correction, in theſe foregoing Words of <hi>R.B.</hi> the firſt is, that he ſaith it is the Soul, not the Body that is to be Nouriſhed by this Fleſh and Blood; this is a great Miſtake; though the Bodies of the Saints are not to be Nouriſhed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as with natural Food that is Corruptible; yet ſeeing it is by him that the Bodies of the Saints ſhall be raiſed up at the Reſurrection of the Dead to partake of Life Everlaſting; therefore he is truly ſaid to be that Food that Periſheth not, that Feedeth both the Souls and Bodies of the Saints to Life Everlaſting; and though their Bodies Dye, yet becauſe by the Power of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection (as his Body was Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Dead, ſo on the account of his Reſurrection) their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be Raiſed to Eternal Life. Therefore their Bodies as well as their Souls are truly ſaid to be Nouriſhed by him. The ſecond is that he ſaith, <hi>neither is the Communion of the Saints with</hi> God <hi>by a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and mutual Participation of Fleſh, but of the Spirit; he that is joyned to the</hi> Lord <hi>is one Spirit, not one Fleſh.</hi> Anſ. The Communion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the Saints with <hi>God,</hi> is not by any natural Conjunction, or Union of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body that was outwardly Slain with the Saints, yet a Myſtical and Relative Union there is, as really, or rather more really, as is betwixt the Husband and the Wife, who are ſaid to be one Fleſh. This is a great Myſtery, ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> but I ſpeak concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Church; who according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, as they are one Spirit, ſo they are one Fleſh: And as elſewhere he ſaid, we are of his Fleſh, and of his Bone; and foraſmuch as the Children were partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he took part of the ſame; wherefore he is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to call them Brethren. Now in this <hi>R.B.</hi> was in a great Error; that by his thus excluding the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> outward Body from being any means of the Saints Communion with <hi>God,</hi> he excludes the ſaid Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from being any neceſſary part of the Mediator; and at this rate of his Arguing, only the Divine Light or Seed in Men is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101541:32"/>
Mediator betwixt <hi>God</hi> and Men; but according to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> the Mediator of <hi>God</hi> and Men (who is one) is the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and by the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is underſtood in Scripture, not the Spirit only, nor the Soul of his Manhood only, but the Body alſo, together with the Soul, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> made of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Fleſh: And as really as there is a Relative Union betwixt Brethren, and near Kindred with reſpect to their Fleſh and Blood; on which account it is ſaid, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 37.27. <hi>He is our Brother and our Fleſh,</hi> and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>The Tribes of Iſrael ſaid unto David, behold we are thy Bone and thy Fleſh:</hi> So believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as believing <hi>Jews</hi> may ſay concerning the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi>; of whom, to wit <hi>Eve,</hi> we are all deſcended, <hi>we are his Bone and Fleſh</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath taken Fleſh and Blood like unto us, therefore in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect, he is compleatly qualified and fitted to be our Mediator, and High Prieſt with <hi>God,</hi> by whom (becauſe of the true Nature of Man, conſiſting of a true reaſonable Soul, and true and real Body of Man, which the Eternal Word is united unto) we have Communion with <hi>God.</hi> His fourth and laſt Argument hath the like Defect with the former. That which Feedeth upon it ſhall never Dye, but the Bodies of all Men once Dye. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Men are ſaid in Scripture to Dye; though the Soul Dyeth not, yet Men are ſaid to Dye, becauſe the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Union of the Soul with the Body is Diſſolved; which being but for a Time, and that a very ſmall Time, as a Moment, in reſpect of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and after that their Bodies ſhall be raiſed up again, and Vitally be United to their Souls; therefore by the contrary Argument, by the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the Saints Feed upon, muſt be meant in part his outward Body of Fleſh, now Glorified, which is a Glorious Spiritual Body; becauſe the Reſurrection of <hi>Christ's</hi> Body, is the Ground of the Saints Hope wrought in them by the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> that their Bodies ſhall be raiſed up, and ſhall together with their Souls inherit Eternal Life. And to conclude this whole Matter; when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, it is the Spirit that Quickneth, the Fleſh profits nothing. His meaning is, that according to their Carnal and Fleſhly Senſe; it doth not profit; as if he had ſaid, it would profit you nothing to Eat my Fleſh, as ye imagin by the Bodily Mouth, but to Eat it Spiritually, and by Faith, this doth profit; but to take the Words, the Fleſh profits nothing in the Senſe that ſome take them, is moſt Blaſphemous; as to ſay, <hi>Christ's</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body of Fleſh profits nothing to our Salvation; for this would make his Coming and Death for us in the Fleſh to have been in vain; and alſo would render our Faith Vain, that he did ſo come; yea, ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101541:32"/>
neceſſary was <hi>Christ's</hi> coming in the Fleſh for our Salvation; that it is by his Fleſh and Soul, Conſtituting his Manhood, that we have his Spirit; the Man <hi>Christ</hi> is that Olive Tree (conſiſting of Soul and Body, United Perſonally to the Godhead of the Eternal Word) which giveth us the Oyl of the Holy Spirit, and poureth it into our Hearts; and as in the Natural Olive Tree, it is by its Body that we have of its Oyl, or Spirit; and when we Eat of its Oyl, we are ſaid to Eat of the Tree; becauſe the Tree yields us its Oyl; even as when we Eat of an Apple, or Drink the Fruit of it, or of the Vine; we may be ſaid to Eat of the Apple-Tree and Vine-Tree; the Fruit being what the Tree naturally yields; ſo the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> conſiſting of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is that Precious Olive Tree, and Vine-Tree, that yields us the Oyl and Wine of the Holy Spirit, and pours it into our Hearts who Believe in him, and Love him, and as Effectual as his Soul and Fleſh of his Manhood is now to Believers for their receiving the Spirit by the ſame, ſince he came in the Fleſh, no leſs Effectual it was to Believers before he came in the Fleſh, even from the beginning of the World, according to <hi>B. Jewel</hi>'s Words, he was not come in the Fleſh, yet they Eat his <hi>Fleſh</hi>; to wit, by <hi>Faith</hi>; he had not Shed his Blood, yet they Drank his Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith; and both his Fleſh and his Blood, before it had any viſible Being, or Exiſtence, together with his Soul was Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to Believers in all Ages, for their Reception of the Spirit, and all Spiritual Bleſſings of Juſtification, and Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well before he came in the Fleſh as ſince: And thus he was the Lamb Slain from the Foundation of the World, whoſe Death was of the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy from the beginning, and will be to the end of the World, to all that believe in him. And as <hi>God</hi> is the giver of the Spirit, and of all the Graces of the Spirit; ſo he giveth it to Believers by and through <hi>Christ,</hi> even the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is both the Procurer, and Diſpenſer of all that Grace that <hi>God</hi> giveth unto them; and though Men moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Eat the Meat, and Drink the Drink that is bought with Money; yet in ordinary Speech, by a common Metonymy, they are ſaid to Eat and Drink the Money that buyeth it; as the Poor Widows two Mites were called her Living; ſo after ſome ſort, though the inward Life and Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be the moſt immediate Food of the Souls of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; Yet becauſe the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it was broken for us, and his Blood as it was Shed for us, is the Price and Purchaſe Money which hath procured to us the inward Life and Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Graces and Gifts thereof; therefore we are ſaid, to Eat his Fleſh,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101541:33"/>
and Drink his Blood, by the Like Metonymy. But there is much more in this Great Myſtery, than can be demonſtrated by theſe Similitudes and Examples, or any others of the like Nature.</p>

But it was a great Miſtake in him, and too raſhly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in general by him, upon both Papiſts and Proteſtants, their being guilty of that Error. For it can be ſhewn, that ſome of the Popiſh Writers have affirmed the contrary, and delivered it as the common Faith of their Church; that true Believers partake of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Fleſh and Blood, although they Dye before they receive the outward <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>; for which Lombard, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 9. citeth <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lib. de med. paen. Nulli ambigendum eſt,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>No man ought to doubt that any Man is then a partaker of the Body and Blood of the <hi>Lord,</hi> when he is made a Member of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; nor is he Alienated from the Communion of that Bread and Cup, although before he Eat that Bread, and Drink the Cup; being Conſtituted in the Unity of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he depart out of this World; for he is not deprived of the benefit of that Sacrament, when he is found to have that which that Sacrament ſignifieth.</q>
And as for the generality of Proteſtants, I know not, nor ever knew any that ſo tyed the Participation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body to the outward <hi>Supper,</hi> as he mentioneth. They ſay indeed, it is a Means of Grace, and of our Communion of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Body; but not the only means, or ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as without it, none have that Communion.</p>
               <p>Another great Miſtake I find in <hi>R.B.</hi> p. 81. of that Treatiſe, where he ſaith; as for the Paſchal Lamb, the whole end of it is ſignified par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.8.9. to wit, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might thereby be kept in remembrance of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Anſ. That is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101541:33"/>
mentioned as an end of it, but not the whole end of it; for the end of the whole Law was <hi>Chriſt</hi>; whereof that Command of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was a part; but that the Paſſover was a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as he was to be Slain for their Sins; is plain, out of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Let us keep the feaſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for our paſſover is ſlain for us.</hi> Now as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to Eat the Fleſh of the Paſſover; ſo the Believers in <hi>Chriſt</hi> are to Eat his Fleſh; even that Fleſh that was Slain; to wit, by Faith, as is above declared; but not by any Corporal Eating; and why did <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt apply theſe Words of the Paſſover to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body; <hi>a bone of him ſhall not be broken?</hi> This plainly proveth that the Paſſover was a Type of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and therefore one great end of it, was to hold him forth to their Faith.</p>
               <p>In p. 87. <hi>R.B.</hi> ſaith, let it be obſerved, that the very expreſs and particular uſe of it, according to the Apoſtle, is to ſhew forth the <hi>Lord's</hi> Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to ſhew forth the <hi>Lord's</hi> Death, and partake of the Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are different things; from whence he infers, as his following Words ſhew that this Practice of the outward <hi>Supper,</hi> hath no inward or immediate Relation to Believers, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, or Partaking of the Spiritual Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; or that Spiritual <hi>Supper,</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Conſequence doth not follow, that Practice of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Supper,</hi> had not only that end, to Commemorate and ſhew forth the <hi>Lord's</hi> Death, but had other great ends alſo; as another was to ſignifie their Communion of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body, as not a bare Sign, but as a means of that Communion; though not the only means, or ſuch a means, as if the ſaid Communion were tyed thereto; another end was to ſignifie their Union and Communion one with another; both which ends are plainly held forth in theſe Words; <hi>The bread which we break is it not the Communion of the Lord's Body</hi>; &amp;c. <hi>and we being many, are one bread, and all are made partakers of that one bread.</hi> And though <hi>R.B.</hi> denyeth that by Bread in thoſe Words, <hi>the bread which we break is it not the communion of the Lord's body</hi>; is to be underſtood the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bread; yet I have above proved it to be the outward Bread that was uſed in the <hi>Supper</hi>; for to underſtand it of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Body, were to make it Non-ſenſe; as to ſay the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Body? Whereas the true Senſe is Obvious, taking it for the outward Bread. The Bread which we break, is it not a Sign of the Communion of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuch a Sign that is a means, whereby our Communion of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Body, and of the Spiritual

Wicked Perſons, though in Fact they may receive the outward Part, yet they have no Right to it.

Beſides in this he palpably runs into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to what he had ſaid a little before, in p. 83. For there he will not have the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be the Table of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and Cup of the <hi>Lord</hi>; becauſe wicked Men cannot partake of the Table of the <hi>Lord</hi>; and yet now here he grants they may, and thereby Eat and Drink Damnation. And as jejune and ſtrained, as well as falſe is the Gloſs he puts on theſe Words, <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, and is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord</hi>; as if they ſignified no more than what theſe Words import, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth is damned, if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith</hi>; which had only a Relation to Meats that might lawfully be Eaten; but if he that did Eat them, did think them forbidden, he Sinned, and ſo was Condemn'd in his own Conſcience. For the Word <hi>Damned and Damnation,</hi> in both places do not ſignifie any Final Sentence of Damnation; but only both being Sins, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the Guilt of Judgment, or Condemnation.

ſome Publick way of ſhewing it forth in Religious Meetings, that proveth it was not Mens private Eatings, which may oft happen when they are alone; and for this, and the like Reaſons, ſome of the Antients, and particularly <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> called it <hi>Verbum viſibile,</hi> the viſible Word; which when joyned with the Word that is founded in Mens Ears, has a double force upon the Minds of devout Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: To which doth well agree that ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his Homilies on <hi>Matthew,</hi> cited in the Title Page, <hi>If thou hadſt been without a Body, God had given thee naked and incorporeal Gifts; but becauſe the Soul is planted in a Body, he giveth thee Intelligible things in Senſible things.</hi> And it was well obſerved by the Antients, that all obſignatory Signs, have ſome words of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to make them effectual, according to which <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Accedat verbum ad rem, &amp; fit Sacramentum,</hi> i.e. <hi>let the word be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the ſign, and it becomes a Sacrament</hi>; and therefore we find in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. the waſhing of Water joyned with the Word—<hi>That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> I know ſome will have the Water here to be meant, the inward Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Word to be inward alſo; but ſuch a Senſe would be not only ſtrained, but unintelligible, as to ſay with the waſhing of the Word by the Word, for they make the inward Water and Word to be the ſame thing here; but the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth them as two things, both which have the Efficacy by the inward working of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That <hi>as often,</hi> together with the foregoing words, import a Command, I have already proved, and it was raſhly ſaid in him, that he had ſhewn the contrary, and that they will never be able to prove it. And whereas ſome argue, had it been a Command, ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times would have been mentioned, how oft in a Week, Month, or Year it ſhould have been Practiſed. To this it is Anſwered; that it followeth not more than to argue that, becauſe it is not mentioned how often in a Week, Month, or Year, Publick Prayer is to be uſed; that therefore they are not Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; for as Publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer is to be uſed as frequently as can ſtand with the Ability and Conditions of both Preachers and Hearers; ſo this Practice as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is to be uſed; which, as the time of thoſe, is to be left to the Diſcretion of the Perſons, as <hi>God</hi> ſhall inwardly Guide them, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly afford them the Convenience; ſo is the Time of this to be left to the like Diſcretion, Guidance, and Convenience; which as it ſeemed to be the Practice of the Church in the Days of the Apoſtles; each Lord's-day, being the firſt Day of the Week, ſo it is clear from <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and other ancient Writers; that it was the conſtant Practice of the Chriſtians, Solemnly to Celebrate the ſame every Lord's-day; beſides what other times they might have done it.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, which he calls together with the other, the chief thing in Controverſie, it is indeed ſo, even the chief thing; and therefore if this be effectually proved againſt them, that thoſe Words, <hi>until he come again,</hi> are underſtood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s laſt outward coming, the Cauſe is gained. But firſt, let us examine what Proof he brings, that they are not to be underſtood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s laſt outward coming. Firſt, he ſaith, the Apoſtle might well underſtand it of his inward coming and appearance; but what Proof doth he give of this? None at all, but his ſimple Affirmation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He ſaith, theſe Weak and Carnal <hi>Corinthians</hi> might be permitted the uſe of this, to ſhew forth, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death till he ſhould ariſe in them. But what Proof gives he of this, that this was, or might be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? for no ſuch Permiſſion is any where expreſſed in the Scriptures; the things that ſimply were permitted, as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were uſed but by a few, and not long; <hi>Paul</hi> ſeverely oppoſed them after ſome time; but ſo he never did either <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> or the <hi>Supper.

things to put them in mind of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi>; why then, ſeeing there are now in all Churches and Chriſtian Societies, ſome that are as weak as thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, do not they allow the uſe of them to ſuch as need them? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he ſaith, ſuch as are Dead and Buried with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Riſen again with him, need not ſuch things to remember him. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Here, as elſewhere, his Argument is faulty, by arguing; that becauſe ſuch things are not abſolutely neceſſary, therefore they are not uſeful, or neceſſary in any reſpect. Beſides, as I have above ſhewn, his Argument has the ſame force againſt the uſe of the Holy Scriptures, and all Books, all Preaching of the beſt Men, and all External Parts of Worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> They that are Dead and Buried with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Riſen with him, need none of theſe outward things. But the beſt Men, and ſuch are the moſt humble, will and cannot but acknowledge, that all outward Helps and Means that <hi>God</hi> hath afforded them, are very uſeful to them, and help to ſtir up the pure Mind in them. Nor are any ſo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Raiſed Saints ſhall be at the Reſurrection; therefore till then, they may be helped with outward Means of <hi>God</hi>'s appointing. It is very Unwiſely, as well as Irreverently Argued; we need not thoſe things, therefore they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The contrary is the better Argument; they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, therefore they are needful, at leaſt in ſome reſpect; <hi>God</hi> better knoweth what we need, than we do our ſelves; and therefore in his great Love and Wiſdom, hath provided out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Helps for us, as well as inward. But ſeeing they will needs underſtand the Words, <hi>until he come</hi>; not to mean <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s laſt outward coming, but his inward; then with the ſame Pretext, they may as well underſtand his Death, of an inward Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them; and the ſhewing his Death of an inward ſhewing; and then all Remembrance of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death, as he Dyed outwardly may be forgotten. But if by the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Death, is underſtood his outward Death, by as good reaſon, by his coming is underſtood his outward coming.</p>

               <p>HAving thus ſhewn the Invalidity of his Proofs, that by the <hi>Lord</hi>'s coming, is underſtood his inward coming into their Hearts, and not his outward coming. I ſhall give ſome clear Reaſons, why it muſt be underſtood his outward coming at the general Judgment. The firſt Reaſon is; becauſe the Reaſon of the Command continuing to his laſt outward coming, the Command doth alſo continue; for ſo long doth any Command continue in Force, as the Reaſon of it continueth; but the Reaſon of the Command, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c. doth continue to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s laſt outward coming; which Reaſon is this; that by that Practice they might remember the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Death; and not only remember it, but ſhew it forth, Publickly Declare and Profeſs, it, and the ineſtimable Benefits they have by it. Now put the caſe, that any had ſo good and living Remembrance of it; that they needed not the outward things to put them in remembrance thereof; yet that is not enough to Anſwer the Reaſon and End of the Command, which is by this outward Practice to ſhew it forth, and declare it by a publick Profeſſion, that they owe Remiſſion of Sin, and Salvation to the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that they are not aſhamed to own and confeſs him their Saviour, their King, their Prieſt and Prophet, and in Token thereof they give Teſtimony of their Obedience to theſe his peculiar poſitive Laws and Inſtitutions of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi>; for if theſe be rejected, by the ſame Method Men may reject all other his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Inſtitutions, relating to External Practice of Religion, and ſo turn the Chriſtian Religion into meer Deiſm, and Pagan Morality. The ſecond Reaſon is, that the end of this Inſtitution, being a ſolemn Commemoration of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death and Sacrifice which he offered up to <hi>God</hi> for our Sins above ſixteen hundred Years ago, and of the great Spiritual Bleſſings we have thereby; there is the ſame Cauſe and End for it to continue to our Day, and to the end of the World, as when it was firſt appointed. Had it been indeed only a Prenuniciative Sign of ſome things to come, or of the hidden inviſible Subſtance, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> terms it, meaning thereby the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, at the coming of the Spirit within into their Hearts; the Sign might have ceaſed, as the Prenunciative Signs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s outward coming in the Fleſh were to ceaſe after his outward coming, and accordingly did ceaſe. But the Signs of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> as commanded by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:101541:39"/>
and Practiſed by the Apoſtles; were not ſuch Prenunciative Signs of the coming of his Spirit within them, but were chiefly Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Signs of him as he had come; for both of them were appointed by him when he was come, and the Inſtitution of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him after his Death and Reſurrection, the Inſtitution of the <hi>Supper,</hi> ſo near to his Death, that it was in the very Night when he was Betrayed, and at which time he had the great Senſe and Weight of his Sufferings upon him, and as then in great part begun; and becauſe the uſe of thoſe Signs of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> being broken, and the <hi>Wine</hi> poured out, was a Solemn Commemoration of his having <hi>given his Body to be broken for them, and his Blood to be ſhed for them</hi>; therefore he ſaid, <hi>Take, Eat, this is my Body that is broken for you</hi>; he did not ſay, this is my Spirit, or this is the inward viſible hid Subſtance that ye ſhall afterwards receive; <hi>but this is my Body; Take, Eat</hi>; and though they were not to eat his Body with the Carnal Mouth, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Bread</hi> which ſignified it; yet by Faith they were to eat his Body, that is to ſay, they were to partake of a Myſtical Union with his Body, and to have their Right and Intereſt in him confirmed to them by that Symbol, by means whereof they were to receive plentifully of his Grace and Spirit, as the Conſequent and Effect of that Union with him. Therefore they were not ſo to mind the Effect, as to neglect the great Cauſe of that Effect; which great cauſe was <hi>his giving his Body to be broken for them, and his Blood to be ſhed</hi>; for to mind only the Effect, and neglect the Cauſe, were like the Hogs that greedily run after the Acorns, or Nuts; but are unmindful of the Tree that beareth them. But as the Spiritual Eyes of Believers, are to be to the Graces and Gifts of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; ſo eſpecially, and chiefly to him, from and by whom they have them, and their Faith and Love ought chiefly to act upon him, and upon <hi>God</hi> the Father, in and through him, as alſo upon the Holy Spirit as principally reſiding in him, from and by whom we derive our ſeveral Meaſures of the ſame. The Third Reaſon is this; when <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave the Cup, he ſaid; <hi>this Cup is the new Teſtament in my Blood, ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Now how is that Cup the New Teſtament? ſurely no other ways but as an Obſignatory Sign of the New Teſtament, obſignating to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>remiſſion of Sins by his Blood outwardly ſhed</hi>; which New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath in it the Force and Eſſence of the Covenant of Grace, which <hi>God</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>keth with Believers, through <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator of it; and as <hi>Christ</hi> hath confirmed this Covenant of Grace and Teſtament with his Blood that was Shed once for us; ſo he hath given to Believers this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101541:39"/>
obſignating Pledge of it, by way of Inveſtiture; as when a Man has an Eſtate of Land conveyed to him, and gets the Inveſtiture of it, it is by ſome outward Sign, as here in <hi>England</hi> in ſome Places, by delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him Twig and Turf; and as Kings were Inveſted with their Kingly Power, by having Oyl poured on them; and as <hi>Aaron</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted into the Office of Prieſthood. And indeed all Covenants that ever <hi>God</hi> made with any People, have always been by ſome outward obſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory things, as in his Covenant he made with <hi>Noah,</hi> he gave the Bow in the Cloud for the Token of that Covenant; in the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he gave the Sign of Circumciſion, which by a Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy is called <hi>God</hi>'s Covenant in Scripture. Alſo the Sacrifices under the Law, were Signs of obſignatory of <hi>God</hi>'s Covenant with them who offered thoſe Sacrifices. And in all the Covenants that we read of in Scripture, that any of the Fathers made with the Neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Inhabitants, there were obſignatory Signs and Pledges; ſo that who rightly underſtand the Nature of a Covenant, Tranſacted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any publick manner, muſt acknowledge it cannot be without ſome obſignatory Pledge, or Sign outwardly to be ſeen, given by the one Party to the other; inſomuch that it ſeems to be a general Inſtinct in Mankind, or at leaſt the Equivalent of it, an univerſal Cuſtom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and practiſed even among <hi>Heathens,</hi> as to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it is among the <hi>American</hi> Heathens; who in all their Covenants make uſe of Signs for the greater Security and Confirmation. Thus in the 50th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>gather my Saints together, who have made a covenant with me by ſacrifice, v.</hi> 5. And if any ſhould be ſo Stiff and Pertinacious, as to deny that outward Signs are neceſſary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Covenants univerſally; yet the Caſe is plain here, as to the <hi>Supper</hi>; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf hath ſaid it, <hi>this Cup is the new Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> &amp;c. Which muſt have this meaning; <hi>that the Cup was Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Teſtament, as Circumciſion was God</hi>'s <hi>covenant with Abraham and his ſeed</hi>; for ſo it was called in Scripture; that is to ſay, <hi>the Cup is a ſign of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Teſtament, and of the covenant of grace that God hath made with believers, through Chriſt the Mediator of it.</hi> But if any object, this would ſeem to make the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Supper,</hi> of ſo great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as that it cannot be ſaid, that the Covenant is duly confirmed without them, betwixt <hi>God</hi> and Believers. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſheweth inded a great neceſſity of them, as in reſpect of any People being in Covenant with <hi>God,</hi> in a viſible way of a Church, and as Members of a viſible Church or Society, well and duly conſtituted; for all the Members of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101541:40"/>
a viſible Church, as they are in Covenant with <hi>God</hi> inwardly by the Faith and Obedience of their Hearts, ſo they are in Covenant with him outwardly by the Confeſſion of their Mouths, and other External Acts of Religion, whereby they declare their profeſſed Subjection to him, and to his Laws. Hence we find in Scripture, that not only Faith is required in order to Salvation, but Confeſſion alſo; and that Confeſſion is not only with the Mouth, but by External Works of the Body, proceeding from a living Principle of Faith in the Heart, among which Works are the External Practices of outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> where they can be duly had, whereby they declare their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the poſitive Laws and Inſtitutions of <hi>Christ,</hi> and thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves from either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> who may be Moral Men, and Profeſs Faith and Religion towards <hi>God,</hi> as a Creator, and yet be profeſſed Enemies to the Chriſtian Faith, ſuch as many <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> were in the Apoſtles Days, and are in our Days. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> have been not unfitly called and eſteemed <hi>Badges of Chriſtianity,</hi> peculiarly diſtinguiſhing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>; though not the only Badges, but when they are accompanied with a good Converſation of Sobriety, Juſtice, and Piety, they do make the diſtinction betwixt true Chriſtians, and <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> much more apparent; for if theſe External Practices, Inſtituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> be laid aſide, whereby ſhall it outwardly appear that Men and Women are Chriſtians? If it be ſaid, by the Sobriety, Juſtice, and Piety of their Converſation; But theſe are no poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Marks of Chriſtianity, becauſe Men and Women that are no Chriſtians, may have as much of the out-ſide of Sobriety, Juſtice, and Piety towards <hi>God,</hi> as many true Chriſtians have. If it be again ſaid, their frequent Prayer to <hi>God,</hi> in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and calling on the Name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in Prayer, is a Badge of their Chriſtianity. I anſwer in part it is ſo, but not in full, or in the whole; for he that not only Prayeth to <hi>God</hi> in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him in Words, but alſo ſheweth his Obedience and Subjection to all the Commands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the leaſt as well as the greateſt, whereof the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> are ſome, is the moſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Chriſtian, and beareth the moſt compleat Badge of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. And though Men's Ignorance in their not knowing them, or not being perſuaded concerning them, that they are the Commands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being darkned by the Prejudice of Education, or faſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by Seducers and falſe Teachers, doth in part excuſe them, or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101541:40"/>
at leaſt where Sincerity is, as to the main gives ground of Hope, that <hi>God</hi> will forgive them the Omiſſion of theſe Practices; yet where Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not given to every Command of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even the leaſt as well as the greateſt, though the Omiſſion be through Ignorance, or falſe Perſuaſion, yet it is a Sin, and renders the Perſons found in that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion defective and incomplete Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>THE 4<hi>th.</hi> Reaſon is this, Theſe outward practices of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> are not only viſible Signs and Pledges of our being in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>God</hi> thro' <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that as he is our <hi>God,</hi> ſo we are his People; but they are alſo the viſible Signs and Pledges that we are in the Unity and Communion of the Church, as Children of one Family, begot of one Father, having one Faith and Hope, one <hi>Lord,</hi> and being Members of one Body. And though the Communion of Believers conſiſts chiefly in the Spirit, and the inward Graces thereof; yet, as they are a viſible Body and Society, they are to have ſome outward and viſible Signs and Pledges of the ſame, that carry ſome diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Character, to diſtinguiſh them, not only from profeſſed Infidels, but alſo from looſe and ſcandalous Perſons, profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith with them: Therefore as in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, <hi>God</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that whoever did not obey the Moſaical Precepts, were to be excluded the Congregation, and debarred from the external Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that they had as a Church, even ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> has appointed, that whoſoever profeſſing him in Words, deny him in Works, and walk diſorderly and offenſively, as well as who err concerning the Faith, ſo as not to hold the Head, that they ought to be rejected and diſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; in token whereof, they are to be debarred from the external Signs of the Saints Communion with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one with another. Otherwiſe, what can be meant by <hi>rejecting, caſting out, and purging out,</hi> in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament? Alſo by the word <hi>ſeparating, and withdrawing,</hi> ſo as to have no Fellowſhip with them? Surely it was more than a verbal denyal of them, or giving forth a Paper againſt them. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> tell us what it was, when he ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>If any man that is called a brother be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, &amp;c, with ſuch an one no not to eat.</hi> This <hi>not to eat</hi> cannot be meant the common Eating, but ſuch as that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. to wit, <hi>at the Lord's Table.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> did ſee it meet, that as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101541:41"/>
the Outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be a Sign declarative of the Perſons Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized taking or putting on the Profeſſion of a Chriſtian, ſo the Eating at the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Table ſhould be a Sign, that they did remain Faithful under that Profeſſion, and did continue in the Unity and Communion of the Church, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s words declare, <hi>We being many are one bread, and are all made partakers of that one bread, &amp;c.</hi> Even as under the Law, the receiving of Circumciſion was the Sign or Badge of their being Members of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and their Eating of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and of the Sacrifices, (ſuch as were allowed to them to Eat) was a Sign of their being ſtill owned as ſuch; and if any by their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs and diſobedience did occaſion the Church to debarr them from the external Privileges of that Church, when upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reconciliation, they were again received, they needed no ſecond Circumciſion; ſo nor do profeſſed Chriſtians, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any thing that occaſion their caſting out, being again received by Repentance, need a ſecond Baptiſm. Now if <hi>Baptiſm</hi> had been the alone obſignating token of the Covenant, and Badge of Chriſtian Communion, how ſhould Perſons be received into Communion, without a new <hi>Baptiſm</hi>? but to have a new <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is as improper as for a Woman after ſome juſt offence againſt her Husband, that he has put her from him, if upon her Repentance he receive her again, to need a ſecond Marriage with the ſame Husband; but tho' ſhe need no ſecond Marriage, yet that her Husband give her ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and pledge of his Favour, and Acceptance is very ſuitable. And now ſeeing theſe external Practices have ſo many neceſſary uſes in the Church, ſo that the Church cannot, in all reſpects, be duly conſtituted, and have all things in order without them, it is evident, that as long as the Church was to continue on Earth, in its due Conſtitution, ſo long ſhould theſe external Practices remain; and ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> enjoyned this of breaking Bread to remain to his coming, it is evident, that it is his laſt outward coming.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Reaſon is, that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Inward coming was then in and among the Diſciples when he did Inſtitute theſe Outward Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. The Church was never without the Inward Preſence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> It is true, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Inward Preſence to be with them and in them; but this was not ſo to be underſtood, as if the Faithful had him not preſent formerly, in all Ages, as well before, as after his Outward coming; for without the Inward Preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Holy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101541:41"/>
Spirit,</hi> there can be no true Faith nor Holineſs. We find that the Faithful are called Saints, as well in the Old Teſtament, as in the New, and therefore they had as true Inward enjoyments of <hi>God</hi> then as ſince, the difference at moſt is but in degree, betwixt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Enjoyments of the Faithful, before <hi>Chriſt</hi> came in the Fleſh, and ſince as to the general. And if it be ſaid, that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly come to ſome, yet not to all in the Apoſtles times, ſo as to Anſwer to the full extent of the fulfilling of the Promiſe of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coming; It may be anſwered, nor is he ſo come now; for as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, the Poor ye have always with you; ſo until the end of the World there will be in the Church Babes and little Children as well as young Men, and Fathers; and therefore on the account of ſuch by <hi>R.B.</hi>'s Confeſſion, that are weak, as ſome of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Outward things to put them in Remembrance of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death, they are ſtill to be continued, even to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> laſt Outward coming; but there are too many among the Quakers that think there is no need to Remember <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death, as he dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> abuſing and perverting <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>henceforth we know Chriſt no more after the fleſh,</hi> and ſo there is no need or uſe of Remembring <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death; that they ſay is but Hiſtory, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> within is the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereas <hi>Chriſt</hi> within is not the whole Myſtery, but in part, and the leſſer part too; the whole Myſtery of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Chriſt</hi> both Outwardly come in the Fleſh, and Inwardly come by his Spirit into the Hearts of the Faithful.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Reaſon is, that to underſtand by the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe words—<hi>untill he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. His Inward coming, and not his coming Without us at the day of Judgment, by the ſame pretext and method of Interpretation, All the other Scriptures every where that mention his coming throughout the whole Bible, and eſpecially throughout the New Teſtament, ſhall be underſtood only of his Inward coming: And thus we ſhall have not one proof left us in all the Bible, to prove that there is any other coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be expected, than his Inward coming in Mens Hearts. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly indeed we find, that too many of the Quakers have by this manner of perverting this place of Scripture, been led to underſtand all theſe other places of Scripture in the New Teſtament that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his coming ſince he came in the Fleſh, to be only underſtood of his Inward coming in Mens Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on this account have deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any other coming of <hi>Christ</hi> to be expected, but only his Inward
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101541:42"/>
coming, being perſuaded into this Falſe and Antichriſtian Belief, by ſome of their great Teachers, witneſs what <hi>William Baily,</hi> a great Teacher among them, hath plainly declared in this matter, p. 306. of the Collection publiſhed by the 2d. days Meeting of the People called Quakers, at <hi>Grace-Church-street. I never read in all the Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, (<hi>as I can remember</hi>) <hi>of a</hi> 3<hi>d. coming of Chriſt, perſonally in his own ſingle perſon, or of a perſonal Reign beſides what ſhall be in his Saints. But I have read of his coming the</hi> 2<hi>d. time, without Sin unto Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which the Apoſtles in their days did witneſs.</hi> Witneſs alſo <hi>Rich. Hubberthorn,</hi> another great Teacher, in his Collection publiſhed after his death alſo by the 2d. days Meeting, p. 56. in anſwer to his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. — <hi>How many Souls haſt thou led into that Pit of Darkneſs and Blindneſs, as to believe that Chriſt is yet to come in Perſon? Now the Scripture which thou bringeſt proves no ſuch thing,</hi> Matth. 24.27. And a 3d. witneſs is <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his <hi>Nature of Chriſtianity</hi> againſt <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> who p. 29. ſaith, <hi>Doſt thou look for Chriſt, as the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>to appear Outwardly in a bodily Exiſtence to ſave thee, according to thy words, p.</hi> 30. <hi>If thou doſt, thou may'ſt look until thy Eyes drop out before thou wilt ſee ſuch an Appearance of him.</hi> And p. 41. <q>(Where
doth the Scripture ſay, he is Outwardly and Bodily Glorified at <hi>God's</hi> right Hand? Do theſe words expreſs the Glory he had with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the World began, in which he is now Glorified?)</q>
This and the two foregoing Quotations are to be found more large in my Two Narratives of the Proceedings at <hi>Turners-Hall</hi>; all which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prove that they believed no Outward coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a thing to come; therefore it is no wonder that they meant only <hi>Chriſt's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inwardly into Mens Hearts by theſe words, <hi>ye ſhew forth the Lord's death until he come</hi>; for from the ſame Unbelief they have conſtrued all the other places that mention <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming after his Reſurrection, of his Inward coming, and all this in prejudice of his Outward coming, which theſe Men did not believe, which places of Scripture are many, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.27. This very place <hi>G. W.</hi> denyeth to be meant of his Outward coming at the Day of Judgment, as alſo 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.15. In his Book called <hi>Light and Life,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. Now by the ſame Method whereby they deny any of theſe four places now mentioned, to be underſtood of any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> than his Inward coming, they muſt deny all other places that mention his coming after his Reſurrection, to be meant of his Outward coming in the true Nature of Man, becauſe they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101541:42"/>
they own no ſuch thing, as <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being in Heaven without us in a Perſonal and Bodily Exiſtence; and that which is not in Being, they cannot believe will come.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch Error I charge as this on <hi>R.B.</hi> who I know did own that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had the true Being and Nature of Man in Heaven, and that he would come and appear without us in that Nature to judge the World in Righteouſneſs. But to proſecute the Argument, that by the words—<hi>until he come</hi> muſt be underſtood his Outward coming; it has the more force againſt <hi>R.B.</hi> becauſe he believed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Outwardly to come, and that there were ſufficient proofs of Scripture for it, as indeed many there are beſides thoſe already named, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37, 43. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23, 24. <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.19. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.13. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. Now ſeing <hi>R.B.</hi> did believe that all, or Many of theſe places were to be underſtood of his Outward coming, how could he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced his unbelieving Brethren, that any of theſe places were to be underſtood of his Outward coming more than that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.— <hi>till he come,</hi> ſeeing from the reaſons above given, as much evidence appeareth, that by his coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. is meant his Outward coming, as from any other places above cited, or any that can be brought, his Outward coming can be proved? And ſo indiſcreetly Zealous have ſome of their great Teachers been for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Inward coming (which is a Truth very great and neceſſary to be believed rightly and duly underſtood, but ought not to be proved by perverſions of Scripture that mean not ſo, whereas ſufficient proofs can be brought for it, without all ſuch perverſions,) that divers of the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, concerning <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming in the Fleſh, they have turned to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Birth within them, as that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>;—<hi>Unto us a Child is born, a Son is given:</hi> And that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. concerning his Death and Burial without us in his real Body of Fleſh, <hi>He made his grave with the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rich. Hubberthorn</hi> turns it to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being buried in the wicked, contrary both to the true tranſlation, as well as to the true ſenſe of that place. And thus by this preſumptuous Liberty they take, to expound the Scriptures falſely, contrary to all reaſon and common Senſe, they ſeek to diſarm the Chriſtians from bringing proofs out of the Old Teſtament againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> to prove that the promiſed Meſſiah is already come in the Fleſh, or that he hath ſuffered in the Fleſh. And though I was ſo far blinded by them, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101541:43"/>
I did underſtand 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.—<hi>till he come,</hi> of his Inward coming; yet I had always a firm Belief, both of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being in Heaven in the glorified Nature of Man, and that he would come in that glorified Nature of Man to judge the World. And now I plainly ſee, that his coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. is as really his Outward coming, as any where elſe in all the Scripture; and I hope I have ſufficiently proved it to all impartial and intelligent Perſons, who ſhall read my Reaſons I have brought to prove the ſame.</p>
               <p>Page 113. His Quotation of the Syriack tranſlation doth no ways favour his Senſe, as that the Eating 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. was only by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and not by Command. The Quotation is this. <hi>In that concerning which I am about to Command you (or Inſtruct you) I Commend you not, becauſe ye have not gone forward, but are deſcended into that, which is leſs, or of leſs Conſequence.</hi> From this he infers, that <hi>Paul</hi> judged the Bread and Wine to be beggerly Elements: But the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack tranſlation ſaith no ſuch thing; he might well have blamed them, that they were not gone forward in the Life of Chriſtianity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther backward, becauſe of the corrupt and irregular manner of their practiſing that Inſtitution, that ſome were drunk; ſurely this was to go back, but this is no proof againſt the regular Practice it ſelf. And what he further quotes of the ſame Syriack Verſion, is as improper and invalid to his purpoſe, v. 20. <hi>When then ye meet together, ye do not do it, as it is juſt ye ſhould do in the day of the Lord, ye eat and drink</hi>; thereby ſhewing to them, to meet together to Eat and Drink outward Bread and Wine, was not the Labour and Work of that Day of the <hi>Lord.</hi> But nothing appeareth from this, that he blamed the regular Practice of it, but their undue and corrupt manner of doing it; ſo that their doing of it, as they did it, was not the Work of the Day: And therefore he might well ſay, as it is <hi>v.</hi> 20. of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had turned it into a prophanation</hi>; But <hi>R.B.</hi>'s obſervation on theſe Words, <hi>p.</hi> 109. is of no force at all to prove his purpoſe: <hi>He ſaith not, this is not the right manner to eat, but this is not to eat the Lord's Supper,</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) the Supper of the <hi>Lord</hi> is Spiritual, and a Myſtery. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But the right manner of a thing in many caſes is ſo eſſential to the thing, that the want of the right manner deſtroys the thing it ſelf. As the right manner of a Circle is to have all the ſtraight Lines drawn from the Center to the Circumference equal, and if this be wanting, the Figure is not a Circle. Yea, If the right
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101541:43"/>
manner of Prayer be wanting, ſo that it be directed to <hi>God,</hi> yet not in true words, it is not true Prayer, and if not in truth and ſincerity of Heart, it is not true Prayer. His other Arguments from <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. are all anſwered above ſufficiently, Part 1. Sect. 6.</p>

                  <hi>PAge</hi> 121. <hi>His laſt Argument is general againſt both the Outward Baptiſm, and the Supper. It remains</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to ſhew us how they come by Power and Authority to Adminiſter them. —Their Power muſt be derived from the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>either mediately, or immediately; but they have no mediate Power, becauſe of the Interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption made by the Apoſtacy: And for an immediate Power or Command by the Spirit of God to Adminiſter theſe things, none of our Adverſaries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Argument is unduly worded in the former part of it; for Men may have a Power that is neither from the Apoſtles mediately nor immediately; not mediately, as he thinks he has proved, nor yet immediately from the Apoſtles, becauſe not their immediate Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. But, why may they not have a Power mediately from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after ſome true manner, and yet in ſome ſort immediate alſo? If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſeveral ſignifications of the Words mediate and immediate, none of which are Scripture words, any more, or ſcarce ſo much, as other words they reject, becauſe not Scripture words; and becauſe of the ambiguous and doubtful ſignification of the Words mediate and immediate, they may be omitted, and other Words uſed to as good, or better effect. But if we may be allowed to uſe the words mediate and immediate; one Senſe of the word <hi>immediate</hi> is a Call from <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Perſon, ſpeaking with an audible Voice to the outward Ear; ſuch as the twelve Apoſtles had, and <hi>Paul</hi> alſo. This I know none now pretends to. Another Senſe of the word immediate is, a Call by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Hearts of them who are ſo Called, in the ſame way and manner, as the Prophets were both taught their Prophecies, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to deliver them, and commit them to Writing, which was by a Prophetick Spirit that did Infallibly guide them, in every Sentence and Word of their Meſſage, without the leaſt poſſibility of Error or Miſtake; and as ſo Taught and Called, without the need or uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward means whatſoever. If ſome of the Teachers among the Quakers have pretended to any ſuch Inward Teaching or Calling, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101541:44"/>
it can be eaſily proved they have, it can be as eaſily proved, that they have not been ſo taught nor called, becauſe in too many things, wherein they have pretended to ſuch Teaching and Calling, they have Bewrayed themſelves miſerably, and laid themſelves open to the Judgment of the weaker ſort of Sincere Chriſtians, who have been able to prove, that in too many things they have delivered as Divine Revelations, they have contradicted the Holy Scriptures, and ſo have groſly Erred. A Third ſort of immediate Teaching and Calling, is by taking the Etymologie of the Word immediate, to ſignifie not without all Means, but in and with the Means; as when it is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that there is an immediate Supernatural Divine Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> that aſſiſteth the Faithful in all truly holy Actions; yea, in all holy Thoughts and Deſires, Words and Works; yet not without the uſe of outward Means, but in the due and frequent uſe of them; as in Reading, Hearing, and Meditating upon what hath been Read, or Heard. Now this ſort of inward Teaching and Calling by the Spirit, as it is not without means altogether; ſo is it not without all poſſibility of Erring, or Miſtake; for though no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror can proceed from the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> nor can the Spirit Err; yet a Man that has the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> working in his Heart, both to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his Underſtanding, and move and incline his Will to good Things, may through Humane Weakneſs and Inadvertency, or by ſome Prejudice of Education, or wrong Information of his Teachers, miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and miſunderſtand the Spirits inward Illuminations and Motions, which he is the more likely to do, if he do not duly and diligently apply his Mind, as to the Spirits inward Illumination, ſo to the Directions and Inſtructions, given to us in the Holy Scriptures, to examine and find the agreement of the inward with the outward; for certainly if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions that any Man hath, contradict the plain Directions and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions given in the Holy Scriptures, they are not of the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> whatever appearance they may ſeem to have of Power or Evidence; the joynt concurrence of the Spirit of Truth within, and the inſtrumental and ſubordinate help of the Scripture without, given us to help our weakneſs, may be compared to the natural Light of the Sun, or Candle that we read with (in ſome ſort) though this, and all other Similitudes fall ſhort of a full Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; for as we cannot Read without the Light, though the Book lie open before us; ſo when the Light Shines, yet it will not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101541:44"/>
teach us what is in the Book, unleſs we look on it, and alſo be taught to Read in it. Even ſo the Light of the Holy Spirit, ſhining upon the Ideas, and Perceptions of our Minds, as conveyed to us by what we have heard or read out of the Holy Scriptures, opens to us the true hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Senſe and Truth of them, with Life and Power, and great inward Clearneſs and Evidence, Joy and Satisfaction; and thus if we find that the Spirits Illumination, worketh in our Hearts and Minds an Aſſent to the Truth of what is Recorded in the Holy Scriptures; we can with all readineſs receive it. But if what we ſuppoſe to be a Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, diſcord from the Truth of the Scriptures; we ought to reject it, and by no means to receive it, for it is not Divine, but Humane; or which is worſe, Diabolical. Now according to this laſt Senſe of the Word immediate, <hi>i.e.</hi> inward Teaching, and Call of the Spirit, in the uſe of outward Means and Helps, and eſpecially the Holy Scriptures, I ſee not, but it may be granted that Men may be found, and are to be found, that have a true immediate Call from the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their Hearts, both to Preach, and Adminiſter theſe Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Supper</hi>; and all this well conſiſting with the mediate orderly Call, where there is a Conſtitute Church, though not every way ſo rightly and duly Conſtitute, as was in the Apoſtles Days, and in the pureſt Times ſucceeding the Apoſtles. There is ground to believe, that <hi>God</hi> raiſed up many ſuch in the beginning of the Reformation from Popery; and though ſince that beginning, too many Particulars have rather gone backward than forward; yet the Succeſs of the Miniſtry, and excellent Books that have come forth, time after time, of many Worthy Perſons, however in ſome things miſtaken, and the truly Chriſtian Lives and Converſations of many, through all the Proteſtant Churches, though in compariſon of the great multitude that are Prophane and Scandalous, they are but a few, may be a good Ground of Evidence, that <hi>God</hi> is truly among them, and doth own the Remnant that are Sincere, and their Miniſtry; to whom an Alluſion may be made of what was ſaid to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> (the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <hi>Sardis,</hi> is in the Plural Number) thou haſt a few Names in <hi>Sardis,</hi> who have not Defiled their Garments; they ſhall walk with me in White, for they are Worthy. I know there are ſome, who do more than make an Alluſion in the Caſe, and think that by the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> is really meant the collective Body of the Proteſtant Churches, throughout the ſeveral Parts of the World; which I will not here be poſitive, either to affirm, or deny, but either
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101541:45"/>
by way of Alluſion, or by Hypotheſis, let us conceive that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Body of the Proteſtant Churches, anſwers to <hi>Sardis,</hi> and not this or that particular ſpot or part of the Earth, or this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Country, Province, or City, but the Collective Body of the whole, that by the Harmony of their Confeſſions already extant, may be allowed to hold the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many are under great miſtakes in other things. Now we do not find this Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> blamed for Idolatry or ſuffering it, as ſome of the other Seven Churches we find ſo blamed, and particularly that of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that may allude to the Dark and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Times of Popery, for divers Ages foregoing. The great things of the <hi>Sardis</hi> Church that are blamed are, that her Works were not perfect before <hi>God</hi>; that ſhe had more a Name of Life, than the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, which ſeems to paint out to the Life, the Collective Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Proteſtant Churches, who yet have a few Names, who have not defiled their Garments, and who are worthy; which few Names are not confined to this or that particular Denomination, but ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and diſperſed through the whole, as ſo many Grains of pure Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Gold thro' a great maſs or Lump of Oar, where is much more Droſs and Refuſe.</p>
               <p>And becauſe things receive their denomination from the better part frequently, therefore I judge that the Proteſtant Churches are, with a reſpect to, and on the account of theſe few Names that have kept their Garments clean, to be reckoned a true Church, and is ſo repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore it were very adviſable, that all that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Believe in <hi>God,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and love <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Fundamentals, as they generally do, that they would Love one another, and Repute one another as Brethren, walk together, and worſhip <hi>God</hi> together in Spirit and in Truth; the Stronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to the Weaker, and becoming all things to all Men, and in every thing that is not manifeſtly ſinful, yielding one to another, endeavouring to be of one Heart and Soul in true Chriſtian Love and Affection, however differing in ſome leſſer matters, both as to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice. This I hope <hi>God</hi> in his own time will bring to paſs; and for this, as many (I believe) ſincerely pray, ſo do I cordially joyn my earneſt Supplications with them. And let this ſuffice at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for an Anſwer to that laſt Argument, about the Call, as whether mediate or immediate.</p>

               <p>IT is not to be doubted, but many in the Proteſtant Churches can give as great evidence, and far greater, of their true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Call to the work of the Miniſtry, than many, or moſt of the Teachers among the People call'd Quakers; and that not only by the conformity of their Doctrine and Converſation to the Holy Scriptures, but the real ſucceſs and good effect of their Miniſtry by the Bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> upon their Labours: And if the noiſe of boldly claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves the only Privilege of being the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their Teachers and Miniſters the only Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having only the Inward Call, and furniſhing of the Spirit, be laid aſide, and the Queſtion fairly and calmly ſtated, it will not bear great Diſpute to make it appear which of the two ſorts have the beſt Marks of the true Church and Miniſtry. Would the Quakers leſs value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for ſome ſingular things, which at beſt are but as the Cummin and the Mint, and ſome of them not ſo much, they might eaſily find themſelves equalled, and far excelled in great part by many others in the greater things of true Divine Knowledge, Piety and Virtue. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for a Concluſion, let this be added; that ſuppoſe preſent Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators could not be readily found, ſo qualified, as to ſilence all the ſcrupuloſities of Objectors, this will not prove that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> are not the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it will not prove that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel is not a Divine Inſtitution, becauſe in many parts of the World true Preaching has been wanting, and yet is; yea, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Quakers narrow and ſcanty Charity, true Preaching was generally loſt in the World, untill the Quakers were raiſed up about the year 1648. Doth it therefore follow, that it was no Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors to Preach the Goſpel? And here let it be noticed, that I put a diſtinction betwixt a Power given to a Man to uſe the Gifts that <hi>God</hi> has given him, in teaching others leſs knowing, and a Paſtoral Gift, of not only Teaching, but Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring theſe Divine Inſtitutions of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> and doing divers other things relating to the Diſcipline, Order, and Government of the People, over whom, by <hi>God</hi>'s appointment, and the Peoples conſent, he is ſet to be their Paſtor and Watchman.</p>
               <p>Here Note Reader, that what is ſaid in this ſmall Treatiſe, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Arguments of the principal Teachers of the Quakers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101541:46"/>
named, will alſo ſerve for an Anſwer to <hi>W. Dell</hi>'s Book, againſt <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi>; for there is nothing Material in his Book, but what is in their Books, upon that Subject, though they borrowed his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and have ſo great a liking to his Book, that they have Printed it often, again, and again; and indeed, as they borrowed from him, ſo the moſt of his Arguments he ſeems to have borrowed from <hi>Socinus,</hi> who hath uſed the ſame Arguments for the moſt part, long before <hi>W. Dell,</hi> or the <hi>Quakers</hi> appeared in the World. Only pleaſe Reader to take notice of that great piece of Ignorance in <hi>W. Dell,</hi> to affirm ſo bold an Untruth; that <hi>Zacharias, John</hi> the Baptiſt's Father was High Prieſt. The more particular Queſtions about <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> relating either to the proper Subjects of it, or manner of it, are not needful to be handled here, the deſign of this Treatiſe being to Convince ſuch of the <hi>Quakers</hi> as are willing to read it, that <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> are Divine Inſtitutions; till they own this, it would be Prepoſterous to perſuade them about thoſe other. Were the People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> convinced of this great Truth; that the outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> by <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> are Divine Inſtitutions, and ought to be practiſed by them, as becoming true Chriſtians, there are ſome thouſands of them who are at Age, and have Children at Age, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any manner of outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi>; if theſe have true Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and can ſincerely ſay, as the Eunuch did, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all thoſe Errors that are contrary to the true Faith in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Doctrins thereof</hi>; there is no queſtion but they may be <hi>Baptized,</hi> they are proper enough Subjects of it; and when they are thus well Prepared and Qualified to Receive it, it may be hoped that they will be Directed and Guided by the <hi>Lord,</hi> where, and how to find the Perſons that may be fit to Adminiſter it unto them. Such among them who ſcruple, or queſtion the manner of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> by Sprinkling, may receive it by Dipping; for all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> own that that Form may be uſed Lawfully; and that Adult Perſons having Faith in the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> after their giving the Confeſſion of the ſame, may, and ought to be <hi>Baptized.</hi> And ſuch among them who might ſcruple to receive it from Perſons of another Denomination, might find ſome of their own Way to Adminiſter it unto them. For it were ſtrange, to ſuppoſe, that among ſo many hundreds of Men, profeſſing to have an immediate, or inward Call to that part of the Miniſtry by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Prayer, there ſhould not be ſome found among them, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101541:46"/>
might apprehend that they are as immediately call'd to the other part of the Miniſtry, of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> after they are truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are Goſpel Inſtitutions. There is ſome Ground of Hope, that many among them will be brought to ſome good Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and better Underſtanding, ſo as to ſee the great hurt and loſs that it has been unto them, to reject thoſe things, and alſo to come to that good and ſolid Diſcretion and Judgment of the great Profit and Advantage it would be to them, to receive the Practice of them among them, for their Spiritual Good and Honour of their Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (thereby declaring, as well as by their Chriſtian Lives and Converſations, that they are the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Love to him; that they keep theſe his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as the others that he has enjoyned; remembring that he that breaketh the leaſt of his Commandments, and teacheth Men to do ſo, ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven) and alſo for the removing the great Scandal and Offence of many Tender People, who are greatly ſtumbled at their Way, in not only omitting, but ſpeaking Reproachfully againſt thoſe Sacred Inſtitutions. It will be no occaſion of Diſhonour to them, nor Argument of their declining, or going backward from the Truth, to own and receive the Practice of theſe things, that they have needleſly, and for want of due Conſideration, dropt, and loſt; more than it would be to a Man that had dropt ſome piece of Money, or Jewel, to return, and ſtoop to take it up again. That which addeth to my Ground of Hope in this thing, is, that ſome among them have privately acknowledged, that they are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Hurt and Diſadvantage that they have been at, as a Body of People, for laying thoſe Practices aſide.</p>

               <p>HAving finiſhed my Anſwers to the Arguments of the four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, above named, againſt the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> I think fit to take notice of the Arguments of <hi>George Fox,</hi> (the greateſt Perſon among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when living, and whoſe Words are ſtill as Oracles unto them) againſt theſe Divine Inſtitutions; to which indeed little more Anſwer is needful, than what is given to thoſe other, for his Arguments are Included in theirs, and ſo may the Anſwers be in the Anſwers to them. His Argument againſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> I find to be but one, in a Book of his, called, <hi>Something<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Anſwer to the Old Common-Prayer-Book, Printed at</hi> London, 1660
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101541:47"/>
p. 18. <hi>And doth not that in</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>ſay, Baptize into the Name; and is not that more than in the Name</hi>? This the Reader will find An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered above, in Reply to ſome of their Arguments; <hi>but to Baptize into the Name,</hi> Acts 8. they grant not to be the inward <hi>Baptiſm</hi>; and therefore, nor is that <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. the Particles <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>into,</hi> being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſame in Signification, both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> yea, and in <hi>Hebrew</hi> alſo, and <hi>Latin,</hi> and generally in other Languages.</p>
               <p>His Arguments againſt the outward <hi>Supper,</hi> are as followeth, p. 26. <hi>They that received the Bread and Wine in remembrance of Chriſt, ſhewing his Death till he come, which the Apoſtle had received of the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>which they were to examine, and Eat, and Drink in remembrance of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Death, till he come.</hi> This was in, 1 <hi>Cor. Then he wrote again to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>and bids them examine themſelves, and prove their own ſelves; knew they not that Chriſt was in them, except they were Reprobates</hi>? So they may ſee that this was not a ſtanding Form; <hi>but as often as they did it, they did it in remembrance of Chriſt, till he come; and then examine your ſelves, prove your ſelves, If Chriſt be not in you, except ye be Reprobates; ſo if you have him within, what need you to have that which puts in remembrance of him? And ſo if ye be riſen with Chriſt; ſeek thoſe things that are above; for now Bread and Wine is below, which is the remembrance of his Death, ſo that part dies with him; which muſt have a Sign to put in remembrance of him. For the Apoſtles forgot, who ſaid, that they thought that that Man ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſubſtance of this is replyed unto above; only I thought fit to take notice, how impertinent and idle his Argument is, from his comparing the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> with a paſſage in his ſecond Epiſtle to them; as if in his firſt Epiſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had delivered the Command or Practice of it unto them, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not then come in them; but when he wrote again, he was come in them. Which reaſoning of <hi>G.F.</hi> is built on a moſt falſe Foundation; for <hi>Paul</hi> did believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was as truly come in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at his firſt writing, as at his ſecond; for as he ſaid unto them in his ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>know ye not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Cor. 13.5. So he ſaid in his firſt Epiſtle, 1 Cor. 6.19. <hi>Know ye not that your body is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you, which ye have of God,</hi> &amp;c. And ſurely, when they had the Holy Ghoſt in them, they had <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them; from which it appears, that this Argument of <hi>G.F.</hi> is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impertinent, and built on a groſs and manifeſt untruth. But it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101541:47"/>
was the way of <hi>G.F.</hi> What he neither did nor could prove from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, he would boldly perſuade by his Authority and Stamp, with ſaying, <hi>This is the word of the Lord unto you,</hi> and then it was no more to be queſtioned; and if any did, they were reckoned bad Spirits, like <hi>Corah,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo his ſaying, Bread and Wine is from below, and they who have <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them need not the Sign; all this is anſwered above; and had he not been very weak in his underſtanding and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he might have eaſily obſerved, that this way of his Reaſoning was equally againſt all Outward Miniſtry, Words, and Writings, which are not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> more than Bread and Wine. And are not his many Papers, about Orders, and Womens Dreſſes, from below, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are viſible things, and therefore by his Arguments, they ſhould be rejected?</p>
               <p>There is yet one Argument behind, which I have found in a Manuſcript having <hi>Humphry Norton</hi>'s Name to it, a Preacher of great Name formerly among the Quakers, and in extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> and <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> as appeareth by their Epiſtles of Recommendation concerning him, they both ſent with him to Friends in <hi>Ireland,</hi> contained in the ſaid Manuſcript; unto you all (ſaith <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>) I do him recommend, as a faithful Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, to be received by you in the Name of him that ſends him, in tender pity for you all, and the Bleſſing of the <hi>Lord</hi> upon his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs I doubt not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dated <hi>London</hi> 19. 3d. mo. 1656. And ſaith <hi>Fr. Howgil,</hi> receive <hi>Humphry Norton</hi> in the <hi>Lord,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord</hi> hath moved to come unto you, who is a Brother, and Faithful in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Work, and be Subject unto him in the <hi>Lord,</hi> all unto him; for I much deſired that he might come unto you, and ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ordered it; and as you receive him, you receive me, <hi>F. Howgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Man, <hi>Humphry Norton,</hi> after his Arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the year 1656, writ, and ſpread about ſeveral Papers among the People, call'd Baptiſts, and others; of which I have ſeen divers contained in a Manuſcript, all Writ by one Hand, and having his Name to them.</p>
               <p>His Argument againſt <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is in the following Words. <hi>Q.</hi> 15. And now ye Baptiſts, ſeeing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come, and hath <hi>Baptized</hi> us, and all Men come unto him, tell me, whether there be <hi>any Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm but one</hi>; ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> Eph. 4.5, 6. And whether <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be not a Doctrin, yea, or nay? If you ſay an Ordinance, whether it be not Aboliſhed; yea, or nay; ſeeing the Scripture ſaith, <hi>having aboliſhed in his Fleſh the Enmity,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101541:48"/>
even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances; for to make in himſelf of Twain, one new Man; ſo making Peace,</hi> Eph. 2.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That concerning one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is fully Anſwered above: To the latter concerning Ordinances, the Word in the <hi>Greek</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not properly Tranſlated Ordinances, but rather Opinions, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. But let it be Tranſlated Ordinances; how doth this prove, that therefore <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is Aboliſhed, unleſs the Argument be built upon this Suppoſition; that all Ordinances are Aboliſhed, and conſequently <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> and at the ſame rate, Preaching and Prayer muſt be Aboliſhed, which are no leſs Ordinances.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame Parcel of Queries, the fifth Querie is; now An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in plain Words; From whence muſt this <hi>Chriſt</hi> ye wait for come, and in what Generation, and of what Family, and out of what Country, and of whom muſt he be Born? that they may no longer be deceived by you, who have kept them gazing after a falſe <hi>Chriſt</hi>; well may it be called Gazing; but leave it, and mind theſe in white Apparel, which Reproves you for it, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Humphry Norton,</hi> after ſome Years went into New <hi>England,</hi> and after his Return, Prints a Book at <hi>London</hi> (which I find Quoted in another Printed Book) having the like, or the ſame Queries for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the Words are theſe. <hi>Is not Chriſt God, and is not God a Spirit? you look for a Chriſt without you; from what Coaſt or Country ſhall he come? What Country-man is he? You ſtand Gazing up in the Clouds after a Man, but we ſtand by in White chiding of you.</hi> Reader, are not theſe dreadful Words, enough to make all Chriſtian Ears to tingle? it is no wonder that they have ſo generally Conſtrued theſe Words; <hi>ye ſhew forth his Death until he come,</hi> to be only his inward coming; when the chiefeſt Teachers among them had no Faith of his outward coming to Judge the World. And it is but too likely, that <hi>E. Burrough,</hi> and <hi>F. Howgil,</hi> were as great Unbelievers as he in that great Fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion; and if they were not, they were miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and did miſerably deceive themſelves by their ſuppoſed Gift of Diſcerning; to give ſuch high Recommendations and Praiſes of a Man, that deſerved not to be numbred among the loweſt Rank of Chriſtians, who hath dared thus openly, like one of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, to Scoff at our Bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi>'s coming without us to Judgment; but never any Chriſtian gave him occaſion for ſuch a Scoffing manner of Queſtioning, it being univerſally believed by all Chriſtians, that our <hi>Lord</hi> will come from Heaven in the ſame Body wherein he Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101541:48"/>
and is not to be Born again of a Woman. Again, In another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that hath his Name to it, there are theſe Words; <hi>and whereas he Accuſed us for denying Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Merits; I ſay, that which can be Merited, is of Self; and that which is of Chriſt is freely given. But ſuch a word is not in Scripture, as</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Merits, but is fetch'd from the Whore a at</hi> Rome <hi>by them.</hi> Behold the Man, whom <hi>E. Burrough</hi>'s called a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Labourer, and <hi>F. Howgil</hi> called a Brother Faithful in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Work, to whom he would have all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject! How can they who follow ſuch blind Guides, but fall into the Ditch with them? Is there any greater, or ſo great Blindneſs to be found in the Blindeſt, and moſt Ignorant of the Papiſts?</p>
               <p>In a Book of mine, called, <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> p. 140. I find an other Argument I have uſed againſt the <hi>Supper</hi>; the Effect of which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe following Words; <hi>What Chriſt did at that time; and bid his Diſciples do until he come, is no Goſpel Ordinance, becauſe it was done in the Night, or Evening of the old Covenant Diſpenſation, and conſequently was to come to an end with it. Ans.</hi> I freely acknowledge this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Weak and Unſound, and the way to Anſwer it, is by denying the Conſequence to be True and Juſt; for moſtly what <hi>Christ</hi> Taught was in the Evening, or latter part of the old Covenant; but it doth not therefore follow that it was to end with it. As alſo where I have ſaid in my Book, called, <hi>Presbyterian and Independent Churches,</hi> &amp;c. P. 185. <hi>That which ye now uſe is neither Subſtantial Dinner nor Supper, being only a Crumb of Bread,</hi> &amp;c. I acknowledge, was unadviſedly ſaid, and as weakly Argued; for the end of that outward Inſtitution, was not any outward Subſtantial <hi>Dinner</hi> or <hi>Supper,</hi> as neither was that of the Paſchal Lamb. And alſo where, p. 184. of the ſame, I have argued, that the uſe of the outward Signs of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> did ſuit moſt with the Ages and State of Children, for they ſuit well enough with the moſt grown Chriſtians, while remaining in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Body.</p>

               <head>SECT. XII.</head>
               <p>AND thus I have Anſwered to all the Arguments brought againſt the outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> by their ſeveral Writers, and chief Teachers that I have found in their Books; not omitting any to my beſt Remembrance, of any Note; where though I have brought in <hi>G. Fox</hi> among the laſt, becauſe I had not found the particular Book
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101541:49"/>
where his Arguments were, until I had finiſhed my Anſwer to the other four preceeding; yet he was the firſt among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that led them, as into divers other great Errors, ſo into this of rejecting the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> grounding all upon a pretended Divine Inſpiration; and as by that Pretence he did throw down the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> leading many thouſands into the Ditch with him; So by the ſame pretended Authority, he ſet up outward Orders and Ordinances of his own, particularly that of Women's Meetings, giving them Rule and Government in the Church, and appointing all Marriages to come before the Women's Meetings, before they could paſs, or be allowed by the Community; which hath no Footſtep, or Warrant from the Holy Scripture. And when it could not be proved from Scripture, though Eſſayed by him and others, miſerably ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, contrary to their true Senſe; the Reſult was, that it was commanded by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and whoever did not Obey, were judged by him and his Followers, Apoſtates, and Enemies to Truth.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I ſhall bring ſome clear Proofs from Scripture; ſhewing that outward <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> are the Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the Goſpel. And firſt, as to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water.</hi> That is an Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he did command his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, to Practiſe to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>But he commanded them to Practiſe <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore,</p>
               <p>That he commanded them to Practiſe <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. And from what is above Diſcourſed in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Objections, it is apparent that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is there meant.</p>
               <p>And that the Apoſtles, and all the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did underſtand that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> was an Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is clear from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Practice of Believers in the Apoſtles Days; ſo that it cannot be inſtanced where any came under the Profeſſion of Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; but they received <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> either by the Apoſtles, or other Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, That which is declared in Scripture to be a means of Grace and Salvation, and which hath Goſpel Promiſes annexed to it, is a Divine Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>But ſo is <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> as the following Scriptures prove, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. And though theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> will not allow that the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101541:49"/>
Scriptures above-mentioned, are to be underſtood of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; yet by what is above Diſcourſed, in Anſwer to their Objections; it is evident, that they are to be underſtood of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> the Sign being accompanied with the thing ſignified, in all that duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it.</p>
               <p>Again, That which is made a Ground of Unity among the Faithful, together with Faith and Hope, and Calling, is a Divine Inſtitution; but one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as well as one Faith, one Hope, one Calling, is made a Ground of Unity among the Faithful, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>one Baptiſm</hi> there, is the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> (the thing ſignified going along with the Sign) is above proved in the Anſwer to the foregoing Objections. And thus much briefly, for Proof of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> its being an Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the Goſpel, to continue to the end of the World; becauſe he promiſed to be with his Miniſters to the end of the World, in their doing what he commanded them.</p>
               <p>Next, That the <hi>Supper</hi> by breaking of <hi>Bread,</hi> and the uſe of the <hi>Cup</hi> is an Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> until his laſt coming, is proved by the like Arguments, that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is proved to be an Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; for firſt it was commanded by <hi>Chriſt; Do this in remembrance of me; as oft as you Eat this Bread, and Drink this Cup, ye ſhew forth the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Death till he come.</hi> And that this is his outward coming to Judge the World, is above proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a Means of Grace; <hi>the Bread which we break is it not the Communion of the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Body? The Cup which we bleſs is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Blood</hi>? That is, are they not, both Signs and Means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting to us the Communion of his Body and Blood, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings that come to Believers thereby? For indeed all the Signs that ever <hi>God</hi> appointed to his People, were Means of Grace, and not bare Signs or Symbols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Supper,</hi> is made a ground of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the Faithful, as well as <hi>Baptiſm; we being many are one Bread, and all are made partakers of that one Bread.</hi> The Objections made againſt the Senſe of theſe and the like Scriptures, are above fully An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; ſo that I ſee no occaſion to ſay any more at preſent, by way of Argument on this Subject.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Containing ſome Obſervations upon ſome Paſſages, in a Book of</hi> W. Penn, <hi>call'd,</hi> A Caveat againſt Popery; <hi>and on ſome Paſſages of a Book of</hi> John Pennington, <hi>call'd,</hi> The Fig-Leaf Covering Diſcovered.</p>
            <p>IN a Book of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> called, <hi>A Seaſonable Caveat againſt Popery,</hi> Printed in the Year 1670. I find the following Paſſage, p. 18. <hi>But if there be ſome Virtue ſignified by the Wine, more than by the Bread, it is horrid Sacriledge to Rob the Sign, much more the thing ſignified. It is a Supper, and at Supper there ſhould be to Drink, as well as to Eat; there can be no Body without Blood, and the Drinking of his Blood, ſhews a Shedding of his Blood for the World, and a Participation of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Sign is incompleat, and the end of that Sacrament, or Sign, not fully Anſwered, but plainly maimed, and what</hi> God <hi>hath put together, they have put aſunder; ſo that the Falſeneſs and Inſcriptural Practice of theſe Men are very manifeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> Reader: Wouldeſt thou not think by theſe Words, that <hi>W. Penn</hi> was in good earneſt, Pleading for the Sacrament (as he calls it) or Sign of the Supper? And hadſt thou not known that <hi>W. Penn</hi> was the Author of that Book; would'ſt thou not have concluded, whoever was the Author was rightly Principl'd for the <hi>Supper,</hi> compleatly Adminiſtred under both Signs, by the Arguments he brings for it? as firſt, If there be ſome Virtue ſignified by the <hi>Wine,</hi> more than by the <hi>Bread,</hi> it is horrid Sacriledge to Rob the Sign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Antecedent is true, by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> otherwiſe his Argument is vain; and therefore the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt be true, which is this; It is horrid Sacriledge to Rob the Sign. Now if it be horrid Sacriledge in the Popiſh Prieſts and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to Rob the Sign of <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Supper</hi>; is it not as horrid, or rather more horrid Sacriledge in <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and the reſt of the Teachers of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to have Robb'd both the Signs, the <hi>Bread</hi> as well as the <hi>Wine?</hi> and under the Guilt of this Robbery and Sacriledge they ſtill continue, I wiſh they may Repent of it, that they may find Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His ſecond Argument is this. <hi>It is a Supper, and at Supper there ſhould be to Drink, as well as to Eat.</hi> But how is it a <hi>Supper,</hi> when there
<pb facs="tcp:101541:50"/>
is neither to Eat nor to Drink: If the Popiſh Teachers have maimed the <hi>Supper,</hi> which he blames them for; how much more is he and his Brethren Blameworthy, who have quite Aboliſhed it? His third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Cup is, the Drinking of his Blood, ſhews a Shedding of his Blood; but how doth it ſhew it among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have totally Aboliſhed the <hi>Bread</hi> as well as the <hi>Cup</hi>? His fourth Argument is, <hi>the Sign is incompleat, and the end of that Sacrament or Sign, not fully Anſwered.</hi> But how is the end of that Sacrament, or Sign any wiſe Anſwered among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have Aboliſhed both Signs? His fifth Argument is, <hi>what</hi> God <hi>hath put together, they have put aſunder</hi>; ſo that the Falſneſs and Inſcriptural Practice of theſe Men is very manifeſt. Now to Proſecute and Retort his Argument upon himſelf; If it be a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin to put a ſunder what <hi>God</hi> hath put together; is it not as hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or rather more, to put away, or Aboliſh both things which <hi>God</hi> hath put together? If they do Evil that ſeparate Man and Wife, whom <hi>God</hi> hath joyned, or put together; do not they worſe who kill them both?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Arguments are only on Suppoſition, and uſed againſt the Papiſts, <hi>ad hominem.</hi> I Anſwer, firſt, This doth not appear by his Words, which are Poſitive. Secondly, If here he only Argues on Suppoſition, and <hi>ad hominem</hi>; how ſhall we know when he Argueth Poſitively, and is in good earneſt? Thirdly, His Arguments ſeem to me and; I think they will ſeem to many others, not only Poſitive, but more valid and ſtrong, than any Arguments he hath brought againſt them.</p>
            <p>Again, In the ſame Book, p. 20. concerning the Sacrifice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, he ſaith—notwithſtanding the Scripture expreſly tells us, <hi>that we have our High Prieſt, that needs not Sacrifice once a year, but who hath offered one Sacrifice, and that by the will of God we are Sanctified, through the Offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, once for all and that by one Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he perfected them that are Sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.10, 11, 14. <hi>Yet do they daily Sacrifice him a freſh,</hi> As if his firſt were inſufficient, or their daily Sins required a new one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> Do not theſe Arguments of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his being daily Offered up a Sacrifice in the Maſs, prove as effectually, <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Doctrin to be falſe, in their Defence of <hi>W. Smith,</hi> who ſaid, in p. 64. of his Primmer, ſecond Part; <hi>we believe that Chriſt in us doth offer up himſelf a living Sacrifice unto God for us; by which the Wrath and Juſtice of God is appeaſed towards us.</hi> This <hi>W. Penn</hi> Confirms
<pb facs="tcp:101541:51"/>
in his <hi>Rejoynder to</hi> J. Faldo, p. 285. <hi>ſaying, that Chriſt offers himſelf in his Children, in the nature of a Mediating Sacrifice; and that Chriſt is a Mediator, and an Attoner in the Conſciences of his People, at what time they ſhall fall under any Miſcarriage, if they unfeignedly Repent, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2. and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> is very large in the Defence and Confirmation of it, in his Book, called, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> p. 44. And Quotes at leaſt ſeven ſeveral places of Scripture to prove it, <hi>viz. That Chriſt in them doth offer up himſelf a Sacrifice unto God for them, by which the Wrath and Juſtice of God is appeaſed towards them.</hi> All which Scriptures, and many more, reſpecting the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Christ</hi> without us, and his Blood outwardly Shed, they have moſt groſly Perverted and Miſapplyed to a ſuppoſed Daily Offering of <hi>Christ</hi> by way of Sacrifice in them to Appeaſe the Wrath and Juſtice of <hi>God.</hi> Now let <hi>W. Penn</hi> Anſwer to his own Arguments which he had uſed againſt the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Maſs; for any that are not wilfully blind may ſee, they are of equal force againſt his ſuppoſed and invented Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> daily offered in every <hi>Quaker</hi> when they Sin, to Appeaſe the Wrath and Juſtice of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I think fit to repeat ſome Queſtions I Propoſed to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> by way of Argument, againſt this falſe Notion of his, (and of <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> which they Originally received from <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and he it is very probable from Familiſts and Ranters, who had the ſame Notion, as I can eaſily prove) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers up himſelf in them, to Appeaſe the Wrath and Juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> in the Nature of a Mediating Sacrifice. (Note Reader, theſe Words beſpeak their Senſe to be a Sacrifice, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrictly ſo taken; yea, the Sacrifice within, to be the only real and ſtrict Sacrifice; for the other without, of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the Type, the Hiſtory. The Lamb without, ſhews forth the Lamb within, ſaid <hi>W. Penn,</hi> one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing cannot be the proper Figure, or Repreſentation of another outward thing). Theſe Queſtions are in my Book, called, <hi>Groſs Error and Hypocriſie Detected</hi> in <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and ſome of his Brethren, p. 20. And I have juſt cauſe to propoſe them again, to his and his Brethrens Conſideration; becauſe I have not to this Day received any Anſwer to them, either from <hi>W. Penn,</hi> or <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> nor from <hi>Tho. Elwood,</hi> who hath Writ a pretended Anſwer to this very Book, called, <hi>Groſs Error</hi>; &amp;c. who hath paſſed by, not only theſe Queries containing ſo many Arguments as there are Queries; but the other chief things in that Book; and yet he and his Brethren Glory, how they have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb facs="tcp:101541:51"/>
all my Books, when in effect they have Anſwered none of them to purpoſe, and ſome of them not at all; as my ſecond Narrative of the Proceedings of the Meeting at <hi>Turner</hi>'s-<hi>Hall,</hi> that has been above a Year in Print; (as no more have they Anſwered to <hi>Satan Diſrob'd</hi>; done by the Author of the <hi>Snake in the Graſs</hi>; being a Reply to <hi>Tho. Elwood</hi>'s pretended Anſwer to my firſt Narrative, which ſaved me the Labour of Replying to it.) And indeed, the Book, called, <hi>Groſs Error,</hi> &amp;c. has been in Print near three Years, and yet no Anſwer has been given to theſe Queries; which are as follow. 1. If Satisfaction be totally Excluded (as <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath Argued againſt the Satisfaction of the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> without us; and by his Death and Sufferings on the Croſs, <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing,</hi> p. 91. becauſe a Sin, or Debt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both Paid and Forgiven; what need is there of a Mediating Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within Men, more than without them? 2. Seeing it is the Nature of all Sacrifices for Sin, that they be Slain, and their Blood Shed; how is <hi>Chriſt</hi> Slain in his Children, and when? For we Read in Scripture, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> lived in the Faithful, as he did in <hi>Paul</hi>; but not that he is Slain in them. 3. If any Slay the Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them by their Sins; doth not that hinder the Life to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Argument; that the Killing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, being the Act of Wicked Men, could be no Meritorious Act? 4. Where doth the Scripture ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers himſelf up in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a Sacrifice for Sin? 5. Is not this to make many Sacrifices, or at leaſt to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers himſelf often, yea, Millions of times, contrary to Scripture, that ſaith, <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered up himſelf once? 6. Why could no Beaſt under the Law, that had a Blemiſh, be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but to ſignifie that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to offer up himſelf in no other Body, but that which was without all Sin? 7. Why was it Prophecied of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; a Body haſt thou prepared me, why not Bodies many, if he offer up himſelf in the Bodies of all the Saints? 8. Is not this to make the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> of leſs Value and Efficacie in his own Body, than his Sacrifice in <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Body? becauſe the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in that Body that was offered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the Type, this in <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Anti-type; That the Hiſtory, This the Myſtery. 9. Doth not this ſtrengthen the Papiſts in their falſe Faith; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Maſs, an unbloody Sacrifice? I deſire that <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> will give a poſitive Anſwer to theſe Queries; and ſhew, wherein my Arguments againſt their Notion of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being offered a Sacrifice in Men, are not ſo ſtrong againſt them, as <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:101541:52"/>
are againſt the Papiſt's Notion; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is offered up daily in the Maſs.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Note, Reader, Whereas my Adverſaries, <hi>Tho. Elwood,</hi> and <hi>J. Pennington,</hi> in their Books againſt me, have brought ſeveral Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of ſome of my former Books, particularly <hi>The Way caſt up,</hi> p. 99. and <hi>The Way to the City of God,</hi> p. 125. on purpoſe to prove that I was of the ſame Mind and Perſuaſion with <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> being a real Sacrifice for Sin in Men, to Appeaſe the Wrath and Juſtice of <hi>God</hi>; and his being the Seed of the Woman in them, having Fleſh and Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without any Metaphor, or Allegory, or other Figurative Speech, is what I altogether deny, can be inferred from my Words; for as I have ſhewed in my Book of <hi>Immed. Revel.</hi> p. 14.15, 16. (which <hi>John Pennington</hi> hath perverſly applyed in his Book, called, <hi>The Figg-Leaf Covering,</hi> p. 5.4.) <hi>The Spiritual Diſcerning of the Saints (in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is held forth under the Names of all the five Senſes;—In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the things of God themſelves, are held forth in Scripture, under the Names of ſenſible things, and which are moſt Taking, Pleaſant and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing unto the Senſes; as Light, Fire, Water, Oyl, Wine, Oyntment, Honey, Marrow and Fatneſs, Bread, Manna, and many other ſuch like Names, which I expreſly grant are Metaphors; yet that hinders not</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>but that the Spiritual Myſteries Repreſented under them, and ſignified by them, are real and ſubſtantial things; to wit,</hi> God's <hi>Power and Virtue, Spirit, Light, and Life, and the wondrous ſweet and precious Workings and Influences thereof (which I expreſly mention,</hi> p. 14.) <hi>and indeed theſe outward things are but Figures of the Inward and Spiritual, which as far exceed and tranſcend them, in Life, Glory, Beauty, and Excellency, as a living Body doth the Shadow.</hi> Now all this I ſtill firmly hold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as much as formerly, when I Writ thoſe Words; for indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have not proper Words, whereby to ſignifie Spiritual and Divine Enjoyments and Refreſhments in the Souls of the Faithful; therefore Words are borrowed, and transferred from their common Signification, to a Metaphorical, and Allegorical; whereby to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Spiritual Enjoyments and Refreſhments of the Saints, from what they Witneſs and Experience of the Power, Vertue, Light, Life, and Love of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them. So that I ſtill ſay, the outward Light of Sun, Moon, Star, or Candle, is but a Shadow, or Figure, campared with the Divine Light of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> within; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bread, Wine, Fleſh, though ever ſo excellent that the outward
<pb facs="tcp:101541:52"/>
Man taſts of, is but a Figure and Shadow; being compared with that inward Bread of Life, inward Wine and Fleſh, Oyl, and Honey, that is inwardly taſted and received by the inward Man. But behold the wretched perverſion that my Prejudiced Adverſary, <hi>John Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> puts upon my ſound Words, and the wretched Concluſion that he draws from thence; as if therefore I did hold then, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was but a Shadow, or Sign of the inward Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Men, and his outward Sacrifice and Blood outwardly Shed, was but a Figure and Shadow of his being a Sacrifice within Men, and his Blood inwardly Shed; which as it hath no Shadow of Conſequence from any Words, ſo it never came into my Thoughts, ſo to imagine; for in that place of my Book, of <hi>Immed. Rev.</hi> above quoted by him, I did not compare <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death without, and his Death within, or his Blood without, to his Blood within; making That the Shadow and Figure, and This the Subſtance, as they do: But I was comparing the outward Meats and Drinks, as Bread, Fleſh, Wine, Marrow and Fatneſs, with the Divine Enjoyments of the Saints, which borrow the Names of theſe outward things, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are but Figures and Shadows.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And when I ſaid in ſome of my former Books, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Seed of the Woman, that bruiſed the Serpents Head in the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all Ages; I did not mean that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> was a Figure, or Allegory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Birth, or Formation in the Saints. But on the contrary, <hi>Chriſt</hi> inwardly Formed, is the Allegory and Metaphor; yet ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> inwardly enjoyed in the Saints, is a real Divine Subſtantial Enjoyment and Participation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Life, Grace and Virtue, in meaſure which they receive out of the Fulneſs of the Glorified Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in Heaven; for though to Call <hi>Chriſt</hi> inwardly the Seed Born, or Crucified, is Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical; yet the inward Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Real and Subſtantial that the Saints Enjoy; and being a Meaſure out of the Fulneſs that is in the Glorified Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in Heaven, it is of the ſame Nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and it is one and the ſame Mediatory Spirit, and Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in him; the Head dwelling in Fulneſs, and in them in Meaſure, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>to every one of us is Grace given, according to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he quotes me in his 55th p. ſaying; <hi>This is the promiſed Seed which God promiſed to our Parents after the Fall, and actually gave unto them, even the Seed of the Woman, that ſhould bruiſe the Head of the
<pb facs="tcp:101541:53"/>
Serpent.</hi> But doth this prove, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> being inwardly Formed in the Saints, was more properly (and without all Allegory Metaphor, or Synecdoche) the Seed of the Woman, than as he was Born of the Virgin? I ſay nay; though he would ſtrain my Words to this, to bring me into the ſame Ditch with him and his Brethren; who make <hi>Chriſt</hi> without, the Type and Hiſtory, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, the Subſtance and Myſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the promiſed Seed was actually given to Believers, immediately after the Fall, hath this plain Orthodox Senſe.</hi> That the Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Godhead or the Eternal Word that was in the beginning, and which was in the Fulneſs of Time, to take Fleſh and Blood, like unto the Children, did actually break the Power of Sin and Satan in the Faithful; and this Power was the real Power of the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and what that Power effected and wrought in the Faithful, in the Ages before <hi>Chriſt</hi> came into the Fleſh, it was with Reſpect to his coming in the Fleſh, and to what he was to do and ſuffer in his Body of Fleſh for their Sins. And what I ſaid, as Quoted by him, page 35. out of my Book, <hi>Way to the City of God,</hi> page 125. <hi>Even from the beginning, yea, upon Man's Fall,</hi> God <hi>was in</hi> Chriſt <hi>Reconciling the World to himſelf, and</hi> Chriſt <hi>was manifeſt in the Holy Seed inwardly, and ſtood in the way to ward off the Wrath of</hi> God, <hi>from the Sinners and Unholy, that it might not come upon them to the uttermoſt, during the Day of their Viſitation.</hi> All this, or what ever elſe of that ſort, I have ſaid, in any of my Books, hath a ſafe and ſound Senſe, rightly underſtood; though this Prejudiced Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, ſeeks by his own Perverſion to turn them to the contrary: The Word <hi>Reconciling, Redeeming,</hi> hath a two-fold Signification; the one is to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, and pay the Debt of our Sins; this was only done by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he Suffered for us in the Fleſh; the other is to Operate, and Work in us, in order to ſlay the Hatred and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is in us, while Unconverted; that being Converted, we may enjoy that inward Peace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he hath Purchaſed for us by his Death and Sufferings, Now that the Light, Word, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, gently Operates and Works in Men, to turn and incline them to Love <hi>God,</hi> to Fear him, and Obey him, to Believe and Truſt in him; that is, to Reconcile Men to <hi>God,</hi> and to ward, or keep off the Wrath of <hi>God</hi> from them: And thus, <hi>God was in Chriſt, Reconciling the World to him in all Ages.</hi> But this is not by way of <hi>Satisfaction to Divine Juſtice for Men's Sins</hi>; but by way of <hi>Application,</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi>; inwardly Inviting, Perſuading, and as it were Intreating Men to be Reconciled
<pb facs="tcp:101541:53"/>
unto <hi>God</hi>; that ſo the Wrath of <hi>God</hi> that hangs over their Heads, may not fall upon them; for while <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> thus inwardly viſits the Souls of Men, inviting and perſuading them to turn and live; ſaying, <hi>why will ye Dye?</hi> the Wrath is ſuſpended, and delayed to be Executed upon them; yet it is not removed, but abides upon them, until they Repent and Believe, as the Scripture teſtifieth; <hi>he that believeth not, the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And though this inward Appearance, and Operation in <hi>Christ</hi> in Men's Hearts, ſtayeth the Execution of Divine Wrath and Juſtice; yet that inward Appearance, is not the Procuring and Meritorious Cauſe of Men's Reconciliation with <hi>God</hi>; but the Means whereby, what <hi>Christ</hi> by his Death and Sufferings hath Purchaſed, is applyed; for though <hi>Christ</hi> made Peace for us by his Blood outwardly Shed; yet that Peace cannot be, nor is obtained, or received by any, but as the Soul is inwardly Changed and Converted, and ſo Reconciled unto <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. And the like twofold Signification, hath the Word to <hi>Attone</hi>; for as it ſignifieth to Attone, or Reconcile <hi>God</hi> and us, that wholly is procured by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Obedience unto Death, and Sacrifice that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for Men on the Croſs; but as it ſignifieth the effectual Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great Attonement, made by <hi>Christ</hi> for Men at his Death; that is wrought by his Spirit, and inward Appearance in their Hearts. And I might well ſay, at Man's Fall, <hi>the Seed of the Woman was given, not only to bruiſe the Serpent's Head, but alſo to be a Lamb or Sacrifice, to Attone and Pacify the Wrath of God towards Men</hi>; as he Quotes me in my Book, <hi>Way to the City,</hi> p. 125. For taking <hi>Attoning</hi> in the firſt Senſe, the Virtue, Merit, and Efficacy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacrifice on the Croſs, did as really extend to the Faithful for Remiſſion of Sin, and bringing into Reconciliation and Peace with <hi>God,</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, as it now doth; which this Prejudiced Author ſeems wholly ignorant of, as well as his Brethren: Again taking it in the ſecond Senſe, for the effectual Application of the Attonment made by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death, through his Meek and Lamb-like Appearance by his Spirit and Life in Men's Hearts, it has a Truth in it: And <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſaid to be the Lamb of <hi>God</hi> that taketh away the Sins of the World; both by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance in the Fleſh, as he Dyed for us, to Procure and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Pardon of our Sins, and our Juſtification before <hi>God</hi>; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his inward Appearance, to Renew and Sanctifie us; for as by our Juſtification the Guilt of Sin is taken away; ſo by our Sanctification is the Filth of it removed: Both which is the Work of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Lamb
<pb facs="tcp:101541:54"/>
of <hi>God</hi> reſpecting both his outward and inward Appearance; in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being a Sin-offering for us, and a Sacrifice in a ſtrict Senſe; in his inward Appearance of his Divine Life in us, being as a <hi>Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and Sacrifice of ſweet ſmelling Incenſe before <hi>God</hi>; not to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>God</hi> and us, as is above ſaid; but to apply effectually to us, the Reconciliation made for us by his Death on the Croſs.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And that I ſaid (as he again Quotes me) the Seed hath been the ſame in all Ages, and hath had its Sufferings, under, by, and for the Sins of Men in them all, for the Removing and Aboliſhing them; This I ſtill hold, that there is a tender Suffering Seed, or Principle in Men, that ſuffers by Men's Sins, and by its gentle Strivings, prevails and gains the Victory at laſt in all the Heirs of Salvation. But this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Seed, or Principle, I never held it to be <hi>God,</hi> nor was I ever of that Mind, that <hi>God</hi> did <hi>really and properly Suffer by Men's</hi> Sins; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have known divers to hold ſuch an abſurd Opinion, as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath plainly declared to be his Opinion in his <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> p. 56. which is as really Repugnant, both to Scripture and ſound Reaſon, as to hold that <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>Bodily Parts and Members</hi>; becauſe the Scripture in many places, in condeſcenſion to our human Capacities, ſpeaks of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Suffering, Repentance, being grieved</hi>; as it doth of his <hi>Face, Eyes, Ears, Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi>; all which ought not to be properly, but Allegorically underſtood. And though I hold that this tender Seed ſuffers in Men by their Sins, that ſo by its gentle Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings with them, it may overcome them, and Slay and Crucifie the Body of Sin in them; Yet I hold not that Suffering to be the <hi>Procuring</hi> and <hi>Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, and Pardon of Sins before</hi> God; nor do I remember any where that I have ſo ſaid or writ; if any ſhall ſhew me where, I ſhall readily Correct and Retract it, or any thing in any of my Books that looks that way: And if any Query whether I hold that Seed to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that doth ſo ſuffer in Men by their Sins; I Anſwer, It is not the Fulneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but a Meaſure proceeding from the Fulneſs that was, and is lodged in the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe the Fulneſs is not in us, and never was, or ſhall be in any Man, but in the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> alone, that was Born of the Virgin; therefore he, and he only, becauſe of the Fulneſs of Grace and Truth that was and is in him, was Ordained and Appointed to be the <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>only,</hi> and <hi>alone Sacrifice</hi> for the Sins of the World, being <hi>the Head of the Body,</hi> which is his Church, it was only proper that the Sufferings that ſhould be in the Head only; ſhould be that <hi>compleat, only, and alone Satisfactory,
<pb facs="tcp:101541:54"/>
and Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of Men</hi>; As the Arguments above mentioned in my Queries to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> do plainly demonſtrate: And though in <hi>Chriſt</hi> when he Suffered for the Sins of the World at his Death, his Godhead did not Suffer, yet all that was in him (the Godhead excepted) did Suffer.</p>
            <p>Note again, Reader, That although I find no cauſe to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Book of <hi>John Pennington,</hi> above-mentioned, called, <hi>The Fig-Leaf Covering,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe I had ſaid in my ſecond Narrative, p. 33. that very Book, (being a pretended Anſwer to my Book of <hi>Explications and Retractations</hi>) is ſuch a plain and evident Diſcovery of his Unjuſt, and Unfair Proceedings againſt me (whereof the whole ſecond Days Meeting, who hath approved his Book is Guilty) and of his Ignorance and Perverſneſs of Spirit, in Perverting my Words; that I ſee no need to give any other Anſwer to him, or direct to any other Anſwer, (either to his <hi>Fig-Leaf,</hi> &amp;c. or his Book <hi>Keith againſt Keith,</hi> or any other his Books) but his own very Book, and Books compared fairly with my Books, Quoted by him; and particularly that of my <hi>Explications and Retractations</hi>; yet becauſe I find divers Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in that Book of his, plainly prove him and his Brethren of the ſecond Days Meeting extreamly Erroneous in the great things of the Chriſtian Doctrin, ſome of them being Fundamental; therefore I ſhall take notice of the following Paſſages; partly to give the Reader a taſt of his Unfair Dealing towards me, and partly to ſhew his being ſtill Erroneous in ſome great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith; together with his Brethren of the ſecond Days Meeting, who have approved his <hi>Fig-Leaf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 19 and 20 Pages, he will needs faſten a Contradiction on me: That one time, <hi>by the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> John 6. I mean an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inviſible Subſtance, and the Eating an inward inviſible Eating. But now in my Retractations, I Aſſert, that to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he gave his Body of Fleſh outwardly to be broken for us, is the Eating of his Fleſh, as well as the inward Enjoyment of his Life in us. And to confirm the Contradiction, he Quotes me, ſaying, <hi>Immed. Revel. p.</hi> 258. <hi>This Body of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>of which we partake, is not that which he took up when he came in the Fleſh outwardly, but that which he had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Anſ.</hi> Firſt, It is no Contradiction, to ſay, <hi>the Eating of Chriſt's Fleſh,</hi> John 6. is to believe (not by a bare Hiſtorical Belief, but by a living ſincere Faith Wrought in us by the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt) that Chriſt gave his outward Body to be broken for us</hi>; and alſo that it is the inward
<pb facs="tcp:101541:55"/>
Enjoyment of his Life in us; as it is no Contradiction, to ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our Intire and compleat Saviour; both as he came outwardly in the Fleſh, Dyed and Roſe again, &amp;c. And as he cometh inwardly by his Spirit into our Hearts, and dwelleth in us by Faith. And as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Quotation, <hi>Immed. Rev.</hi> p. 258. by <hi>this Body,</hi> in that place; I did mean that which is only Allegorically called his Body, to wit, that <hi>Middle of Communication,</hi> above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mentioned; that is indeed a Spiritual and inviſible Subſtance, owned by <hi>R.B.</hi> as well as by me, and many others. And I ſay ſtill, this inviſible Spiritual Subſtance in the Saints, is not that viſible Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which he aſſumed when he came in the Fleſh outwardly; yet this is not to make two Bodies of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; becauſe the one is called his Body, only in a Metaphorical Senſe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. In my Book of <hi>Retractations,</hi> p. 25. I had plainly Retracted and Corrected that Paſſage, in p. 25. <hi>Recor. Corr. That by Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> John 6.50, 51. He meaneth only Spirit and Life; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was at moſt an Overſight in me; but how doth this prove me a Changling in an Article of Faith? As he infers very Injurouſly: May not a Man change his Judgment concerning the Senſe of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place of Scripture, without changing an Article of Faith? That ſuch a Change may be, without a Change in an Article of Faith, is acknowledged by all Sober Writers and Expoſitors of Scripture. Yea, there are many places of Scripture, that ſome underſtand one way, and others not that way, but another, and others a third way; and yet all have one Faith in point of Doctrin. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. What a Man Retracts in one Book, or part of a Book, he ought to be underſtood to Retract the ſame Paſſage, where it can be found in another Part, or Book of his; nor ought he to be Charged with Contradiction, in what he hath Retracted. For as I have formerly ſaid in Print, they are only Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Contradictions that without Retractation, holds Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Aſſertions, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> i. e. both together.</p>
            <p>Page 22. He will not permit me to uſe that Diſtinction, to ſay, I had not my Knowledge from them, (<hi>viz.</hi> The Scriptures) as being the efficient Cauſe, but I did not deny that I had my Knowledge by them Inſtrumentally; to wit, the Doctrinal Knowledge and Faith I had of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Truths; he Quibbles upon the Word <hi>from,</hi> as if it could not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſometimes the efficient Cauſe, and ſometimes the Inſtrumental; whereas a School Boy knoweth that it hath theſe ſeveral Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and more alſo. And ſeeing what I then Writ in my Book of <hi>Immed. Rev.</hi> was owned by the Quakers, it plainly followeth, That according to <hi>J.P.</hi> the Words of Scripture are not a Means ſo much as
<pb facs="tcp:101541:55"/>
Inſtrumentally to our Knowledge of the Truths of Chriſtian Doctrin. But how will he Reconcile this to <hi>W. Penn</hi>; who doth acknowledge that the Scriptures are a Means to know <hi>God, Chriſt</hi> and our ſelves? See his <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> p. 115. where he expreſly ſaith; <hi>We never denied the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be a means in</hi> God's <hi>Hand, to Convince, Inſtruct, or Confirm.</hi> By <hi>we,</hi> its plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>W. P.</hi> meant all the Quakers; and conſequently <hi>G. K.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then owned to be one of them.</p>
            <p>Page 39. He will not allow, that what I have Quoted out of my <hi>Immed. Revel.</hi> p. 243. to p. 247. proves that I did then hold the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us in Heaven, to be the <hi>Object of our Faith</hi>; though he grants my Words that I ſaid, <hi>The Man Chriſt who Suffered in the Fleſh at Jeruſalem, is the Spring out of which all the living Streams flow into our Souls,</hi> and that he is to be Prayed unto, which he ſaith none of us deny. And yet with the ſame Breath as it were he denyeth it; for if the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be Prayed unto, being the Spring out of which all the living Streams flow unto our Souls; ſurely as ſuch he is the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of our Faith; for how can we Pray to an <hi>Object</hi> in whom we <hi>believe not?</hi> But ſeeing he will not allow me, that I then owned the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us to be the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith (wherein he is moſt unjuſt unto me) and that I Writ then as a Quaker, and my Doctrin was the Quakers Doctrin; It is evident, that according to him, it was not the Quakers Doctrin, that the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us, is in any Part or Reſpect the Object of our Faith; why then doth he, and many others Accuſe me, that I Bely them, for ſaying they hold it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Salvation, that we believe in the Man <hi>Christ</hi> without us? And it is either great Ignorance, or Inſincerity in him, to ſay, that none of them deny that the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us in Heaven, is to be Prayed unto; Seeing a Quaker of great Note among them, <hi>William Shewen,</hi> hath Printed it in his Book of <hi>Thoughts,</hi> p. 37. <hi>Not to Jeſus the Son of Abraham, David and Mary, Saint or Angel; but to God the Father, all Worſhip, Honour and Glory is to be given, through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but ſome other <hi>Jeſus</hi>; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Light within; otherwiſe there would be a Contradiction in his Words; ſo here he Aſſerts two <hi>Jeſus's</hi> with a witneſs; what ſaith <hi>J. Pennington</hi> to this?</p>
            <p>Page 41. In Oppoſition to my <hi>Chriſtian Aſſertion,</hi> that the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> before <hi>Christ</hi> came in the Fleſh, did believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he was to be Born, Suffer Death, Riſe and Aſcend; and ſo the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even before he was Conceived, Born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was the Object of their
<pb facs="tcp:101541:56"/>
Faith; He thus moſt Ignorantly and Erroneouſly Argueth.—<hi>Could that be the Object of theirs,</hi> (viz. <hi>The believing Gentiles</hi>) <hi>or of the Jews Faith, which our Lord had not yet received of the Virgin, which was not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor Born, much leſs Aſcended? Anſ.</hi> Yes, That can be an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith and Hope, which has not a preſent Exiſtence, but is <hi>quid' futurum,</hi> ſomething to come; though nothing can be an Object of our Bodily Sight, or other Bodily Senſes, but what is in Being, and hath a real Exiſtence in the preſent Time. But ſo Stupid and Groſs is he, that he cannot underſtand this, that the Faith of the Saints could have a future <hi>Object,</hi> in any Part or Reſpect; this is to make Faith as low and weak a thing as Bodily Senſe. Is it not generally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that the Saints of old, as <hi>Abraham, Moſes, David</hi> believed in <hi>Christ,</hi> the Promiſed Seed as he was to come, and be Born, and Suffer Death for the Sins of the World, according to our Saviours Words, <hi>Abraham ſaw my Day and was glad</hi>; which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood by Expoſitors; that as he ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> inwardly in Spirit, ſo he ſaw that he was to come' outwardly, and be his Son according to the Fleſh; and by what Eye did he ſee this, but by the Eye of Faith? And that Eye of Faith had <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come in the Fleſh, to be Born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for its Object as a thing to come.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame Page 41. He Quoteth me falſly, ſaying, <hi>Immed. Rev.</hi> p. 132. agreeing with both Papiſts and Proteſtants, <hi>That God ſpeaking in Men is the Formal Object of Faith.</hi> This Quotation is Falſe in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, as well as his Inference from it is Falſe and Ignorant. I ſaid in that p. 132. That both Papiſts and Proteſtants agree in this; <hi>That the Formal Object of Faith is God ſpeaking</hi>; but quoth the Papiſt, it is the Speaking in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; no, quoth the Proteſtant; <hi>God</hi> Speaking in the Scriptures, is the Formal Object of Faith. Here I plainly ſhew the difference of Papiſts and Proteſtants, about the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object of Faith</hi>; though they agree in one Part, that it is <hi>God</hi> Speaking; yet in the other Part they differ; the Papiſts making it, <hi>God</hi> Speaking in the Church; that is, not in every Believer, but in the Pope and his Counſel. And there in that, and ſome following Pages, I Plead for Internal Revelation of the Spirit; not only Subjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Objectively Working in the Souls of Believers; to which Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony I ſtill Adhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what then? Doth this prove that <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us is no Object of our Faith? Will he meddle with <hi>School Terms,</hi> and yet underſtand them no more than a Fool? Doth neither he, nor his <hi>quondam</hi> Tutor, <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> underſtand that the <hi>res credendae,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101541:56"/>
i. e. The things to be believed, are Ingredients in the <hi>Material Object of Faith</hi>; as not only that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came in the Fleſh, was Born of a Virgin; but all the Doctrins, and Doctrinal Propoſitions ſet forth in Scripture, concerning <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all the Articles of Faith, are <hi>the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Object of our Faith</hi>; but the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> is the inward Teſtimony of the Spirit, moving our Underſtandings and Hearts to believe and cloſe with the Truth of them? All which are well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, and owned by me.</p>
            <p>Page 43. He Rejects my Expoſition of the Parable, concerning the loſt piece of Money, in my late Retractation of my former Miſtake, p. 15. Sect. 1. p. 10. <hi>That by the loſt piece of Money, is to be underſtood the Souls of Men; as by the loſt Sheep, and the loſt Prodigal.</hi> To this he moſt Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and Falſly oppoſeth, by ſaying: <hi>Firſt, The Lord can find the Soul without lighting a Candle in it.</hi> I Anſwer, By finding, here is meant Converting the Soul; thus the Father of the Prodigal found him, when he Converted him to himſelf; this my Son was loſt, and is found, <hi>i. e. was departed from God, but now is Converted,</hi> Luke 15.32. And ver. 6. <hi>I have found the Sheep that was loſt.</hi> Now, can this be wrought; or doth <hi>God</hi> Work this Work of Converſion in a loſt Soul, without his Lighting a Candle in it? <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith, the very deſign of the Parable, was to ſet forth, not what <hi>God</hi> had loſt, but what Man had loſt; the Candle being uſed by Man who needed it, not by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> who needed it not. How Ignorantly and Stupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he here Argue? How can Man uſe the Candle, unleſs <hi>God</hi> light it in his Heart; and doth not <hi>God</hi> uſe it in order to bring, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Man to himſelf? It's true, though there were no Candle lighted in Man's Heart, <hi>God</hi> ſeeth where the Soul is, even when it is involved in the greateſt Darkneſs; but in order to the Souls Converſion, which is principally <hi>God's</hi> Act, it is <hi>God</hi> that lights the Candle in it, and cauſes his Light to Shine in it. And whereas I have ſaid; they who Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the <hi>loſt Piece of Money,</hi> to be the <hi>Light within</hi>; will find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to ſhew what the nine Pieces are, which are not loſt.—His Anſwer to this is, as Similes ſeldom go on all four; ſo neither muſt Parables be purſued too far. I Anſwer, Though every Circumſtance of a Parable is not to be purſued, yet every neceſſary part of it is; whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Expounds the Parable, is bound to Expound what the nine Pieces are, as well as what the tenth was. But he thinks to pinch me with great Difficulties in my Expoſition. As firſt, He demands whether there be no difficulty to find who the Woman is that had ten Souls,
<pb facs="tcp:101541:57"/>
kept nine, and loſt one. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no difficulty in this, more than in finding who the ninety nine Sheep were that were not loſt; and who the Elder Brother was in the other two Parables: And who they were; I had formerly ſhewn, but that his Prejudice blinds him, that he will not ſee: Many Angelical, Created, Rational Spirits did not Sin, ſo were not loſt; but the Souls of Men did Sin, ſo were loſt.</p>
            <p>And the number nine in the one Parable, and ninety nine in the other, anſwer one to another; the Definite Numbers being put for Indefinite, as is ordinary in Scripture. But he thinks it a mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty according to my Expoſition, to tell what the Houſe was, which in effect has no difficulty at all; the Houſe where the Soul is, as Buried under a great heap of Filth and Sin, is the Body wherein the Soul is Lodged; and the Animal and Natural Faculties, with which alſo the Soul is Defiled; ſo the Houſe, to wit the Body, and Animal and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties, being Swept and Cleanſed by him who hath his Fan in his Hand, purely to Purge his Floor, to wit, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (ſignified here by the Woman) he finds the loſt Soul; for as he ſaid himſelf, <hi>he came to ſeek and to ſave,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>that which was loſt.</hi> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not loſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>God</hi> had not loſt <hi>God</hi>; but they had (in a Senſe) loſt the Souls that had Sinned, as the Souls had loſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>

To be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being Crucified in Men; elſe why doth he oppoſe me with his Queries? and at this rate we ſhall not find any place in the New Teſtament, where <hi>Paul</hi> Preached <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified without Men, but only within; for by the ſame Liberty he may Expound all other Places, only of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified within. But there is no reaſon, why any of theſe places ſhould be underſtood of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Crucifixion in Men; the Crucifying the Old Man is ſo far from being joyned with the inward Crucifying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that it is rather a Sign and Effect of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Power, Triumphing Victoriouſly in Man, than of his being Crucified in Man. The Crucifying <hi>Chriſt</hi> afreſh, is not ſo much the Crucifying him within Men, as its Men Acting ſo Unworthily; as if they did Act over again the <hi>Jews</hi> Part, in Crucifying him outwardly.</p>

And for a Proof he Querieth; Can a Man Retract and Renounce a Paſſage upon Suppoſition, and not know what the Paſſage is?</p>
            <p>But his Query is Impertinent, and hits not the Caſe; a Man may Retract a Saying upon Suppoſition, that he had ſaid it; yet not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ever he ſaid it; as if he were accuſed, that he had ſaid, <hi>B.</hi> is a Diſhoneſt Man, and replyeth, I know not that ever I ſo ſaid; but on Suppoſition that I ſo ſaid, I Retract it.

and at this rate of his blaming me; when <hi>Chriſt</hi> Dyed upon the Croſs; that was not ſo proper a Death, as when he is Crucified in Men by their Sins; and conſequently his Death in Men is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacrifice, for that Mans Sins. His Death without, being not ſo proper a Death, is not a proper Sacrifice, by his moſt Ignorant way of Reaſoning. But my Reaſon for my Aſſertion holds good, and which he has not touched; for when a Man Dyeth, his Soul leaveth the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ceaſeth to Act in it, nor is the Body any more ſenſible; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> Acteth in a Dead Soul, and the Soul, though Dead, is oft made in ſome degree ſenſible of the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Acting in it, in order to its being further quickned; as frequently comes to paſs in Thouſands and Millions of Souls. Beſides, as I Argued; the Union of Soul and Body, is a Perſonal Union, whereby what the Body doth, is chargable upon the Soul; but the Union betwixt the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Men, is not a Perſonal Union; otherwiſe when thoſe Men Sin, their Sin would be chargeable upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

He Ignorantly thinks he hath caught me in a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about owning a Condition in one Senſe, in Reference to <hi>God's</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all Men to be ſaved; <hi>ex parte Objecti,</hi> and denying a Conditional Election. But this is no Contradiction at all; becauſe the Will of <hi>God</hi> is Conditional Objectively, or <hi>ex parte Objecti, i. e.</hi> Men that are the Object of <hi>God's</hi> Will, and yet not Conditional Subjectively, <hi>i. e.</hi> on <hi>God's</hi> Part; if he underſtand not this Diſtinction, I ought not to ſuffer for his Ignorance; he ſhould not meddle with <hi>School-Terms,</hi> except he underſtand them; the diſtinction of Volition, <hi>Conditional Objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and not <hi>Conditional Subjectively; and yet the ſame</hi> Will is common and ordinary in all Authors that Treat on ſuch Subjects.</p>
            <p>Page 69. He is Guilty of great Injury againſt me, in Matter of Fact, by an Unfaithful Reciting of my Words, and thence taking occaſion againſt me.—<hi>In all places in the New Teſtament, where the Word Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is uſed, it ſignifieth the Doctrin of Salvation by the promiſed Meſſiah, that was outwardly to come, and did come in the true Nature of Man,</hi> &amp;c. He quite leaves out my Words, <hi>and did come in the true Nature of Man,</hi> that were neceſſary to perfect the Sentence, and if he had brought them, would have taken away his occaſion of his Quarelling with me ſo Unjuſtly; he ſaith, <hi>here he is out again; for the New Teſtament being Written, not when Chriſt was outwardly come, but after he was outwardly come; the Word</hi> Goſpel <hi>there, when it ſignifieth the Doctrin of Salvation by the promiſed Meſſiah, muſt needs reſpect him, as already come, not as

to come. Anſ.</hi> Where the New Teſtament ſaith, the Goſpel was Preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs; Goſpel there ſignified the Doctrin of Salvation by the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was then to come, and not already come; but at other times it ſignifieth the Doctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> already come, as my Words Cautioned it; therefore he is Guilty of Abuſe and Forgery, like his <hi>quondam</hi> Maſter, <hi>Tho. Elwood,</hi> as elſewhere.</p>

               </gap>mpertinently oppoſeth my ſound Aſſertion, by Quoting <hi>Paul,</hi> mentioning another Goſpel, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6, 8, 9. <hi>For by Goſpel I underſtand the true Goſpel of Chriſt, and not a falſe Goſpel; as when I ſay, every Man is a Rational Creature</hi>; and <hi>J. Pennington,</hi> ſhould Object, a Man Pictured on a Board or Wall, is not a Rational Creature. Is not this a rare Diſputant!</p>
            <p>But his following Oppoſition is the moſt obſervable, and is a new effectual Proof of my Charge againſt him and his Brethren of the 2d. Days Meeting, who have approved his Book, he ſaith by way of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>Alſo when the Everlaſting Goſpel was again to be Preached after the Apoſtacie (for it ſeems by the word</hi> again, <hi>it had been diſcontinued to be Preached; although the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Birth, Death had not) doth that place,</hi> Rev. 14.6, 7. <hi>mention any thing of the Doctrin of Salvation, by the promiſed</hi> Meſſiah? <hi>There is not a word of that ſaid there; but ſaying with a loud voice, fear God, and give Glory to him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(Being Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Commiſſion from on high,) is called Preaching the everlaſting Goſpel. Did</hi> G. K. <hi>(ſaith he) in his diligent ſearch overlook this? if not, how could he ſay in all places in the New Teſtament, where the word Goſpel is uſed, it ſignifieth the Doctrin of Salvation by the promiſed</hi> Meſſiah; <hi>he adds to this two other places, as</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>and</hi> Coloſ. 1.23. <hi>in both which, he will not have the Goſpel to ſignifie the Doctrin of Salvation by Chriſt Crucified, with reſpect to that clear and bright Diſpenſation the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were under (which was the Senſe I gave of the Goſpel, in</hi> Col. 1.23.) <hi>And he ſaith in</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>That the Goſpel cannot be ſaid to be the Power of God unto Salvation, to the Believer, in any other Senſe, than as it is a Powerful, Energetical inward Principle; for as it is barely Hiſtorical, the Ungodly have that Belief, though they want the Power.</hi> This I ſay ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually proves again my Charge againſt them, That they hold it not neceſſary, for us to believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Dyed and Roſe again for our Salvation; why, the Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Is not the Doctrin of Salvation by Chriſt Crucified, the promiſed Meſſiah, and when the everlaſting Goſpel was to be Preached,</hi> Rev. 14.6, 7. (Which the Quakers think they have given them to Preach
<pb facs="tcp:101541:59"/>
(with Commiſſion from on High) the Doctrin of Salvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, was not that Goſpel; the Conſequence is plain, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Faith of <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt</hi> Crucified, is not neceſſary to their Hearers for Salvation. It is not the Everlaſting Goſpel that is given them to Preach; If they Preach it, they go beyond their Commiſſion, they do a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Work. But ſaith <hi>J. P.</hi> Fear <hi>God</hi> and give Glory, to him is called Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel. But is not that alſo a Doctrin? yes, ſurely; ſo then the Doctrin, Fear <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. being Preached, is a Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel; but the Doctrin believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died for our Sins, and Roſe again, being Preached is not Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel; according to <hi>John Pennington,</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Second Days Meeting.</p>
            <p>This Sufficiently ſheweth, that thoſe Quakers are <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame; they are the ſame ſtill, as formerly; though many that hear them of late, ſay, their Way of Preaching is changed; they had wont formerly, before the Difference aroſe betwixt them and <hi>G. K.</hi> to Preach only the Light within, and Obedience to it; but now they Preach the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Death and Sufferings without, and how beneficial they were to Mankind; and that the Faith of it is Beneficial. Yet by <hi>J. P.</hi> his Affirmation approved by the Second Days Meeting of the Friends of the Miniſtry, in and about <hi>London,</hi> whereof <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> are Members, and where frequently they are preſent, The Doctrin of Salvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, is none of the Everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that is given them to Preach; but fear <hi>God,</hi> and give Glory to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how comes it, that believe in the Light within, obey the Light within, and that ſhall ſuffice to your Salvation, is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Angels Commiſſion to Preach the Everlaſting Goſpel, no more than believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified without you? Perhaps <hi>J. P.</hi> will reply, though not mentioned or expreſſed; yet it is implyed, and underſtood. But how prove they it is implyed; that believing in the Light within alone, and obeying it, is ſufficient to Salvation, without Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified? Is not the Blindneſs of theſe Men (for all they talk of Light within) exceeding Great, and the Darkneſs that's over them, like the Darkneſs of <hi>Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that might have been felt? <hi>John</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7.) did not ſay the Angel had nothing elſe to Preach, but fear <hi>God,</hi> and give Glory to him; that Doctrin being a general Doctrin, common both to Law and Goſpel, and both to <hi>true</hi> Gentile <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>true Chriſtian Religion.</hi> The Apoſtacie having been ſo great, that many called Chriſtians were Degenerated below the Heathens, and their Religion ſcarce ſo good, as that of ſome <hi>Heathens</hi> that did fear God, and Worſhip him only; the Angel might Preach
<pb facs="tcp:101541:59"/>
that general Doctrin, as being very proper and neceſſary to call Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Degenerate Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, from their Idolatry and Profanity, as a neceſſary Introduction to the Everlaſting Goſpel; as well as in one Senſe it is a neceſſary part of it, but not the whole Doctrin of the Goſpel; for Faith and Love are as neceſſary Doctrins of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as Fear, though neither of them are expreſly mentioned, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, together with all the other Chriſtian Virtues. But <hi>J. P.</hi> in his Words above Cited, will have it, <hi>That the Goſpel cannot be ſaid to be the Power of God unto Salvation, to the Believer in any other Senſe, than as it is a Powerful energetical inward Principle; for as it is barely Hiſtorical, the Ungodly have that Belief.</hi> I Anſwer, How Fooliſhly doth he here Argue, and Impertinently? whoever ſaid, that the bare Hiſtorical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or Report of <hi>Christ</hi> Crucified, is the Power of <hi>God</hi> unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or if any have ſaid it is the Goſpel, I am ſure I never ſaid nor thought it. But what hath <hi>J. P.</hi> againſt this Senſe of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>That it is the Doctrin of Salvation, by the promiſed Meſſiah, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Spirit of God and Chriſt inwardly Revealed, making it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to be Believed and Obeyed, in all that ſhall be Saved by it; and thus the Goſpel that</hi> Paul <hi>and the other Apoſtles Preached, is not a bare Form of Doctrin without the Spirit and Power, nor the Spirit and Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Doctrin.</hi> And how Non-ſenſical is he to Argue; <hi>that as it is barely Hiſtorical, the Ungodly have that Belief</hi>? But they have not the Saving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Doctrin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified; for that only is wrought in the Godly, by the Power and Spirit of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And though the Ungodly may have the Goſpel Preached unto them; yet while they remain Ungodly, they receive it not, neither do they truly believe it, nor obey it. A bare Hiſtorical Faith, is no more a True Faith, than the bare Picture of a Man, is a Man. Therefore he is Idle to Argue againſt the Saving Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified; becauſe the Ungodly may have the bare Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Belief of it; which differs as widely, as a Dead Body from a a Living Man.</p>
            <p>But it is not enough for <hi>J. P.</hi> to Pervert my Words; but he will be bold to Pervert the Words of the Scripture, and not only put a falſe Gloſs on them; but alledge that to be ſaid in Scripture, which is not ſaid, but is his own Addition. For as I have above Cited him, he ſaith, alſo when the Everlaſting Goſpel was again to be Preached; and he adds in Parentheſis; for it ſeems by the Word <hi>again,</hi> it had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued to be Preached; although the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Birth, Death had not. Now, Reader, open the Bible, and Read that place,
<pb facs="tcp:101541:60"/>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7. and thou wilt find the Word <hi>again</hi> is not there to be found; (but in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>Some Principles,</hi> p. 22. it is found) and yet he Grounds his Argument upon this Pillar, <hi>again</hi>; by which he inferreth, that to his ſeeming, the Everlaſting Goſpel had been diſcontinued to be Preached, although the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Birth, Death had not. And this diſcontinuing of the Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel, he and his Brethren think did remain, until <hi>G. Fox</hi> and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers began to Preach it. For <hi>ſaith G. Fox and his Brethren, in the Book, called,</hi> Some Principles of the Elect People of God, <hi>Printed it</hi> London, 1671. In p. 48. <hi>But many People ſpeak after this manner; Have we not had the Goſpel all this time till now?</hi> Anſ. <hi>We ſay no, you have had the Sheeps Cloathing, while you are Alienated from the Spirit; and ſo not living in the Power, which is the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. But as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7. The Word <hi>again</hi> is not to be found, nor will the <hi>Greek</hi> bear it; ſo nor is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that there was a diſcontinuing of the Preaching of it altogether; for had the Goſpel ceaſed, the Church had ceaſed alſo, and Faith and Salvation had ceaſed. The moſt that can be inferred, is, that the Preaching of it was not ſo common and frequent, as formerly; it had met with a great Stoppage and Oppoſition in many parts of the World, even under a Chriſtian Profeſſion, becauſe of the Apoſtacie; which had it not come, the Goſpel would have ſpread much more than it yet hath done; but as the Apoſtacie goes out, the Everlaſting Goſpel, the ſame that the Apoſtles Preached, will be Preached to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation and Kindred, and Tongue, and People, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. That is, univerſally; this doth not prove the diſcontinuing of it, as <hi>J. P.</hi> falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Argueth; but that the more General, and indeed the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Univerſal Spreading of it, hath not hitherto been as yet. His Argument, <hi>That the Goſpel that</hi> Paul <hi>Preached to the</hi> Coloſſians, <hi>was not the Doctrin of Salvation, by the promiſed</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>Chriſt Crucified; becauſe the Goſpel he was ſpeaking of, was Preached to, or in every Creature under Heaven.</hi> Therefore (ſaith he) it could not be meant of the Doctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Christ</hi> Crucified,—but of that Goſpel which had been Preached to, or in every Creature under Heaven. I ſay this his Argument is Vain and Falſe; but it is a good and effectual Proof to confirm my Charge againſt them. Theſe Quakers Preach not any Goſpel for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but that which is Preached <hi>to, or in every Creature</hi> under Heaven; but (saith <hi>J.</hi> P.) that is not the Doctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified; therefore that is none of the Goſpel theſe Quakers Preach; what can be required more, <hi>habemus Confitentem reum</hi>; we have the
<pb facs="tcp:101541:60"/>
Guilty Confeſſing Matter of Fact. But ſurely the Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> was the Doctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, as appears plainly from 1 <hi>Col. v.</hi> 14. to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And his Arguing from the Words <hi>to, or in every Creature</hi> (which ſort of Argument hath deceived many) is no more valid to prove that the Goſpel, either then, or formerly had been Preached to every Man and Woman, in the full and adequate Senſe of the Word <hi>every,</hi> as it ſignifieth every individual; than that becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 28. of that ſame Chapter <hi>whom we Preach, Warning every Man, and Teaching every Man</hi> in all Wiſdom, that we may preſent every Man Perfect in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> and his Brethren, then living, did Teach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, that ever lived, or is now living on Earth. If yea, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>John Pennington,</hi> and all other Men now on Earth, were then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and this will be the Doctrin of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> or <hi>Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Souls with a witneſs, (which he ſo frequently would caſt upon me, though he has no juſt ground ſo to do, nor any other Man;) if nay, then he muſt quit his Poſt, and ceaſe any more to Argue from his place of Scripture; that the Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, was not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified; but the true Senſe of that place, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. I had formerly given, as he Quotes me, p. 71. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though it was not at the ſame time actually Preached to all Men, yet it was begun to be Preached, and after the Prophetical Stile, that which was to be done, is ſaid to be done</hi>: He Quibbles againſt this, ſaying, <hi>Where that Prophetical Phraſe is, or how it is uſed, he Aſſigns not.</hi> Indeed it was not neceſſary to ſhew to any but a little Skilled in the Letter and true Senſe of Scripture, where that Prophetical Phraſe is; for it is ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in Scripture Prophecies, that no Man that is not Brutiſh, but muſt be ſenſible of it, when he Reads them. When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Prophecied of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death and Sufferings, and Birth, yea, and Burial, it is all ſaid <hi>in praeterito</hi>; as if it had been, which yet was not ſome hundred Years after. And ſo it is almoſt in the whole Prophecie of the Book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and particularly that 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.7. brought by him, which yet he applyeth, not to <hi>John</hi>'s Time, but to his and his Brethrens Preaching (not the Doctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified; if we muſt believe <hi>J. P.</hi>) (behold your Patron, all Sober Perſons among the Quakers) <hi>but the Light in every Creature</hi> under Heaven.) And p. 22. <hi>Some Principles of the Elect People.</hi> And now ſaith <hi>G. F.</hi> the Goſpel muſt be Preached again to all Nations; and this ſaith <hi>J. P.</hi> is not the Doctrin of Salvation, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, but the Light or inward Principle
<pb facs="tcp:101541:61"/>
in every Creature, and his, and his Brethrens Argument is Weak; that becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> called the Goſpel the Power of God to Salvation; therefore it is nothing elſe but the inward Principle; for he called the Preaching of the Croſs the Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. And yet that Preaching was an outward Preaching, and he called it the Power of God becauſe it was made Effectual to many that heard it, by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God that accompanied it.</p>
            <p>Thus Reader, I have given thee a Taſt of this Man's Ignorance and Anti-Chriſtian Doctrin, which is the ſame with that of his Brethren of the Second Days Meeting, who have approved his Books againſt me. I ſhall not nauſeate thee with his other many Impertinencies, and Extravagancies, as well as his Groſs Errors in other Particulars of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; nor take notice of his Baſe and Scurrilous Revilings, that are equally Unjuſt and Malicious; As his calling me not Sincere, but a Belly-Convert, and his inſinuating; If I be diſappointed among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, I may ſeek a Living from the Papiſts, which is like his and his Brethrens other falſe Prophecies.</p>
            <p>Note, Reader, That having ſome Years ago ſeen a Book of <hi>Thomas Lawſon,</hi> a Quaker, againſt <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi>; I have made ſearch for it, but cannot find it any where, to have it; however, I ſuppoſe it hath nothing of Argument in it, but what in effect is contained in thoſe above, Examined and Anſwered; and I do not think that any of their Books on that Subject, will be found to have any other Arguments in them againſt <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> but what is in effect contained in thoſe above-mentioned.</p>
