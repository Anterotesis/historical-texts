            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat Sir <hi>Henry Ferrers, 25. May</hi> 1630. mortgaged
the Mannor of <hi>Skellingthorp</hi> in the County of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
to the Petitioners deceaſed Father <hi>John Stone,</hi>
and his heirs for 3000 l. and after in 1634. 1900l.
more releaſed his power of Redemption. And the ſaid <hi>John
Stone</hi> dying 1642. the Petitioner <hi>Katharine</hi> is entituled to
part as a Jointure, and the Petitioner <hi>Henry</hi> the reſt, as heir.</p>
            <p>That the Petitioners reſpective intereſt paſt the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and after great charges and trouble to the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
had allowance both in the Countrey by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Parlament for Sequeſtrations; and again upon the
re-examination by the Comittee for ſequeſtrations ſitting in
<hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Petitioners reſted themſelves ſecure of their
Eſtates, being legally good and allowed by the ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees.
But the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Ferrers</hi> being put into the Bill of
Sale as a Delinquent, your Petitioners knew nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and conceiving themſelves quiet and ſecure, by reaſon of
their title, and the ſaid allowances, did not put in any claim,
but as ſoon as they underſtood of any queſtion of their ſaid
eſtate, and before any contract for ſale, claim was lodged
in the ſurvey, and application made to the Committee of
Obſtructions, but the time being elapſed, the ſaid Committee
could not relieve your Petitioners, as they affirmed.</p>
            <p>Since which <hi>Nathanael Snape</hi> and <hi>Samuel Foxley,</hi> who knew
your Petitioners undoubted right, and watched for an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
have applied themſelvs to buy the ſaid Lands, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
your Petitioners have made ſeveral Addreſſes for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to the late Parlament, and to his Highneſs the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
before any contract in the premiſſes, and upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
references your Petitioners caſe being thereupon ſtated,
to be in truth as herein ſet forth, at laſt was referred by his
Higneſs to His Council, but other weightier affairs enterven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſo that your Petitioners have not yet obtained a hearing:
and matter of time and ſurprize, being the only means and
hopes of advantage to their Adverſaries to ſtrip your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of their eſtate.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners are inforced humbly to beſeech this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Houſe to take the ſufferings and danger of a distreſſed
Widow and Orphan into your pious and tender conſidration
(the Petitioners being otherwiſe likely to be ruined and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
without any fault or offence before their cauſe can
be judged) And that in ſome ſuch ſpeedy way, as your other
great affairs may permit, and the exigency of the cauſe in
truth requires,</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners ſhall pray, &amp;c.</closer>
         </div>
         <div type="answer">
            <head>The Anſwer of Nathanael Snape, and
Samuel Foxley, to this Petition, which is falſe
and ſcandalous in divers particulars, as
followeth.</head>
            <p>1. THat Releaſe was not abſolute but only in Trust for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of Articles which <hi>Stone</hi> did not perform,
and note that <hi>Stone</hi> was never poſſeſt of that Releaſe to
this day, but it was left in the hands of Sir <hi>Henry Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>'s
Truſtees where is ſtill remains. Beſides at the time of the Releaſe
made the Lands was more than double the value of the whole money
lent, and therefore impoſſible the Releaſe ſhould be intended to be
abſolute.</p>
            <p>2. Note <hi>Stone</hi> (to deceive the Commonwealth and produce the
abſolute deed by which the Land was conveyed to <hi>Stones</hi> Truſtees,
but not the deed of defeazance, by which the deed was to be void
upon payment of the 3000 l. and ſo) by that deviſe <hi>Stone</hi> got his
Claim allowed at the Comittee of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Hall.</p>
            <p>3. The Purchaſers knew nothing of <hi>Stones</hi> pretended undoubted
Right, nor watched for any advantage; for the land lay at leaſt three
quarters of year (after it was ſurveyed) with the Truſtees at <hi>Drury</hi>
houſe before any body came to buy it, and <hi>Stone</hi> might have brought
it in all that time if he would; therfore that is falſe and ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>4. The Purchaſors had contracted for the Lands long before
<hi>Stone</hi> made any addreſs to the Parliament, or his Highneſs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that allegation in this Petition is falſe alſo.</p>
            <p>And Note that the Commiſſioners for obstructions have not only
judged the cauſe againſt the Petitioners twice upon full hearing of
him and his many Councel; but alſo afterwards his petition in
Parliament upon hearing of him and his Council was diſmist; and
his Highneſs upon <hi>Stones</hi> Petition, having ſtayed the ſale for two
moneths, afterwards ordered that there ſhould be no longer stay in
the ſale or poſſeſſion by colour of his Highneſs order.</p>
            <p>And note that <hi>Stone</hi> and his Father have (as they are credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by Sir <hi>Henry Ferrers</hi> and others) received the profits of
the ſaid lands above ten years, the lands being ſurveyed at neer 600
<hi>l. p. an.</hi> which comes to about 8000l. having ploughd up Meadow and
Pastures, <hi>Stones</hi> Father hath received intereſt mony upon the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
1000l. He hath cut down woods, value 2000l. And hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
other great ſums out of the lands, ſo that he hath had his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and interest with a great overplus, and therefore need not
complain.</p>
            <p>Note alſo the Manner how the Petitioners <hi>Katharine</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Stone</hi> gat the poſſeſſion of the premiſſes from Sir <hi>Henry Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi>
during his abſence in the time of Delinquency, which was not
by legall way of tryal, verdict or Judgement, but by the order of
the ſaid Committee of <hi>Lincoln</hi> only (being deceived by <hi>Stones</hi>
not producing the ſaid deed of defezance as aforeſaid) which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
alſo had then no power to allow Titles or give poſſeſſions of
Delinquents Estates, without order from the Commiſſioners of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrations
at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> or <hi>Haberdaſher's</hi> Hall.</p>
