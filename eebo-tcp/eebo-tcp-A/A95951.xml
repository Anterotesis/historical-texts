            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Intituled, Heads preſented by the Army to the
Kings Majeſty.</head>
            <p>WHereas we finde a Pamphlet lately printed and publiſhed,
bearing the title of, <hi>Heads preſented by the Army to the Kings
Majeſty,</hi> on Saturday June the 19. 1647. though we think it
will of it ſelfe appeare ſuch a confuſed headleſſe peece, ſo ſurreptitiouſly
crept forth, and in ſuch a pure Pamphlet dreſſe, as we hope it will gaine
little beleefe to our prejudice: Yet to avoid any jealouſies or doubtfull
thoughts which it might poſſible breed in any honeſt minde, we cannot but
take notice of it, and for the vindication of the Army doe hereby declare,
That the ſaid printed Pamphlet is moſt falſe, ſcandalous, and injurious to us
and this Army: Neither hath there beene any ſuch Paper preſented to his
Majeſty by or from this Army. And the ſame we profeſſe and declare with
great deteſtation, concerning another written Paper, whereof we had a Copy
ſhewed to us yeſterday by the Commiſſioners of the City, Intituled, <hi>Articles
agreed upon betweene the King and the Army, the 16. of Iune.</hi> And we deſire
all that wiſh well to this Army, or the King or Parliament, or peace of this
Kingdome, that they would doe their beſt to finde out and diſcover the
Authors and Publiſher of the ſaid Paper and Pamphlet, or any thing elſe of
that nature that may be divulged concerning the Army, to interrupt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the preſent ſetling and compoſure of Affaires. And we hope it will
not be further needfull or expected from us, that we ſhould give particular
anſwer to every ſuch ſcandalous Paper, which the malice of our enemies
may forge againſt us, but that what we have publiſhed to the world in our
Repreſentation and other Papers avowed by us, may ſerve to cleare our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
untill we ſhall appeare to act ſomething to the contrary.</p>
