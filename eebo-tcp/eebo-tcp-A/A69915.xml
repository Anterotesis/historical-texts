            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with them, and partly to oppoſe them, but with all Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to propound their Doubts, meekly to hearken and receive Inſtruction, humbly begging of God to open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that they may ſee and imbrace the Truth, taking great care that no evil Affection, love of a Party or carnal Intereſt, influence or byaſs their Judgment.</q>

                     <q>We do not by this deſire men to pin their Faith upon the Prieſts ſleeve, or to put out their own Eyes, that they might be better guided and managed by them, but only diligently to attend to their Reaſons and Arguments, and give ſome due Regard and Deference to their Authority; for it may not be ſo abſurd, as may by ſome be imagined, for the common People to take upon Truſt from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teachers, what they are not competent Judges of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But the difficulty here is, How ſhall a private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian govern himſelf, when the very Guides and Miniſters of Religion determine differently concerning theſe Matters in queſtion amongſt us, ſome warranting and allowing them, others as much diſapproving them? By what Rule ſhall he chuſe his Guide?</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>As for thoſe who ſcruple at Conformity, and are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly able to judge for themſelves, let not ſuch rely barely upon the Authority either of one or the other; all we deſire of them is, that they would equally hear both ſides, that they would think the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have ſome Senſe and Conſcience too, as well as other men, and are able to ſay ſomewhat for what they do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or require of others, and laying aſide all Prejudices, Favour to, or Admiration of Mens Perſons, they would weigh and conſider the Arguments that may be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, being Diffident of their own Apprehenſions, and Indifferent to either part of the Queſtion, that they would think it no ſhame to change their Mind, when they ſee good Reaſon for it.</q>

                     <q>Could we thus prevail with the People diligently to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Merits of the Cauſe, our Church would every day gain more Ground amongſt all Wiſe Men; for we care not how much Knowledge and Underſtanding our People have, ſo they be but humble and modeſt with it; nor do we deſire men to become our Proſelites any further than we give them good Scripture and Reaſon for it.</q>

Upon reading whereof (being ſent me by a Friend) I did betake my ſelf to a ſerious Search, and impartial Conſideration of the Controverſies, and the Arguments ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on both ſides, (many of the learned Guides, as you well obſerve, being of ſuch different Minds herein) and more particularly have I weighed thoſe Arguments mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your ſelf in that Diſcourſe (in Conjunction with what the Reverend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> the Learned Dr. <hi>More,</hi> and others, have ſpoken to the ſame purpoſe); together with what is, or ſuppoſed may be ſaid in Anſwer thereto. And from this Chriſtian Encouragement and Invitation from your ſelf, have preſumed, though a Stranger to you, to preſent it to you, with a diſpoſition (as you adviſe) meekly to hearken to, and receive Inſtruction or Conviction from your ſelf, or any of the Learned, truſting that you ſhall find no evil Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, love of a Party, or carnal Intereſt, ſhall influence or byaſs my Judgment, or that I ſhall think it any ſhame to change my Mind, when better Reaſon is offered for my Conviction.</p>
                  <p>Reſting confident in your Condor and Ingenuity, that what you have ſaid herein to draw forth the Scruples of any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter, is not to lay a Bait thereby to catch him in any Snare, or to take any legal Advantage upon him for his diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Religion by Law eſtabliſhed (which is hedged with ſo many legal Penalties;) But out of a <hi>Noble Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that you may have an Opportunity to diſcover, with how much meekneſs of Wiſdom and demonſtration of Truth you can treat, convince and ſatisfie a Gainſayer, having ſo generouſly declared, <hi>That you do not deſire men ſhould become your Proſelites, further than you give them good Reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it; Club-Law</hi> being none of the Arguments you treat a ſcrupulous or tender Conſcience with.</p>

as a Negative Article of Faith, that ſays we are not to do ſo, or ſo, <hi>Kneel</hi> at the Communion, <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm, keep <hi>Holy-days,</hi> uſe <hi>Liturgies, Letanies,</hi> &amp;c. they can have no cauſe of juſt ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>And thus, Sir, you are pleaſed to Argue, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That there <note place="margin">Scrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, p. 30.</note>can be no Tranſgreſſion, but by either omitting what the Law Commands, or doing what the Law forbids: For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; If a man can ſhew where Kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is forbidden in Scripture, where ſitting is required, where praying by a Form is forbid, and extemporary Prayers are enjoyned, then indeed the Diſpute would ſoon be at an end; But if neither the one nor the other can be found, as moſt certainly they cannot, then Kneeling at the Sacrament, and Reading prayers out of a Book, muſt be reckoned amongſt things lawful, and then there is no need of ſcrupling them, becauſe they may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; nay where they are required by our Superiors, it is our Duty to ſubmit to them, becauſe it is our duty to obey them in all lawful things.</q> This way of Arguing (you ſay) is very plain and convincing.</p>

                        <q>But the ſtrangeſt Effort of all the reſt, is what he hath reſerved to the laſt place,</q> 
                        <hi>viz. That the Charge of Idolatry againſt them muſt be vain and groundleſs, becauſe if I be preſſed Cloſe, I ſhall deny any one of theſe Negative Points to be divine Truths,</hi> viz. <hi>That honour is not to be given to the Images of Chriſt and his Saints; that what appears to be Bread in the Euchariſt, is not the Body of Chriſt; that it is not lawful to Invocate Saints to pray for us</hi>—[Theſe are the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> words, requiring the Doctor to prove thoſe Negatives, upon which ſingle Point he puts the ſtreſs of his Argument.] Then follows his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which I pray you to mind well, becauſe it is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you muſt take to the like Queſtion from us, <hi>viz.</hi>

What need we make Negative Articles of Faith, where the Affirmative do neceſſarily imply them? If I believe that the Scripture is my only Rule of Faith, as I moſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do; Will any man that conſiders what he ſaith, require me to make Negative Articles of Faith, that the <hi>Pope is not, Tradition is not, Councils are not, a private Spirit is not?</hi> for all theſe things are neceſſarily Imply'd therein. And ſo for all particular Doctrines rejected by us upon this principle, we do not make them Negative points of Faith, but we therefore refuſe the Belief of them, becauſe not contained IN OUR ONLY RULE OF FAITH: On this account we reject the <hi>Pope's Supremacy, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>preſent Church</hi> in Delivering Points of Faith, <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and other FOPPERIES im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon the Belief of Chriſtians; So that the ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of our Faith is this, That we ought to believe <hi>Nothing</hi> as an Article of Faith, but what God hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and the compleat Revelation of God's will to us is contained in the BIBLE, &amp;c.</q>

Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing is lawful in the Worſhip of God, but what he hath expreſly commanded, (as ſay the Diſſenters) and not all things lawful which are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as ſay the Advocates for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let his own words decide the matter, and forever determine the Caſe. For what need the Diſſenters (as the Doctor affirms on their behalf) make Negative Articles of Faith, where the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative does neceſſarily imply them; If they do believe with the Doctor, that the Scripture is their ONLY Rule of Faith, as they moſt firmly declare to do, will any man that conſiders what he ſaith, require them to make Negative Articles of their Faith, that <hi>Popes, Councils, Private Spirits, Traditions,</hi> are not, and ſo for all particular Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines rejected by them upon this principle: They do not with the Doctor, make them Negative points of faith, but they therefore (with him) refuſe the Belief of them, BECAUSE NOT CONTAINED IN OUR ONLY RULE OF FAITH. On this account they do (with the Doctor) Reject the Pope's Supremacy, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in Delivering points of Faith, <hi>viz, Purgatory,</hi> and other <hi>Fopperies,</hi> (as <hi>Salt, Oyl, Spittle, Exorciſms, Conjurations, baptizing</hi> of Bells, &amp;c.) And upon the ſame account do they Reject what the Proteſtants have received either from Pagans or Papiſts, as to National, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, Dioceſan and Parochial Churches, Becauſe not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our ONLY RULE of Faith. As alſo of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of Chriſt by <hi>Lord Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Arch-Deacons, Parſons, Vicars, Curates, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Officials,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe not contained in our ONLY RULE of Faith. In like manner do the Diſſenters alſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the <hi>Conſecrating</hi> of <hi>Churches, Chappels, Cathedrals, Prieſts Garments, Altars, Liturgies, Singing Service, Letanies, Bowings, Croſſings, Cringings, Holy-dayes, Faſts, Feaſts, Vigils,</hi> becauſe not one word of any of them is contained in our only Rule of Faith; So that the ſhort Reſolution of the Diſſenters and the Doctor's Faith in this great Point is this, that they ought to believe nothing as an Article of Faith, but what God hath revealed, and that the Compleat Revelation of Gods Will to us, is contained in the BIBLE.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Chriſt having in the Affirmative compleatly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us his mind and will in the Bible, both as to the

Doctrine and Diſcipline of his Church, we need not go to <hi>Pope, Council, Tradition,</hi> or any other for <hi>Additions</hi> to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor trouble our ſelves to make Negative Articles of Faith and Practice, which would be as Ridiculous as End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

                     <p>But this being ſo well performed by the Doctor, what ſhall we ſay that ſo wiſe, ſo learned, and ſo great a man as Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> ſhould forgot himſelf ſo far, as to make head and run counter againſt his own Argument, and to that degree, as to pawn the whole Controverſie upon that ſingle point which he had ſo infallibly and indiſputably reſolved, which indeed is very ſtrange and wonderful; but yet upon ſerious Thoughts we ſhall find it but a fulfilling of that Word of the Lord, <note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 14, &amp;c.</note>viz. <hi>I will do a marvellous Work amongſt this People, even a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Work and a Wonder</hi> [But what is that?] <hi>Why the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Prudent men ſhall be hid</hi> [But when ſhall that be?] viz. <hi>When they teach for Doctrines the Commands</hi> [or the fear or Worſhip] <hi>of God for the Precepts of men.</hi> Our very caſe, and whereof we <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note>have frequent and continual experience.

                        <hi>1.</hi> That the pretence of ſtill retaining &amp; impoſing the preſent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies out of due Reverence to Antiquity, is falſe &amp; hypocritical.</p>

It is true, the Antients after Baptiſin did ſign the baptized with a Croſs upon his head and breaſt, and anointed him with Chryſm, as a diſtinct Order from Baptiſm; but no ſuch Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the act of Baptiſm, as part of that Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth's time the Reformers did, as the firſt Service-book makes mention, ſign the Elements three times with the Sign of the Croſs, and alſo the Child upon the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Breaſt when the Godfathers named his Name, and afterwards in Confirmation again in the breaſt and forehead; but all this is laid aſide, and a new thing taken up, which is neither to be found in Antiquity, nor in the firſt Pattern of our Reformers.</p>

                        </note> To which we ſay, We do ſurely allow of reading the Scriptures, but not as they do, eſpecially in thoſe Epiſtles, Goſpels and Pſalms, which are given us in the Liturgy, for the following Reaſons:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Epiſtles, Goſpels and Pſalms, in the Service-Book, are miſ-tranſlated, being taken from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt vulgar Latine-Bible, which is ſo extream faulty, and ſo much complained of by the learned, both Proteſtants and others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe what they call Epiſtles and Goſpels are ſo curtal'd and mangled, that they become quite another thing than the Evangeliſts intended in the Goſpels, or the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, altogether ruining the ſcope and connexions in divers places, as may be inſtanced in numerous particulars, if need were.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe they have been the Inventions of the Popes, who have ſo adulterated Chriſts pure Worſhip and Service, to patch up their Idolatrous <hi>Maſs-Service,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> (called) <hi>the Great</hi> compleated, as before, fixing and appropriating the Epiſtles, Goſpels and Pſalms to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins and Even-Songs, throughout the Year, as the <hi>Romiſh Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> whoſe Copy ('tis ſuſpected) we imitate, writes after.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That whilſt it is ſuppoſed we may be inſtructed in the Leſſons ordered to be read upon the (ſo called) <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Holy-Days,</hi> through the whole Bible, they have omitted ſo much of the Canonical Scriptures, as the greateſt part of <hi>Leviticus, Ruth, Chronicles, Nehemiah, Eſther, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Lamentations, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah, Haggai, The ſecond Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians,</hi> the ſecond and third of <hi>John,</hi> and moſt part of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> inſtead of which, ſeveral parts of <hi>Apocryphal Writings</hi> are read, which are eſteemed by the Learned, to be fabulous, and ſavouring of the too much adored Vanities of <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Becauſe they have omitted all the Original Titles or Inſcriptions of the Pſalms, which are part of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which have ſo great a tendency to unfold the myſteries in the Pſalms, and inſtead of them retain the Popiſh Latino Titles, printed over our Engliſh Pſalms.</p>

Sixthly, becauſe of thoſe additions which are made to the Scriptures therein as to the 14 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 3 whole verſes which are not in any of the Original Copies, and <hi>Gloria patri</hi> to the Concluſion of ſeveral Pſalms, ordering it to be ſaid at the reading of every Pſalm, contrary to <hi>Deut</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, becauſe the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpels</hi> are ordered to be ſung as well as ſaid, without the leaſt warrant or direction from the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, becauſe it is ordered in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> to ſit at the reading of the Epiſtles, and to ſtand up to bow and ſcrape, and Reſpond at the Goſpel, without any warrant or direction from the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, becauſe of the diſorderly chopping &amp; interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scriptures, by way of <hi>Colloquy,</hi> betwixt the Prieſt and People, <hi>viz. The Lord be with thee,</hi> muſt the Prieſt ſay: <hi>And with thy Spirit,</hi> muſt the People ſay: <hi>Open our Lips,</hi> muſt the Prieſt ſay: <hi>And let our Mouths ſhew forth thy praiſe,</hi> muſt the People ſay.

                        <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> It is very true, they are indeed offended at that piece they conceive) of voluntary Humility and Will-Worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no more ground for Bowing at the mentioning of that Name, either from that or any other Scripture, than for Croſſing our ſelves when that Name is named.</p>
                     <p>For, firſt, if it be a Command (as ſuppoſed) univerſally to bow at the mentioning thoſe Syllables, and that Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> then are all both in Heaven, Earth, and under the Earth, Mer, Angels and Devils obliged thereto, whenever that Name is mentioned; be it either by a Wicked mans blaſphemouſly ſwearing by it, or a drunken Prieſts prophanely muttering it, or the mentioning Jeſus the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> or <hi>Bar Jeſus</hi> the Conjurer.</p>
                     <p>And, ſecondly, if the ſuppoſed Command muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to relate to the naming the Name of our Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; it muſt then be conſidered which of his Names muſt be meant, becauſe he hath many Names in Scripture, as <hi>Chriſt, Immanuel, Jehovah, Wonderful, the Everlaſting Father, Saviour, Redeemer, Son of God, Prince of Peace, King of Kings, Lord of Lords,</hi> &amp;c. Any of which being much more properly to be underſtood here, than this of Jeſus, becauſe it is at the name of Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome Name of his, and not the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> that is to be bowed to.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Neither can that Name be ſuppoſed to be meant here, becauſe it relates to a name the Father gave him after his Death, Suffering and Exaltation, as the words make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; and therefore not that name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which was given him at his Circumciſion, before his ſaid Suffering and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>Neither, fourthly, can this ſenſe be admitted as a literal Command, that all muſt bow the Knee at that Name, becauſe at the ſame time all and every one which make that reverence with the knee, are enjoyn'd with their mouths, to declare that

                     <p>Therefore, fifthly, It doth neceſſarily reſpect another thing, than Reverencing the ſyllables of a Name, <hi>viz.</hi> that Power, Authority and Soveraignity which the Father gave him in Glory, as a Reward of his Suffering, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declared after his Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>That all Power was given him in Heaven &amp; Earth,</hi> Epheſ. 28. This bowing in the Name of Chriſt in this place, being by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 45. 23, 24. explained a Subjection of all to the univerſal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that he ſhall exerciſe. <hi>Name</hi> often ſignifying <hi>Power</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 5. 20. 1. 7.

In the next place I ſhall give you ſome Confirmation of the Truth of the prevalency of Popery under a Proteſtant Mask, in the Rites and Ceremonies impoſed in theſe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, by the witneſs Bourn by ſeveral Eminent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, which we find upon Record in ſeveral Books, <hi>viz.</hi> A Book called the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> another the <hi>Abridgment</hi> which was a Book Delivered to King <hi>James</hi> by the Miniſters of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Dioceſs Anno 1605.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Regiſter</hi> page 3. We have the 24 Articles agreed in the Synod, and Confirmed by the Queen, Exhibited to Mr. <hi>Edward Dering,</hi> and his Anſwers thereto, Anno 1573. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Receive his Anſwer to the firſt Article, The Article was <q>whether the Book Intituled the Book of Common Service allowed by publick Authority in this Realm is to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of God, by Gods Word or no? To which he replyed,</q> That</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Similitude that this Book hath with the Form of Prayer which the Papiſts uſed, I think declineth from the Equity of thoſe Laws,</q> Deut. 7. 25, 12, 30, 18, 4. Which Thing our Fathers ſo much Regarded in the Primitive Church, <q>that their Books are full of great Complaints againſt all Similitude to be had with the Gentles,</q> yea the Second <hi>Council of</hi> Bracca <hi>made a Decree, that no Chriſtian ſhould have either Bay-leaves or Green Boughs in their houſes, becauſe the Gentles ſo Accuſtomed, and at this day, all Reformed Churches in</hi> France, Polonia, Helvetia, Scotland <hi>and other places have changed that Form of Prayers which Prudency of all Ages, if we ſhall Condemn the Rebuke of the Apoſtle I think will Teach us,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 36. Came the Word of God out from you, or came it unto you only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have the Pſalms, <hi>Venite, Benedictus, Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, nunc Demittis,</hi> uſual in our Miniſtry of which we can give no good reaſon, nor I ſee no cauſe why we ſhould more leave out <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and becauſe of parting the Scriptures again into the Epiſtles and Goſpels (which was not heard of before the days of Popery) I dare not Avow that this is that Reverend handling of the Scriptures, and the right dividing of the Word of Truth which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Requireth, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 15.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The great Inconveniency which hath followed this Book while it hath Maintained an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned Miniſtry, and made it thought ſufficient to have the Service Read wherein we have made
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94432:35"/>
the Spirit of God to ſpeak in vain, <hi>1 Tim. 3. 12.</hi> which Requires the Miniſters of the Goſpel to be apt to Teach and to exhort and Reprove, Tit. <hi>1. 9.</hi> This is an other Cauſe why I cannot Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto the Book, that it hath all things anſwerable to the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>But the Abridgment is much more full, bringing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Scripture, The Fathers, the Old Reformers, and our own Old Proteſtant Doctors againſt it whereof I ſhall give this following Account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is contrary to the Word of God to uſe ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Worſhip of God as man has deviſed if they be notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to have been of old, and ſtill to be abuſed unto Idolatry and Superſtition by the Papiſts, eſpecially if the ſame be now of no neceſſary uſe in the Church, where note that the Ceremonial part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service that is like unto that of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> is what has been abuſed by the Papiſts to Idolatry or Superſtition but yet are not ſo neceſſary to Divine Worſhip, but that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may be Compleat, Devout and orderly without them, which appears ſaith they.</p>
                     <p>Firſt by the Second Commandment which forbids all provocation unto Spiritual Fornication, as the <hi>7</hi>th doth unto that which is Carnal:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Commandment and Direction God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in his Word to Seperate our ſelves from Idolaters, and be as unlike to them, as may be, eſpecially in their Religions, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Ceremonies, to aboliſh not only all Idols, and that ſo as we may beſt ſhew our utmoſt Deteſtation to them, and root out the very memory of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the Equity and Reaſons of theſe Commandments which we find ſet down in Holy Scripture, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> The deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Lord our God (being a Jealous God) beareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatry, and all the Inſtruments and Tokens thereof, as unto Spiritual Whoredom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it cannot be ſaid ſincerely we have Repented of the Idolatry of our Forefathers, unleſs we be aſhamed of, and caſt away with Deteſtation all the Inſtruments and Monuments of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we ſhall be in danger to be Corrupted in the Subſtance of Religion and Purity of Doctrine; and even to fall back again to Idolatry, if we Conform our ſelves to Idolaterous Ceremonies, yea, if we ſhew not all Deteſtation unto them. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That our Conformity with Idolators in their Ceremonies wherein
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94432:36"/>
they Repoſe the greateſt part of their Religion, will be a ſpecial means to harden them in Superſtition. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That ſeeing the Pope is revealed to be that Great Antichriſt, and his Idolatry troubleth the Church at this day more than any other, and our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Converſe more with Papiſts, then with any other Idolators, there is more danger in the Retaining of the Ceremonies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Popery, then of any other Idolatry whatſoever.</p>

To which we ſay, That it is moſt certain that Obedience is due from Inferiors to Superiors, for Conſcience ſake, and for the Lord's ſake. But then that is limited to be only in the Lord; for if they who are his Miniſters, command any thing not agreeable to his Word, and plainly Sinful, though they may call them Indifferent things, State Policy, Order and Decency, we are juſtifi'd with the Midwives, in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the King's command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 17. and <hi>Saul</hi>'s Guard, in refuſing Obedience to the King, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 22. 17. and <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>three Children</hi> in diſobeying the King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 6. and with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who refuſed to forbear preaching Chriſt at the Rulers command, telling them, <hi>It was beete to obey God than Man.</hi> Though this abſolute obedience to Superiors (as you'l find) is an Argument principally urged by men who have the Magiſtrate on their ſide, and their own Profit and Advantage concern'd, then Obedience to them is cryed up to be better than Sacrifice, and fall foul upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, as Diſobedient, Seditious and Rebellious. So <hi>Celſus</hi> the Heathen, reproaches the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for their forſaking their publick Aſſemblies, getting into Corners, diſobeying Authority. So all the time of <hi>Popery</hi> were the <hi>Waldenſes, Wickliviſts, Lollards</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> branded with Seditions, Diſobedience to Authority, impugning the King and Queen's proceedings. And how doth <hi>Bonner</hi> lay the 13 <hi>Romans</hi> to the Martyrs, to require their Obedience and Subjection to all their <hi>Mumſimus</hi>'s and <hi>Sumſimus</hi>'s? But if the Tide be turn'd, and the Magiſtrate on the other ſide, then the ſame men cry out againſt Impoſition and Perſecution, as it was with the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> under the ſeveral Emperors of different minds; the 13 <hi>Romans</hi> was in thoſe days uſed as the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man's Breeches to ſerve all occaſions, and always improved to eſtabliſh and inforce the preſent Impoſitions by the Power and Religion which was uppermoſt. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves all our worthy Witneſſes, the <hi>Waldenſes, Wickliviſts, Lollards,</hi> &amp;c. who bore up for Chriſt againſt all their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary Laws, Prohibitions and Commands, and thoſe who oppoſed <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calf-Worſhip. This would eſtabliſh the Religion of the preſent Power, be it either <hi>Judaiſm, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, Popery,</hi> &amp;c. and a conformity to it. But 'tis ſaid, you intend this ſubjection to Superiors, only in lawful things, things not plainly ſinful. Then if the Inferior be to judge
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94432:39"/>
what is Unlawful, and plainly Sinful, the Controverſie is at an end. If they command lawful things, they command no other than God has commanded, which makes it lawful, then Obedience (as due) is given to God. If they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the things of God any other than lawful, or what he has required, they have no Authority ſo to do; and we Sin not in Diſobedience by your own Rule, if they command ſinful or unlawful things.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe things of an Indifferent Nature, or things not poſſitively forbidden, under which is included all the Rites and Ceremonies injoy'd by man, whereof no Word of God for.

                     <p>And may we not truly ſay, as it was then, ſo it is now? And may not you your ſelves, who ſo carry it to your diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren, expect the ſame meaſure from that Generation of men, if they ſhould get an advantage again in this Nation? as our Saviour tells you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>It is no new thing, you-ſee, to have Innocency and Truth falſly and injuriouſly charged, and treated as Sedition and Treaſor.</p>
                     <p>And may not the diſſenting Party, notwithſtanding all the Rage, Noiſe and Clamour, the many Provocations by mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Proſecutions, invading of Properties, Priviledges, &amp;c. Worrying of Informers and Souldiers, Fines, Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Impriſonments, the Deaths, both in City and Country theſe two and Twenty Years, challenge the worſt of their Enemies to come forth and produce any one thing wherein the Diſſenters (as Diſſenters) are juſtly to be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sedition, Treaſon or Rebellion, [in this Nation] but that under all they have behaved themſelves meekly, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and ſubmiſſively, as becomes their holy Profeſſion?</p>
                     <p>And as for this horrid Slander of being all engaged in a late <hi>Plot,</hi> [their Principles leading thereto;] 'tis like all the reſt. If to have been under the higheſt Provocations, and in the Exerciſe of the greateſt Patience under them, renders them guilty, it may be ſomething: Otherwiſe, if Proofs be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make People guilty, why have not the Witneſſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared? But this is but a pretence; for have they not ſuffer'd long before any Plot was talkt of?</p>
                     <p>But as to this, 'tis ſaid, Have not ſeveral been impriſoned, ſome fled, and others executed about the Plot?</p>
                     <p>That ſeveral have been impriſoned, ſome fled and ſome

executed, who have been reputed Non-Conformiſts, is very true; and ſo have many more of the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> I preſume, four for one of the other: Will it therefore be a fair way of Arguing, Becauſe ſo many of the Conformiſts are ſaid to be in the Plot, therefore all the Conformiſts of the Nation are guilty, and ought to be ſeverely handled. I remember it was thought a very unfair way of proceeding of old, becauſe <hi>Coll. Wagſtaff</hi> tranſgreſſed in the Weſt, that therefore my Lord of <hi>Kingſtone</hi> muſt be puniſhed in the North; nay, the whole party decimated for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>If ſome of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> are found Tardy upon good Proof, let them ſuffer the Penalty of the Law; but let not the Innocent be judged and puniſhed with the Guilty, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs let not the Principle of Non-Conformity be judged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome have miſcarried under that Profeſſion; for by that Rule may not the pureſt ſtate of the Church, both in the Old and New-Teſtament, be cenſured and judged, who had their <hi>Chora</hi>'s, <hi>Judaſſes</hi> and <hi>Diatropheſſes</hi> amongſt them? His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in his Speech to both Houſes, gives us a good Rule here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, viz. <hi>Let us look forward and not backward, and never think of what is paſt, except men put us in mind, by repeating faults we had forgot; and then let us remember no more than what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thoſe very Perſons.</hi>

                     <p>But have they not appeared of late years very zealous and forward in Elections of Parliament-men, and other publick Officers in City and Country?</p>
                     <p>It is true, they have ſo, and ſo have the Conformiſts alſo, ten for one to their Number, both in City and Country; but what Tranſgreſſion is that?

                  <p>So ſaid <hi>Bonner</hi> of old to the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, and ſo ſaid the Scribes and Phariſees of Chriſt, <hi>They had a Law, and by their Law he ought to dye.</hi> But you know it is a Maxim in the Engliſh Law, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>That if any Law, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuage or Cuſtom be contrary to God's Law, they are null and void in themſelves.</hi> And how much ſuch Laws ſo rigorouſly put in force againſt the Diſſenters, are againſt both the Law of God and Nature, you have by your own Pens decided, and do alſo know what the proper Interpreters of the Law have ſaid of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> are not intended by them, but the <hi>Popiſh</hi> only, as pag. 47, 48, 49, 50.</p>
                  <p>And as for the ſevere Penalties inflicted upon Diſſenters as Seditious and Riotous for their Aſſembling together to worſhip God, as though they thereby infringed the Law, and violated the publick Peace; and for which they have in theſe three laſt Years ſuffered in their Eſtates and Trades, at leaſt two Millions (as ſuppoſed) contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of thoſe Statutes, if the Maxim of the Law be true, that the Intention makes the legal Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, both as to <hi>TREASON,</hi> Fellony, Murder and Riot, Twenty Three Years Experience evidencing their quiet and peaceable Behaviour, and that they have been as far from Sedition and Riot (as the Law defines) as any in the Nation.</p>

                  <p>YOu have here a briefe and I hope Satifactory account (from many Learned Authoritys) of the Riſe and Origanal of many of the Rites and Ceremonys now in Queſtion (which have and do occaſion ſo much trouble, and diſtreſs) the only right way to end diſputes, and which was the method Chriſt took with the Phariſes, <hi>Mat, 19. 8.</hi> And which Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> ſo wiſely obſerves from him, in confuting the Papiſts. Whereby it is eaſely diſcerned what is from above and what from beneath, what from God, and what from Man. This proves their Riſe, and Birth, to be many hundred Yeares before Chriſt, therefore not from him for Chriſtian Service.</p>
                  <p>The learned <hi>Cauſabon</hi> in his Original of Idolatry (Writ in French and collected (as his Epiſt tells us) from <hi>Elaſopolitanes</hi> Commentaryes, Tranſlated by Mr. <hi>Darcy)</hi> Sayes <hi>P. 73.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the maine and principal parts of the <hi>Maſs</hi> are digeſted and brought in by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> [the 2 King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a great Magician about 700 years before Chriſt, P. 37.] The farthar Additions were Invented, by other Roman Pontifs, and eſpecially by a <hi>Monk</hi> called <hi>Gregory,</hi> the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Name, who attained the Papacy being Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Pythagoricall Magick and Philoſephy, haveing alſo ſtudied the Laws of King <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> ſucceſſor to <hi>Numa,</hi> and to the end he might Perpetuate his Name, Inſtituted div ers additions to the Maſs, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>But you'l ſay, why do you give the <hi>Heathen</hi> the Denomination of a <hi>Church,</hi> Is that proper? Yes why not? Do not you read of the Church of Evil-doers? <hi>Pſ. 26.</hi> And <hi>Synagogue</hi> of Satan? <hi>Rev. 2.</hi> And I know no reaſon why <hi>Rome Pagan</hi> the Mother, may not be ſo called as well as <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> the Daughter, who fetches ſo much of her <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Policie, <hi>Church Rites, Services, &amp; Ceremonys,</hi> from her; But did not <hi>Pagan Rome</hi> kil Chriſt, and diſown Chriſtianity which <hi>Papal Rome</hi> did not?

                        <p>On the Twenty-ninth of <hi>November</hi> laſt, late in the Evening, I was Apprehended by one <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to the Preſs; And by him carried before Sr. <hi>Thomas Genner,</hi> now Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> who asked me divers Queſtions, the moſt material of which are mentioned in the following Letter ſent afterwards to him: By the ſame
 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94432:51"/>
Recorder I was ſent to the Compter in <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> where I had moſt wretched Accomondation; I was turn'd in amongſt the Common-ſide <hi>Priſoners,</hi> where a hard Bench was my <hi>Bed,</hi> and two Bricks my <hi>Pillow;</hi> and not ſuffered to ſee ſome of my Acquaintance that were Priſoners there, as <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>

                        <p>Next Morning Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> got me cald to the Lodge, and to his praiſe be it ſpoken, narrowly ſearch'd me for Papers, but found none for his purpoſe, and ſo left me to be turned in again; but a little while after I was ſent by a freſh Warrant to <hi>Newgate.</hi> The Copy of which follows.

                        <p>By vertue of that warrant I was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and Lodg'd amongſt Felons, whoſe horrid Company made a perfect repreſentation of that horible place which you deſcribe when you mention Hell.

                                    <hi>Sr.</hi> You know I was Committed Priſoner firſt to the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> then to <hi>Newgate,</hi> by your warrant. In my Mittimus tis ſaid that I refuſed to give Bail, which is a miſtake, for being asked by you whether I would give Bail then? I ſaid I could not, it being ſo late at Night, when I had no opportunity to ſend to ſuch as would Bail me, and being askt whether I would give Bail the next Morning? I ſaie I knew not whether 'I could or not, becauſe I was not certain whether ſuch to whom I might have made Application, would do it or not: This was no Sullenneſs, nor Obſtinacy in me, but what my Real apprehentions then were. Some Friends of mine, Freemen of theis <hi>City,</hi> went afterwards to be my Bail, but they were told you were not at home. They made thereupon an application to Sr. <hi>William Turner,</hi> who referd them to you.</p>
                                 <p>It is ſaid in the Warrant that I confeſſed I was the <hi>Author</hi> of a Libel, Entituled <hi>A Plea for the Nonconformiſts;</hi> wherein are contained things dangerous to the <hi>Government,</hi> which thus much and no further is true: I confeſſed before you that I delivered a Manuſcript of my own writing to one <hi>John How,</hi> with that Title, in order to be Printed, and that if the Print agreed with the Manuſcript I would own it, otherwiſe I could not, becauſe the miſplacing of a Stop, the miſprinting of a Lettor, or Syllable, or ſome other Errators of the Preſs, would alter the ſence even to contradiction of what was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſcuſſed; which was not as my Indictment wors it, (in a form of aggravating terms) but in order to a plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſuch things as Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi> from <hi>Pulpit</hi> and <hi>Preſs,</hi> invited <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to inquire into, as you may ſee in his Book, called <hi>A Diſcourſe of a Scrupulous Conſcience.</hi> There is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94432:52"/>
nothing of matters Relating to the Civil State, in what I am Charg'd with, for I am not concern'd with that, but if the Guid's of the Church (as Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi> calls the Benificed men of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> will make publick Chalenges, they ſhould receive Objections without puniſhing the Objectors, whoſe (Suppoſed) Crime is only for obeying them; and that you know <hi>Sr.</hi> is diſagreeable to Juſtice.</p>
                                 <p>If any thing I have done falls within the laſh of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, <hi>Fiat Juſtitia.</hi> But I am ſatisfi'd I have done nothing in this point unbecoming an honeſt Subject, a Scholar, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and which is worth all, a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> I Commit the whole matter, with Reſpect to this Diſpute, to that Supream Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, who is without Exception juſt, and who will judge all that are S ubordinate to him, which is all from <hi>Sr.</hi> your Servant</p>

                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon that publick <hi>Call</hi> of yours, I adventured to examine (with the moſt diligent ſearch I could make) what each of the ſaid parties ſay for themſelves, and this not out of any Litigious principle (that <hi>Pruritus Diſputandi)</hi> now too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally grown Epidemical; but to give ſuch as are Concern'd oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to inveſtigate theſe diſputed matters to the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the clearing up of truth in a juncture when it can never be more Seaſonable. What was digeſted, was intened to be ſent you in a Manuſcript with ſome modeſt Inferences and inquiries, but upon Recollection I judged it would more Anſwer your End, <hi>viz.</hi> Publick Information, to have ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as are producible by the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as Publick as the Invitation you gave them from <hi>Pulpit</hi> and <hi>Preſs:</hi> It being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual that the Anſwer ſhould be as ſpreading as the Objections.</p>
                                 <p>I am far from the Vanity of pretending to be your Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the faculties of the Schools: I cannot judge of them any otherwiſe then as unſerviceable to <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Tinctured with that Grace Derivative only from the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of all Gifts, which I hope you partake of.</p>
                                 <p>I am one of the meaneſt of the Flock, yet not below the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards of the Sheepherd of Souls, who is no Reſpecter of Perſons, and whoſe Example ſuch as call themſelves his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> ought to follow. And therefore though ſome who pin their faith upon Canonical Sleevs, may cenſure me, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing (or if I may uſe a Millitary metaphor, taking up the Gantlet againſt a man of your figure) yet I can take up my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this, that it was not Pride, nor a popular Itch, much leſs the love of a Briſon, influenced me to become an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer of your <hi>Scrupulous Conſciences.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I could heartily wiſh (as a mercy to theſe Nations) that all Religious Differences were Compoſed by Evangilioal Rules, and that all who own the Name of Chriſt, would ſerve him with one heart, and with one ſoul, and not tear each other to pieces, which by conſequence muſt expoſe them as a Prey to ſuch as gape for their Deſtruction.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94432:53"/>
If the Sanctions of Chriſt in the Old and New Teſtament ought to regulate the modes of his Worſhip, and that we are under an indiſpenſible Obligation to Obey that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Heaven, then let us either quit the name of Chriſtians, or act according to the Supream Law-givers unrepealable Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, quite exploding what's undeniably borrowed from the <hi>Pompilian</hi> or <hi>Pontifical Canons.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Some Sheets have been Printed off, of what I intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, but the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the <hi>Preſs</hi> interupted the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and got me Committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> where I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. There is nothing done, nor was intended to be done, but a fair Examination of thoſe things yonr Sermon invited to, which I had thought (if eſteemed Criminal) ſhould fall rather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cognizance of Divines, then the men of Law. For me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Pandects ſhould not be the Oracles of Religion; and that temporal Statutes ſhould be ſo Civil as to give precedency to the ſacred Records.</p>
                                 <p>'Tis poſſible that inquirers into Religion will look upon it, as a prepoſterous proceeding, and diſagreeable to the Nature of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> to force doubting perſons by penaltyes to Embrace it; for that can never make them good Converts, but Hypocrites. May they not ſay that tis a horid diſparagement to the ſelf-evidencing Light of the Goſpel, if it cannot ſtop the mouths of the Gain-ſayers any other way then by the Rigid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Acts of State? I cannot find that Chriſt or his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ever <hi>Church-curſed</hi> or <hi>Newgated Scrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> to Conformity.</p>
                                 <p>My Confinement is for accepting your invitation to hear both ſides, and I appeal to you, whether it be Candid to puniſh me for Obeying a Guide of the Church? I look upon you <hi>(in hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)</hi> Obliged to procure my Sheets <hi>(yet unfiniſhed)</hi> a publick Pasport, and to me my Liberty: Elſe I muſt conclude it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and that if the irreſiſtible Logick of Goals grows Al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode, it will make the Reformation ſome pretend to, ſuspected to be very little Meritorious of theat Name.</p>
                                 <p>Religion is a Sacred thing, and has been moſt horribly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch as have ſuperadded their own inventions, or thoſe Traditional Fopperies, received from our Deceiv'd and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious

                                 <p>I Beſeech you in the fear of God, and as you will anſwer it to our great Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that without reſpect to any other end then the good of Souls (as the profeſſion you take Obliges you to) that you would Treat <hi>Scupulous Conſciences</hi> as you would be dealt withal your ſelf: If they have no reaſon for their <hi>Diſſent,</hi> and will without ground ſuffer <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> with all the Ruinous Concomitants of ſo diſmal a Circumſtance; tis certain that <hi>Bedlam</hi> is more fit for them, then ſuch places of <hi>Confinement</hi> as are appointed for men in their wits; and by conſequence tis pity to be ſo ſevere with ſuch Simpletons. But if you will allow them any <hi>Modicum</hi> of Reaſon, then I appeal to all the Guid's of the Church, whether it be not more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the precepts of our <hi>Soveraign Legiſlator,</hi> to confute them by his <hi>Rules,</hi> rather then by ſuch Coercive methods which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> judg'd Ineffectual in his Declaration of indulgence <hi>March 1672?</hi>

                                 <p>Others being ſilent I obey'd you in that particular, not meerly to wrangle (for the Encounter is unequal, betwixt a Man ſo Eminent as you are, and ſo mean a Perſon as I am) but that an occaſſion may be given, in compliance to what you deſired to conclude Controverſys of this nature.</p>
                                 <p>If meerly for ſuch Obedience I muſt be puniſhed I know not how, nor in what manner, is there not a new way of conquering <hi>[Scrupulous Conſciences]</hi> unheard of in the Holy Scriptures, Started by ſome certain Ringleaders?</p>

                           <hi>The Recorder asked me ſome queſtions then,</hi> (viz.) Whether I was in Orders?

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Court told both Mr.</hi> Ralphſon <hi>and me,</hi> that in reſpect to our Education, as Scholars, we ſhould not be <hi>Pillory'd,</hi> though ('twas ſaid) we deſerv'd it.</p>
                        <p>We were ſent back to our place of Confinement, and the next <hi>Execution day,</hi> our Books were burnt, as the Sentence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, WITH FIRE in the place aforeſaid, and we continue here; but ſince I writ this, Mr. <hi>Ralphſon</hi> had a Superſedeas by <hi>Death</hi> to a <hi>better place.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus Sir, you have a ſeries of my Circumſtances; I will make no Complaints of the uſage I had, when forc'd, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to Lodge amongſt a Rabble of wretches, whoſe ſociety ſeem'd to me to be a Hell upon Earth, as before; nor of my other hardſhips, as Confinement, loſs of Employment, loſs of Health, &amp;c. But if you have any ſence of Humanity in you, you will Recollect your ſelf, and procure me my Freedom, (being not able to pay the Fine) loſt by obedience to your publick <hi>Call.</hi> Sir, I muſt tell you plainly, that you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in your very dedication to Sr. <hi>Gorge Jefferies,</hi> now chief Juſtice, a kind of Doubt, to ſay no more, Reſpecting your Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>You ſay there (P. 2. Ep.

                           <hi>From theſe Expreſſions I muſt conclude (If you are in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) that you care not how much you offend your weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>was of another mind,</hi> Rom. <hi>15. 1.</hi> &amp;c. We then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmitys of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves; let every one of us pleaſe his Neighbour for his good to Edification. <hi>Pray conſider this, and what follows in the ſame Chapter: And 1</hi> Cor. <hi>8. 12.</hi> But when you ſin ſo againſt the Brethren and wound their weak Conſciences, ye ſin againſt Chriſt. <hi>ver. 13.</hi> Wherefore if meat make my Bro her to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the World ſtandeth, leſt I make my Brother to offend: <hi>And 1</hi> Theſ. <hi>5. 14. the ſame Evangelical Doctor, exhorts you,</hi> To Comfort the feeble minded, Support the weak, and to be patient toward all men. <hi>And Gal. 6. 1.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the faulty in the Spirit of Meekneſs.</p>
                        <p>What a Superlative, <hi>what a true Chriſtian</hi> Complyance is here! Worth the imitation of the Guides of your Church! This Apoſtle would rather make a perpetual faſt from fleſh, then offend his <hi>Weak Brother.</hi> And I am apt to think no flouriſhes of <hi>Pulpit-Rhetorick</hi> ever drop't from <hi>him,</hi> to grieve his <hi>Weak Brethren,</hi> and that he never ſhrouded his writings, or preachings, under the terrible Patronage of ſuch men as you Repreſent Sr. <hi>Gorge Jefferies</hi> to be. I have a kind of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that your ſaid Patron, now <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> as he is a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in Eminent place, and of a piercing Judgement, Srong Memory, and of fluent Oratory, could not but look through the Superficial Addreſſes of that Dedication.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, a Man ſo dignified as he is, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly take it as an affront to his title of <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> that you ſhould ſay that men will be <hi>Juſtly affraid</hi> of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with you, when they know you have Engaged him on your ſide. That ſame word [Affraid] denotes a Champion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Courage in you; that no body ſhould dare to come near you; and withal, a Reflection on the juſtice of your Patron, that he will take your part <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong.</hi> As to the word [Quarrelling] I know no body that has aſſaulted you in any more perillous Attaque, then in Examining the Merits of the Cauſe as you Preached, and by the ſame Sermon (transfigur'd from the <hi>Preſs)</hi> invited men to do.</p>
                        <p>No Force and Arms were uſed againſt you by me, but Pen, Ink and a few Papers. The Indictment makes this a very formidable kind of Artillery.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94432:59"/>
But to bring the matter a little cloſer, I muſt deſire you will pleaſe to take notice of this Hainous Charge given in againſt me, and how made good in the Indictment, and how ſeverely handled both by the Juryes and Court thereupon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The charge, as you have heard, is for</hi> intending to diſturb the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> To bring the King into the greateſt <hi>Hate</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> to ſtir up and procure <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: a high and Heinous Charge indeed! But how is this made good?</hi> viz. <hi>By</hi> my diſparaging the Book of Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>But how doth that appear?</hi> viz. <hi>By</hi> the force of Arms uſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfully, Seditiouſly, and Maliciouſly, to Write, Print and Publiſh a <hi>Seditious</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Libel,</hi> Concerning our Lord the King and the Book of Common Prayer, Intituled <hi>A Plea for the Nonconformiſts. But wherein doth it appear by any thing which is writ in that Book, that this Hainous Charge is made good?</hi> viz. By their pregnant inſtances, produced out of the Book expreſſed in the Indictment.</p>
                        <p>The which therefore, ſince we muſt ſuppoſe they are the moſt Hainous and Dangerous paſſages to be found therein, and moſt proper and ſignificant to make good the Charge, I ſhall for your information, and that you may the better judge how the Charge is proved againſt me, give you the intire paragraph out of which the inſtances were picked, which I muſt beg the juſtice of you to Read; &amp; which I could not with all my Entreatys Obtain of the Court, tho ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (as you'l find) to come to the right ſence, (and for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Illuſtration; I ſhall diſtinguiſh the inſtances of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a different Character) know therefore that I having (in the <hi>Plea for the Nonconformiſts)</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 14. at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, been giving an account what the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> Anſwer to that great Objection; that all things they ſcruple in the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Church, are not <hi>Popiſh Novelties,</hi> but of Primitive <hi>Antiquity,</hi> (as you ſay) and having diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone through moſt of them, giving their Reaſons why they are not of <hi>Primitive Antiquity,</hi> but of <hi>Popiſh Novelty,</hi> and containd in the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi>—This Objection came to be ſtarted, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <q>But what do you ſay to the Lords Prayer? muſt we forbear that too, becauſe we find it in the <hi>Maſs-Book;</hi> tho ſo publickly injoyn'd by Chriſt to uſe it, as a ſtinted form, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. That when we pray, we ſhould ſay, Our Father, &amp;c.? To which the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ſay,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94432:59"/>
that it is a great miſtake to ſuppoſe that Chriſt hereby in this Scripture, has appointed this to be a ſet form, to be prayd by all in theſe preſcript words, when we pray unto God, for then it would be unlawfull to uſe any other words, then theſe herein expreſſed, in our prayers, and that the Diſciples and Apoſtles ſinned in uſing other words in thoſe their prayers we read of in Scripture, and ſo does the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                           </q> in forming ſo many Collects and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; And. <hi>p.</hi> 41. 42.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, to preſume to vary from Chriſt precepts, in altering or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>to the form of words expreſſed by Chriſt in this <hi>11 Luke.</hi> For ſo they have done, they ſay, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them who Treſpaſs againſt us,</hi> when there are no ſuch words in Chriſts Prayer, his words are, <hi>forgive us our Sins, our Debts opheilemata for we alſo forgive every one that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to us.</hi> Which, ſaith the Indictment, are falſe, ſictious, and ſcandalous ſentences, but it ſhews not wherein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And alſo the Doxology, which is not in this Prayer in <hi>Lake</hi> 11. <hi>[viz. For thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.] But you'l ſay, as to the Doxology, it is expreſſed by Chriſt at the end of the ſame prayer in his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. It is very True, it is ſo, where he delivers this prayer not as a ſet form, but a pattern of prayer: <hi>After this manner Pray ye hovto's</hi>—to this purpoſe, and which is an Explication of what he ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. when you pray, ſay, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>after this manner,</hi> and which can only be a warrant to the; Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any other, to make ſuch alterations Chriſt no more intending to tye the Diſciple who deſired to be inſtructed how to pray, to this form of words (nor any other Diſciple) then he did the twelve Diſciples when he ſent them out to Preach with thisword of Command, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Preach, ſaying, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> that they ſhould thereby be tyed to thoſe very words in their Preaching (and Preach nothing elſe) but as this was given as a Text or Theme to Preach by, ſo the other to pray by: The Diſciple who propoſes the queſtion, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1.

That Chriſt herein Teacheth us a Compendium of thoſe things we are to pray for; at that time (ſaith he) they were not bound to the uſe of ſo may Words and Syllables: As alſo <hi>Tertullian, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Muſculus, Cornelius Alapide:</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf (upon the place) who ſaith <hi>Liberum eſt,</hi> it is free for us to ask the ſame thing in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Aliis atque aliis verbis,</hi> ſometime one way,</q> and ſometimes another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> tell us expreſly, he knew not what to pray for, but as the Spirit gave him utterance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. But he did know what to pray for if this was to be his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript form.</q>

                              <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, they prayed <hi>Sine Monitore,</hi> without a Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor (or Common-Prayer-book) and <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us that among all the Chriſtians of that age ſcarce two were to befound that uſed the ſame words in Prayer, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Homil.</hi> 14. ſaith, With other gifts they had the gift of Prayer, which was alſo called the Spirit, but he who had the gift, did pray for the whole multitude, for that was Expedient unto the Church, &amp; alſo did inſtruct others to Pray.</q>

                        <p>For inſtance, if a man is charged in an Indictment that he contrary to his Allegiance, and not having the fear of God before his Eyes, but being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Inſtigation of the Devil, did ſuch a day, in ſuch a place, bring the King into greateſt Hate and Contempt amongſt his Subjects, and did moſt Maliciouſly and Seditiouſly, &amp;c. againſt the <hi>Publice peace,</hi> by force and Arms, Read a Chapter in the Bible in Engliſh before ſeveral People (which was Crime enough heretofore, however it is now) that the proving and confeſſing the matter of fact, (or any of the like nature) as foreign from the Crimes urged, muſt according to our Court-proceedings, bring him in Guilty of the whole Indictment, in order to be ſenetnced accordingly.</p>
