            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> haue adventured once againe Right Worshipfull, reverenced, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> to put into your hands, and present vnto your view, what hath fallen into my lap, and lot from the Lord. This worthy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatise so behoofefull for al persons, so needfull for these times, being formerly commended to my vse, with some other things of like nature, by my beloved, and gracious friend: I did accordingly as I had occasion, vse, and pervse. Now the more I did read, ponder, and consider what I read, the more I did admire the Impressions of wisdome, learning, religion, sanctification, and many other rare parts, which in faire characters of Grace, I found stampt almost in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry page of it. Certainely this Preacher sought to find out both profitable, and pleasant things, words of delight, and words of truth: not to humor, and tickle the itching eare by plausible, &amp; vaine sounds, as of tinckling Cymbals: but to refresh the thirsty heart with waters of life, and satisfie the hungry soule with good things, I know, Sir, you are no stranger, neither to the Tree, nor fruit, having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dwelt together vnder one roofe, dranke togither of

For, seeing here your eie may with more serious observation behold, what with good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heretofore your eare hath heard: both eie, and eare, head, and heart, may be refreshed anew with the renued presence (as it were) of an absent, &amp; ancient friend. <hi>David</hi> for his loue to <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Father, shewed great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> his Sonne, and I doubt not but this Infant for his Fathers sake, this worke for the Authours, shall finde accesse, and acceptance in like manner at your hands. And so commending this and my selfe to your favour and loue, I pray for continuance of Gods mercies &amp; increase of his graces, and that both for your person, &amp; place, to the farther building vp of the Body of Christ both in your selfe, and in all that depend vpon you. <hi>Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury in Cheshire, Iuly, 8. 1614.</hi>

            <p>CHristian Reader, I take not vpon me to speake so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Author, or his labour, as may match their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, or raise mens thoughts to any higher straine of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or admiration of the same. Yet if my wordes were of so great weight, and my testimony of that worth, that I might in discharge of this dutie, procure them their due: It were a labour neither mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed nor mispent: seeing <hi>that</hi> is no lesse due to the Gratious man, then to the vertuous woman, <hi>Giue him of the fruits of his hands and let his owne workes praise him in the Gates.</hi> Howsoever, for my own part, I cannot but speake what I haue found and felt. <hi>Wisdome herselfe</hi> (it seemeth) had a purpose to broach <hi>some of her best wines</hi> when she made a vent in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>is Vessell, and called so earnestly vpon <hi>all that thirst, to come, and buy wine without mony, and drinke freely.</hi> It is now about <hi>12</hi> yeares ago since first I tasted of this wine, aboue <hi>30</hi> since first it was mingled, &amp; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to cheere the hearts of Gods children: and yet, old as it is, it is so pleasant, and wholsome at this houre, that hee that drinkes of this old, will not streight desire new, but will doubtlesse acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the old is better. It was then a <hi>cup of salvation and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> first tempred for, and ministred vnto the Spouse of Christ, as a <hi>Preservatiue</hi> against the <hi>cup of abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the whores fist</hi>; and as a <hi>Confortatiue</hi> against the cup of <hi>Affliction in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand,</hi> whereof she must needs tast and pledg her <hi>Lord,</hi> that had himselfe begunne so deepe vnto her. And I nothing doubt but as the tast yet remaineth, so the vigor and vertue will bee now no lesse effectuall then before. Is any weake and feeble, wanting a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall appetite vnto heavenly Manna and wholsome food? let him drinke a little of this wine for his stomacke sake, and for his often infirmities. It shall refresh his spirits, warme his heart, &amp; quicken his desires vnto good things. Hath any drunk so deep of the whores Chalice, that being giddy therewithall, hee reeles and staggers in opinion, &amp; religion, as a drunken man? and is ready to sinke downe
<pb facs="tcp:3606:4"/>
and perish in his sinne? O then giue him of this soveraigne &amp; sweet wine; <hi>and stay him with these flagons, comfort him with these apples</hi>; and if once <hi>he thirst, and drinke of this fountaine,</hi> if once <hi>he hunger and eat of this fruit,</hi> he shall be sicke of loue, &amp; his soul shall liue. I adde no more.</p>
            <p>Only be advertised, Christian Reader, that albeit the copy which I had, was for the Bulke and body of it, reasonable intire, yet was it not without some blemishes, &amp; breaches as it came to my hands, which by some other helpe that I had, I laboured to repair.

That the day of the Lord was at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhemists</hi> in their notes mislike in our interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two things.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rhem. in</hi> 2, <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.</note> 1. That we say this revolting should be <hi>generall.</hi> 2. That we say it must be in <hi>matters of Religion</hi>: whereas the most part of the Fathers (say they) expound it of the revolting from the civill obedience to the Empire of Rome. But if that were gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them (which how true it is, shal after appeare) yet litle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it for their purpose. Now for our interpretation there are many things that make, namely the wordes following which serue to the same purpose that these do: for after that he had said <hi>a departure,</hi> he addeth straight, <hi>and that the man of sin be disclosed,</hi> of whom it is verified, that he should <hi>sit in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and shew himselfe to be God,</hi> which cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood otherwise then of <hi>Spirituall matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>signification,</hi> and <hi>vse</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, proveth,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> that it is so meant here as: in <hi>Act.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Which in the time of temptation go away.

            <p>Thirdly, this may appeare by the conference of other places of the scripture, wherein this same doctrine is delivered; <hi>Apo.</hi> 12.6. Where <hi>the woman fleeth into the wildernes</hi>: and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Babilon made all nations drunke with the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</hi> But for that they say, the fathers agree that it is meant in civill matters: let vs first admit they did, and all, if they please:<note place="margin">

            <p>Now the question is not who is an Antichrist. For who so breaketh the vnity of the Church by scisme or heresie is such a one. Wherevpon <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith, that even in his daies there were <note n="k" place="margin">1. Ioh 2.18.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Neither is it, what particuler man hee is, but what state of Governement, for it is spoken of some common state. Even as in this same place when it is said, that he only <note place="margin">2. Thess. 27.</note>

For if (as most <note n="n" place="margin">

Even so when he speaketh of Antichrist though it be vnder the name of one, yet the whole is vnderstood. Even as <note n="o" place="margin">Dan 7.3.4.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> in his 7. chapter, where he speaketh of 4. Monarchies calleth them 4. <hi>beasts and</hi> 4. <hi>kings,</hi> whereby are meant foure whole kingdomes. As for that shift of <note n="p" place="margin">

               </note> and wherevnto the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Antichrist here set downe do most properly belong: I say, that so farre as I can iudge the Bish. of <hi>Rome</hi> with that state is he. And hereby I meane not the Bish. alone, but the whole governement: not the Head only, but the whole Body, armes and legs: as is likewise meant in <note n="u" place="margin">Dan. 7.17.

               <hi>Daniel</hi> by the names of the kings, and kingdomes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3606:8"/>Neither mean I, that alwaies the Pope is the greatest &amp; chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest enimy &amp; wicked one, but that somtimes some that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him are the special instruments, &amp; dealers in his kingdome of wickednesse. As is also in <hi>Daniel</hi> meant, when it is said that the <note n="x" place="margin">Dan. 7.5.</note> Beare had in his mouth betweene his teeth three ribs, to <hi>whom it was said, arise, devour much flesh:</hi> whereby was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the crueltie that should be in that kingdome: which was not so much in the Kings and Governours themselues, as in those who were vnder them. For <note n="a" place="margin">2. Chr. 36.23 Ezra. 1 3 Ezra. 3.7.</note>

               <hi>Darius</hi> would haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued <hi>Daniel</hi> from the denne of Lions, but they were such as were inferiour in place, who hindred the <note n="c" place="margin">Ezra. 4.1.</note> building, and <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 6.4.5.</note> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast to the beasts.</p>
            <p>Hereto be we led, first by the circumstance of the times. For seeing that which withheld the discoverie of Antichrist, was the Abolishing of the Romane Empire (wherein wee haue the assent of our adversaries, and consent of the Fathers) and that the erecting of the Popedome was the abolishing of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, I see not how our adversaries can well avoid it, but that the Pope with that state must needs be Antichrist. Wherevnto we may adioyne the place deciphered in the <note n="e" place="margin">Apoc. 17.9.</note> 
               <hi>Revelation</hi> to be the citie seated on seaven hils, which had the government of al the earth. And whereas against this the <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sand. Dem.</hi> 4.</note> adversaries take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for that they say the Emperor is not yet gone thence, it is a slender shift, for that there remaineth to him the onely naked name, the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> yeelding neither tribute, nor subiection vnto him. And if the name were enough, <note n="g" place="margin">Ier 52.31.</note> 
               <hi>Ichoiakin</hi> being caried captiue to <hi>Babylon</hi> was then called king, and his throne set aboue the rest of the kings that were there: and yet then was fulfilled that <note n="h" place="margin">Hos. 3 4.</note> prophesie that <hi>Israel</hi> shall bee without a king.

            <p n="2">2 For that notwithstanding his rage against Christ, and his church, yet he kept even there a remnant, so that his name was among them.

Yet so long as they haue thus much, albeit in generality confessed: yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines there a church.

            <p>So that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we consider the general corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they may be termed an adulterous seed. And as we are to wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at the Lords severity, who so greatly punished his church: againe, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side we are to praise and magnifie his mercy: who in this great famine, had kept some bread &amp; some water, bread &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in a scant measure, yet such as might serue for to saue the life of some,<note place="margin">1.

The meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that such as are to encounter with this adversarie, shall finde him to be no common enimie. For though he shall bee a man, and therefore shall also die as the sonnes of men; yet so great power shal be given him to deceaue the world, that such as haue to deale with him, shall finde that they are to striue with more then flesh &amp; bloud.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note> Whereas therefore the Church hath been alwaies in afflictions, yet those which she shal suffer vnder Antichrist, shall be so great, that whereas these were but rods,<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Where it is said, that he shall come <hi>with all power</hi>] it is not meant that such <hi>might</hi> should be given him that he should doe what he will, for such power is not given to Satan himselfe, it being a <hi>prerogatiue</hi> peculiar to Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.18.</note>

Although they saw not all the errours, yet such as overthrew the foundation of Christianitie no doubt they vnderstood and withstood.

When they aske of vs. How many or who are they who thus were saued? What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer can they haue but this;<note place="margin">Rom. 11.34.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord, or who hath beene his counsellour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are then to think that God had some which never bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their knees to <hi>Baall,</hi> many who although partakers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their errors yet held the foundation. Some also who being deepely sunke in their grosse idolatries, were notwithstanding saved as brands halfe burnt out of the fire, beeing effectually called, some sooner, others later according to the rich mercy of God.</p>
            <p>There remaine as yet two points of those which haue beene proposed. The former, the <hi>Cause why God sendeth this great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> Wherin we are to consider how il he taketh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his worde. The later, the order and severity of God in condemning of such as refuse the word of truth offered.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <hi>11</hi> And therefore God shall send them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lies.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <hi>12</hi> That all they might be damned which beleeved not the truth but had pleasure in vnrighteousnesse.</p>
            <p>But because the later containing the grievousnes of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3606:22"/>
doth sufficiently expresse how il the Lord taketh the offence which deserveth it, I shall touch the same so far as this giveth occasion.</p>
            <p>Some there are to whom the word of truth was never sent, which abide in darknes and ignorance, so that no man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the wrath that lyeth on them. Howbeit if we compare it with the fircenes of that wrath which is here declared against them to whom the word of truth hath bin revealed, but who haue refused it, we shall see, that it is but very little. For here is laid downe the displeasure of God against them, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread and water was offered, but they as scornefull childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue cast it away, and insteed thereof haue poison given them whereon they feed, and drinke to their vtter destruction. Foolish men who when they had the light sent amongst them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>loued darknes more then light,</hi> who therefore had a perpetuall night brought on them, and so were led from iniquity to iniquity, til that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of damnation light vpon them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iudgements</hi> here threatned are two.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 One in this life.</item>
               <item>2 The other in the life to come.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The former, <hi>a punishment and sin.</hi> A <hi>sin</hi> in that they take <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in beleeving lies and delusions,</hi> a <hi>punishment, in that they are given over therevnto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The later <hi>a punishment only.</hi> In the first men are both doers &amp; sufferers: in the later they are sufferers only against their will.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pelagians</hi> long since, the <hi>Papists</hi> at this day, with some others, whose names I spare, haue so interpreted both this, and the like places, as having no other meaning, but that God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth them to be given vp to delusions, &amp;c: least if they say as the Apostle doth, that <hi>God sendeth them,</hi> they should make him the author of sin.<note place="margin">Iob. 13.7.</note> But we may say to them, as <hi>Iob, Is it fit to lie for God</hi>? We must say that which is the truth notwithstanding the vaine imagination which men haue of false consequents.

For seeing it is said that <hi>he sendeth delusions</hi> as his messengers,

it is plaine that herein he hath his worke. After which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the scripture speaketh in other places.<note place="margin">1 King. 22.23.</note>

Their dwelling place was enlarged by themselues, &amp; it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were not very sumptuous, for they were not able to beare the charges of an axe head which they had borrowed.
