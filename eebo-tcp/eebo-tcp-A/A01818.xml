         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THe firſt diviſion of the <hi>Romans</hi> in reſpect of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

<note n="b" place="margin">Servius. in lib. Georgic.</note> alſo <hi>Indigites</hi> .i. Gods adopted, or canonized; men deified.
For as the ſelect Gods had poſſeſſion of heaven by their
owne right; ſo theſe Gods canonized had it no otherwiſe
then by right of donation, being therefore tranſlated into
heaven, becauſe they lived as Gods vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth: but becauſe
their merit was inferior, and could not parallel the deſerts
of the Gods ſelect, therefore were they called Gods of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior

                        <hi>Servius</hi> would haue theſe called <hi>Divi;</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

ſhould ſignifie men made Gods, though commonly they
are vſed one for another. Whence they called all their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<hi>Divi,</hi> becauſe for their deſerts they thought them
worthy to be Gods. Now the<note n="d" place="margin">Roſin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. l. 3. c. 18.</note> manner how a man became
deified was this: The party to be canonized being dead, a
pile of wood was made in forme of a great tent, or taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
with three other leſſer tabernacles one vpon top of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
the lower-moſt having in it dry combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but in the out-ſide adorned richly with gold, Ivory, &amp;
painted tables: vpon the top of which was placed an eagle
made of ſome light matter, as paper, or thin wood. Hither
the dead corps was to be caryed with great ſolemnities;
the Senate, the gentlemen, and al the chiefe magiſtrats go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, with hymnes and ſongs, and al kinde of honor,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3342:20"/>
which was to be performed even to the Gods themſelues.
He being in this manner brought, and laide within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
tabernacle, the fire was kindled, by reaſon of the
ſmoake and vapor whereof the Eagle was carryed vp into
the aire, and, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> thought, it did tranſport the
ſoule of the dead body into heaven, in ſo much that ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was canonized amongſt the Gods, and worſhipped
as a God. And becauſe they were thus turned into Gods,
ſome haue called them <hi>Deos animales,</hi>

vertues, by which as by a ladder men clymed into heaven:
and therefore did men ſtile them Gods, becauſe by their
meanes men became deified. Late writers perceiving that
all the number of the Gods could not bee reduced vnto
theſe three heads, haue added a fourth ſort, which they
<note n="f" place="margin">Roſin. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. lib. 2. c. 19.</note> call <hi>Semones, quaſi ſemi-homines,</hi> becauſe ancient writers,

In which point I ſhall willingly condeſcend vnto him; but
I ſhall leaue to the iudgement of others, to determin how
iuſtly he hath reſtrained the Gods <hi>minorum gentium</hi> of the

is, that the demigods, the morall vertues which haue
beene ſtiled Gods, and theſe <hi>Semones,</hi> may all of them bee
called Gods of the leſſer nations, ſtanding in oppoſition
with the Gods ſelect, which are called Gods of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nations. But that we may vnderſtand what is meant by
theſe <hi>Semones,</hi> we muſt remember, that by them are ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto vs not thoſe Gods, which doe appertaine to man
himſelfe, but to the neceſſaries of mans living, his victuals,
his cloathing, and the like: not to the being of a man, but
to the well being of him, of which ſort is <hi>Salus, Fortuna,</hi>
with others. We read likewiſe of other names given in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to diverſe Gods, not as oppoſite members of a diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but as notes of diſtinction drawne from the diverſity
of helpe, which they ſeverally did afford vnto man. In this
eſpect ſome were called <hi>dij Patrij,</hi> or <hi>tutelares,</hi> ſuch as had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3342:21"/>

<hi>S. George for England, S. Denys for France, S. Patricke
for Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. And the Romans being fully perſwaded of
the truth thereof, whenſoever they went about to beſeege
any towne, by certaine enchantments, or ſpels they would
firſt call out theſe Tutelar Gods; becauſe they deemed it a
matter impoſſible to captivate the citie, as long as theſe
Gods were within; or at leaſt they thought it a crime vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expiable
to take the Gods as priſoners. And leaſt other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might vſe the ſame meanes in beſeeging Rome, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<note n="g" place="margin">Sylvius in epiſt. virotu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illuctrium.</note> as diverſe authors haue thought, the true name of
the Romane citie was never knowne, leaſt thereby the
name of their Tutelar God might bee deſcryed. Others
namely the <hi>Tyrians</hi> haue tied faſt their God <hi>Hercules</hi> with
a golden chaine, thereby the more to ſecure themſelues of
his reſidence among them.<note n="h" place="margin">Alex. Gen. dier. l. 6. c. 4.</note> Others haue beene called <hi>Dij

in time of war they are not bound to either ſide: but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they helpe one ſide, and ſometimes the other. And as
they ſuppoſed ſome Gods to haue the protection of whole
countries, ſo did they beleeue that others had the charge
of particular men; and that ſo ſoone as any man was borne
two ſpirits did preſently acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany him inviſibly, the one
tearmed the <hi>bonus Genius,</hi> or good angell, perſwading him

was the more confirmed by a viſion which appeared vnto

hath his name <hi>à februando,</hi> from purging: whence the feaſt
or game is as a purification; though the Latin word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
as much as a feaſt of wolues, in a memoriall that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi>
and <hi>Remus</hi> were nurſed by a ſhee-woulfe. This ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
very probable, becauſe the Prieſts, which were called
<hi>Luperci</hi> began their courſe at the foote of the mount <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
called by the <hi>Romanes Lupercal</hi> .i. the place, where the
woulfe nurſed<note n="f" place="margin">Plutarch. in Romulo.</note> 
                        <hi>Romulus.</hi> The ceremonies were theſe: The
hoaſt (being two goates) was to be ſlaine; and two noble
mens ſonnes were to bee preſent, whoſe foreheads being
blouded with the kniues of them that had ſlaine the goats,
by &amp; by were to be dryed vp with wooll dipped in milke.
Then the young boyes muſt laugh immediately after their
foreheads were dry. That done they cut the goats skins, &amp;
made thongs of them, which they tooke in their hands, &amp;
ran with them all about the city ſtark-naked (ſaving they
had a cloath before their privities) and ſo they ſtrook with
thoſe thongs all they met in the way. The young wiues did
never ſhun them at all, but were well contented, to be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with them; beleeving it helped them to be with childe,
and alſo to be eaſily delivered. Moreover it is to be noted,
that a dogge was ſacrificed at this time, becauſe there is a
naturall antipathy, or contrariety of nature, betweene the
dogge and the woulfe: whereby <hi>Romulus</hi> thought to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his gratefulneſſe vnto the woulfe for her paines in nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
him. The reaſon why the prieſts ranne vp &amp; downe
the ſtreetes naked, was, becauſe that <hi>Pan</hi> the God of this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3342:23"/>
ſacrifice was painted naked. As the feaſt, ſo alſo the place
from whence they came, and likewiſe the Prieſts had their
names <hi>à Lupâ</hi> which ſignifieth a woulfe. Some authors
haue obſerved three ſorts of the <hi>Luperci,</hi> ſome called <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani,</hi>

then did al the people repaire vnto a common feaſt; where,
as they were eating, they ſung hymnes, and ſongs in the

about the altars; intimating therby, that there was no part
of their body, but ſhould bee imployed in the ſervice of

<note n="a" place="margin">Plutarch. in Numa.</note> Some allowed no more daies to an yeare, then we doe to

ſaie, <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> perceiving that the monthes did

the winter, therevpon after long ſtudy and many inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the <hi>Grecians</hi> finding the reaſon of this confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he added vnto <hi>Romulus</hi> his yeare fifty daies, ſo that
the whole yeare afterward was divided into twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths;
becauſe the moone had finiſhed her courſe 12. times
in that ſpace; Beginning their yeare then at Ianuary: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then in his iudgemnt was the fitteſt time to beginne

Ianuarie, the ſun being about the Tropicke of Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne.
Afterward vpon a ſuperſtitious conceite of the odde
number, <hi>Numa</hi> added one day more vnto <hi>Ianuary,</hi> ſo that
wheras at the firſt <hi>Numa</hi> his yeare did agree with the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
yeare, both of them containing three hundred fifty

fifty fiue daies, which computation falling out too
ſhort for the true yeare by the ſpace of ten daies, and ſixe
howres yearly, it occaſioned every eighth yeare the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of three whole months, which they called their
leape yeare:<note n="d" place="margin">G Merula in orat. pro Q. Ligario.</note> This confuſednes afterward <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> by
long ſtudy remedied, adding the odde ten dayes vnto <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Pompilius</hi> his yeare. And leaſt the odd ſix houres might
at laſt breed diſorder in their computation, hee appointed
that every fourth yeare a whole day ſhould bee inſerted,
next after the three and twentieth of Februarie; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
they called <hi>Intercalatio</hi> from an old verbe <hi>Interca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>

being the foure and twentieth of Februarie, was
alwaies the ſixt of the Kalends of March,<note n="e" place="margin">G. Merula in orat. pro Q Ligar.</note> and therefore
becauſe of the interpoſition of that day, they called the
leap-yeare <hi>Annum biſſextilem</hi> .i. the yeare wherein there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3342:37"/>
falled out two dayes which they called <hi>Sext. Calend. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij.</hi>

In reſpect of the players forſaking the ſtage, the parts were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3342:40"/>
fiue; namely the fiue Acts. For the Actors did fiue times in

ſuppoſed to haue been this, That the ſpectators might not
be wearied out with a continued diſcourſe or action, but
that they might ſometimes be delighted with variety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed.

The ſubiect of a Comedy is often feigned, but of a
Tragedy it is commonly true, and once really performed.
The beginning of a tragedy is calme and quiet, the ende
fearefull and turbulent; but in a comedy contrarily the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3342:41"/>
is turbulent, and the end calme. Another differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
which <hi>Anteſignanus</hi> hath omitted is behouefull for vs to
knowe, namely that the Tragedians did weare vpon the
ſtage a certaine ſhooe comming halfe way vp the legge in
manner of buskins, which kind of ſhooe was called by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <hi>Cothurnus,</hi> and from that cuſtome it hath beene occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that <hi>Cothurnus</hi> is tranſlated to ſignifie a Tragicall and

of playes hath beene taken not from the place where

Some were celebrated in the honour of the Gods, &amp; they
were named <hi>Ludi ſacri;</hi> others for the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſome
vow, being called therefore <hi>Ludi votiui;</hi> others for the
more ſolemne celebration of funerals, whence they were
called <hi>Ludi funebres:</hi> laſtly others for ſport and exerciſe
called therefore <hi>Ludi ludicri.</hi> Vnto thoſe ſacred or holy
playes belonged theſe; <hi>ludi Megalenſes,</hi> otherwiſe called

The <hi>votiui ludi</hi> were alſo performed in the honour of ſome
God, but they were diſtinguiſhed from <hi>ludi ſacri,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3342:42"/>
theſe <hi>votivi</hi> were performed only vpon occaſion of ſome
ſpeciall vow made: for whenſoever the <hi>Romans</hi> did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any deſperate warre, then did ſome <hi>Roman</hi> magiſtrate
<hi>Vovere ludos vel templa,</hi> conditionally, that they got the
conqueſt.<note n="h" place="margin">Aſcenſius epiſt. viror. illuſt. lib. 5.</note> Whiles the magiſtrate vttered this his vow, he
was ſaid <hi>Vota nuncupare</hi> or <hi>facere vota</hi> .i. to make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
vow vnto the Gods; The vow being thus made, hee
was ſaid to be <hi>votireus.</hi> .i. conditionally bound &amp; obliged
to the performance of this vow, ſo that the Gods might
challenge the thing vowed as due debt, if they granted his
requeſt. But the requeſt being granted, then was hee ſaid
<hi>damnatus voti, vel voto</hi> .i. ſimply bound to the performance
of it; ſo that by a conſequence <hi>Damnari voti vel voto,</hi> is to
haue ones deſire accompliſhed. The third ſort of plaies,
which wee called <hi>ludos funebres,</hi> was fencing and playing
of prizes, the cuſtome among the Romanes being, that at
the funerals of their friends, they would procure certaine
ſlaues and captiues to ioyne combate vpon the <hi>Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,</hi>
vntil one of them had beene killed; whence thoſe fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were called <hi>Buſtuarij,</hi> from <hi>buſtum,</hi> the place where
dead mens bodies were burned. They firſt began their
fight with certaine cudgels, or yardes called <hi>Rudes</hi> &amp; after

ſix or ſeaven combatants: and if his hap were to prevaile
ſo often, then did he receaue a garland or coronet of palme

there were three beds, ſometimes but two about the table,

ordinary wood, ſtanding vpon three feet; but for men of

and it ſtood vpon one whole entire foote made of yvory in
the forme of a great Lyon or Leopard, &amp;c. ſometimes this
table was made in the forme of an halfe moone, the one

it was called <hi>Sigma,</hi> becauſe it did much reſemble the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

The matter whereof theſe torches were made, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

<hi>Teda,</hi> and thence haue the Poets figuratiuely called
both the torches, and the wedding it ſelfe <hi>Tedas.</hi> When the

annoint the poſts of the dore with oyle,<note n="l" place="margin">Serv. Aenei. lib. 4.</note> from which cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

raviſhed the daughters of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> there were founde
ſome of the meaner and poorer ſort carying away one of
the faireſt women: which being knowne certaine of the
chiefe citizens would haue taken her from them, but they
began to cry out that they caried her to <hi>Talaſſius,</hi> a man
well beloued among the Romanes; at which naming of
<hi>Talaſſius</hi> they ſuffered her to be caried away, themſelues
accompanying hir, and often crying <hi>Talaſſio, Talaſſio.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whence it hath beene continued as a cuſtome among the
<hi>Romanes</hi> ever after at their mariages to ſing <hi>Talaſſio, Talaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio:</hi>

of leading or bringing home the new maried bride, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that comicall phraſe <hi>Ducere vxorem,</hi> to mary a wife.
Shee being thus brought home, receaued the keyes of her

of al things in the houſe was then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto her.<note n="n" place="margin">Alex. Gen. dier. l. 2. c. 5.</note> The
mariage bed was called <hi>Genialis lectus,</hi> as we may ſuppoſe
<hi>quaſi Genitalis.</hi> The next day after the mariage the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
receaued gifts from her friends, which the lawyers
termed <hi>Nuptialia dona.</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Vid. Fr. Silv pro Clientio.</note> But <hi>Cicero</hi> expoundeth theſe <hi>dona

diſcontent had fallen out betweene the man &amp; his wife
<note n="p" place="margin">Sig. de iure Rom. l. 1. c. 9.</note> then did they both repaire vnto a certaine chappell built

there, they returned friends. We hauing thus ſeen the rites

                     <p>THE <hi>Romanes</hi> in ancient time when they perceaued a

kinne ſhould receaue the laſt gaſpe of breath from
the ſicke body into his mouth, as it were by way of kiſſing
him: (to ſhew therby how loath &amp; vnwilling they were to

After the body had thus deceaſed, they kept it ſeven daies

In theſe ſeaven daies ſpace, all the dead mans friendes met
together now and then making a great out cry or ſhout
with their voices, hoping that if the dead body had beene
onely in a ſwoune or ſleepe, he might thereby be awaked.
This action was tearmed <hi>conclamatio,</hi> whence when wee

the poorer ſort were not able to vndergoe the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

Moreover if any ſervants had beene manumized by him,
they accompanied the mourners lamenting for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

that no man beſides the Emperour and Veſtal Nuns

was not by interring the corps, as in former times it had

making even the dead alſo ſubiects of their implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſolemnity. The charges at funerals growing by this means
to be doubled, the law of the 12. tables provided in theſe
words <hi>Homini mortuo oſſa ne legito, &amp;c:</hi> that no mans fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

of their proceedings in propounding caſes vnto the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.
<note n="d" place="margin">Philip. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Phil. 11.</note> The cuſtome was at firſt, that the <hi>Romanes</hi>
ſhould beſtow their ſuffrages <hi>Viuâ voce,</hi> but afterward
that every one might with freer libertie giue his voice,
they commanded certaine wooden tables, wherein the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3342:54"/>
names of thoſe that ſtood for offices were written, to bee
caried about, every ſuffrager receaving ſo many tables, as
there were ſuitors: then did the people giue backe that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with whom they would ſuffrage. But if a law were to
be enacted, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> every ſuffrager receaued two tables, in the
one or which were written theſe two great letters V. R; in
the other was written a great <hi>Romane</hi> A. Thoſe who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
theſe tables vnto the people, did ſtand at the lower
end of<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. pag. 13.</note> thoſe bridges (which were erected vp for the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers
to aſcend vnto the <hi>ovilia)</hi> whence they were called <hi>à


diribendo</hi> .i. from diſtributing <hi>Diribitores.</hi> At the other end
of the bridges were placed certaine cheſts or little coffers,
into which the ſuffragers which did approue the law did
caſt in the firſt table; thoſe that diſliked it, did caſt in the
ſecond: for by thoſe two letters V. R. which were written
in the firſt, is meant <hi>Vti Rogas</hi> .i. Be it as thou haſt asked,
this word <hi>Fiat</hi> being vnderſtood. By A. in the ſecond table
was meant <hi>Antiquo</hi> .i. I forbid it, the word ſignifying, as
much as <hi>antiquum volo;</hi> I like the old law, I loue no inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
The tables being thus caſt into the cheſts, certaine
men appointed for that purpoſe in manner of <hi>Scrutators</hi>
(they called them <hi>Cuſtodes,</hi> and ſometimes<note n="c" place="margin">Plin. l. 33. cap 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Nongenti)</hi> did
take the tables out of the cheſts, and ſo number the voices
by making ſo many points or pricks in a void table, as they
found tables alike: which kind of accounting occaſioned
theſe and the like phraſes; <hi>Suffragiorum punctano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tulit ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>

The voices being thus numbred, it was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the common cryer what was decreed. Becauſe the
vſe of thoſe tables is now growne quite out of vſe, I ſhall
make bold to inſert that, which with much labour I haue
collected out of ſeverall autors touching theſe tables. It is
certaine that a long time the vſe of paper was not known,
whence men were wont to write ſometimes vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
rinds of trees, called in Latine <hi>Libri</hi> (ſo that to this
day we call our bookes <hi>Libri,</hi> becauſe in olde time they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3342:54"/>
were made of thoſe rinds of trees:) ſometimes they did
write in great leaues made of that ruſh <hi>Papyrus,</hi> growing
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from which we haue derived our engliſh word
<hi>Paper,</hi> and the latine word <hi>Papyrus,</hi> now ſignifying our

whence we haue digreſſed, wee will proceed to ſhew the
maner how they enacted their laws. Al the <hi>Romans</hi> had not
power and autority of preferring a law, but onely eight of
their magiſtrates which they called <hi>Magiſtratus maiores:</hi>
namely the <hi>Praetor,</hi> the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> the <hi>Interrex,</hi>
the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> the military Tribunes, the Kings, and the
<hi>Triumviri,</hi> vnto theſe eight was added one of thoſe whom
they called <hi>Magiſtratus minores,</hi> namely the <hi>Tribunus
Plebis.</hi> If any of theſe Magiſtrates thought it fit to preferre
a law, then did he firſt write it downe at home, and conſult
with ſome lawyer, whether or no it might be for the good
of the common wealth, whether it would not weaken anie
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3342:55"/>
former law, or whether it was not formerly included in
ſome other law, &amp;c. Theſe and many other cautions were
to be conſidered, before it was preferred, yea ſome would
haue the approbation of the whole Senate after the adviſe
of their lawyer, though diverſe times that hath been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And the lawyer alone allowing it, the law was hanged
vp publiquely in the market place for the ſpace of three
market-daies, which kinde of publiſhing the law was tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Legis Promulgatio quaſi provulgatio,</hi> during which
time of promulgation, reaſons were alledged <hi>pro &amp; con:</hi> by
the ſpectators: and all the people had ſo much time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of the conveniency thereof, and every one vpon iuſt
reaſon, had free liberty to admoniſh him that preferred the
law, either to amend it, or to ſurceaſe the propoſeall. After
the third Market-day, (for vnleſſe it were vpon an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no aſſembly might be called vpon a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-day,
becauſe of the country folks buſineſſes, they alſo
having freedome of ſuffraging) the magiſtrate did convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
the people to that place where the law was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:
there the Towneclarke or notary reading the law,
the common cryer proclaimed it, then did he which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged
it make an oration vnto the people, perſwading
them that it might paſſe. Sometimes others of his friends
would ſecond him with orations in his behalfe, as likewiſe
others that diſliked it, would by orations diſſwade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſhewing the inconveniency thereof. After the orations
had been ended, an vrne or pitcher was brought vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Prieſts there preſent, into which were caſt the names
of the tribes, if the <hi>comitia</hi> were <hi>tributa,</hi> or of the centuries

being divided into thirty pariſhes did giue their
ſuffrages: they were ſo called from <hi>curia</hi> ſignifying
a pariſh. And vntill <hi>Servius Hoſtilius</hi> his time, who did firſt
inſtitute the <hi>comitia centuriata,</hi> all things which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the ſuffrages of the people, were determined
by theſe <hi>curiata comitia:</hi> But after the other two ſortes of
aſſemblies had beene eſtabliſhed, theſe <hi>curiata</hi> were vſed
onely either for the enacting of ſome particular lawes, or
for the creating of ſome certaine prieſts called <hi>Flamines.</hi>
For the better vnderſtanding hereof we muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3342:57"/>
though at firſt theſe thirty pariſhes were parts of the three
Tribes (each tribe being divided into ten pariſhes,) yet in
proceſſe of time the encreaſe of the <hi>Romane</hi> people was
ſuch, that a great part of the <hi>Romane</hi> fields were filled with
buildings &amp; places of habitation, inſomuch that the tribes
of the <hi>Romanes</hi> were encreaſed to thirty fiue: but the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
(becauſe none that dwelt out of the citty were tied to
the rites and ceremonies of the <hi>Romane</hi> religion) did not
encreaſe, ſo that the pariſhes did not alwaies remaine parts
of the tribes. Hence it followeth that all the <hi>Romanes</hi> had
not power to ſuffrage in theſe aſſemblies, but thoſe alone,
who dwelt within the city: for no other could be of anie
pariſh. The place where theſe aſſemblies were held, was the
great hal of iuſtice called from theſe aſſemblies <hi>Comitium.</hi>
Before theſe aſſemblies were held, it was required that
ſome lawfull magiſtrate for ſome competent time before
hand ſhould ſolemnely proclaime them, and the thirtie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jants
(each pariſh hauing for that purpoſe his ſerjant)
ſhould call the people together; as likewiſe three <hi>Augures</hi>

The firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> contained foureſcore centuries of

twentie centuries of footmen, and two of workemen,
which followed after to make military engins &amp; weapons:

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
of footmen, but to the fourth were added two other

vpon iuſt occaſion did againe <hi>receptui canere,</hi> ſound the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait:
the fifth <hi>Claſſis</hi> contained thirtie centuries of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
the ſixt or laſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> contained one centurie: ſo that
in all the ſix <hi>Claſſes</hi> were contained one hundred foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and thirteene centuries. Where we muſt note that al
the centuries of footmen did conſiſt the one halfe in every
<hi>Claſſis</hi> of the younger ſort, who were to make war abroad
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3342:58"/>
vpon the enimies; the other halfe of old men, who remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at home for the ſafety of the citie. All that hath beene
hitherto ſpoken of theſe <hi>Centuriata comitia,</hi> may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of <hi>Sigonius</hi> in the place aboue quoted. The chiefe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander of every centurie was called <hi>Centurio;</hi> the rod or

may perceaue, that thoſe <hi>Centuriata comitia</hi> were thoſe,
wherein the people did giue their voices by centuries, or
hundreds. Now the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turies did not conſiſt of thoſe alone
which had their places of habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but of certaine
<hi>Municipall</hi> ſtates alſo, &amp; ſuch colonies or other ſtates, that

the cuſtome in old time was, that al theſe centuries ſhould
march in their armour after the magiſtrate which aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them, into the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> there to giue their
voices. But this cuſtome continued not long, for thereby
they did diſarme the citie, and giue their enimies (if any
ſhould aſſayle them in time of their aſſemblies) the greater
adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage: for their greater ſecuritie therfore, they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a flagge to bee hanged out vpon the mount <hi>Ianiculus,</hi>
ſome few armed men ſtanding there in watch &amp; ward for
the ſafegard of the citie: and when the aſſembly was to bee
diſſolved, then did the watch depart, and the flag was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
downe: neither could any thing after that bee determined;
but if they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued their aſſemblies, then did they proceed
to the giuing of their voices, in old time thus. Thoſe ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> being the wealthier had the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
of ſuffraging firſt, and becauſe this firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
more centuries then all the reſt, therefore, if they could
agree among themſelues, the other centuries were never
asked their voices. This kind of ſuffraging being ſomwhat
partiall in as much as the richer and wealthier being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> did overſway the elections againſt
the poorer ſort of people; thence did the after ages appoint

<hi>à tributo dando</hi> every ſeveral region or quarter paying ſuch
a tribute; or <hi>quia primò tres tantùm fuerunt,</hi> the whole citie
being at firſt divided only into three regions, or wardes,
each nationall tribe having his ſeuerall region or locall
tribe to dwell in. The firſt nationall tribe called <hi>Ramnenſes</hi>
did in habit the mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the mount <hi>Coelius,</hi> &amp;
thoſe two hills made the firſt locall tribe. The ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
tribe called <hi>Tatienſes</hi> did inhabite the <hi>Capitoll,</hi> and
the <hi>Quirinall</hi> mountaine, which two mountaines made the
ſecond locall tribe. The third nationall tribe did inhabite
the plaine betweene the <hi>Capitoll</hi> and the <hi>Palatine</hi> hill, and
that plaine was called the third locall tribe. Of theſe tribes
more is ſpoken in the<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. pag. 22.</note> firſt diviſion of the Romane people.
Only here we muſt note thus much, that in proceſſe of time
after the citie was enlarged, and the number of the Roman
citizens encreaſed, theſe locall tribes were alſo augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted,

ſo hot that in the end though the nobilitie would not

out of the commonalty, who though they were not
called <hi>Conſuls,</hi> but <hi>Tribuni,</hi> yet were they of <hi>Conſular</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
By which they were diſtinguiſhed from the other
ſort of Military <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who had power and authoritie
only in matters military, and were known by the name of
<hi>Tribuni militum</hi> without any addition.<note n="n" place="margin">Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 6. c. 18.</note> Sometimes there

and <hi>comitiati;</hi> not therby to intimate vnto vs any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

For if they were choſen by the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> then were

then were they called <hi>Tribuni fuffecti</hi> .i. <hi>Tribunes</hi> ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Senate, called <hi>Praetores,</hi> whoſe office was to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
iuſtice vnto the Provinciall inhabitants: yea, and if
occaſion ſerved, to make warre alſo vpon their enimies; &amp;
this was the reaſon that the number of the <hi>Praetors</hi> did ſo
increaſe alwaies, namely accordingly as the number of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3342:71"/>
Provinces did encreaſe. The warres and tumults in the
Provinces ſometimes were ſo great, that the <hi>Praetour</hi> was
not ſufficient both to manage warre and execute iuſtice:
wherevpon the <hi>Senate</hi> thought fit to ſend another magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
into the Provinces, whom they called a <hi>Conſul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
properly the managing of warre belonged vnto the
<hi>Conſul.</hi> So that there were at firſt two ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
magiſtrates, a <hi>Conſul</hi> to manage warre, and
a <hi>Praetour,</hi> or L. chiefe Iuſtice to ſit in iudgement. And if
theſe two by a ſecond grant from the <hi>Senate</hi> did continue
in their office aboue the ſpace of an yeare, then were they
called <hi>Proconſules, &amp; Propraetores.</hi> But in proceſſe of time
this cuſtome was altered. For then none could bee <hi>Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,</hi>
but thoſe alone who had beene <hi>Conſuls</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could any be <hi>Propraetours,</hi> which had not beene <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
at <hi>Rome.</hi> Their manner being, that the next yeare after
the expiration of their offices in <hi>Rome</hi> they ſhould departe

certaine Provinces for the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

howbeit ſometimes the <hi>Senate</hi> did interpoſe their autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

which how iuſtly he hath tearmed a violence, I ſhal
leaue to the indifferent iudgement of the vnpartial reader.
The right of the Lordſhip or owning any thing was ſued
for in this maner: The plainteiffe did queſtion with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
thus; firſt <hi>An auctor eſſet?</hi> .i. whether hee had not
covertly made away the poſſeſſion of the thing, thereby to
fruſtrate the action. Secondly, <hi>An sponderet</hi> .i. whether he
woulde put in a gage of mony into the court, which hee
would forfeit if he were caſt; which being done, the plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiffe
did alſo vpon the demande of the defendant put in a
gage of mony to be forfeited, if he prevailed not in his ſuit.
This gage of mony was tearmed<note n="r" place="margin">Sigon. de iu dic. lib. cap. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

put in ſurety, that during the triall in law, the ground or

Vpon extraordinary occaſions, (as when tumults or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
did cauſe any ſuſpicion of imminent danger) the
chiefe leader of the ſouldiers did go vnto the Capitoll and
bring forth two banners or flags, the one red, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>vexillum roſeum,</hi> vnto which the footmen repaired; the
other sky-coloured called therefore <hi>coeruleum,</hi> which the
horſemen followed. The reaſon why the horſemens ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner
was sky-coloured is<note n="g" place="margin">Serv Aenei. lib. 8.</note> rendred thus, becauſe it did moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the colour of the ſea, which colour they deemed
moſt acceptable to <hi>Neptune,</hi> who was both the God of

ſuddaine daunger woulde not yeelde ſo much time,
that they might ſeverally bee ſworne, therefore did they
take their oath in common altogether; and thence
were they called <hi>Milites per coniurationem;</hi> as likewiſe

it in its true ſenſe, namely for thoſe ſouldiers who
by the L. Generall were added vnto the body of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
hee hauing autoritie to call out ſuch other ſouldiers,
who for their long ſervice were diſcharged from giuing in
their names at a muſter. And theſe are generally by all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
tearmed <hi>Milites evocati;</hi> and <hi>Lipſius</hi> deemeth them

The ſouldiers being thus preſſed, if they purpoſed
to make warre vpon their enimies, then did the L. Generall
ſummon them to prepare themſelues by a ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets;
&amp; this was tearmed <hi>Claſſicum canere, à calando,</hi> which
ſignifieth to call. Which being done, a skarlet banner was
hanged out at the L. Generall his pavilion: from which ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony

vpon this they did <hi>Barritum tollere,</hi> make a great

they did <hi>Arma concutere,</hi> ruſtle together with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,

choſe out the youngeſt and pooreſt of all the reſt, &amp; called
them by the name of <hi>Velites.</hi> Their place in regard of the
other ſouldiers was baſe and diſhonourable, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they fought a farre off and were lightly armed; but
alſo becauſe they were commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly expoſed to their enimies
as forelorne hopes. According to<note n="h" place="margin">Lip. de mil Rom. lib. 4. dial. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> theſe <hi>Velites</hi> did
commonly make vp the ſpaces betweene the Maniples of

retire: whence when a man doth leape from one thing to

Having choſen out a competent number of theſe ſcoutes,
they proceeded to the choiſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they called <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtati</hi> .i. Pike-men: foraſmuch as they fought with a kinde of

Secondly, they called the <hi>Principes,</hi> which marched in the

This rampier did extend it ſelfe toward the wals of
the city, ſo that by making (as it were) a great hill, they
might overtop the city, and fight with the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Now that this great heape of earth might become

times the <hi>Romanes</hi> did beſtow the freedome of their citie
vpon forraigne countries; &amp; the degrees of freedome was
proportioned accordingly as the countries were. Some
they honoured with the name of <hi>Romane</hi> citizens, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
them from the right of ſuffraging, leaving them alſo
to be governed by their owne lawes and magiſtrates. This
ſtate they called a <hi>Municipal</hi> ſtate, in Latine <hi>Municipium,</hi>
becauſe they were <hi>Muneris huius honorarij participes.</hi>

were three. Firſt <hi>Nomen Imperatoris,</hi> of which<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. p. 176.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

for many daies togither, ſometimes more, ſometimes fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
all which daies the <hi>Romane</hi> people did obſerue as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
daies, offring vp dayly praiers and ſacrifice to the Gods
in the behalfe of their L. Generall: The cuſtome being that
after ſome notable victory, the ſouldiers having ſaluted
their chiefe captaine (whom I call their L. General) by the
the name of <hi>Imperator,</hi> then would he ſend letters vnto the
<hi>Senate</hi> dight with lawrell, wherein he required both that
name to be confirmed, and approved by them, as likewiſe
that they would <hi>Decernere ſupplicationes</hi> .i. appoint ſuch
ſolemne ſupplications. Thirdly, they honoured him at his
comming home alſo with a Triumph. <hi>Triumphus vel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior,

<hi>Coronae,</hi> crownes, of which <hi>A. Gell.</hi> obſerveth theſe to haue

it called <hi>Corona aurea:</hi> it was ſent by the <hi>Senate</hi> vnto the

which was given by the ſouldiers vnto their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
when they were freed from a ſiege: it was made of
graſſe growing in that place, where they were beſieged,
whence it had the name alſo of <hi>Corona graminea.</hi> Now the
reaſon why they made this crowne of graſſe growing in
the place where they were beſieged, was thereby to yeeld
vp their right in that place vnto their captaine: for by that
ceremony, as<note n="m" place="margin">Plin. l. 22. cap. 4.</note>

the reſemblance of a bulwarke, or at leaſt of the mound,
