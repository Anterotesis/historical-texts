            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
FREE-BORN SUBJECT;
OR,
The Englishmans Birthright:
Asserted against all Tyrannical Usurpations, either
in RELIGION or STATE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to take my Text to pieces; By a
<hi>Free-born Subject,</hi> is meant a person
that is born under the Protection of the
<hi>Law;</hi> and thereby entitled to certain
known <hi>Immunities</hi> and <hi>Privileges,</hi> as
his <hi>Birthright.</hi> But then he is likewise
tied up; by the same Law, to certain
<hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
So that he seems to be <hi>Free</hi> in one respect; and
<hi>Subject</hi> in another. Now how far he is <hi>Enfranchised</hi> by
this <hi>Liberty,</hi> and how far <hi>Limited</hi> by that <hi>Subjection,</hi> will
be the Question.</p>
            <p>You shall seldom or never find this expression used, but
as a kind of <hi>Popular Challenge;</hi> and still in favour of the
<hi>Free-born,</hi> without any regard at all to the <hi>Subject.</hi>
Whereas we should as well consider the <hi>Authority</hi> of an
<hi>Imperial Prince</hi> on the one hand; as the <hi>Privileges</hi> of a
<hi>Free-born People</hi> on the other. And not so far mistake, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49922:3"/>
the <hi>Force</hi> or the <hi>Intent</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Right;</hi> (by which we claim to these Liberties)
as if by being discharged of our <hi>Vassalage,</hi> we were also
discharged of our <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Englishmans Birthright</hi> sounds much to the
same purpose too, with the <hi>Free-born Subject:</hi> Only there
lies a stronger <hi>Emphasis</hi> (in Common Speech) upon the
word <hi>Englishman.</hi> As when we speak of a Brave Man,
that stands up for the Honour and Defence of his Country;
such a one, we cry is a <hi>Right Englishman,</hi> a <hi>True English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end that we may not be misled by the
Sound and Jingle of Words; into a false, and dangerous
Notion of Things; let us repair to the <hi>Law,</hi> which is the
<hi>Known,</hi> and <hi>Common Standard</hi> of our <hi>Civil Actions:</hi> that
we may not either give up our Own just Rights on the
One hand, or Encroach upon his Majesties, on the Other.
For it is the Law that marques out the <hi>Metes</hi> and <hi>Bounds</hi>
both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> that shews how far we are to <hi>Go,</hi>
and where to <hi>Stop;</hi> and teaches us to distinguish betwixt
<hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Sedition;</hi> betwixt a <hi>True, Right Old English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and a <hi>shuffling, double-hearted Moderm Impostor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we have our <hi>Legal Rights,</hi> so we lie under <hi>Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions</hi>
too: And the King likewise hath his <hi>Legal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,</hi>
which are also accompanied with certain <hi>Legal
Limitations.</hi> From whence it appears, that the Law serves
as a <hi>Common-Rule</hi> and lies as a <hi>Common Obligation</hi> both
upon <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet though there be a <hi>Duty</hi> Incumbent on <hi>both sides,</hi>
there is a great difference even in point of <hi>Law it selfe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Kings Violation</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples.</hi>
The <hi>King</hi> breaks his <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> forfeit their <hi>Bond.</hi>
They are <hi>Both</hi> of them <hi>Bound</hi> alike in <hi>Conscience;</hi> but the
<hi>People</hi> are over and above engaged upon a <hi>Penalty.</hi> It makes
a huge noise in the World, that <hi>Kings are bound by the Laws
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49922:3"/>
as well as the People.</hi> And so they are, in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
but no further: And this arises from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Government it self: For wheresoever the <hi>Last Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi>
lies, there rests the <hi>Government.</hi> And there can be <hi>no
Government at all,</hi> without the Establishment of a <hi>Final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,</hi>
for otherwise the <hi>King</hi> shall <hi>Iudge</hi> the <hi>People</hi> and the
<hi>People Rejudge</hi> the <hi>King;</hi> and so the Controversie shall run
round World without end. Take notice now that <hi>all Appeals</hi>
move from a <hi>Lower Court,</hi> or <hi>Sentence,</hi> to a <hi>Superiour;</hi> and
consider then, how ridiculous it were to <hi>Appeal Downward;</hi>
or from <hi>Sovereign Princes,</hi> to any other Power, than to the
<hi>King of Kings,</hi> who alone is above them.</p>
            <p>But let us put the Case now, that a Prince mis-governs:
<hi>How shall he be tried?</hi> It must be either <hi>By</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
it. If the <hi>Former,</hi> where is the <hi>Law</hi> that says, <hi>The</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>may call their</hi> Soveraign <hi>to accompt, in case he does not
Govern according to</hi> Law? Or if they cannot produce such
a Law, the <hi>Assertion</hi> is <hi>Treasonous.</hi> If the <hi>Latter,</hi> we are at
our Old <hi>Salus Populi</hi> again: Which, in one word, is no
other then a direct Dissolution of the Law, and a Prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Authority to the Will of the Multitude.</p>
            <p>Having already stated the Conditions, and Advantages
of a <hi>Free-born Subject,</hi> and of our <hi>English Birthrights:</hi> we
shall now proceed to the asserting of these our Privileges,
against all <hi>Tyrannical Usurpations,</hi> either in matter of
<hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> And first a word of <hi>Tyrannical Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this Head may be comprised all sorts of <hi>Violence</hi>
and <hi>Oppression;</hi> (by what <hi>means,</hi> or <hi>Instruments</hi> soever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised)
contrary to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi> By <hi>Tyranny,</hi> we do
understand <hi>An Vnjust Domination;</hi> or <hi>an Abuse of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Power, to the injury of the People:</hi> as if a Prince should
turn a <hi>Legal Government</hi> into and <hi>Arbitrary.</hi> Now we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
reckon <hi>That</hi> for an <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> when <hi>One man takes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49922:4"/>
upon him the Right of another, without any Title to it at all:</hi>
As our late <hi>Oliver</hi> was called <hi>Vsurper.</hi> And there are also
<hi>Mixt Cases;</hi> (as was That before mentioned) where <hi>Tyranny</hi>
and <hi>Vsurpation</hi> meet <hi>Both</hi> in <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to This Division we may be <hi>oppressed three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways;</hi> either <hi>Immediately</hi> by the <hi>Prince</hi> himself; or
<hi>Mediately</hi> by his Ministers, as by special Direction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
Or otherwise we may be simply <hi>oppressed, one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
by <hi>another.</hi> But still these <hi>Oppressions</hi> are <hi>Illegal</hi> every
way; and the Question is Now, what <hi>Legal Relief</hi> in the
Case? For as the <hi>Law</hi> entitles us to the <hi>Privileges</hi> we claim,
and to the enjoyment of them: so does the <hi>Law</hi> likewise
appoint, and chalk us out the <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Asserting</hi> and
<hi>Maintaining</hi> our <hi>Rights,</hi> in case they be invaded. So that
we must onely Oppose <hi>Legal Remedies</hi> to <hi>Illegal Wrongs;</hi>
and not think to deliver our selves from one Violence by
another. For <hi>Popular Commotions</hi> are the most Criminal
and <hi>Dangerous</hi> of all sorts of <hi>Oppressions. Other Oppressions</hi>
may lie Heavy upon <hi>particular Persons;</hi> but <hi>This</hi> is an <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> it self. And it is as <hi>Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
as it is <hi>Impious;</hi> For while we Phansie all things to be
<hi>Lawful</hi> for us, because we suffer many things <hi>against Law,</hi>
we incur a <hi>Legal Forfeiture</hi> of all our <hi>Privileges,</hi> by the
<hi>unlawful manner</hi> of endeavouring to preserve them.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>Maxim</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> but not in <hi>Morals,</hi> that <hi>the King
can do no wrong;</hi> for he may shed Innocent Bloud with his
own hand, which is the <hi>Greatest</hi> of <hi>Wrongs;</hi> but it is not
looked upon however as a <hi>Wrong</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> because there is
no <hi>Law</hi> to question him for it. The Ordinary shift upon
this Point is, <hi>That the King may be sued, and that consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he stands answerable to the Law.</hi> To which I say, with
a Distinction, that the <hi>King</hi> hath a <hi>Twofold Right,</hi> a <hi>Right</hi>
of <hi>Dominion,</hi> and a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Propriety.</hi> In the <hi>Former</hi>
(which is the point in Question) there lies <hi>no Action</hi> of
<hi>Law:</hi> In the other there may, for otherwise he might take
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49922:4"/>
away any mans <hi>Free-hold</hi> at pleasure. And were it not a
wild thing to imagine otherwise, when according to the
very <hi>Stile</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> all <hi>Writs, Trials,</hi> and <hi>Forms of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
run in the <hi>Kings name?</hi> So that admitting their Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>the King sits Iudge upon himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the late Underminers of the Government found
that they could not shake the Royal Authority <hi>This way,</hi>
(for it was attempted) they had recourse afterward to the
Phansie of a <hi>Coordinate Government;</hi> making the <hi>King,
Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> to be <hi>the Three Estates;</hi> in stead of
the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal;</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in Parliament. Which mistake being swallowed
by the Undiscerning Multitude, proved the Foundation
of our Common Ruine. This Whimsie being now set
on foot again, I shall bestow a Word or two upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking
of that pernicious and sensless Pretence, and make
it appear, that the Position is Destructive, not onely of the
<hi>Three Estates,</hi> (as some account them) but of the very <hi>Being</hi>
of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supposing the Government to be <hi>Coordinate,</hi> (as these
People will have it) any <hi>Tw<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Parts</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> may <hi>Out</hi>
the <hi>Third.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> lies at the Mercy of the <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Commons;</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> at the Mercy of the <hi>King</hi> and the
<hi>Lords;</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> as much at the Mercy of the <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Commons.</hi> So that at this rate no body knows to day,
what Government we shall have to morrow. This is the
Just <hi>Ratio</hi> of a <hi>Coordinate State;</hi> and then to colour the
Invention, they tell us that the King is <hi>Singulis Major,
Vniversis Minor; Greater</hi> then the <hi>Diffusive Body of the
People,</hi> but <hi>Inferiour</hi> to the <hi>Collective.</hi> Which strikes at the
very Root of <hi>Parliaments;</hi> for if it be True, that a <hi>Prince</hi>
by calling of a <hi>Parliament dethrones himself;</hi> what Prince
would ever call a <hi>Parliament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is clear that <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> is <hi>Sacred,</hi> and not to
be Touched; it is no less Clear on the other side, that all

the <hi>Executors</hi> of <hi>Illegal Powers</hi> and <hi>Violences</hi> may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned;
for that the <hi>Law</hi> puts no difference betwixt <hi>one
Subject</hi> and <hi>another,</hi> but provides for <hi>Common Iustice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
man and man, without any difference of regard to
<hi>Dignities</hi> or <hi>Persons.</hi> And as it appoints us such a <hi>Relief</hi>
in such and such Cases; so does it likewise ordain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
such and such <hi>Punishments</hi> in other Cases, according as
the wisdom of the Law-makers hath found convenient.
So that he is upon his <hi>Good behaviour,</hi> either for <hi>Redress,</hi> or
<hi>Punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hear many people say, that 'tis True, <hi>the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
well enough for us; but what if Iustice be overaw'd and
obstructed?</hi> My answer is, that we are to help our selves
by <hi>Law,</hi> if we can; but if the <hi>Law</hi> will <hi>not</hi> relieve us, we
must be <hi>Patient;</hi> especially in a Case, where 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find a <hi>Remedy</hi> that is not worse then the <hi>Disease.</hi>
Let us but look a little into the Consequences of passing
That Line, and taking upon us to be our Own Carvers.
<hi>First;</hi> by Transgressing the <hi>Bounds</hi> of the Law, we cast
our selves out of the <hi>Protection</hi> of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Common Equity</hi> of it, we run into <hi>Partialities</hi> and
<hi>Factions,</hi> and every man makes himself both <hi>Iudge</hi> and
<hi>Party. Thirdly,</hi> from a <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> Provision for
the <hi>Stating</hi> and <hi>Determining</hi> of all <hi>Controversies;</hi> we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
our selves into an Absolute <hi>Impossibility</hi> of ever <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling</hi>
them, I might have said, of <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> them:
For <hi>Fourthly;</hi> from matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> we betake our selves
to Questions and <hi>Propositions</hi> of <hi>Notion;</hi> as <hi>the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Self-preservation,</hi> &amp;c. which signifie nothing more,
then to <hi>puzzle</hi> the <hi>Multitude,</hi> and <hi>confound</hi> the Order of
<hi>Civil Administration.</hi> For there can be no <hi>Proof</hi> made of
a <hi>Thought;</hi> but under Countenance of These <hi>Blinds,</hi> the
<hi>Ambitious,</hi> the <hi>Revengeful,</hi> the <hi>Necessitous,</hi> the <hi>Factious,</hi> the
<hi>Covetous,</hi> the <hi>Malicious,</hi> and the like, <hi>Stalk</hi> to their <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous</hi>
and <hi>Self-Ends.</hi> And what's the Issue of all This,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49922:5"/>
but that, when by <hi>Coveting more</hi> then did belong to us,
we have <hi>lost</hi> what we <hi>had:</hi> when by forsaking the <hi>Known,</hi>
and the <hi>Safe</hi> ways of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> we have <hi>wandered</hi>
out our Lives in <hi>Pathless, Dangerous,</hi> and <hi>Vncomfortable
Errors;</hi> without either <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Guide</hi> to set us right
again: When we have been led by a <hi>False Shew of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
as by an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> through <hi>Boggs</hi> and <hi>Ditches,</hi> and
all in pursuit of a <hi>Sluttish Vapour:</hi> When by breaking the
<hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> we have turned a <hi>Community</hi> into
a <hi>Desert;</hi> and like <hi>Wild Beasts,</hi> torn one another to pieces.
What is the <hi>fruit</hi> at last of all our <hi>Wild Adventures?</hi> but
<hi>Bondage, Beggery, Shame,</hi> and <hi>Late Repentance?</hi> So that
our <hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Surest Way</hi> will be, for every man to look to
his <hi>Own Province,</hi> without intermeddling in the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having sufficiently discoursed upon the <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Usurpations,</hi> we come now to <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>State,</hi> as the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> they are to <hi>work</hi> upon:
Wherein we shall Distinguish betwixt <hi>Tyranny,</hi> as an Act
of the <hi>Government;</hi> and <hi>Usurpation,</hi> as a Claim of the
<hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Possibility</hi> of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi>
in the matter of <hi>Religion;</hi> the Question falls into a
very narrow Compass: for <hi>Conscience</hi> lies out of the Reach
of <hi>Law;</hi> And the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are onely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
upon <hi>Ouvert,</hi> and <hi>Sensible Acts.</hi> But the point in
hand however is This: First, <hi>What is intended by the
<hi>Tyranny</hi> here spoken of?</hi> Secondly, <hi>How are we to behave
our selves, in Case of such <hi>Tyranny?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be <hi>Tyranny,</hi> either in <hi>forcing</hi> a man, (upon a
<hi>Penalty</hi>) to <hi>Renounce</hi> the <hi>Right Religion,</hi> or to <hi>Embrace a
False One:</hi> Or in <hi>Prohibiting</hi> to any man, the <hi>Freedom</hi> of
<hi>Worship after his Own way.</hi> And all these Cases vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>Conscience</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49922:6"/>
of the <hi>Governour.</hi> For <hi>the same thing</hi> may be <hi>Lawful</hi> in
<hi>One place,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> in <hi>Another;</hi> and to <hi>One Person</hi> too, and
not to <hi>Another:</hi> And it may be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less Excusable</hi> also,
according to <hi>These Circumstances.</hi> In short; It is a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi>
to press a man to a <hi>False Worship;</hi> A <hi>Tyranny</hi> to
<hi>punish</hi> him for <hi>adhering</hi> to a <hi>True one;</hi> A <hi>Tyranny</hi> to <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
any man from <hi>Worshipping</hi> God as he <hi>Ought:</hi> And the
<hi>Tyranny it self,</hi> is yet farther <hi>aggravated,</hi> if it be done in
<hi>Opposition</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> And to the <hi>Conscience</hi>
of the <hi>Ruler,</hi> as well as to <hi>Common Equity.</hi> But still when
I have lost <hi>Liberty, Estate,</hi> nay and <hi>Life it self,</hi> by <hi>reason</hi> of
<hi>Religion;</hi> my <hi>Religion it self</hi> is preserved <hi>Inviolate,</hi> even
when my <hi>Body</hi> lies in <hi>Ashes.</hi> The Prince that <hi>Acts</hi> all these
<hi>Tyrannies,</hi> hath undoubtedly a great deal to answer for to
<hi>Almighty God:</hi> But what <hi>Remedy</hi> is there for the <hi>Subject</hi>
that <hi>Suffers</hi> them? And let <hi>That</hi> be the <hi>next Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Case of such <hi>Persecutions</hi> as aforesaid, I know no more
then These <hi>Four ways</hi> of Application, for <hi>Relief;</hi> Either by
<hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Almighty God;</hi> By Recourse to the <hi>Law,</hi> for
<hi>Protection;</hi> By <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> for <hi>Indulgence,</hi>
and <hi>Compassion;</hi> Or else, to trie if we can deliver our selves
by <hi>Direct Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> is a sure <hi>Expedient</hi> in all Cases: for where
we are not <hi>Delivered</hi> from our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> Our <hi>Afflictions</hi>
are yet, by Gods Providence, turned into <hi>Comforts.</hi> In the
<hi>Second</hi> place, we may make the best of the <hi>Law,</hi> provided
that we do not make the <hi>Law Felo de se,</hi> and raise <hi>Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of <hi>Equitable Supposition,</hi> in <hi>Contradiction</hi> to the <hi>Naked</hi>
and <hi>Express Letter</hi> of it. As for Example; By the <hi>Law,</hi>
we have a <hi>Lawful Right</hi> to such and such <hi>Liberties;</hi> and
herein we have the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Friend.</hi> But if we make any
attempt to compass these <hi>Lawful Ends</hi> by <hi>Vnlawful Means,</hi>
the <hi>Law</hi> is point: blank <hi>against</hi> us.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Next</hi> Resort is, by <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>Government;</hi>
which is a Course, <hi>Laudable</hi> and <hi>Fair;</hi> provided we keep
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49922:6"/>
clear of <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Clamour;</hi> and address to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
not to the <hi>Multitude:</hi> For it is not the <hi>End</hi> of those
<hi>Popular Papers</hi> to <hi>Sollicite Relief,</hi> but to <hi>Provoke Tumults;</hi>
and under the Countenance of begging <hi>Compassion</hi> toward
the <hi>People,</hi> to stir up <hi>Sedition</hi> against the <hi>Government.</hi> For
<hi>Lewd</hi> Characters of Men breed <hi>Ill Thoughts</hi> of them; and
<hi>Evil Thoughts</hi> break out into <hi>Wicked Actions;</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
way in the World to a <hi>Rebellion is,</hi> to startle the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
with an Apprehension of <hi>Tyranny.</hi> If all this will not
do, there remains nothing more, but either <hi>Patience</hi> or
<hi>Force.</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> was of the <hi>Primitive,</hi> and the <hi>Later</hi>
hath been the practice of our <hi>Modern Christians;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do <hi>Well</hi> or <hi>Ill</hi> in it, shall be now examined.</p>
            <p>It hath done a great deal of Mischief in the World, the
Misconstruction of That <hi>Text</hi> that bids us <hi>Obey <hi>God</hi> rather
then man.</hi> For the People are not well aware, that, <hi>First,</hi>
in Obeying of <hi>Magistrates</hi> in all <hi>Warrantable Cases,</hi> they
Obey <hi>God</hi> also, in <hi>That Civil Obedience. Secondly,</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the <hi>Command</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Magistrate</hi> to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Opposite</hi> to the <hi>Express Will</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> I will not <hi>Obey</hi> him
in <hi>That Case,</hi> but I am not yet discharged of my <hi>Duty</hi> to
him in <hi>Other Cases:</hi> for he is never the less a <hi>Lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;</hi>
(even for not being a <hi>Christian</hi>) and I will not <hi>Resist</hi>
him in <hi>Any: Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>This Nation</hi> makes all
<hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Insurrections</hi> whatsoever, without <hi>Legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
to be <hi>Riotous, Seditious,</hi> or <hi>Treasonous Assemblies.
Fourthly,</hi> Allowing this <hi>Latitude</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> that they
may <hi>Confederate,</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi> for the <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> they
may as well rise for the <hi>Subversion</hi> of it: for we have but
their <hi>bare Words,</hi> either for the <hi>One,</hi> or for the <hi>Other.
Fifthly,</hi> It Authorizes every man to set up a <hi>Church</hi> by
himself, in his Own <hi>Phansie;</hi> and in stead of carrying his
<hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>Doctor</hi> for a Fit of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> he brings his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
forsooth, to the <hi>Government,</hi> to be cured of a <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
And this License, in one word, sets up the Crotchet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49922:7"/>
of every <hi>Sickly Brain,</hi> in Competition with <hi>Christianity</hi> i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
self, and the <hi>Politique Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if I should say now, that there was never any
War in the World undertaken purely upon the Accompt
of <hi>Religion,</hi> that was not utterly <hi>Vnlawful;</hi> unless in Cases
of <hi>Gods Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Peculiar Dispensations.</hi> For,
<hi>First,</hi> What are the <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>Necessary Effects</hi> of <hi>War,</hi>
but <hi>Bloud, Rapine, Oppression;</hi> the Multiplying of so many
<hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans; Depopulating</hi> of <hi>Countries,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;</hi>
and the <hi>Violation</hi> of all <hi>Rights, Sacred</hi> and <hi>Profane?</hi>
Are These now the Works of the <hi>Gospel?</hi> And what is <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
the better for all this? <hi>These</hi> are <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for <hi>Moloch;</hi>
and <hi>This</hi> is a <hi>Religion,</hi> and an <hi>Oblation,</hi> fitter for an <hi>Insensible</hi>
and <hi>Implacable Idol,</hi> then for the God of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us but consider now, what a Deluge of <hi>Impiety</hi>
flows in upon <hi>Humane Nature</hi> with <hi>This Opinion.</hi> The
<hi>Papist</hi> falls foul upon the <hi>Protestant;</hi> the <hi>Protestant</hi> upon
the <hi>Papist;</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> upon the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
upon the <hi>Christian:</hi> It sets <hi>all People,</hi> and <hi>all Parties</hi>
together by the Ears, onely for <hi>Diversity</hi> of Thoughts. It
makes <hi>Authority Ridiculous,</hi> it frustrates the very <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>Nations,</hi> and lays the World again in <hi>Common.</hi> Now if
This be so Pestilent a Doctrine, taken only at <hi>Large;</hi>
How much more Diabolical is it, for <hi>Subjects,</hi> upon This
<hi>Vngodly Pretext,</hi> to go about to <hi>Embroyl</hi> a <hi>Well Regulated
State;</hi> and to charge their Souls with <hi>Perjury, Schism,</hi> and
<hi>Rebellion,</hi> over and above the <hi>Common Crimes</hi> that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<hi>Hostile Invasions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Law</hi> hath been <hi>hitherto,</hi> so it must be <hi>hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of all our Proceedings. In the
Section of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> the Question was, <hi>How the</hi> Subject
<hi>should demean himself toward the Prince, in the Case of such
and such</hi> Oppressions <hi>in matter of Religion.</hi> But now, in
Case of an <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> the Question is, <hi>How far the</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>should comply with a</hi> Popular Importunity; <hi>or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49922:7"/>
how far the</hi> People <hi>should gratifie</hi> one another. Of which
we have spoken so much at large elsewhere, that the less
will serve in this place.</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> implies the <hi>Affecting</hi> or <hi>Invading</hi>
of <hi>Anothers Right;</hi> which, in the point of <hi>Religion,</hi> must
needs be very <hi>Dangerous;</hi> because the People are so easily
disposed to swallow <hi>That Deadly Pill.</hi> I do not reckon a
<hi>bare</hi> and <hi>simple Dissent</hi> from the <hi>Established Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church, to be an <hi>Vsurpation:</hi> For possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
there may be a <hi>Real Scruple,</hi> or want of <hi>due Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in the Case. But when That <hi>Dissent</hi> comes to be
<hi>Practical;</hi> when it comes to make <hi>Parties,</hi> to Divide
into <hi>Sects,</hi> to <hi>Plead</hi> and to <hi>Challenge</hi> the <hi>Law;</hi> it is no
longer a <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> but a direct <hi>Conspiracy</hi> against
the <hi>Government.</hi> It is a <hi>Nursery</hi> of <hi>Heresies,</hi> over and
above; And a <hi>Liberty,</hi> utterly Inconsistent with the
Measures of <hi>Political Iustice</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> For <hi>First,</hi>
They Agree among themselves in the single point onely of
<hi>Departing</hi> from <hi>Vs;</hi> And they are not, in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> more
dissatisfied with our <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> then
they are <hi>severally,</hi> among themselves, <hi>one Sect</hi> with <hi>another:</hi>
So that it is, in this respect, impossible to please them.
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is no less <hi>dangerous</hi> to offer at it, in <hi>other
Considerations.</hi> For <hi>First,</hi> upon the Current of <hi>Long</hi> and
<hi>Constant Experience,</hi> they have been always found <hi>Insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
Never esteeming what they <hi>had,</hi> to be <hi>Enough,</hi> till
they had gotten <hi>All.</hi> The late King gave them still more
and more; and the more he <hi>Gave,</hi> the more they <hi>Craved;</hi>
and turned his <hi>Bounty,</hi> at last, to his <hi>Destruction.</hi> He did
effectually, in favour of their Importunities, Strip himself,
to his <hi>Revenue,</hi> his <hi>Crown,</hi> and his <hi>Life;</hi> and <hi>all <hi>That,</hi>
               </hi>
They <hi>took.</hi> Another danger is, that <hi>the very men that ask
a Toleration, are Principled against it. And I see not the least
shadow of a Reason, why they that will not Tolerate Others,
should be Tolerated Themselves.</hi> And truly as little Ground
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49922:8"/>
for the <hi>Asking</hi> of it, as for the <hi>Granting</hi> of it. For <hi>First,</hi>
Why should the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>broken,</hi> and the
<hi>Peace</hi> of it <hi>disturbed,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Enemies</hi> of it; and
to the <hi>Discouragement</hi> of the <hi>Churches Friends? Secondly,</hi>
As the Act of <hi>Vniformity</hi> hath the Full and Solemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of a <hi>Binding Law;</hi> why may they not as well
demand a <hi>Dispensation</hi> for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as for <hi>Schism?</hi> And
quarrel <hi>any other Law,</hi> nay, one after another, the <hi>whole
Body of the Law,</hi> as well as <hi>That?</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Rule</hi> of our <hi>Actions;</hi> and they will have every <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Phansie</hi> to be a <hi>Rule</hi> to the <hi>Law.</hi> They themselves
<hi>fly</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> and their Complaint is, that the <hi>Law</hi>
doth not <hi>follow</hi> them. This Method frustrates the very
<hi>Order of Providence,</hi> and makes all Provisions of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to be <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Vseless.</hi> They cannot pretend to
Charge this <hi>Law</hi> with any <hi>Defect,</hi> in regard either of the
<hi>Civil,</hi> or the <hi>Ecclesiastical Authority</hi> of it. Here is, <hi>First,
The Iudgment of the Church duly Conven'd, touching the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Convenience of the Rites and Forms therein Contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>There is the Royal Sanction, Approving,
and Authorizing those Rites and Forms; and requiring our
Exact Obedience to them.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The Matter of the Law
here in question, is our Own Act;</hi> for that we <hi>our selves</hi> are
Concluded in the Vote of our <hi>Representatives.</hi> Against
These <hi>Vsurpations</hi> we have <hi>Law</hi> enough: And so we have
likewise against those that follow in Matter of <hi>State:</hi>
which may be reduced to <hi>Vsurpations</hi> upon us, in Matter
of <hi>Life, Liberty,</hi> or <hi>Estate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an <hi>Vsurpation</hi> upon the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> and there
is an <hi>Vsurpation</hi> upon the <hi>Subject:</hi> Upon the <hi>Former</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
either of <hi>Title,</hi> or of <hi>Power;</hi> both which Cases are
<hi>Determinable,</hi> and <hi>Relievable</hi> by the <hi>Law:</hi> And so also is
any Oppression upon the <hi>Subject:</hi> That is to say, where
One Subject oppresses Another. When I say <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>Relievable</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> my meaning is, that the <hi>Law</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49922:8"/>
hath competently provided for the <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Security</hi>
both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> And the <hi>Remedy</hi> seldom fails,
where it is <hi>Seasonably applied,</hi> and <hi>Vigorously pursued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Dignity of Government may be vilified
<hi>Gratis,</hi> the <hi>Kings Ministers</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> bespattered with
<hi>Billingsgate Libels,</hi> and his <hi>professed Enemies supported</hi> and
<hi>encouraged:</hi> when his Majesties <hi>Title</hi> as well as his <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
and <hi>Reputation,</hi> shall come to be the subject of every
<hi>Bawling Pamphlet;</hi> and the <hi>Bounds of Sovereign Power to be
debated by Porters and Carmen, over Pots of Ale:</hi> when not
onely the <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Lawful Ministers,</hi> and the <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Order</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> shall be <hi>Derided</hi> and <hi>Despised;</hi> but
<hi>Religion it self</hi> pass onely for a <hi>Sham,</hi> a piece of <hi>Priest-Craft,</hi>
and be published in Print, for no more in effect then a
<hi>Political Art of getting a Hank upon the People:</hi> when such
Outrages, I say, as These come to be daily committed over
and over, in the very face of the Sun, and the <hi>Laws</hi> suffered
to <hi>Sleep,</hi> that should <hi>repress,</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> them: what can be
the Event of This <hi>Inhumane License,</hi> but <hi>Confusion,</hi> and
<hi>Ruine?</hi> And if it comes to That once, it was our Own
fault, for not putting a <hi>Timely</hi> and a <hi>Legal Stop</hi> to These
<hi>Audacious Vsurpations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Positions</hi> and the <hi>Methods</hi> that brought on our late
Troubles, are now Revived and Practised every day afresh:
We have our <hi>Quaeries,</hi> our <hi>Remonstrances,</hi> and all things, to
the Old Tune of <hi>Curse ye Meroz,</hi> and <hi>To your Tents, O Israel:</hi>
most munifestly tending to the Unhinging of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and as certainly designing the <hi>Subversion</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> and of the <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>Boldness</hi> and the <hi>Impunity</hi> of
these Libels, would be an Equal Wonder to me, if I were
not satisfied, that the <hi>One</hi> is clearly the <hi>Effect</hi> of the <hi>Other:</hi>
For their escaping punishment, looks as if the <hi>Government</hi>
were <hi>afraid</hi> of the <hi>Rabble;</hi> and then their passing without
<hi>Answer,</hi> gives a kind of Credit to their Doctrine.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49922:9"/>
It is not a Work for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to Rake a <hi>Dunghil,</hi> and
to gather up the <hi>Peoples Vomit:</hi> But yet out of a Foolish
<hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Tenderness</hi> for a <hi>Duty</hi> that hath onely given me
<hi>Misery</hi> in <hi>This World,</hi> and the <hi>hope of Comfort</hi> in a <hi>Better;</hi>
I cannot but endeavour to possess others with the same
sense of these Indignities which I have my self; and to
lay open this Spirit of <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Slander: These Vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
of their Fathers Nakedness, and Defilers of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Common Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Onely Encouragement to This Undertaking, is the
Title I have to be believed in it. For I am so far from
being <hi>Bribed</hi> into this Office, either by the <hi>Tie of Past Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,</hi>
or by the <hi>Prospect of Benefits to come,</hi> That (with
Infinite Acknowledgments of his Majesties Grace and
Goodness to me) I defie any man to produce another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in the Kings Dominions, under my Circumstances,
that hath suffered so many <hi>Illegal, Arbitrary,</hi> and <hi>Mean
Injustices,</hi> from any of <hi>the Abusers of the Kings Bounty,</hi> as I
have done. Insomuch that after a Sentence of <hi>Death,</hi> for his
Majesty; betwixt <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>Four Years</hi> in <hi>Newgate;</hi> and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Seven and Thirty Years faithful Service to the Crown;</hi>
the Bread hath been taken out of my Mouth, and in a large
proportion, shared amongst some of those very People
that pursued the late King to the Block: Nor do I look
for any more Advantage for the Future. This <hi>Reflection</hi>
(by the way) <hi>doth not concern any man that is now in Office
at Court;</hi> and I hope there is enough said already, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
me of any likelihood to be Partial in This matter.
I must not slip This Occasion of bringing in a Case of late
date; a Case wherein all men of <hi>Letters</hi> are concerned,
and not impertinent in This place, and That being done,
I will proceed.</p>
            <p>Being desirous to Inform my self very particularly concerning this late
Devillish <hi>Plot,</hi> I got the best Intelligence I could, as well by <hi>Short Notes</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49922:9"/>
upon the <hi>Trials in Court,</hi> as by <hi>word of Mouth</hi> from Credible persons that
were there present. After this, upon perusal of the <hi>Printed Trials,</hi> I found
several <hi>Gross Incoherences;</hi> (especially in the Later of them) and very <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Mistakes.</hi> As in that of Mr. <hi>Langhorn, Fol.</hi> 39, and 40. Mr. <hi>Lyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
name</hi> is used no less then <hi>Nine times,</hi> as one of the <hi>St. Omers Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
in stead of Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> to his very great prejudice.</p>
            <p>Reflecting upon <hi>These Errors,</hi> together with the almost <hi>Inextricable Dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulty</hi>
of Retriving the <hi>Truth,</hi> out of such a <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Tautologies,</hi> and
<hi>Forms;</hi> the <hi>Collection</hi> being so <hi>Bulky</hi> too, and the <hi>Particulars</hi> lying so
<hi>scattered,</hi> that it was next to the Work of a Resurrection to set every part in
its right place. I betook my self to my Friends, my Thoughts, and my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and digested the whole Transaction into an <hi>Historical Narrative.</hi> And
not in <hi>Dialogue</hi> neither; nor in the words, either of the <hi>Bench,</hi> the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
or the <hi>Prisoners;</hi> but in <hi>my Own stile</hi> and <hi>Way,</hi> and just in the
same Fashion as I would tell the Story. This Book I entitled, <hi>The History
of the Plot, &amp;c.</hi> made a <hi>Legal Assignment</hi> of my <hi>Right</hi> to a <hi>Bookseller.</hi>
I <hi>Authorised</hi> him to <hi>Print</hi> it, and he <hi>Imprinted</hi> it by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the
<hi>Author:</hi> Some of the <hi>Pretenders</hi> to the Formal <hi>Trials, Arrest</hi> my <hi>Booksel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
as an <hi>Invader of their Propriety,</hi> and Threaten him most wonderfully
into the Bargain. He puts in <hi>Bail</hi> to the <hi>Action,</hi> and there the Squabble
rests. They do not complain of any <hi>Imitation</hi> of <hi>their Copy,</hi> but take upon
them, as if no man else were to write upon <hi>That Subject.</hi> At this rate, we
shall have all <hi>Sermons</hi> forfeited to the <hi>Kings Printers,</hi> for Descanting upon
<hi>Their Bibles;</hi> and <hi>all Books whatsoever,</hi> to the <hi>Company of Stationers,</hi>
because they are made out of the <hi>Four and Twenty Letters;</hi> and the <hi>ABC</hi>
is <hi>Their Copy.</hi> What a <hi>Scandal</hi> is this to the <hi>Commonwealth of Letters?</hi>
What a <hi>Cramp</hi> to <hi>Learning,</hi> and Industry? That if I have a mind to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile
a <hi>History, I must go to Forty little Fellows for leave, forsooth, to
Write the Narrative of the Proceedings upon our Blessed King and
Martyr, the Brave Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury; <hi>with a
hundred more Instances of the like nature, because some or other</hi> of
them has lurched, perhaps, a <hi>Copy</hi> of <hi>Their Trials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if a man should write the Battle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and the Kings
miraculous Escape, after the Defeat; must he not mention the <hi>Thousand
Pound</hi> that was set upon his Majesties Head, without leave of the
<hi>Printer</hi> that had the <hi>Propriety</hi> of the <hi>Proclamation</hi> that offered it?
Or if a Body would draw up a <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Sedition;</hi> must he
go to the <hi>Publisher</hi> of <hi>Bacons Government,</hi> for a <hi>License?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am the <hi>larger,</hi> because it is a <hi>Publick Case.</hi> And take notice, <hi>First,</hi>
that the <hi>whole Story</hi> is drawn into less than a <hi>Sixth</hi> part of <hi>Their Volume.
Secondly,</hi> That there is not so much as <hi>One Material Clause omitted</hi> in it.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49922:10"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is incomparably <hi>Plainer,</hi> and more <hi>Intelligible</hi> then the
other; beside the many <hi>Corrections</hi> in it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it is <hi>Eleven
Shillings saved;</hi> Theirs being rated at <hi>Thirteen and Six pence,</hi> at the Lowest
Penny, and This onely at <hi>Half a Crown.</hi> And so much for this.</p>
            <p>I come now to an Examination of <hi>Two Libels;</hi> the most
<hi>Audacious</hi> and <hi>Virulent</hi> that have yet passed the Press.
The <hi>One</hi> of them Entitled <hi>Omnia Comesta à Bello;</hi> Or, <hi>Bel
hath devoured all.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is called, <hi>My Lord Lucas's
Speech.</hi> But take notice that my Exception lies to the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi>
or <hi>Appendix;</hi> not concerning my self at all with
the <hi>Speech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Former</hi> of these Papers is an Allusion to the Story
of <hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dragon:</hi> where the <hi>Priests</hi> and their <hi>Wives</hi>
came in at a <hi>Back-dore,</hi> and consume what was offered to
the <hi>Idol.</hi> It is Printed <hi>BELLO</hi> in stead of <hi>BELO;</hi>
and the <hi>Mistake</hi> is a great deal Righter then the <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
For it was, in Truth, the <hi>WAR</hi> that <hi>Devoured all;</hi>
and the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi> (which was the Foundation of <hi>That
War</hi>) was, in effect, no better than a <hi>CHRISTIAN
IDOL.</hi> It comes forth, as an <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>First</hi> of
<hi>Five Pretended Questions;</hi> which he sets down at Length:
and we will speak of them in Order, as far as shall be
needful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quaery</hi> 1. Whether the Great Cause of Impoverishing the
<hi>Nation,</hi> Ruine of Trade, and General Consumption of Comfort,
Settlement, and Content, which hath brought the Land to a
meer <hi>Anatomy,</hi> be not the Pomp, Pride, Luxury, Exaction,
and Oppression of the Prelates? Pag. 3. <hi>He</hi> Concludes <hi>in the</hi>
Affirmative. <hi>And</hi> Pag. 4. The Trading Stock of the Nation
<hi>(he says)</hi> is devoured in this Prelatical Gulph.</p>
            <p>But are we so <hi>Miserable</hi> then? And is the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> the
Cause of all our <hi>Miseries?</hi> Let us compare the <hi>Times</hi>
a little, when we <hi>had Bishops,</hi> and when we <hi>had None:</hi>
For there is no Trial of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of Things,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49922:10"/>
like <hi>Experience.</hi> From 1558. (when <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> came to
the <hi>Crown</hi>) to 1641. we had a <hi>Continued Succession</hi> of a
<hi>Protestant</hi> (or rather, a <hi>Reformed) Prelacy.</hi> And so from
1660. to this present 1679. which is upward of <hi>a hundred
Years.</hi> And all this while the <hi>Government</hi> stood <hi>firm</hi> upon
its <hi>Ancient Basis.</hi> The <hi>Gospel flourished,</hi> and the <hi>Subject</hi>
enjoyed their <hi>Legal Liberties,</hi> under a <hi>Legal Administration,</hi>
both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> From 1641, to 1660. <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
was <hi>Out of Dores.</hi> Do but observe, now, what Havock
was made in the <hi>State,</hi> both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil;</hi> in matter
of our <hi>Religion, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> in That <hi>Interval,</hi>
of onely <hi>Nineteen Years:</hi> when <hi>an Ordinance</hi> was of more
force then <hi>an Act of Parliament:</hi> And our <hi>Lives, Freedoms,</hi>
and <hi>Estates,</hi> lay at the Mercy of the <hi>Tyrants of Athens,</hi> in a
<hi>Derby-house Committee.</hi> But let us yet come closer to the
Business.</p>
            <p>I would fain know what these men would be <hi>at,</hi> that are
so desperately unsatisfied with the Condition they are in.
Would they be in the days of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> again; or
of <hi>King Iames;</hi> or of the <hi>Late King?</hi> If nothing of This
will content them; there is no other choice left, but That
of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> For whosoever Traces the <hi>History</hi> of these
<hi>Male-contents,</hi> will find <hi>Deadness of Trade</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi>
to have been their <hi>Constant Complaint,</hi> from the <hi>Reformation
it self,</hi> to <hi>this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the Passing of a</hi> General Sentence <hi>upon the</hi> Bishops,
<hi>as the</hi> Authors <hi>of all our</hi> Calamities, <hi>he takes the</hi> whole <hi>to</hi>
pieces. <hi>Treating</hi> First, <hi>of the</hi> Revenues, Pomp, <hi>and</hi> State,
<hi>of</hi> Prelates. <hi>And there he tells us of</hi> Two Provincial Arch-bishops,
<hi>with their</hi> Princely Retinue, Domestique Chaplains,
Officers of Temporal Tithes, Spiritual Officers, Vicar General,
Guardian of the Spiritualities, Dean of the Arches, with all
their Vnder-Officers and Attendants.</p>
            <p>To be as brief as possible: <hi>First,</hi> Where is the <hi>Crime,</hi>
or the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of all This <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>State?</hi> Or why should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49922:11"/>
not an <hi>Ecclesiastical Body</hi> have its <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
as well as a <hi>Civil Community?</hi> There is no body envies
my <hi>Lord Maior</hi> his <hi>Sword-bearer,</hi> his <hi>Mace-bearer,</hi> or any
other <hi>Servant,</hi> or <hi>Ensign</hi> of his <hi>Preeminence</hi> and <hi>Office.</hi> For
beside that the very <hi>Splendor</hi> and <hi>Magnificence, creates</hi> and
<hi>preserves</hi> a <hi>Reverence</hi> for <hi>Authority.</hi> This <hi>Multiplicity</hi> and
<hi>Subordination of Officers,</hi> is of <hi>absolute Necessity</hi> also; as
<hi>subservient</hi> to <hi>Order,</hi> and to the very <hi>Discharge</hi> of his <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
The <hi>Second Question</hi> is, <hi>Are these Officers established
by</hi> Law, <hi>or not?</hi> If by <hi>Law; This clamour is an Arraignment
of King, Lords, and Commons. Thirdly,</hi> It is not onely a
<hi>Legal Establishment,</hi> but an <hi>Establishment</hi> of <hi>many Ages,</hi> and
<hi>continued</hi> without <hi>Interruption,</hi> till both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
fell together. And then, in Lieu of <hi>Bishops</hi> we had a
<hi>Motly Synod</hi> of <hi>State-Pensioners; Hirelings,</hi> to poison the
<hi>Pulpits</hi> and the <hi>People;</hi> and to <hi>decoy</hi> the silly <hi>Multitude</hi>
out of their <hi>Lives, Fortunes, Liberties, Duties,</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions:</hi>
Men kept in <hi>Pay,</hi> to preach <hi>Thanksgiving Sermons,</hi>
and to help out at a Dead Lift, towards the bringing of
their <hi>Soveraign</hi> to the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> When they had <hi>preached</hi>
and <hi>prayed</hi> the Kingdom into <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Disobedience;</hi> and
held the Rabble several Years <hi>agog,</hi> and gaping after the
Blessed <hi>Reformation</hi> so graciously promised them: Out
comes at last the <hi>False Conception</hi> of their <hi>Directory.</hi> (A kind
of <hi>Spiritual Moon-Calf.</hi>) But by this time, the King was
as good as Lost; and so they fell presently to sharing of
the <hi>Publique Revenues</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> They <hi>Dispatch</hi>
their <hi>Prince, Enslave</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> and there is an end of <hi>That
Reformation:</hi> And it is the very Fellow of it, that they
would have again. Was it not a <hi>Blessed Exchange</hi> now, to
be freed from the <hi>Prelatical Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>their Retinue,</hi> and
to have such <hi>Gospel-Ministers? Generals, Majors, and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Generals, Plunderers, Sequestrators, Decimators, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides,</hi>
and <hi>Sacrilegious Vsurpers</hi> set up in their stead? This
<hi>Cuckoo-Song</hi> of <hi>Forty One, Forty One, Forty One,</hi> over and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49922:11"/>
over; were <hi>Ill-natured</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> if the other <hi>Cuckoo-Song
of Popery and Tyranny, Popery and Tyranny,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the <hi>Former Principlies,</hi> over and over, had
not made it <hi>absolutely Necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next Grievance is, <hi>The Ecclesiastical Courts: Court of
Faculties, Court of Audience, Prerogative Court, Delegates,
24 Bishops Diocesan, with their Trains, Domestick Servants,
Chaplains, Officers, and Courts; Chancellors, Registers, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
Proctors, Archdeacons, Commissaries, Officials, Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates;</hi>
Their Lordly <hi>Palaces, Ecclesiastical Dignities, Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
&amp;c.</hi> viis &amp; modis <hi>amounting to at least Four Hundred
and Fifty Thousand Pounds a Year: Enriching themselves</hi>
(also) <hi>by Ordinations, Institution, and Induction; by making
Rural Deans, Licenses to Curates, School-masters, Parish-Clerks,
Physicians, Midwives, Marriages, by Absolutions, by
Commutation of Penance, Probates of Wills, Letters of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
Presentment, &amp;c. Pag.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
            <p>There is enough said already to their <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;</hi>
and so for their <hi>Courts, Fees,</hi> and <hi>Privileges:</hi> They
are all of them of <hi>Ancient Right and Custom.</hi> If they envy
the <hi>Bishops</hi> their <hi>Revenue,</hi> the Common People may as well
set up a <hi>Levelling Trade</hi> again; and fall upon <hi>All Estates</hi>
and <hi>Conditions of men</hi> that are better to live then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Why should such a Lord, Gentleman, Merchant, &amp;c.
have so many Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year amongst them;</hi>
and the <hi>Poor</hi> ready to <hi>sterve?</hi> Is not <hi>Money</hi> drawn into a
<hi>few hands here,</hi> as well as <hi>there;</hi> and <hi>Their abundance,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
the Cause of Our <hi>Want?</hi> Nay, the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
reaches the <hi>King,</hi> as well as the <hi>Church.</hi> So that <hi>Gods
Providence</hi> to <hi>Some,</hi> must be rendred and <hi>Injustice</hi> to <hi>Others.</hi>
One would think by the <hi>Out-Cry</hi> that all This went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
out of the <hi>Peoples Pockets:</hi> whereas the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Setled</hi> and <hi>Confirmed</hi> by the <hi>Great
Charter,</hi> of the <hi>English Liberties;</hi> as <hi>firmly</hi> as any <hi>Freehold</hi>
we have. There hath been always This <hi>Clamour</hi> against
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49922:12"/>
their <hi>Courts;</hi> But how was it with us, when they were
put down? We had our <hi>Triers</hi> (in good time) Our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi>
for <hi>Sequestration, Decimation; Money</hi> upon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi>
the <hi>Sale</hi> of <hi>Irish Lands;</hi> Our <hi>Loans</hi> for our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
the <hi>Scots;</hi> Our <hi>Committees</hi> for <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Church
Lands:</hi> and a hundred other Inventions for the <hi>Beggering</hi>
and <hi>Enslaving</hi> of us, <hi>contrary to Law;</hi> by way of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
for the <hi>Iurisdiction of These Courts, according to Law.</hi>
In stead of <hi>Licenses</hi> to <hi>Preach,</hi> or <hi>Teach School,</hi> we had <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrations</hi>
and <hi>Imprisonments</hi> for <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Teaching;</hi>
unless upon the Conditions of <hi>Renouncing</hi> both the <hi>King,</hi>
and the <hi>Church.</hi> In stead of <hi>Demanding Lawful Oaths,</hi>
we were upon pain of <hi>Plunder, Confiscation,</hi> and <hi>Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
pressed</hi> to <hi>Vnlawful Ones;</hi> as <hi>Covenants, Negative Oaths,
Oaths of Abjuration;</hi> and not onely so, but in direct <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
to the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Canonical Obedience;</hi>
to Double-hatch the <hi>Perjury,</hi> in Defiance of both our <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit</hi>
and <hi>Explicit Obligations.</hi> Here is the short of that
Exchange.</p>
            <p>Upon his Computation of the <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Dependences</hi> of
the <hi>Ecclesiastical State,</hi> he reckons some <hi>Ten Thousand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
one way or other, belonging to the <hi>Church:</hi> And at
least 450000 <hi>l. per ann. First,</hi> In place of the <hi>Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Persons</hi> he speaks of, (who in another place (he sayes)
bring nothing to the Stock) what do ye think of an <hi>Army</hi>
of 40000 <hi>men,</hi> wholly <hi>exempt</hi> from the <hi>Civil Iurisdiction;</hi>
and onely Triable by <hi>Martial Law? Hist. Indepency, Pag.</hi>
68. <hi>Part.</hi> 1. Or in stead of the <hi>Churches spending four or five
hundred Thousand Pound a Year,</hi> of their <hi>Own;</hi> what do ye
think of the <hi>Vsurpers spending above Forty Millions, in less
then seven Years,</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms money. Hist. Indep. Pag.</hi> 8.
But of this hereafter. We had Then no longer the <hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore</hi>
before us, of the <hi>Prelats Lordly Palaces;</hi> The <hi>Kings
Palaces</hi> were likewise <hi>seized</hi> by the <hi>same hands:</hi> Our <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
turned into <hi>Stables;</hi> Our very <hi>Alters Robbed</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49922:12"/>
And, to go <hi>thorough stitch,</hi> He whips up the <hi>Clergy</hi>
for their <hi>Visitations,</hi> their <hi>Paschal Rents</hi> and <hi>Procurations;</hi>
Nay, their <hi>Canons, Vicars, Petty-Canons, Singing-men</hi> and
<hi>Boys, Choristers, Organists, Gospellers, Epistlers,</hi> and <hi>Virgers</hi>
too: And all this, as idly, as if he talked in his sleep.</p>
            <p>Here he takes Breath, and at the Bottom of the 5. <hi>Page,</hi>
promises a <hi>Catalogue of more Families Ruined, more Persons
Imprisoned,</hi> and an accompt of <hi>more Money spent,</hi> by the
<hi>Cruelty</hi> of the <hi>Prelats,</hi> then by <hi>all the Law-suits of England,</hi>
all <hi>Payments</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> beside: <hi>Except upon the late <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Occasion.</hi>
               </hi> This Libel was Printed, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
before the <hi>Great Plague<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and now of <hi>late Reprinted</hi>
over and over, and dated 1679. So that <hi>His late <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Occasion,</hi>
               </hi> is onely a Civiller way of Expressing
<hi>Our late <hi>Extraordinary Rebellion.</hi>
               </hi> Something shall be
said to This By and By.</p>
            <p>His 6. <hi>Page,</hi> and a good part of the 7. are a <hi>Rhapsody of
Grievances.</hi> Upon the <hi>Kings Restauration,</hi> and <hi>Purchasers
of Church Lands</hi> were forced to <hi>Restore</hi> them, without any
<hi>Compensation.</hi> He makes it to be a <hi>hard Case,</hi> the <hi>Restoring</hi>
of them to the <hi>Right Owner,</hi> but says nothing of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Taking them from him.</hi> He tells us that <hi>the Rusty
Ecclesiastiques, that neither serve our</hi> Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>nor
their</hi> Country, <hi>but their</hi> Own Bellies, (this is the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he bestows upon them) <hi>hord up the Mony that they have
extorted from the Subject by</hi> Fines, <hi>and have brought the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a Consumption.</hi> I wonder how <hi>Church-Leases,</hi> that
are commonly the <hi>best Penniworths</hi> should be a <hi>Greater Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>
to the Nation, then <hi>Others</hi> that are set at <hi>higher
Rates,</hi> which we hear no Complaint of at all. And I do not
see how it consists with his charge of <hi>Luxury</hi> upon the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,</hi>
that upon so great Expence, there should be no <hi>Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of the <hi>Treasure.</hi> I could tell him of the <hi>Turkish Slaves
Redeemed;</hi> Their Bounties to <hi>Ministers Widows;</hi> Their
<hi>Publique Works,</hi> as The <hi>Oxford Theatre,</hi> the Reparation of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49922:13"/>
               <hi>Litchfield Cathedral,</hi> and the Re-edifying of such of their
Palaces, as the Iniquity of the late Times had demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
&amp;c. To say nothing of the <hi>Common Right</hi> they have
to dispose of their <hi>Own:</hi> or to the <hi>Secret Charities</hi> of many
of our <hi>Eminent Churchmen,</hi> who have too much <hi>Honour</hi> and
<hi>Piety,</hi> to make Proclamation of it in the <hi>Market Place.</hi> But
now comes a Lamentable Story.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have all our Able, Godly, Orthodox Ministers turned
out, Ruined, and Beggered, and no manner of Supply provided
for the Maintainance of them and their Families: And in
Their Rooms (in many Places) a Company of Debauched, Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
Superstitious, Profane Priests; which Blind Guides
must needs lead them that follow them to Hell.</hi> Pag. 6.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader observe the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> and <hi>Vnmannerly
Opposition</hi> betwixt <hi>his Ejected Ministers,</hi> and those that were
<hi>Introduced;</hi> and then let him consider the <hi>Right,</hi> and the
<hi>Condition,</hi> both of the <hi>One</hi> and of the <hi>Other. This</hi> was the
very <hi>Character</hi> the <hi>Schismatiques</hi> gave our <hi>Learned, Pious,</hi>
and <hi>Canonical Divines,</hi> when they turned them out of their
Livings by <hi>Hundreds,</hi> contrary to <hi>Law, Honesty,</hi> and <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self;</hi> and the same <hi>Character</hi> with the <hi>Other,</hi> did
<hi>They</hi> take upon <hi>Themselves,</hi> that <hi>turned them out:</hi> The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
Legally Invested</hi> in the <hi>Benefice;</hi> and the <hi>Other,</hi> an
<hi>Oppressing</hi> and <hi>Injurious Vsurper.</hi> And what came of it?
The <hi>Shepherds</hi> were <hi>destroyed,</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> set to look to the
<hi>Flock:</hi> The <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> of <hi>Evangelical Truth</hi> was
<hi>lost</hi> and <hi>confounded,</hi> in a <hi>Compound of Carnal Policy</hi> and
<hi>Schism.</hi> We had as many <hi>Religions</hi> as <hi>Pulpits;</hi> and the
<hi>Doctrine of Rebellion</hi> Delivered in them, in stead of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>Damning all the Churchwardens for Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Gospel, if they Present according to their</hi> Oaths;
<hi>and for</hi> Perjury, <hi>if they do not. If a Minister Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his</hi> Canonical Garment: <hi>If any man goes from his Own
Parish Church to hear a Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or work upon a</hi> Romish
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49922:13"/>
Holyday; <hi>If he does not</hi> stand up <hi>at the</hi> Creed; <hi>nor</hi> Bow
<hi>at the Name of</hi> Jesus; <hi>Or does not keep off his Hat all the
while, he is</hi> Presentable.</p>
            <p>Well, and what of all this? There is neither <hi>Life</hi> nor
<hi>Limb,</hi> in the Case, if a man be <hi>Presented.</hi> Here is for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
sake, an <hi>Order;</hi> and <hi>That Order</hi> is supported by
<hi>Authority;</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> in <hi>Lawful Matters,</hi> deriving from
a <hi>Lawful Authority,</hi> is an <hi>Essential Duty</hi> both of a <hi>Subject,</hi>
and a <hi>Christian.</hi> He seems onely to have Talked Idle all
this while; but now he grows directly Outragious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have gotten</hi> (saith he) <hi>most of the sober Trading part
of the Nation discouraged by Citations, Excommunications,
Writs to take them Excommunicated; Imprisonments upon
Ecclesiastical Accompts; By this means Thousands of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are already ruined, and many Hundreds are ready to leave
the Land, and remove into some other Country, where they may
have Liberty of Conscience, and Freedom from these devouring
Harpies.</hi> And then he tell us <hi>of our Surplices, Copes, Tippets,
Cringings, out of the</hi> Romish Rituals, <hi>and a</hi> Service <hi>collected
out of the</hi> Romish Books, <hi>the Maess Breviary, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was not This the very Stile of the <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi>
to <hi>Q. Elizabeth?</hi> and so down to this Instant. <hi>Pray
what did we get by it; when to be cased of This insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Tyranny,</hi> the Nation was at the charge of 114000 <hi>l. a
Moneth to an Army? Hist. Indep. 66. Above One half of the
Revenue of the Kingdom under Sequestration: 300000 l. a
Year openly divided by the Faction among Themselves;</hi> beside
<hi>Private Iobs,</hi> and <hi>above 20 Millions</hi> that they never <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted</hi>
for. 110000 <hi>l. a Year</hi> in <hi>Wages</hi> to <hi>Themselves; 100000 l.
a Year</hi> more in <hi>Gratuities.</hi> Beside <hi>Free Quarter</hi> at pleasure:
<hi>Taxes Innumerable;</hi> and all <hi>Vnder-hand Corruptions.</hi> Above
<hi>a Million and a half</hi> levied by <hi>Compositions;</hi> and then so
<hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>despicable Slaves,</hi> in our <hi>Persons,</hi> that <hi>Welsh Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners</hi>
were sold into <hi>Plantations</hi> at 2 <hi>pence a head.</hi> For
the Truth of all This, I refer my self to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49922:14"/>
of Independency;</hi> a <hi>Knowing</hi> and a <hi>Well-read Person</hi>
in the whole <hi>Transaction,</hi> and a man of <hi>Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Pamphletters <hi>Liberty of Conscience:</hi> He would
have the World believe this <hi>Vniformity</hi> and <hi>Rule of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
to be <hi>New,</hi> and <hi>Singular,</hi> and the Work onely of the
<hi>present Age,</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> Whereas, whosoever will consult
the History of our Government, will find <hi>This Law</hi> to be
a <hi>Moderation,</hi> which they call a <hi>Persecution:</hi> Especially at
a time when the <hi>strictness</hi> is not <hi>executed.</hi> Under <hi>Edward</hi>
the VI. the very <hi>Depraving</hi> of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the Vse of any other</hi> in <hi>Open Prayer,</hi> was 10 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>his
Majesty</hi> for the <hi>First Offence; 20 l.</hi> for the <hi>Second:</hi> And a
<hi>Forfeiture</hi> of all <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Chattels,</hi> with <hi>Imprisonment du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Life</hi> for the <hi>Third.</hi> And in the <hi>Fifth</hi> of the <hi>same King,</hi>
there was Authorized an <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction</hi> in these
Cases. <hi>Q. Mary repealed this Act:</hi> and in the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Q.
Elizabeth, Q. Maries Act</hi> was <hi>Repealed,</hi> and the <hi>Former Act
Confirmed;</hi> which was afterwards in the <hi>Five and Thirtieth
of That Queens Reign, Enforced with more Rigour;</hi> to which
She was necessitated, by the Turbulence of that Spirit of
<hi>Schism</hi> which still to This day is a working. <hi>King
Iames</hi> handed it down to the <hi>late King,</hi> and he continued
it, till by a Torrent of <hi>Popular Violence,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> himself, and
the <hi>Government</hi> were Both <hi>over-born:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have gotten (<hi>saith he</hi>) a Swarm of Ecclesiastical Officers,
which the Scriptures never knew, nor Reformed Churches ever
owned: A sort of Proud Prelats—And all manner of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
to Soul and Body. Plague, Fire, Sword, Vniversal Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery;
and, without Seasonable Mercy, the Total Ruine of the
whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to hear that we have any <hi>Officers</hi> which the
<hi>Reformed Churches</hi> never <hi>owned:</hi> For these which we have
in This Government at <hi>present,</hi> we have had for <hi>several Ages:</hi>
and when we had these Officers no longer, we had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any Government: And <hi>Then</hi> it was that all his Plagues
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49922:14"/>
befel us. We have made but <hi>One Trial of another way of
Government,</hi> and it cost us <hi>Dear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon a supposed Question over again, concerning the
<hi>Rise</hi> of our <hi>Miseries;</hi> the <hi>Libellers Answer</hi> is, that <hi>the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Provoking Sins of the Land; as Adultery, Blasphemy
Swearing, Idolatry, Perjury, and contempt of God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
do pull hard with Heaven to bring down desolating Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
But the nearest Cause of our Impoverishments, ariseth
from the Particulars afore mentioned.]</hi> He should have done
well to have put in <hi>Rebellion</hi> too; which hath all other Sins
in the Belly of it. But That is a Thing these people do not
love to touch upon. To the rest I have spoken more then
enough already: and that which follows, is onely an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Citation of Reflections upon <hi>Ill Bishops,</hi> whence
he would draw an <hi>Inference</hi> that we are to have <hi>None
at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> of the <hi>Five Quaeries</hi> before mentioned is
This, [<hi>Whether since all other Reformed Churches in</hi> Europe
<hi>did upon the First Reformation and Departure from Popery
cast out all Diocesan Bishops, Name and Thing, Root and
Branch, as an Office altogether Popish; together with all their
Hierarchical Appurtenances; and do this day esteem them no
otherwise; why did not, or doth not</hi> England <hi>also do the like.</hi>]
So that by Hook or by Crook, it seems, the <hi>Bishops</hi> must
<hi>down,</hi> either for <hi>Oppression,</hi> or for <hi>Popery; after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of all other Reformed Churches.</hi> We may see by This,
what kind of Reformation we are to expect from Those
People that account the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>Popish.</hi>
We should be presently a tearing down <hi>Altars</hi> again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing
of <hi>Churches,</hi> Rifling of <hi>Colleges,</hi> and Murthering
of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> over again in <hi>Essigie;</hi> which is no way to
be effected but by <hi>another Rebellion. The Model of the best
Reformed Churches,</hi> was the Juggle of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and
the very <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Scots coming in the second time,</hi> was
our <hi>Owning of their Kirk</hi> for the <hi>best Reformed;</hi> and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49922:15"/>
for a <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>English Church,</hi> according to
the <hi>Scottish Model.</hi> The <hi>Reformation</hi> doubtless was a <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Work;</hi> but there have been very <hi>Ill Things</hi> done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that <hi>Pretext,</hi> and in the <hi>way</hi> to it: And it is no New
Thing for <hi>God</hi> to be in the <hi>End,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> in the <hi>Mans.</hi>
Beside that, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is so <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>Apostolical</hi> already, that there is no
need of <hi>Double Refining</hi> it.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Third Quaery</hi> is a Frank Proposal, without any more
ado, of taking all the <hi>Church Lands</hi> into the <hi>Crown;</hi> and
very Courteously he offers the <hi>Poor Cavaliers</hi> a <hi>Snip</hi> in
the <hi>Booty.</hi> Does he consider, that after <hi>This Violence,</hi> an
<hi>Englishman</hi> hath nothing left him that is <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>sacred?</hi>
And that as much as in him lies, he destroys us in our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
Consciences,</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> all at a Blow. The <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>First,</hi> a <hi>Gift</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>appropriated</hi>
to his <hi>Service;</hi> and therefore not to be <hi>touched: (They have
Robbed me,</hi> saith <hi>God,</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Malachy.</hi>) Or if it
<hi>may,</hi> no man is sure of the Estate he possesses, by the same
Reason: For there is no better Title in Nature, then <hi>a
Deed of Gift. Secondly,</hi> it is setled and Confirmed by
<hi>Magna Charta;</hi> which says, <hi>that the Church of</hi> England <hi>shall
be free; and shall have all her whole Rights and Liberties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable,
(for ever.) Thirdly,</hi> the King binds himself by his
<hi>Coronation Oath, to preserve unto the Bishops, and to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
committed to their charge,</hi> all <hi>Cononical Privileges, and
due Law and Iustice; and to protect and defend them, as every
good King ought to be a Protector and Defender of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Churches under his Government.</hi> So that here is
<hi>Sacrilege, Common Right,</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> in the Case.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Fourth Quaery</hi> is, [<hi>Whether in those Kingdoms and
States where Prelacy is extirpated, and a Presbytery onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
there be not as Godly, Able, Orthodox Preachers, &amp;c.
and as good Subjects, as where Bishops are retained.</hi>—His <hi>Last
Quary</hi> is onely a Political Prospect upon the Power of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49922:15"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and nothing to the point in Question.] To which
I answer <hi>First,</hi> That I know no such <hi>Kingdoms</hi> as he speaks
of. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What if under a <hi>Presbyterial Government,</hi>
any <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>That State</hi> should move <hi>vise versâ,</hi> for an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal
There,</hi> as he does <hi>Here</hi> for a <hi>Presbyterial?</hi> How would
it be taken? If there may be as <hi>good Preachers</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
on the <hi>One</hi> side, as on the <hi>Other;</hi> why should we
change the Government, to be onely where we were?
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> If <hi>Two Archbishops,</hi> and 24 <hi>Bishops Diocesan</hi> be
so great an <hi>Oppression;</hi> what would become of us in a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
when we should have 9285 <hi>Popes,</hi> in stead of them?
(<hi>One</hi> in <hi>Every Parish.) Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Presbyterial Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
are purely <hi>Iesuitical;</hi> and that would be but the setling
of <hi>Popery</hi> under <hi>another Name. Sixthly,</hi> we have it upon
Experiment, that the <hi>People</hi> will never indure <hi>Them,</hi> nor
<hi>They</hi> the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come now to That Libel, which bears the Title of
my <hi>Lord Lucas's Speech:</hi> The <hi>Name</hi> of that Noble Lord is
onely made use of for a Cover to those Scandals upon the
King, which, to have saved the last drop of bloud in his
Veins, he would not have been guilty of. It is true, that
Offence was taken to the Liberty of the Speech it self, and
a Censure passed upon it; but it is not presently for every
Mutinous Incendiary to Arraign a Proceeding of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to call it <hi>Barbarous Vsage,</hi> with other rude, and
very unmannerly Expressions, in the Preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
He says that <hi>God hath taken him from an <hi>Ungrateful
Generation.</hi>
               </hi> And he says right in that; for undoubtedly
there never was the fellow of it upon the face of the Earth.
The <hi>Kings Friends</hi> (who are the onely People <hi>Oppressed)</hi>
they sit still, in <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Patience;</hi> while his <hi>Enemies</hi> that
enjoy both the <hi>Advantage</hi> of the others <hi>Losses,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
of their <hi>Services; Those</hi> are the people that <hi>Complain.
This Faction,</hi> to whom the King hath forgiven his <hi>Fathers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49922:16"/>
Bloud</hi> and <hi>his Own. (His Own,</hi> (I say) for they that <hi>shot</hi> at
him and <hi>mist,</hi> are as <hi>Guilty,</hi> as if they had struck him to the
<hi>heart;</hi> and they that <hi>advised</hi> it, as those that did the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>)
These are the people, that in requital for their
<hi>forfeited Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> which his Majesty
frankly <hi>gave</hi> them, are now laying the same Train for <hi>This
King,</hi> by which They ruined the <hi>Last.</hi> The Bold Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> are such, as a Loyal Subject cannot
Honestly so much as recite: It is neither better nor worse
then a <hi>Formal Charge</hi> upon the King in <hi>Five and Twenty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
dispersed with all the Malice, and Industry imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Scope of it is to possess the people with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the King designs the bringing in of <hi>Popery,</hi> and
an <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> with an Application of several parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
to those Ends. Now if these <hi>Affronts</hi> pass, without
either <hi>Punishment,</hi> or <hi>Reply,</hi> who can blame the simple mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that know nothing more then what they read in a
Pamphlet, for giving credit to them? And when they are
once tainted with that deadly <hi>Iealousie,</hi> who can blame them
again, for doing <hi>Ill Things,</hi> that know no <hi>better?</hi> The Time
is almost come, when honest men shall be put to death, and
the very <hi>Murtherers think that they do God good Service.</hi>
This was the mistaken Zeal of the late Times; and we are
even ready for it once again. The <hi>Two Calumnies</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
these people lay the greatest <hi>stress,</hi> are <hi>First,</hi> a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Apprehension</hi> of an <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi>
of an <hi>Inclination</hi> to favour <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Imputation of any Disposition, or Design in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
that now is, in favour of either <hi>Tyranny</hi> or <hi>Popery,</hi> is
so groundless and incredible, to any man that hath but his
Eyes in his head, that it would not be worth a Page of
Paper, to shew the Error of it, were it not that we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to the <hi>Delusion</hi> of <hi>believing things impossible,</hi> and
<hi>discerning things Invisible;</hi> and yet as <hi>Blind</hi> as <hi>Moles,</hi> to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of clear and evident <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49922:16"/>
With what Face can any man pretend an <hi>Apprehension</hi> of
<hi>Tyranny</hi> from <hi>This Prince,</hi> whose very <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi>
by the Extreme abuse of it, hath created his <hi>Misfortune.</hi>
Nay, the most spiteful of his Enemies cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that there doth not live any man that hath less of
Gall and Rancour, in his Nature: Beside the <hi>Experiment</hi>
his greatest <hi>Adversaries</hi> have had of his <hi>Goodness</hi> in Common
with the rest of his Subjects, upon the <hi>Crists</hi> of his <hi>Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
For when he might have made himself as <hi>absolute</hi> as
he would; when he had his <hi>Foes</hi> under his <hi>Feet;</hi> and some
reasons of <hi>State,</hi> perhaps, to lay a <hi>firmer Foundation</hi> of his
<hi>Future Security;</hi> his <hi>Tenderness of Nature</hi> did yet so far
prevail upon him, above all other Considerations, that he
quitted all those <hi>Advantages;</hi> he <hi>Gave,</hi> and <hi>Forgave</hi> all
that was possible; to shew how much he prized a <hi>Dominion</hi>
over the <hi>Hearts</hi> of his People, above That of their <hi>Bodies</hi>
and <hi>Estates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching his <hi>affection</hi> to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> since it hath pleased God in his Infinite Wisdom
to permit, that his Majesty should be Calumniated upon
That point; it is a singular Providence, that this should
happen in a <hi>Iuncture,</hi> when the plain matter of <hi>Fact,</hi>
and the <hi>Naked History</hi> of his <hi>Royal Proceedings,</hi> may suffice
to the most prejudicate, and the most obstinate of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as an Unanswerable <hi>Confutation.</hi> It is every day
more and more artificially <hi>Insinuated</hi> and <hi>Improved;</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since the Discovery of the <hi>late horrid Design,</hi> and
particularly in the <hi>Libel last mentioned,</hi> as if his Majesty were
not so <hi>careful</hi> and zealous for the <hi>Suppressing</hi> and <hi>Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Popery,</hi> and for the <hi>Punishing of Delinquents,</hi> as is
needful for the security of his Government. Nay, there
are some so daring, as to take upon them in <hi>Hint,</hi> and
<hi>Mystery,</hi> to intimate the very <hi>Countenancing</hi> of the <hi>Plot it
self.</hi> If the Proceeding be not altogether so <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary</hi>
as some would have it, we shall onely say This;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49922:17"/>
that Those of all men, have the least Colour to complain
of his Majesties <hi>want of Rigour,</hi> that stand indebted alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for their <hi>Heads,</hi> and for their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> unto his <hi>Grace</hi>
and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Majesty
hath given the World so many and so ample Evidences of
his dislike of That Communion; that every mans <hi>Conscience</hi>
as well as <hi>Reason,</hi> cannot but discharge him upon That
point. It cannot be imagined, that in his <hi>late Troubles</hi> and
<hi>Exile,</hi> he wanted either <hi>Arguments,</hi> or <hi>Solicitations,</hi> either
in point of <hi>State</hi> or of <hi>Religion;</hi> and the most plausible too,
that could be found out, to work upon either his <hi>Conscience,</hi>
or his <hi>Necessities:</hi> And yet no <hi>Temptations,</hi> either on the
<hi>One hand,</hi> or on the <hi>Other,</hi> had any farther Operation upon
his Majesties <hi>Iudgment,</hi> then by causing a stricter Enquiry
into the Subject in debate, to confirm him still more and
more in the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Profession.</hi> In so much, that in
the Lowest and most hopeless State of his <hi>Distresses,</hi> he
chose rather to abide all <hi>Extremities,</hi> then to depart, in any
Tittle, from the Faith of the <hi>Reformed Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now his Majesty having given this <hi>Earnest</hi> of his <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness</hi>
to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> during his
<hi>Banishment;</hi> and shewing that neither <hi>Fear</hi> nor <hi>Despair</hi>
could shake him in his <hi>Resolutions;</hi> it were a strange thing
for him now to <hi>relinquish That Cause</hi> in <hi>Opposition</hi> to his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;</hi>
which when it might have turned to his <hi>Temporal
Advantage,</hi> no <hi>Persecution</hi> or <hi>Flattery</hi> could ever prevail
upon him to do. I might add to all This, that he hath
steered the same Course in all his Devotions both <hi>Publique</hi>
and <hi>Private,</hi> and that the Maintainance of This Church
hath been Undeniably the Scope of all his <hi>Deliberations,</hi>
and <hi>Councils,</hi> in all <hi>Religious</hi> Concernments, <hi>since his Blessed
Return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not enough, in all Cases, for a Prince to be <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Innocent,</hi> in the matter of <hi>Religion;</hi> Witness the late
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49922:17"/>
               <hi>Pious</hi> and yet <hi>Vnfortunate Prince.</hi> For wheresoever this
Incantation takes place, the <hi>Sinews</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are <hi>Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened,</hi>
the <hi>Sacredness</hi> of <hi>Order Dissolved,</hi> and <hi>all Obligations
cancelled,</hi> as well <hi>Moral</hi> as <hi>Divine.</hi> And not onely so; but
the very <hi>Shadow</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> of it, frights people into
<hi>Lakes</hi> and <hi>Precipices,</hi> and transports them with <hi>Panique
Terrors,</hi> into the <hi>Execution</hi> of the very <hi>Mischiefs</hi> they <hi>fear.</hi>
So that his Majesty hath <hi>two main Difficulties</hi> to encounter
at once: The <hi>One</hi> to Master the <hi>Plot it self;</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> to
<hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Sweeten</hi> the <hi>Passions</hi> of men, <hi>zealous</hi> in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Extreme:</hi> that no Inconvenience may arise from
Their <hi>Misapprehension</hi> of Things <hi>another way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to these Measures, his Majesty hath governed
his Course throughout the whole Tract of This Affair;
leaving no means unattempted, that might probably give
light to the Bottom of <hi>This Tragical Design:</hi> He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all sorts of <hi>Encouragement</hi> to <hi>Informations,</hi> by <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Protection,</hi> and <hi>Reward:</hi> The <hi>Depositions</hi> have been
formally taken before his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Privy Council;</hi>
and the <hi>Evidences strictly weighed</hi> and <hi>examined;</hi> and from
thence afterward heartily <hi>recommended,</hi> and faithfully
<hi>Transmitted</hi> to the <hi>Two Houses of Parliament;</hi> as the most
<hi>Rational Method,</hi> for the <hi>Common Satisfaction</hi> both of <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither hath his Majesty been wanting on his <hi>Own part</hi>
in a <hi>Vigorous Concurrence</hi> with the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> to do all that
in him lay, toward the <hi>Suppressing of Popery,</hi> the <hi>seizing</hi>
and <hi>securing of Popish Recusants;</hi> and providing more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
by the best means that could be devised, for the
<hi>Maintainance</hi> and <hi>Establishment of our Religion:</hi> Having
issued out divers <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and done several other
<hi>Publique Acts,</hi> upon the Motion and Advice of his <hi>Two
Houses of Parliament,</hi> to the Ends aforesaid; even to the
taking away from the <hi>Popish Lords</hi> their <hi>Ancient Right</hi> of
<hi>Session</hi> in the <hi>House of Peers;</hi> and disabling all <hi>Papists</hi>

whatsoever, to all purposes whatsoever, from any Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Government.</p>
            <p>And if it be not yet enough, that in this Dangerous
Juncture, his Majesty hath walked <hi>hand in hand,</hi> and kept
pace with his <hi>Two Houses of Parliament;</hi> it may be justly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that he hath in some degree even <hi>supererogated</hi> in
This matter; and added an <hi>Excess</hi> of <hi>Affection</hi> to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
Discharge</hi> of his <hi>Princely Care</hi> and <hi>Function.</hi> Of
This, we might give several Instances; but one shall
serve for all, in his <hi>Majesties Speech to both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
on <hi>Saturday Nov.</hi> 8. 1678. where he quickens the
<hi>Two Houses</hi> themselves, in these words; <hi>I do desire you</hi>
(saith his Majesty) <hi>to think on some ready means for Conviction
of Popish Recusants, and to expedite your Counsels, that the
World may see our Vnanimity; and that I may have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to let you see how ready I am to do any thing that
may give satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After This demonstrative Clearness on his <hi>Majesties side,</hi>
let us cast an Impartial Eye the <hi>Other way,</hi> and so <hi>conclude.</hi>
Was not <hi>This</hi> the very <hi>Charge</hi> upon the <hi>late King?</hi> and
was there ever any Prince that lived more <hi>faultless?</hi> Was
not the Care of the <hi>Protestant Religion, pretended;</hi> and
was not all <hi>Religion,</hi> in a manner, <hi>subverted?</hi> Was not the
<hi>Kings Honour,</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> the <hi>Pretext</hi> of a <hi>Solemn Covenant?</hi>
and was he not delivered up by the <hi>Same Covenant,</hi> to his
very <hi>Executioners?</hi> What a <hi>Clamour</hi> there was about <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Charta,</hi> the <hi>English Liberties;</hi> and a <hi>Reformation,</hi> onely
of some <hi>Excrescences</hi> (as they called them) in the <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>State?</hi> And did not this specious Flourish conclude
in a <hi>Total Extinction</hi> of <hi>Law, Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Government?</hi>
Were not the same <hi>Arguments</hi> used <hi>Then</hi> as <hi>Now?</hi> Are not
the <hi>same Artifices</hi> of <hi>Libelling Authority</hi> practised <hi>Now,</hi> which
were <hi>Then?</hi> And are not the <hi>People poisoned</hi> the <hi>same
way This Year,</hi> that they were the <hi>Last?</hi> In short; Is not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49922:19"/>
               <hi>High-gate</hi> the way to <hi>St-Albans</hi> Still? So certainly are we
now running the <hi>same Stage</hi> over again. Was there not a
Time when St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was turned into a <hi>Garrison?</hi> When
<hi>Apprentices cancelled their own Indentures,</hi> and had them
renewed again by an <hi>Ordinance?</hi> When for fear of <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats</hi>
in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> the Credulous Multitude brought them,
like <hi>Aegyptian Plagues,</hi> into their very <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Dishes.
Oh! but do you think</hi> (they cry) <hi>that These Godly People
will ever touch the King?</hi> How many well meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thought the <hi>same thing before,</hi> and yet contributed to
the destroying of their <hi>Soveraign;</hi> not knowing what they
did. <hi>Be not deluded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after the sending of what is above-written,
to the Press, comes out a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> entitled <hi>Englands Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Or the Two Vnanimous Votes of the last Good Parliament,
concerning the D. of</hi> York <hi>being a Papist, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have so great a Reverence, as well for the <hi>Honour</hi> of
the <hi>Constitution of Parliaments,</hi> as for the <hi>Personal Loyalty</hi>
of the <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>late Great Representative,</hi> that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but take notice of the <hi>Abuse,</hi> which is <hi>First,</hi> put upon
That <hi>Illustrious Convention it self;</hi> and <hi>afterward,</hi> upon the
<hi>People,</hi> in <hi>This Libel.</hi> It makes the <hi>House of Commons</hi> to be the
<hi>Parliament:</hi> But neither did those worthy Gentlemen claim
to themselves <hi>a Full Parliamentary Power,</hi> to the <hi>Exclusion</hi> of
any other <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Essential Concurrence:</hi> Nor will they
take it well to be so much <hi>Mis-represented.</hi> And then, it
is as great an <hi>Abuse,</hi> on the <hi>Other</hi> hand, to the whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
For if This Opinion be swallowed once, the People
will be apt to take <hi>Ordinances</hi> again, for <hi>Laws.</hi> So that the
Title is in a great <hi>Mistake</hi> upon <hi>That Point:</hi> And now that
the <hi>Reader</hi> may not incur almost as <hi>Great</hi> a one, on the
<hi>other</hi> hand, in <hi>another;</hi> Lei it be observed that the <hi>Woman</hi>
in whose Name this Pamphlet is published, is so far from
being a <hi>Well-Willer</hi> to the <hi>Kings Person,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49922:20"/>
from the time of his Majesties Restauration, it hath been
her Constant Business to promote all <hi>Spiteful</hi> and <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Books,</hi> and <hi>Papers,</hi> against both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these <hi>Pretended Votes,</hi> I can say nothing, whether
<hi>True,</hi> or <hi>False;</hi> but This I am sure of, that <hi>Debates</hi> of That
<hi>Solemnity,</hi> and <hi>Importance,</hi> ought not to be made <hi>Publique;</hi>
that nothing can be more <hi>Derogatory</hi> to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of that
<hi>Great Body;</hi> then (as the Fashion hath been of late) for
every <hi>Pedant,</hi> and <hi>Mechanique,</hi> to set up the Trade of
<hi>Teaching Parliament-men</hi> their <hi>Lessons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject of his Royal Highnesses's <hi>Succession</hi> to the
<hi>Crown,</hi> is made the <hi>Common Theme</hi> of the <hi>Press:</hi> And I do
not presume to <hi>Reason</hi> the matter, either <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> as it is
a Case out of my Province: But still I am at Liberty to
assert the Duty of a <hi>Free-born,</hi> and of a <hi>Faithful Subject;</hi>
and to <hi>affirm,</hi> that I have not found any one <hi>Argument</hi> in
any of these Libels, which in a <hi>Natural Consequence</hi> does
not likewise reach the <hi>King:</hi> whom <hi>God preserve,</hi> and in
<hi>Mercy</hi> keep all <hi>his Subjects</hi> in <hi>Due Obedience.</hi>
