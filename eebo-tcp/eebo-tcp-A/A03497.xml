            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot forget your fauours, whiles I enioy them: and yet the contemplation of that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, cannot properly be called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. But when I thinke of giuing thankes, mee thinkes it is not more my purpoſe then my feare: ſince gratitude does in ſome ſort make bountie leſſe; bountie being more content, when it is attended by gratitude; but being more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, when it is oppoſed by ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: ſo that the greateſt thankes,
<pb facs="tcp:4372:3"/>
though not the beſt, is not to giue thankes. Beſides, bountie hauing in it more of outward good then grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude hath, gratitude may ſeeme a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer goodneſſe, then bountie; and ſo whiles it ſtriues to requite it, may ſeeme to exceed it. Yet ſince reaſon tels vs that ingratitude is againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being an iniuſtice, and ſo againſt nature, I chooſe to giue thankes the common way; not that I iudged it enough gratitude, to giue thankes thus: but that I iudged it too much ingratitude, not to giue thankes thus. That I might not therefore requite your goodneſſe with iniury, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to imitate that goodneſſe by making my thankes; like vnto it, publicke and yet ſincere. Secret thankes are often free from flatterie,
<pb facs="tcp:4372:3"/>
yet alwayes like it: being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at as much diſtance from exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as flattery deſires to be. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then are my thankes, which are as iuſt as your merit, being made iuſt by your merit: which ſo appeares in your exemplary &amp; daily Deuotion, that you haue taken more poſſeſsion of your Church, then of your Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And for your Colledge, you haue made it enioy a Statute of Improouement, not ſo much in Dyet, as in Studie: ruling it by the Statute of your Example; which will be Deane beyond Your time. Any man May ſay thus much, but I Muſt: truth will make it iuſtice in another: but choice will make it gratitude, in Mee: who owe my ſelfe vnto you; nay,
<pb facs="tcp:4372:4"/>
who owe my Friendes vnto you. They haue giuen me bleſsings; but you haue giuen me Them; euen the moſt Noble (and, through your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour) My Sir Francis Stuart: whom, when I haue Named, I haue Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my vnderſtanding: and, when I haue named him Mine, I haue Contented it. Which happineſſe muſt needes make mee remember You, as the cauſe of that happineſſe; and as, before, I was His, by being Yours; ſo now by being His, I ſhall be the more</p>

               <pb n="1" facs="tcp:4372:5"/>GReat ſorrowes are dumbe: and can cuſtome then iuſtly expect that this ſhould bee eloquent? This day has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with his owne griefe: and ſhall wee adde vnto it by repetition? The ſeueritie of this paſſion admits no other wit of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, then the ſalt of a teare; nor ſharper accent, then of a groane equall to a loſt friend, or to a ſinne. Yet ſee the endeuour of compaſſion, which had rather with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate teares recouer it ſelfe to language, by the reliefe of complaint to eaſe affliction; then to be guilty of ingratitude by wonder and ſilence. This day muſt cry-out, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulately lament vnto all dayes, this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, the tragedie of God: which ſeemes as much to exceed our faith, as our ſorrow. Is our God, our liuing God, as the carcaſſe-idols of the Heathen, whoſe God-heads ſuffer the ſtroake and victory of the Chizell and the Hammer? Or, are Poets Prophets indeed? and are there very Giants, that dare inuade God? Fiction, that intends to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, neither contradicts nor exceeds na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and ſtory muſt be more ſeuerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued within the poſſibility of action: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4372:6"/>
it begets not faith, but ſcorne, and the Hiſtorians reaſon is rather queſtioned, then his eloquence. Yet this day breathes-out ſuch vnion of extremities, the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and the inſolence of man, in Ieſu crucified, and the crucifying Iewes; that your pietie can ſcarce be more amazed at our Lord's affliction, then at the Iewes crueltie; ſo that, if the motiue and condition of theſe vnreaſonable actors were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, our ſuſpicion might cry-out, Who will beleeue our report? Hiſtory or inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has anciently told vs of ſome altars, where-on wild deuotion ſacrificed men: but durſt Poetry euer faigne a people that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their God? Would any man haue thought that the Iew would haue beene the firſt Antichriſt of his Meſſias? That the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham would murder the God of Abraham? That the partakers of the Lords glory, would crucifie the Lord of glory? I muſt admit you a reſpite to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſatisfie as well your admiration, as your enquiry; which does, me thinkes, with the labour of expectation deſire to know not only the fact, but alſo the affection of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4372:6"/>
Iewes: as if then you would bee perſwaded to the ſtory of the action, when firſt you ſhall haue heard the ſtory of the actors. Not the Iewes alone were partakers in this guilt: but chiefly the Iewes triumph'd in this guilt; the Iewes, who were alwayes of a churliſh vnderſtanding, and now their ſoules were as darke as peruerſe. They had before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an eſſay of cruelty vpon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: but that was but a yonger practice to this fury. Then they crucified the Lord in his Saints: but now they will doe it without a figure. And may not our reaſon as well as piety here demand with wonder, What aild the Heathen, nay, what aild the Iewes to murmure themſelues into a Conſpiracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſt of the Lord? Surely, their rage did not diſcerne in him the myſticall ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme of God and man; for had they knowne it, they would not haue crucified the Lord of glory. Yet ſhall execrable violation bee ſoftned into an ignorance? ſhall elaborate malice be excuſed into ſo gentle a guilt? ſhall the crucifying of our Sauiour be made but man-ſlaughter? It is not an errour to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don an errour: but it is a crime but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4372:7"/>
a crime. Could the Iewes bee ignorant of his innocence, who was pronounced not-guilty, by his judge? Who was pronounced innocent, by his Iudas? Who was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced holy, by Iewes amaz'd to ſilence, and in that to confeſſion, at the power of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſyllogiſme, If I am guiltie, why doe you not conuince mee? If I am innocent, why doe you not beleeue mee? Could the Iewes be ignorant of his office, when as hee ſo repaired the ſenſes of the diſeaſed, that their ſenſe might juſtly perſwade their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to beleeue? When as he called, by the voice of his power, the dead to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious reſurrection? When as he proued his life to be a Commentary vpon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Could the Iewes bee ignorant of his diuinitie, which was as neceſſary to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of his wonderfull office, as of his wonderfull perſon? His diuinitie, which was acknowledged by the Deuils, whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed: who, for a moment, did by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miracle leaue their lying, then their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and being tormented vnto truth, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably confeſſed him the Sonne of God? His diuinitie, which at his Baptiſme, Heauen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4372:7"/>
reuealed vnto the Baptiſt, which reuelation he likewiſe reuealed vnto the Iewes: the beſt of whom eſteem'd him as a man of God; the worſt of whom fear'd him as a man of God; And he told them what he ſaw, not in the contriuance of phancie, or by the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of a glaſſe; And hee did ſee the veile of Heauen diuided: as if the diuine perſons, who neuer had beene vndiuided, would now ſenſibly appeare vnited at this the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of their Trinitie; And hee did ſee the mild embleme of the Holy Ghoſt deſcend vpon him; and he heard the voyce of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who was both the father and the witneſſe at this great Chriſtning. And ſhall we yet ſay, that this light of the World was ſo obſcured in the cloud of fleſh, that it was not cleerely preſented to the eyes of the world? ſhall we yet ſay, that we doe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnderſtand, whether or no the Iewes did ſufficiently vnderſtand? ſhall wee yet ſay with a bold compaſſion, Had they knowne it? and yet wee muſt ſay with a ſafe compaſſion, Had they knowne it, they would not haue crucified the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The common Iew was the common
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4372:8"/>
ſenſe of that politique bodie: his outward ſoule was able to ſee the Law: but, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, hee was as farre from the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, as from the gift of it. Hee could with enough ignorance gaze at the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Sauiour: but it was a greater wonder to worke, in a Iew, a beliefe of theſe wonders, then to worke theſe wonders. Yet ſome did beleeue them and abuſe them, vilely apprehending theſe demonſtrations as the impotent perſwaſions of probabilitie. And ſome thus thought him to bee the Chriſt; yet durſt not reueale this cheape opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: leaſt they ſhould bee excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſaluation, by being caſt-out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue to Chriſt and his Diſciples. It is the property of a wiſeman, not to haue his heart in his tongue: but neuer was it the property of a wiſe man, to haue a heart without a tongue. The mercie of our Sauiour made the dumbe to ſpeake: but the feare of the Rulers made theſe ſpeakers dumbe; thus were their conſciences tongue-tied by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. And the Rulers themſelues did not more impoſe this ſilence vpon others, then vpon themſelues: but ſtriuing as much to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4372:8"/>
exceed the people in peruerſeneſſe as in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, vnto their ignorance they added fury. Indeed they could not by the ſharpeſt diſcretion of their eye diſtinguiſh an incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate God: nor was the Critique Gamaliel able to inſtruct his Diſciple Saul in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme of this myſtery, though Saul's vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ignorance admitted him neerer to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and conuerſion. But the chiefe of the Iewes, to whom the Goſpell was a ſchiſme, politiquely rejoycing in their wiſdome and honour, ſcorn'd the imputation of leuity by a change, and a ſuſpected dejection by this change; whereby the High-prieſt of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſhould be abuſed into an obſcure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Wherefore arm'd thus with the affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ignorance and the malice of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at what thunder would theſe ſtartle? at what vnconceiued almightineſſe would this fury turne daſtard? Yet had they knowne it, they would not haue crucified the Lord of glory. And yet by an vnmoued decree this paſſion was ſealed to a neceſſitie; and can we then make this predeſtinated execution depend vpon the will of the vncertaine Iewes? This dazles the eye, and is a wheele
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4372:9"/>
turning in a wheele; a ſpheare wrapt in a ſpheare; the loweſt againſt the order of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and nature, ſeeming to giue motion to the higheſt, the will of the Iewes to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God. Had Feſtus vpon his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeate heard holy Paul preach this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming oppoſition, wee may eaſily beleeue that without the manners of deliberation he would once more haue cryed-out to our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Much learning has made thee mad.

               </gap> and without being rapt to the third Heauen, wee know, that Thoſe things which are neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the firſt cauſe admit vncertainty in reſpect of ſecond cauſes. The crucifying of our Sauiour was neceſſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to Gods decree: but it was contingent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to the libertie of the Iewes will: in whom it was choice, and not neceſſitie to will or not to will the death of Chriſt. If the Iewes had knowne it, then both the cauſes of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the action it ſelfe might haue not beene, and had not beene. But this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the knowledge of our Sauiour (which if it had beene, our Sauiour could not haue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4372:9"/>
ſuffer'd) could not be, becauſe the firſt cauſe, God, had decree he ſhould ſuffer. And as God by this decree of his Paſſion, did not with an actiue concurrence, lay a neceſſity &amp; guilt vpon the will of the Iewes: no more did hee impoſe any neceſſitie vpon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane will of Chriſt: but our Sauiour made himſelfe a free ſacrifice with as much mercy as affliction. For though there were in his humane will a neceſſitie of obedience to the decree of his Paſſion, yet was there alſo a true indifference: this neceſſity being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall to his humane will preciſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as it was intrinſecall and naturall to his perſon. But his humane will ſuffering no violence, did for our ſake in the libertie of choice offer-vp his perſon to the violence of the Iewes. Who were ſo glad of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ambition, that rather then they would fall from their Cleargy-monarchy they would not feare to ſet vpon God. The braueſt ſinne that euer was, was ventred in Heauen by an Angell and the baſeſt ſinne that euer was, was committed on earth by a Diſciple. A Diſciple, who had he beene of an intire faith, had beene euen yet of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

fame, &amp; in our ſacred Kalendar enjoyed the place and title of Saint Iudas. Hee was Chriſt's purſe-bearer: whoſe office vnder ſuch a Maſter, was in all likelihood of too narrow a commoditie for a large Knaue: yet louing this, more then his maſter, hee bargaines with the Prieſts, and takes earneſt to be a conuenient Traitor. But heere I muſt not forget one thing, becauſe our Sauiour has commanded mee to remember it: and that is thy piety, O happy woman, who didſt beſtow vpon our Sauiour's head and feete a precious oyntment. With thy beautifull haire thou didſt wipe his beautifull feete, from which thy oyntment returned ſanctified to thine owne head: and by a commanded an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſary of thy pietie, he hath poured vpon thee the oyntment of a religious fame. Iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe I heere remember her, her liberality being the vnjuſt cauſe of Iudas his murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: and it was he whoſe thrift did chide at the ſpending of this oyntment. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if hee had vowed a repaire of this loſſe, he finds a policie to ſell the oyntment, which was already ſpent; by ſelling his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who was annointed with it. A ſubtile
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4372:10"/>
Merchant, that labourd ſo with an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to engroſſe treaſure and iniquitie, as if hee would haue contented with Adam for the future tradition and monopoly of ſinne. Thus you ſee, that it is poſſible, to finde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the crucifying of the Lord of glory, and now I thinke, you can beleeue that there are monſters. But now behold a man! a man, in whom innocence and patience contend for ſupremacy. His enemies are preparing for his death by malice; and hee himſelfe is preparing for the ſame by loue. The moſt of them are at their conſpiracie, and he is at the Communion with his Traytour. At which laſt Supper he himſelfe ſeemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and imitate the goodneſſe of that woman, whom hee commanded vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. Shee wiped his feet, and he waſhes his Diſciples; and would you not thinke that theſe feet would for euer after goe vpright? Mee thinkes, when hee came to waſh Iudas his feete, his ſullen treaſon might haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it ſelfe in Saint Peter's anſwer, Thou ſhalt neuer waſh my feet. Indeed to waſh a Iudas was to waſh a Black-more. Yet he had more need to haue vſed Saint Peter's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4372:11"/>
anſwere, Lord not the feet only, but alſo the hands and the head. But it would haue beene a mercy vnwelcome to his ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneneſſe, to haue beene waſhed to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing cleanneſſe. His ſtaine was as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as his purpoſe: and his eares were cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriz'd as much as his conſcience againſt our Sauious wordes, which preuailed as little with his affection, as with his memory. Chriſt pointed-out the Traytour firſt by word: and, as if that had not beene enough, with his very finger; Hee that I giue a ſop vnto, he ſhall betray me; nay, with the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours owne finger, Hee that dips his finger with mee in the diſh, hee ſhall betray mee. Chriſt dipt, and Iudas dipt, and Chriſt gaue the ſop to Iudas. Who would not heere haue thought, but that hee, who by his garment and ſhadow could conferre health, muſt by his ſanctifying hand haue conferred ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? Was not heere the finger of God? And yet heere was not the finger of God. Iudas now found the truth of that vnhappy Philoſophie, Euery thing is receiued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the receiuer. Chriſt gaue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4372:11"/>
behold a ſad tranſubſtantiation a ſop turned into a Deuill! And now you will thinke it was time for him to leaue Chriſt's company; and ſo indeed hee did for immediatly hee went forth, and it was night a neceſſary ſhadow for the melancholy of treaſon: yet it was but an embleme of his guilt. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſupper they ſung a Pſalme: this was the harmony of the Goſpell in a Celeſtiall Quire, where there was neuer a Iudas, and Chriſt was the Chaunter. Indeed they had need to ſing, whiles yet they had the leiſure of company and joy: for, after this meeting, ſorrow had contriued the perpetuall ſilence of their Muſique. But leauing their Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que and the Citie they depart toward mount Oliuet, a place where the cuſtomary deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Sauiour enjoyed the practice and happineſſe of Prayer. The way was but ſhort, yet our Sauiour made it tedious, not by his company, which was their delight: but by his diſcourſe, which hitherto had bin their delight. Hee tell them that this night he ſhall be their griefe and danger. They, as not ſeeing it, make a large promiſe, though without ſurety, as much of their conſtancy,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4372:12"/>
as of their affection. Peter eſpecially makes this promiſe, which our Sauiour tels him he eſpecially will breake: and that this night, which is the preſent witneſſe of his double proteſtation, ſhall be the ſpeedy witneſſe of his triple deniall: the Cocke ere morning being to be his watchman and remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. The length of our Sauiours diſcourſe reacheth the mount, where departing from his Diſciples about a ſtones caſt, hee enters into a Garden, and the horrour of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enters into him. Now, hee is crucified without a croſſe the height whereof as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward aduanced him, ſo now the feare of it depreſſeth him to the ground. In the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſupplication he bowes his knees; he whoſe almightineſſe could haue bowed the heauens. In the dejection of his thoughts hee fals proſtrate on his face, to ſhew vs the nature of our guilt, that dares not looke-vp vnto heauen: and yet his voice is towards heauen, whiles thrice he begs of his Father, if it be his will, that this cup may paſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this cup crowned full with the bloud of ſowre Grapes: and thrice he returnes to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whom bee finds heauy as night and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4372:12"/>
ſleepe. Whiles he prayes, new terrours ſeize on him; and man though vnited to God is ſo oppreſſed, that an Angell from Heauen is ſent to comfort him. So hard it was for him that ouercame the Deuill, to ouercome the Croſſe. But alas had hee not need of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe, for whom there remayned ſtrokes, and whips, and wounds, &amp; thornes, and nailes and a ſpeare? and ſhall we thinke an Angell, ſhall wee thinke one Angell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt this hoſt of torments? Can wee with the confidence of words frighten horrour? His agonie and prayer increaſe; and from his mercifull pores flowes a ſweat of bloud: which beginnes his paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iewes doe. It pierces and dyes his garment; O, this would haue beene a relique worth the keeping! a garment ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher then Elias mantle! a garment anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with bloud, though not to life, yet to a miracle! The Prophet's loue and ſorrow were but little ones; though his eyes did caſt-out riuers of waters, for the deſtruction of Ieruſalem: but behold for our ſinnes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of our Ieſus does weepe bloud: whoſe ſpeedie drops ſeeme to imitate the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4372:13"/>
expedition of the loue that ſent them. After which agony of deuotion, on his faint limbes he raiſes himſelfe, and returning to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples rayſes them: who willing rather to breake their ſleepe, then their faith, ariſe; when hee comforts them with a hope of more ſleepe, yet tels them that at this time they muſt ſleepe no more: treaſon and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie by a ſtrange friendſhip being in a readineſſe to ſet vpon him. Whiles yet hee ſpeakes, loe, a band of Officers are come from the High Prieſts with Lanternes, and torches, and ſwords and ſtaues, to take him, who neither meanes to fight, nor runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: his mercy will not let him doe that, nor his innocency this. Their leader is Iudas guiding them with his feete to Chriſt, but with his counſell againſt Chriſt. When ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the compact and method of the Treaſon, hee ſalutes our Sauiour with a phraſe and a kiſſe, enough to haue breathed a Deuill into any man, but Chriſt: who as much vnderſtanding as abhorring his ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by a Prophetique queſtion preuents and reueales the newes of his intent; Iudas, betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſſe?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4372:13"/>
And was there euer ſuch a ſight as Chriſt &amp; Iudas thus vnited! Did not Chriſt now alſo deſcend into Hell! From this kiſſing Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour hee paſſes to the ſword-men; his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie making him confident to aske them, whom they ſeeke! when their buſineſſe and authoritie ſtrait-wayes anſwer, Ieſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth. (They had vntowardly learned to make no difference of perſons.) Hee with a mild courage replies, I am hee; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as if hee had come to apprehend Them, they fall downe backward; they fall from Chriſt. The blowing-downe of the wals of Iericho with Rams-hornes, though it was no leſſe wonderfull, yet it was leſſe ſpeedy. And where is now the conſpiracie of their ambition? Where is now the ſtrength of their inuaſion? Where is now the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their armour? Is it not all made the triumph of his meekneſſe. Heere is no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly army to ouerthrow this legion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils; but with a victorious mildneſſe they are ſtrucke downe, their bodies acknowledging his power, which their ſoules denied: their vnderſtanding bodies beeing vnwilling to act, what their ſenſleſſe ſoules prompted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4372:14"/>
them vnto. Yet does his pardon giue them ſtrength to riſe againe, and againe he askes them whom they ſeeke, and they dare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, Ieſus of Nazareth. Before, they ſpake to his humanitie, and his diuinitie anſwer'd them: but now hee anſwers them with the patience of his humanitie; which ſuffers the ſacriledge of their hands and malice. When Peter's zeale, at the captiuity of his maſter, vnſheathes his ſword: and cutting-off the High Prieſt's ſeruant's eare, makes him learne a new Circumciſion, which was no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a puniſhment. But againe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares the diuinitie and mercy of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: who corrects Peter and his fact, replan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſeruant's eare; which ſtraight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges and enjoyes his power. Yet they perſiſt in their impietie: and when hee by his power has prooued himſelfe a God, they by his patience will prooue him to be a man. And being in the hands of very Iewes, his Diſciples, forgetting their maſter and their proteſtations, runne all away: euen bold Saint Peter runnes away with his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and his ſword: euen his beloued Iohn runnes away, breaking the bonds of loue
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4372:14"/>
with the ſtrength of feare. O, heere I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſtay and grieue that his beloued Iohn alſo doth forſake him. Sure there is ſome friend for whom ſome friend will lay downe a life: and ſure there neuer were ſuch friends as Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and ſure of his Apoſtles there was none ſo neere him as his beloued John. The reſt were in his company, but hee in his boſome: and does his beloued Iohn alſo forſake him? Me thinkes the proteſtation and perſwaſion of Saint Paul would haue admirably become the mouth and practice of Saint Iohn, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor life, nor angels, nor principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature, no not a very Iew ſhall euer be able to force mee from the loue and boſome of my Ieſus. Yet euen beloued Iohn alſo does forſake his Ieſus! Whoſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hands they bind: the greateſt miracle of which was at this time not their power, but their patience. They bind his hands; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly forgetting, that if any of them ſhould loſe another eare, as much as in them lay they hindred him from healing of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4372:15"/>
happy had it beene, if Adam and Eue's hands had beene bound thus in Paradiſe! But ſee the bonds of our ſinnes, that are able to captiue the hands of Chriſt! Who is led by the blind malice of his Iewes vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And is there no good man's eye, who will with an eaſie teare follow his trauelling affliction? Is there none that will goe after him, though not to be a partaker, yet but a witneſſe of his injurie? Yes, there is one of more loue then age couered rather then clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with meere linnen: who being haſtily come, and as haſtily apprehended, chooſes rather to leaue his linnen, then his life, and ſlipping from their hands runnes as haſtily backe againe: and indeed hee runnes away ſo faſt, that I cannot tell you who he is. Yet if the curious pleaſe to runne after him, they may peraduenture find him to be the ſonne of that man of the village Gethſemane, at the foot of mount Oliuet, who owned the Garden where our Sauiour prayed. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the night might eaſily awake him to this vndreſſed ſpeed: which whiles hee vſes in running backe, the Iewes goe forward in their way and malice; leading our Sauiour
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4372:15"/>
firſt to Annas. They were to paſſe by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend doore, at which, by way of honour, they preſent their ſhew: and he ſends him to be preſented to the High-prieſt Caiaphas, his ſonne in law; this was the kindred of theſe honourable murderers. But whiles this troupe is with our Sauiour, you may looke back, and behold Peter following afarre off, full of loue, and ſhame, and ſorrow. Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, hee returnes but to forſweare himſelfe and his maſter! In a curious deſire he enters the High-prieſt's hall, a place of temptation and blaſphemie: where with as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as diſſimulation, he mixes with Chriſt's perſecutors; whom as already he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſo anon, by an vnhappy proficiencie, he muſt imitate. Conuerſation is the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of loue, and does by a ſecret friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of nature intimately aſſimilate. Now the High-prieſt with an aſſiſting tumult of Scribes and Phariſies does not examine our Sauiour, but tempt him; and when at their importunitie he has acknowledged himſelfe the Chriſt, he is made guiltie of being God: and ſtraight they practice vpon him the wantonneſſe of ſcorne. They prophane his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4372:16"/>
ſacred face with the blaſphemy of ſpittle: they blindfold him in execrable ſport; and then ſtriking him, in jeſting inhumanitie they aske, who ſtrikes him. Whiles Chriſt is thus condemned, Peter is examined, and ſtraight commits an eaſie deniall of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: and ſtraight the Cocke crowes, but yet not lowd enough to awake his guilt. Hee is perſecuted againe, and too wretchedly ſweares an ignorance. A third tempter vexes him, being both an accuſer and a witneſſe; and this is Malchus his couſin, whoſe eare Peter had cut off: which makes Peter feare more then the proportion of the Iewiſh Law, an eare for an eare. He ſuſpects that this eare will bring in danger his whole head. And hauing but one euaſion, though worſe then his entrance, he wiſhes himſelfe accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if he knowes our Sauiour: when, alas, he knowes that he were accurſed, if hee did not know him. And now the Cocke, as if inſtructed to our Sauiour's propheſie, in his juſt time crowes the ſecond time; with the repeated diligence of his wing and voice not more awaking himſelfe, then the heauy memory of Peter's conſcience, which thus
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4372:16"/>
raiſed before day, makes him vnderſtand and bewaile his night of ſinne; nor does hee more haſten out of doores, then doe the teares out of his eyes. Where marke the apt degrees, as of his fault, ſo of his ſorrow. The haſt of his repentance begg'd pardon for his deniall: the teares of his repentance begg'd pardon for his oath: the bitterneſſe of his repentance beg'd pardon for his curſe. But now the Iewes are not auoiding, but prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a greater curſe: and as ſoone as it is day, in ſteed of ſeeing to correct their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by night, they confirme it; leading our Sauiour from this Cleargy-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Secular execution. When behold the mercy of treaſon! Iudas has a minde to bee godly! and ſeeing his maſter condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Caiaphas, he is with a ſwifter judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condemned by conſcience. Now hee repents him of his bargaine: and as if hee could as eaſily haue beene rid of his guilt, as of his hire, he brings backe the money that would not be put to vſe, and though it were fearefully refuſed, in the preſence and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God hee throwes it downe, flying from it as the Prieſts would haue done from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4372:17"/>
death; and indeed it was the wages of ſinne. His ſinne now does acknowledge it ſelfe and our Sauiour's innocency. This loyall Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betrayes his treaſon. And would you not thinke that now againe hee hath almoſt vn-Iudas'd himſelfe? ſhall not Iudas alſo now againe bee among the Apoſtles? Does he not ſeeme practiſed in the order of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? He grieues, he confeſſes, he reſtores. O, would hee ſtay heere! but, Loe, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the temple &amp; the God of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: he departs and hangs himſelfe. He that is couetous fals into temptation, and the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Deuill. Hee hangs himſelfe, and breakes aſunder; What could you looke for leſſe, but that the Dragon ſhould breake with the pitch-ball? You may remember he conceiued a ſop, and now behold hee brings forth a Deuill, and thus by the riddle of damnation hee is both the childe and parent of the Deuill. Hee breakes aſunder, and is deliuered of his bowels. It was the wit of juſtice, hee ſhould loſe his bowels, that had loſt his compaſſion. But ſince Iudas hath left vs, let vs leaue him: and from this ſpectacle of juſtice got ſee our Sauiour the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4372:17"/>
ſpectacle of injuſtice, trauelling from Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas to Pilate, and from Pilate to Herod. This was a Iew of a delicate Atheiſme: who, in a reprobate joy and phanſie, had a moſt intentiue deſire to ſee a fine miracle or two. But his impietie was ſeuerely delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſilence of our Sauiour; which changing the tyrants curioſitie into ſcorne, he returnes him to Pilate, clad in a garment of ridiculous honour and ſimplicitie. But Pilate deſirous to free him, not ſo much by the mercy as the cuſtome of the Iewes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to the eaſie choice of their pardon, Ieſus and Barabbas a murtherer; and whiles they are heere at their deliberation, as he on the judgement-ſeate, behold his loue is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by feare. His wife prompted to compaſſion not by a bribe, but by a dreame; ſends to her husband to warne rather then requeſt him to deſiſt from judgement; the trouble of a viſion hauing frightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed her: and ſure this was the beſt counſaile ſhee ere tooke of her pillow. But the people poſſeſſed with the Prieſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Barabbas; which was an impious, yet a fit requeſt: for could there bee an apt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4372:18"/>
fellowſhip then of a murtherer with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers? As for Ieſus, as if they would cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him twice, they twice cry-out, Crucifie him, Crucifie him. Is now the voice of the people the voice of God? Sure we are, that the voice of this people is the voice of their Prieſts; by whom Pilate being conquered yeelds-vp our Sauiour vnto ſouldiers, who multiply ſcourges vpon him, as they doe ſinnes and plagues vpon themſelues; as if their madneſſe would whip his diuinitie out of him, making it aſhamed to ſtay in ſo torne a carcaſſe. But, O you Souldiers, how ſhall you wiſh, that a happy palſie had made faint your hands? And, O thou Lord of glory, how hath thy mercy wooed thy God-head vnto this ignominious patience? O Lord of mercy, we are ſcarce more ſaued by the power of thy mercy, then confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the wonder of it: the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a world being a cheaper loſſe, then the leaſt effuſion of thy redeeming bloud! Yet the mercileſſe ſouldiers beyond this crueltie ſcornfully clothe him with a Purple Robe; though their crueltie in this had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented their ſcorne his innocent bloud clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4372:18"/>
him with a nobler purple. But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the art of crucifying they had no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated torment for the head, by the increaſe of inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion they inlarge their ſcience of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fixing on his head a crowne of thornes; and thus, as if he had a diſtinct ſoule in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, they diſtinctly murder euery part. And is not now the Lilly verily among the thornes? This tender head of our beloued enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed with the affliction of a crowne! A crowne neither of gold, nor Roſes! Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of honour, nor pleaſure! Behold, a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruit! The Lord planted a Vineyard, and when he comes to gather grapes, he receiues thornes! They abuſe his hand with a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reede; his hand the power whereof was the ſcepter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that their mouthes might ſinne more then in wordes, they ſpit vpon him. But their owne darke eyes had more need to be touched with our Sauiours purging ſpittle. For had they ſeene what they had done, they would not haue ſpit vpon the Lord of glory! This affecting ſpectacle ſoftens Pilate; and by an errour of humanitie taking Iewes to be men, and that their eyes peraduenture might mooue their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4372:19"/>
hearts, he preſents him to them with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of compaſſion, Behold the man! But, alas, Pilate, can any man behold this man? Will not all eyes bee ſooner blinded with gratefull teares? Or how can they heere behold a man? A man loſt in his owne bloud! Which ſtriues as much to obſcure his body, as his body his God-head! Yet the vnmooued Iewes with broad eyes of crueltie gaze vpon him. And ſhall wee yet thinke Deuealion's people a fable? Sure theſe children were raiſed vnto Abraham from ſtones! And now they are ſo readie to crucifie Chriſt, that they are ready alſo to condemne Pilate, not fearing to pronounce him a hypotheticall Traytour, if hee does not crucifie Chriſt. Wherefore through the conqueſt and policie of ambition he thinkes at once to ſatisfie the Iewes and God, ſo to ſecure his eſtate and conſcience. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the people hee takes water and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes his hands, proteſting himſelfe innocent from this innocent bloud.

               </gap> beloued Barabbas to their pardon, and Chriſt to their croſſe which now he beares, as afterward it beares him. But in this trauaile toward mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, his ſtrength is leſſe then the burden: and needs muſt it be a heauie croſſe, which was laden with a world of ſinnes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haſten the execution, not to eaſe our Sauiour, they make one Simon carry the weight of the croſſe: our Sauiour yet carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight of the ſinnes. Happy Simon now eaſes Chriſt of his burden: but Chriſt hereafter will eaſe Simon of his burden. Whiles he goes on, a multitude of women, forgetting to be Iewes, beſtow teares vpon him: whom he exhorts to thrift of ſorrow; bidding them ſtay their lamentation till a time of lamentation for themſelues, and for their children: whoſe bloud ſhall bee made as cheape as their mothers teares, when in the vengeance and ſport of ſlaughter, the curſe of barreneſſe, and a dry pap ſhall bee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4372:20"/>
a bleſſing. At laſt they bring this Catholique ſacrifice to mount Caluary, to the altar of the world: where euery part of him is ſtretcht-out, as the free embleme of his extended mercy. They faſten him to his croſſe with violence: but hee was faſtned ſurer by his owne loue. They pierce his hands and his feete with nayles but his heart with their ingratitude; thus is hee vſed in the houſe of his friends! They exalt him on his croſſe, arming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt himſelfe, and making his owne weight his owne affliction. And now I muſt cry-out with Pilate, Behold the man, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the triumph of redemption vpon the Cherub of the croſſe! Or if your tender eyes haue not the hearts to ſee this ſpectacle, yet reade the title of his croſſe, and ſure the firſt word, Ieſus, may comfort you. Yet if the remembrance of his name ſhould proue the remembrance of his ſorrow, where will you then, alas, beſtow your eyes? If you looke away, you ſhall ſee thoſe that paſſe by the way, nod their heads at him: if you looke on the ground, you ſhall ſee the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſouldiers at lots for his intire Coate; which they more reſpect, then they doe

Chriſt: if you looke among the company, you ſhall ſee the vnhallowed Prieſts propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him: if you looke on either ſide his croſſe, you ſhall ſee a thiefe made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Whereof one, as if he were his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, crucifies him with blaſphemie; though the other crucifies his owne vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and by a new theft ſteales Heauen at his execution. If yet you cannot behold our Sauiour, behold his Diſciple and his mother, whom from his croſſe he himſelfe beholds. Saint Iohn's loue had now made a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his flight, by conquering his feare to this returne and ſorrow. Our Sauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his beloued Iohn, and hauing nothing left that is his owne but his mother, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathes her vnto him. But, it may be, you are as little able alſo to looke on theſe, who alſo are crucified with the paſſion of loue. If then you cannot at all indure theſe ſights, be indulgent to lamentation: Let teares ſeaze on your eyes, as an vniuerſall darkneſſe does on Iudea. The guilt of the Iewes puts out the Sunne: and yet this huge night which can hide all Iudea, cannot hide the guilt of the Iewes. O how they ſhall hereafter wiſh

that this darkneſſe had beene more ſpeedy, that it might haue preuented or excuſed their violence? Then happily they would haue pleaded, O had we ſeene what we did, wee would not haue crucified the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In this forc'd night and agony, this man of ſorrowes cries out with a voice as ſtrong as earneſt, his fainting humanitie begging aide and releaſe. Thus long they haue affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his outward-parts, and now their wit finds a deuice to torment his inward alſo. In a drouth of combat and torment, hee cries-out, I thirſt: and when from this his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard he might looke for wine, behold they vilely ſpunge him with vngratefull vineger. Being perſecuted thus with a ſwift ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of plagues, in a free obedience he bowes his head, and in the Empire of his Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and loue, is pleaſed to die, giuing to the juſtice of his Father, for a redeeming ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, his troubled ſpirit. Corrupt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers who now for a long time haue anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the world with a magique ſoule, may in this truth bury their errour, and now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that only this is the ſoule of the world. Thus they haue crucified him: and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4372:22"/>
now they ſhall know whom they haue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. The Iewes and the Deuils ſhall know that it was the Lord of glory; and the whole world ſhall know that it was the Lord of glory. Behold an angry miracle teares the vaile of the Temple, and by a greater my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery reueales their myſteries. Behold an earth-quake ſhakes open the graues; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſurrection of this firſt-borne of the dead, the glad carcaſſes by the returne of their diſacquainted ſoules can no more then their ſoules endure the Graue. Behold the ſtones cleaue aſunder, as if violated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would lend them mouthes to cry-out againſt the Iewes; or as if they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce themſelues of a ſofter tempter, then the hearts of men. And now there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious earth-quake in the heart of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion: from whoſe inſpired mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a voice articulated by faith and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; pronouncing the innocence and diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Ieſus; and euen the Iewes doe ſmite their breaſts, as if their hands inſteed of repentance, ſhould ſoften their hearts. But his friends neereſt to him in affection, ſtand afarre off: to whom it is a death not to dye

with him. And indeed none of them did die by martyrdome; the Lord counting the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſpectacle equall vnto it. His friends ſtand afarre off: yet farther from comfort, then from him. O how may wee imagine his tender mother weepes? How may we imagine ſhe now cryes-out, O my ſonne Ieſu, O Ieſu, my ſonne, my ſonne! This is a more wounding lamentation, then the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Megiddon; when the good Ioſias, when the beloued Ioſias fell vnder the ſword, of Pharaoh. Now the ſouldiers come to examine the execution to ſee if theſe, the late priſoners of the Iewes, be now become the priſoners of death: and finding the two theeues breathing ſtill, in the cuſtome of vaine crueltie on malefactors, they breake their legges: when, alas, their ſoules were readier to runne away, then their is bodies But, to our Sauiour, being already dead, they are pleaſed to ſhew a negatiue mercy. Yet one to prooue himſelfe more ſenſleſſe then what he wounds, now pierces his ſide: as if beyond the expulſion of his ſoule, he would not leaue in him the forme of a carcaſſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4372:23"/>
When behold, an inſtructing myſterie flowes from his ſide. Water flowes out, as if it would preſent vnto the ſouldier the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of our Sauiour: bloud flowes out, as if it would preſent vnto the ſoul ther the admoniſhing horrour of his owne guilt. It was vile, to wrong the innocent: it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane to abuſe the dead: but it was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable to violate the Lord of glory. But the glory of this Lord ſhall now diſpell this night of ſorrow. Now weepe not, that hee died: but rejoyce that hee died for you. It was his loue that hee would redeeme, as it was his power that he could redeeme. So he did redeeme, as be did ſuffer, hee ſuffered not in his diuine nature; but by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>emed not in his diuine nature; but by the union of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature. For from a double nature his myſticall vnitie did ariſe: and as his ſoule was a diuinitie to his body; ſo was his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie a ſoule to his humanity. To create man, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reathed a ſpirit like himſelfe into him; him to redeeme man, God himſelfe entred into him; and though the diuinitie could not hee crucified; yet was the vnion of it

with the paſſion of the humanitie, counted as the paſſion of the diuinitie. Thus by the bountie of interpretation, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proprieties, they verily crucified the Lord of glory. Whoſe carcaſſe now as cold as death raiſes a flame of loue in the breaſts of Ioſeph and Nicodemus. Ioſeph in a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Chriſtianitie goes vnto Pilate, and begges the body. When Chriſt was aliue, Iudas ſould him; and now he is dead, Pilate giues him away; whoſe body though it were preſerued by the diuinitie, yet Nicodemus ſweetens it with Myrrhe and Deuotion. They wrap him in a linnen cloth, not ſo much concealing his nakedneſſe, as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his innocence. They lay him in Ioſephs Tombe, which was in a garden; and was not then this garden Paradiſe? It was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſepulchre; as if, by the propheſie of loue, it had been proportioned to the gueſt. Whoſe bodie being heere entertayned with magnificent pietie, his illuſtrious ſoule for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a triumph in Hell, crucifies the Deuill, and ouerthrowes the tyranny of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He does not take away damnation, but contract it. And now you ſee, after this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

of our Sauiour, you may like Thomas put your hand and faith into the wound of his ſide, &amp; receiue ſaluation. You may behold the opening mouth of this wound, which with eloquent bloud inuites you to faith and loue. You may behold the Lord of glory comming from Edom, with his died garments from Boſrah. This is the Lord of glory: glorious in his apparell: glorious in his nakedneſſe: glorious in his mightineſſe to ſaue. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparell, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the Wine-fat? Thou haſt trodden the Wine-preſſe alone, and of the people there was none with thee. O, what did cauſe theſe ſoundings of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards vs? Who can expreſſe thy ſorrowes, and thy louing-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards vs? Who can expreſſe what thou haſt done for our ſoules? Thou waſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, thou waſt deſpiſed, thou waſt whipt, wounded, bruiſed, condemned, ſacrificed for our ſoules; thou waſt made a ſeruant of death, thou waſt numbred with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, thou madeſt thy graue with the wicked for our ſoules. Wherefore God has
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4372:25"/>
highly exalted thee, and giuen thee a name aboue all names; that at the Name of Ieſus euery knee ſhall bow; of things in Heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth; And euery tongue ſhall confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord of glory; And the foure and twentie Elders ſhall fall downe before the Lambe, with their Harps and golden Vials full of Odours; and in their new Song ſhall they prayſe thee; And the Angels about thy throne, euen ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands ſhall ſay with a loud voice, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is the Lambe that was ſlaine, to receiue power, and riches, and wiſedome, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory. Therefore with Angels and Arch-angels, and with all the company of Heauen, wee laude and magnifie thy glorious Name; euermore prayſing thee and ſaying; Holy, holy, holy Lord of glory, Heauen and earth are full of thy glory, and of thy mercies. The Angels in Heauen wonder at thy mercies: the powers of Hell tremble at thy mercies: thou thy ſelfe triumpheſt in thy mercies: and the ſonnes of men rejoyce in thy mercies.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4372:25"/>
Wherefore, O thou that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world, deliuer vs: by thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie and bloudie ſwear, by thy croſſe and paſſion, by thy precious death and buriall deliuer vs; And wee will fall downe before thy glorie: and we will ſing praiſes vnto thy mercie: and we will triumph in the victorie of thy bloud: and we will for euer euen for euer acknowledge, that, Thou the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord of glorie art the Chriſt of God, and the Ieſus of men.</p>

His mercie had before beſtowed many vpon others: but now his power tries one vpon himſelfe. His diuinitie acts a miracle vpon his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; repairing this ſecond Trinitie of his perſon from the immortall ruines of a God, a ſoule, and a carcaſſe. Three dayes did hee conſecrate for the performance of this wonder: and three dayes doe wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate for the perſwading to this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which ſhould haue beene the joy, and was the ſhame of the Apoſtles: who were ſlow to apprehend it, though Chriſt was their Schoole-maſter. They had not as yet learned their owne Creed: which, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe ſenſe was pleaſed to bee taught, not ſo much by our Sauiour, as by his ſepulchre: whoſe opening mouth, when it ſent forth Chriſt the Word, pronounced his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the Epitaph of God.

Angell: and though it cannot, as the multitude of Tombes, with the voice and conqueſt of proud Death, tell vs whom it does captiue; yet does it remember to vs, whom it did. Which aſſumed triumph of death, is as ſhort as its combat. Ioſeph's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion beſtowed this Tombe vpon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; but our Sauiours victorie beſtowed it vpon death: which, ſince his Reſurrection, has lien buried in his tombe. But can a dead man bee warmed againe into life? And can the lungs that haue forgot to breathe, learne to breathe againe? Faith indeed can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this with as much eaſe as ſpeed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honoured with an imitating omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, can with a coequall extenſion of aſſent apply it ſelfe to the number and degrees of Gods actions. But, as hard it was to raiſe the faith, as the body, of Saint Thomas: nay, it was his body, that cauſed him to beleeue the Reſurrection of Chriſt's bodie; which was a way of faith, more certaine then grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Yet muſt the vnderſtanding bee ſo rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, before it can beleeue that the bodie can bee raiſed; that the diuine indulgence does gradually chaſtize the difficultie by the length of inſtruction. For ſcarce had man
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4372:28"/>
viewed the materials of his Creation, when ſtraight hee was practised vnto an eſſay of this ſecond Creation. When Adam deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſleepe, there was a Reſurrection of his rib, which awaked into a woman. Did not mortalitie then put on immortalitie, when a ſenſeleſſe bone was ſo endued with reaſon, that it could apprehend its owne preferment? Mee thinkes, the Chymique might hence extract an eaſie Rhetorique for his promotion of metalls; and, without an Apologie, teach that vſurie of art, And heere too, was an imployed legacie, a woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to time, to multiply reſurrections. Which yet were almoſt reduced to a deſpaire by her degenerating Nephewes: whoſe crimes had forſworne or ſcorned the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their bodies, and did more ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme them then the floud. Yet then looke vpon Noah with joy, as the Lord did with fauour; and when the olde and the new World were diſtinguiſhed and continued but by an Iſthmus, from Noah's wife the Arke of mankind, ſee a new reſurrection of man; and from his floud a reſurrection of the world. But will you ſee a raiſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4372:29"/>
death or ſleepe? Behold Iſaac as neere the ſtroke as the hand of his father, ariſing from his Funerall pile; and at this reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too there was an Angell remoouing though not a Tombe-ſtone, yet a Knife more exorable then the ſword which the Angell in Paradiſe did ſhake; whoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning edge was as deuouring as its flame. But heere was a ſacrifice offered, yet not ſlaine: and though not ſlaine yet accepted. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture it will more gratefully frighten you to ſee a man taught to bee buried aliue, and more yet, to liue after his buriall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then Ioſeph from the tombe of his priſon riſing vnto a triumph as eminent as his innocencie: which had before conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his paſſion, and now his affliction. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in Ioſeph the myſticall bodie of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; a body admirably mortall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible; a body that ſuffered rather the graue then death. And will any man now count it ſuch a wonder to ſee the fetters fall-off from Peter; when they had learned the religion from his Maſters winding-ſheete, which fell at his feet when hee aroſe? But if the eye and courage of your faith will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

farther, and ſee the actiue horrour of a graue, behold Ionas his quicke tombe made a tombe of ſaluation to him. Three of our dayes hee lay ſtruggling in his new night of amazement, as if he had found an Aegypt in the Whale, and did acknowledge that watry Purgatory. At laſt the graue by a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction caſt-vp the liuing. The Whale was no more a Sepulchre, but a fiſh; and Ionas no longer a coarſe, but a Prophet. Hee had ſurely died, if hee had not beene buried. And heere was a reſurrection, though not a reuiuing; a reſurrection from diſobedience and the Whale. Thus this rare An'choret and his tombe were both aliue: but the tombe of our Sauiour was as deſperate as death. What could be expected from a graue and a carcaſſe? Yet behold this carcaſſe reuiue into a man; nay, into a God! And I may rightly ſay, behold: for he did riſe, that wee ſhould behold him; and at that time wherein we might behold him. He roſe, when night riſes into morning, and at this pregnant ſeaſon, when winter is quickned into the ſpring. Now did the day-ſpring viſit vs from the graue. It was on the firſt day of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4372:30"/>
Iewes weeke, a weeke well begunne; and is was the firſt day of the Chriſtian Creation. If you will turne ouer the notes of time, you may beleeue that Pharaoh, as on that day of the yeere, was inuaded by an hoſt of waues, which conquering his Chariots, made him without wheeles hurrie faſter vnto Hell; Whiles Moſes led his Iſrael through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of the Sea, paſſing from the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death in that monument of waters. Did not our Lord alſo leaue his tombe with an equall and contrary wonder? Then were the waters made firme, riſing into Alpes; as now the earth was made to quake like the waters; And well might it tremble, when the Lord conquered it and forſooke it. The Angell too made a little earth-quake in the graue, when he remoued the mightie ſtone: with which the vaine few tryed to oppreſſe our Sauiour after death; as it he would haue ſealed him vp, to an impoſſibilitie of reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But ſince the Angell has opened the tombe for vs, ſhall we goe ſee the place, whence Chriſt is riſen? And yet wee ſhall not make ſuch haſt, but that the ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the two Maries will bee there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

vs: whoſe feete were as ſwift as their loue, and their loue as time; nay, more ſwift then time, which hindred them by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and command of their Sabbath. A Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it was, but only of their bodies, which, whiles our Sauiour lay buried, were but the ſepulchres of their ſoules; their ſoules, that found no Sabbath, till they found the Lord. They came with prepared ſpices and oyntments for him, whoſe diuinitie did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent Balme, and eſteemed their pietie of a more precious ſweetneſſe, then their oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But will you ſee this loue languiſh into feare, and this feare againe ſtrengthned into joy? They are no ſooner in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, but that they find it as empty of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as it was full of wonder; and inſteed of the body of the Lord they behold the Angell of the Lord ſitting vpon the ſtone, which he had conquered to obedience; as if hee meant to reſt himſelfe in triumph, after the conflict of his miracle. His rayment was white as ſnow, which he did imitate in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and deſcent. His countenance was like lightning, or more wonderfull: for, that is of ſo inſtant a terrour, that it is the object
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4372:31"/>
rather of our memory, then our eye; but this with courteous majeſtie was patient to be beheld. The women with the dutie of feare beheld it; being quickly encouraged by the angell, but firſt by their innocence. The ſouldiers beheld it too, though with ſuch guiltie faintneſſe, that they ſeemed to ſtriue as much to ſhame their ſexe, as their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: being at once almoſt diſarmed of their weapons and ſoules. They became as dead men, and were rather the priſoners, then the keepers of the graue. But in the meane time, the angell comforts and inſtructs the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who now are his Diſciples; and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commiſſion to preach the reſurrection of our Sauiour to the Diſciples of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, they haſte out of the Tombe, with the confuſed expedition of feare and joy. Was not this a ſtrange pilgrimage to runne from the ſepulchre of our Lord! But it was yet more ſtrange; they ſeeke the Diſciples, and find Chriſt. It was a comfortable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake! And indeed hee did comfort them with his preſence and ſpeech; When imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they fall on their knees, at his knees, in loue &amp; worſhip holding him by the feet.

O how glorious are the feet of the Lord of the Goſpell! The Goſpell of whoſe reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection theſe female Euangeliſts are againe ſent to teach; and the firſt ſchollers which they muſt teach, muſt be Chriſt's Diſciples. When, to ſhew their obedience to be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as their loue, they depart euen from Chriſt to their dutie; and ſpeedily find Peter and Iohn for their auditours. Heere was zeale and tenderneſſe; the fierceſt and the mildeſt of the Apoſtles; as if they had beene left together to temper one another. And theſe no ſooner heare the newes, but ſtraight they runne as faſt to the tombe, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did runne from it. Iohn came firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: but Peter went firſt into it; Loue was ſwifteſt; but zeale boldeſt. When they are entred, they find Chriſt's victory acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the linnen clothes, his ſpoiles of death; and theſe ſpoiles too had beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided; the napkin of his head being laid by it ſelfe. It ſeemes, the angell at our Sauiour's reſurrection attended to bee a witneſſe of it to the women, and leaue a witneſſe of it to the Diſciples. Thus, that he was not ſtolne away, appeares by the inconuenience and

leiſure of his vndreſſing, and by the method of the linnen: which the frightened policie of the ſouldiers did no more touch, then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, and they no more obſerued it, then did the women: who after the ſight of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, had their eyes as much amazed as their minds. The ſouldiers too did more tremble then watch: but the Diſciples had leſſe feare and more time; beſides, they learned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which they were not taught; and could now teach the women this newes of the graue. But did hee riſe but from the graue? This is the newes but of his bodie; yes, hee did riſe alſo from the damned, who are dead too, as much in judgement as to nature; Though ſome are as vnwilling to haue Chriſt deſcend into Hell, as to goe thither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and in a dangerous Brachygraphie write the Creed ſo ſhort, that without the commiſſion of an Index Expurgatorius, they quite leaue out the article of the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But, what an vnmannerly ingratitude is this, to accept of Chriſt's benefits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his wonders?

The arch-angell conquered the Deuill in Heauen; and now God conquers him in his owne Empire, and makes his Empire his Dungeon! Wee ouercome the Deuill by flight; but God by inuaſion. Yet who would not ſtand amazed to ſee God with the Deuill? Had the Manichie beene now, hee might heere at once haue behold both his Princes Mee thinkes, our Sauiour now turned Sampſon's Riddle into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, which hee expounded and fulfilled. Did not out of the eater come forth meate, and out of the ſtrong came there not ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; when from the jawes of Hell by Chriſt came forth ſaluation? Now whiles the ſoule of our Sauiour was triumphant in Hell, his bodie was obedient in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre: his diuinitie being as his ſoule, till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his ſoule, and made the whole Chriſt change an age of three and thirtie yeeres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

eternitie. Loe, heere is the Lion of the Tribe of Iudah, whoſe almightie ſtrength vouchſafed to couch vnder the power of the graue; and, Loe, the glorious indignation of his loue, has rouzed him vp againe from the ſloth of death! Will you behold how hee was raiſed? behold how the potter workes vpon the wheele: he takes clay; he makes it a veſſell; and this veſſell being marred in the hand of the potter, he makes it againe, as hee beſt pleaſes; Chriſt was immortall clay, and earth purer then Heauen! When, by the wonder of omnipotency, the Creator and the creature were made into one; and of one matter did conſiſt both the potter and his pot! From this broken clay there did ariſe the ſame, and a renewed Chriſt! That hee roſe in the earneſt of a body, his owne mouth did teſtifie, when hee ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; proouing it by the authoritie of food, which he did eate with his Diſciples. Could any man in this point be yet an infidell? If any could, ſee how he conuerts them; Hee lets Thomas diſgrace himſelfe to a beliefe, and by his diſtruſt mercifully and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly increaſe his faith! Can any doubt that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4372:33"/>
hee was renewed in a bodie of glory, when he was full of God? Know you not that his body was indeed the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt? Was hee not renewed in a body of glory, whom the doores that were ſhut, when hee entred to his Diſciples, did obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acknowledge to be the King of glory? And though hee were patient vnder death three dayes, yet ſince the firſt part of the firſt was ſpent before he died, and the laſt part of the laſt, after hee reuiued; there was the number, but not the length of three dayes; and thus hee made ſo ſhort a change ſeeme rather a ſleepe then a death. And, O, but to conſider heere, as well the wonder as the change! Doe but imagine, that in the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning birth of the morning, you ſaw the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of a graue emulating the morning: a coarſe riſing with more comfort and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then the Sunne: a winding-ſheet falling away as an empty cloud: the feet and hands ſtriuing which ſhall firſt recouer motion; the hands helping to raiſe the body; the feet hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to beare both the body and the hands: the tongue ſo eloquent, that it can tell you, it can ſpeake againe: the eares ſo pure, that

they can perceiue the ſilence of the graue: the eyes looking forth of their Tombes, as if they were glad to ſee their owne reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Would you not bee as much affrighted, as inſtructed with this power of a God? Would you not be turned into very coarſes, to ſee this liuing coarſe! Would you not be ſtrucke as pale, as the winding-ſheet you looked-vpon? But, when all this ſhall bee done, as well in mercy, as in majeſtie: as well to raiſe you to a hope of eternall life, as to ſtrike you with a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of a temporall death: as well to make you like vnto God, as to make you know you are yet not like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him: O, how will you then at ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion diſſolue with compaſſion; as if you would haſten to the like reſurrection! How will you then kiſſe thoſe hands, which, before you feared? How will you then with ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt eyes examine and adore the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that body, which is the hope and cauſe of the reſurrection of our bodies! For therefore did hee raiſe himſelfe, that hee might raiſe vs, and ſo become the firſt-fruites of them that ſleepe. But ſhall wee riſe too? and ſhall duſt againe bee taken-vp, and breathed on? Shall euery
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4372:36"/>
man by this ſecond Adam be made as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, as the firſt Adam? And yet ſhall we want faith, when God wants not power? Or, ſhall we thinke it harder to vnite the bodie and ſoule, then to make them? It were an impious diſcourteſie to deny that to God, which God denied not vnto his ſeruant. Did not the widow of Zarephah, thus receiue a ſonne by Elias, who yet was neither the father of it, nor the God? Nay, did not his ſeruant doe more for the Shunamite, to whom hee promiſed a ſonne before hee was conceiued, and reſtored him after hee was dead? Nay, did not the bones of this Eliſha giue life to one, that was as dead as themſelues; teaching him to confeſſe the mercie of a graue? It is eſpecially an act of the mercie of the liuing God to giue life to the dead: yet by a greater mercie hee makes it an act of his iuſtice; freely binding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to admit our boldneſſe, not ſo much to to requeſt as to claime a reſurrection? For ſhall the bodies of the Saints bee more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by their tombs, then by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? or ſhall they bee worſe oppreſſed with death, then they were with their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4372:37"/>
or ſhall their ſoules with an enuious inequalitie vſurpe and enioy the purchaſe of their bodies? ſhall thoſe eyes, whoſe deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did ſtill watch or mourne, for euer want reſpect as much as ſight? ſhall thoſe hands, that haue been free in extending themſelues and mercie to the poore, be for euer bound by the ingratitude of death? ſhall thoſe knees that haue bowed with ſuch willing reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, bee ſo held downe by the violence of mortalitie, that they ſhall neuer riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Where are then thy teares O Dauid, if thy eyes ſhall not enioy the happineſſe of their owne ſorrow? Where are then, O Iob, thy faith and patience, if thy body bee now as much without hope, as it was before without reſt? Where are then, O Eſay, thy victorious ſufferings, if after the ignorant furie of the Saw, and the ſchiſme of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, thy bodie ſuffer a wilder diſſociation from thy ſoule for tedious eternitie? Where are thy trauels then, O Paul, if after thy Chriſtian Geographie, and conqueſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme, thou lieſt for euer confined to the dull peace of a graue? No; the almightie, which made man with ſuch wiſdome of art,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4372:37"/>
wil neither loſe his glory, nor his worke; But, as he made his greater heauen for his angels, ſo made he the leſſer and mortall heauen of mans bodie for his ſoule, and will make it as eternall as his ſoule. There is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of workmanſhip in the ſoule: but more varietie in the bodie. The ſoule does more truly expreſſe God: but the bodie more eaſily. The ſoule judges beſt: but the bodie firſt; and though the eye of the ſoule does behold the works of God more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: yet does the eye of the bodie behold them more properly. Nay, ſhould the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die not bee raiſed to life and heauen, how great a part of heauen and that life would be loſt, whiles not enjoyed, and be as vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as it is wonderfull? God hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded joyes, which the eye hath not ſeene, nor the eare heard; but, which the eye ſhall ſee, and the eare ſhall heare, and without the pleaſure of a traunce, for euer poſſeſſe, as much without errour, as without meaſure. Such honour will the Creatour of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies doe to the bodies of his Saints; they ſhall acknowledge corruption, but ouercome it: they may in their journy be the gheſts of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4372:38"/>
the graue: but at laſt they ſhall bee the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Heauen. Yet the Lord cannot hereafter ſo much honour humane fleſh by rayſing it, as hee has already by aſſuming it. It was before his ſeruant, but now his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. That was a reſurrection of the fleſh, when it was rayſed vnto God: but the only reſurrection of our fleſh is, when it is rayſed to the ſoule. At the day of judgement, though there ſhall be no marriages of ſexes, yet there ſhall be of parts: when ſoules ſhall be vnited to bodies in ſo intire and inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a matrimony, that it ſhall admit no hope nor feare of a diuorce. Neither need wee feare, in the jealouſie of this match, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble parentage of the fleſh: ſince what it wants in birth is ſupplied in dowry; and fleſh is now become ſuch refined earth, being made wonderfull in ſhape and office, that the ſoule may be thought to be ſcarce more noble, but that it ſeemes more reſerued, by being inuiſible. And yet you may obſerue the bodies emulation: which fals before its reſurrection, into ſuch atomes of duſt, that they are with as much difficulty to be ſeene as to bee numbred. But, notwithſtanding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4372:38"/>
that theſe principles of earth be thus diuided among themſelues, yet are they not diuided againſt themſelues, retayning ſtill though not an appetite, yet an obedience to reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; Nature has not loſt this, and God will ſupply that; and as eaſily vnite as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh each duſt. To yeild to this truth, is the Creed of the Creed. If therefore any man's faith in the aſſent to this myſterie, ſhould bee as weake as his reaſon, hee may helpe both his reaſon and his faith, by his ſenſe: by which they ſhall either be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or perſwaded. If you will bee but as bold as antiquitie, you may propoſe vnto your ſelues the ſolemne Poetry of the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, a creature rarer then the reſurrection, though not as admirable: in whoſe aſhes you may find the fire of life, expecting but to be fanned to the reſurrection of a flame; as if this creature by the myſtery of death, would by a fire both periſh and reuiue! But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the courteſie of ſuppoſition, you may in earneſt behold the Eagle ſhoot-forth new quils: wherewith may bee written and teſtified his endeauour of immortality. Thus does God teach nature how to teach vs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4372:39"/>
and without the Magicall ſtudie of the language of birds, to vnderſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their voice, their ſecret inſtruction. But peraduenture you wil think, that to diſcerne this truth in the nature of the Eagle, will require a ſight as ſharpe as the Eagle's; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue then your eye from the foules of the aire, but to the trees wherein they neſt; and with a negligent view you may obſerue, how after the nakedneſſe and death of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they bud afreſh into life and beautie. Yet why ſhould we in the ſloth of this eaſie contemplation ſtudie ſo broad an object? Let our eye with more gratefull induſtrie confine its proſpect to the ſmall ſeed of corne; and at leaſt take the paines to ſee the paines of the husbandman. And ſhall wee not admire at the delightfull arithmetique of nature, to behold a ſeed, whoſe hope ſeemes as ſmall as it ſelfe, by being caſt away, to bee found; by deſtruction to receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and from the ſame furrow to haue both a buriall and a birth! Thus then we ſee that the body is able to ſhew that it ſelfe may riſe: but now the ſoule will proue that it muſt; and with ſuch friendly eloquence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4372:39"/>
helpe its firſt companion, that by the vnion of loue, it will preuent the reſurrection. For, ſhould the ſoule for euer want the body, ſhould it not want both perfection &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Is not the ſoule moſt perfect, when it is moſt noble? and is it not moſt noble, when it is moſt bountifull? and is it not moſt bountifull, when it giues life to the dead? Is it not likewiſe moſt full of wonder, when it is thus perfect in that which is imperfect? when it mixes with corruption, and yet is incorrupt? when it is moſt burthened, and yet moſt variouſly actiue? Thus, by this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inclination of the ſoule, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is as naturall in reſpect of the vnion, as it is aboue nature in reſpect of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But now ſee the curious zeale of the ſoule; It will not only haue a body againe, but in a preciſe ſocietie it will haue only its owne againe. For the preſeruing therefore of ſuch numericall identitie, there ſhall bee wonderfully reſtored the ſubſtantiall vnion, which is but formally diſtinguiſhed from the parts vnited. There ſhall be reſtored the perſonalitie, and laſtly the natiue tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which does containe the indiuidua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4372:40"/>
diſpoſitions, whereby ſuch a matter has a pecullar appetite to ſuch a forme. Which matter by vertue of ſuch inclination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes formally the ſame, though it may be varied by extention; as when the infant ſhall be rayſed into a man, the perſon ſhall bee enlarged, but not multiplyed. But the vnruly wit of Philoſophie will here demand, how they ſhall riſe with their owne bodies, who when they liued, had not bodies of their owne; being not only fed with the fleſh of men, but deſcending alſo from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents nouriſhed with the like horrible diet? For, by this wild reckoning, there will bee ſuch a Genealogie of debt, that the bodie of the Nephew muſt peraduenture be paid to the great Grand-father. To which, ſome Chriſtians doe reply with as much imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent deuotion, as vnwarrantable ſubtiltie, without neceſſity attributing to Gods Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie a totall ſupply of new bodies, which, for the preſeruing the numericall i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentitie, ſhall bee endowed with the former temperature. But ſurely we ought to judge it a ſafer modeſtie, not to ſatisfie reaſon, then to offend Religion. And, ſince we muſt riſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4372:40"/>
in our old bodies without all ſophiſtrie, wee may more temperately beleeue, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſdome has decreed and prouided, that there ſhall neuer be any humane bodie, which ſhall totally conſiſt of other humane bodies; It being harſh to ſay, that the ſame body is raiſed, when there are only the ſame reproduced diſpoſitions; and as abſurd to affirme, that ſuch diſpoſitions, being the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall accidents of a former matter, ſhould be transferd vpon another. You ſee then the ſacred eagerneſſe of the ſoule; It will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſe nor change a duſt; nor will it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſe, but alſo adorne the body. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhall feele and expreſſe a youthfull ſpring: the walking-ſtaffe and the wrinkle ſhall bee no more the helpe and diſtinction of age: and death it ſelfe ſhall ſuffer clima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctericall deſtruction. O, how the wonder will almoſt out-act faith, when the infant and the dwarfe ſhall be made a proper man! When the limbes exhaled with famine, ſhall bee repleniſhed with as much miracle as fleſh! When the child that left its ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it left the wombe, ſhall in an inſtant without growth, be as bigge as the mother!
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4372:41"/>
when ſleepe ſhall bee commanded from the eye-lid, no more by care, but by immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie! which ſhall chaſe death out of nature, and with importunate triumph cry-out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the graue, O earth, earth, earth, heare the voice of the Lord! Thy dead men ſhall liue: with their primitiue bodies ſhall they ariſe: awake and ſing you that dwell in duſt: for your dew is as the dew of herbs; by which bleſſing you ſhall bee made as glorious, as fruitfull. And ſince that fruitfulneſſe is the gratitude of nature, let it remember vs as much to acknowledge as enjoy the mercie of that power by which wee riſe; And wee may moſt juſtly and eaſily remember by whom wee riſe, by remembring him, by whom we fell. Yet, if wee behold the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of their humanitie, wee ſhall find, that they were both without ſinne, and that the firſt Adam had his beſt paradiſe within himſelfe. But when hee was fallen by the weakneſſe of the woman, that was made for his helpe; neuer did woman prooue a ſtrong helpe vnto man, before the Virgin-mother of Chriſt God and man; And then, though the firſt Adam had eaten vp the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4372:41"/>
the ſecond Adam ſwallowed vp death. He had before made the poore man take vp the bed of his ſickneſſe and walke: but hee himſelfe was the firſt, that euer tooke vp the death-bed and walked. Yet ſome, before our Sauiour, borrowed a phantaſticall reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Saul's equiuocall Samuel; and ſome roſe in earneſt, but to die againe in earneſt; as ſupererogating Lazarus, that paid to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one death more then he owed. But our Lord is riſen with as much perfection as power, and with as much power as loue and glory. The Poeticall Chymiques tell vs of an Alchymiſticall man at the earth's center: who by a ſphericall diffuſion of his vertue, does like a ſubterraneous Sunne improoue metals to a metamorphoſis yet new. Which, as it is bold in the fable, ſo by a deuout my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologie may bee made modeſt in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. And this ſecret workeman ſhall be our Sauiour, whoſe vertue was ſo diſperſed into the bowels of graues, that at his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he improued carcaſſes into Saints: who were the witneſſes and attendants of his power. Indeed to aduance the head without the members were ſo vnnaturall, that it were

more like an execution then a preferment: and it were ſtranger to ſee a Leader without his ſouldiers, then without his armes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, were it fit, that when the maſter riſes, the ſeruants ſhould lie ſtill? Thus then they were raiſed; and as much to holineſſe, as to life. It was not only a reſurrection; but alſo a conſecration. Chriſt was the firſt of them that roſe, nay, he was the firſt-fruits of them. Hee had the precedence both in order and vertue. The firſt-fruits were the firſt handfull as acceptable as ripe; by a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mediation obtayning holineſſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynment for the reſt. And this firſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring did commend it ſelfe vnto the Lord ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſpeed then the quantitie. The Iew offered this at his owne home; and it was as domeſtique as his thoughts: being a preſent of eloquent ſimplicitie, which at the ſame time did honour and ouercome the Almightie! O, how our Sauiour made this figure ſolid, when at once he conquered for vs death and heauen! Hee was but the firſt handfull of corne, and yet as powerfull as ſmall: making all the reſt of a like holineſſe, though not of an equall. But there were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4372:43"/>
greater firſt-fruites, which the Iew went to pay at Ieruſalem: and as the firſt were an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of humilitie, ſo theſe of pompe: thoſe did more ſet-forth the thankfulneſſe of the labourer, and theſe the munificence of the Lord. If you will take the word of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines (whom in the ſtory of Cuſtome wee haue no more need to ſuſpect, then they had to faigne) when the husbandman carried-vp theſe fruits to the holy Citie, hee had a Bull went before him; whoſe hornes were gilded, and an Oliue garland vpon his head. This was the picture of his maſters affection and eſtate; as if by the impetuous beaſt hee would expreſſe the courage of his joy: by the gilded hornes the riches of his plentie: and by the Oliue-garland the crowne of his peace. Behold the diſplayed Heraldry of his happineſſe! And that it might bee increaſed by applauſe, a pipe played before them, to charge all to take notice of it, vntill they came to the mountaine of the Lord. Shall not theſe firſt-fruits be likewiſe payed at our great Reſurrection? ſhall they not bee brought to the heauenly Ieruſalem? ſhall they not haue Angels goe before them? ſhall
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4372:44"/>
there not bee crownes likewiſe prouided? and ſhall they not be vſhered with the voice of a trumpet? It was the ſound which the Iewes vſed at their brauer Funerals; and may it not then fitly bee vſed, when they ſhall awake againe from their tombes? Till Chriſt was riſen, thoſe that were buried were dead: but if wee once but name him the firſt-fruits of them that riſe, let vs no more ſay they were dead, but that they ſlept. Yet all before the Reſurrection ſhall not ſleepe: but ſome ſhal inſteed of riſing be only new-dreſſed, by being clothed with incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo haue rather a change of rayment, then of life. They ſhall not put-off their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but their mortalitie; and bee made like Chriſt both in the truth of the Reſurrection, and in the glory. The Eutychian ſhall then confeſſe, that the two natures in Chriſt are not mixt, though joyned; and that his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie though exalted is not changed. The Vbiquitary ſhall then ſee, that Chriſt's body may be ſeene: and it ſhall certainly prooue, that it is not euery-where, by being not in the graue, whence it is riſen. The Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean ſhall then recouer the poſſeſſion and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4372:44"/>
acquaintance of his vagabond ſoule; and the Saducy ſhall then ariſe in that body, in which he denied the reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and with his bodily eyes ſee the errour of his ſoule. Since then our Redeemer is as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in his fleſh, as in his God-head: ſince the ſouldiers feare acknowledged his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which their malice denied: ſince we muſt riſe both by his authority and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: let our riſing not only follow his, but alſo imitate it. As then the day of death and the peace of a Sabbath went before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our Lord: ſo let the crucifying of our vices, and the quiet contemplation of eternall joyes goe before the glory of the Reſurrection. So ſhall it be vnto vs, as it was vnto our Sauiour, a true Paſſeouer, who paſſed thereby from this world vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So ſhall our hope bee as certaine as our riſing: ſo ſhall our ſoules riſe as well as our bodies, in that day of wonder; When the laſt earthquake ſhall ſhake-vp death: when the oecumenicall voice of one trumpet ſhall bee lowd enough to whiſper-vp drowſie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: when looſe duſt ſhal with the warmth and moyſture of bloud bee kneaded into
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4372:45"/>
man: when the tribute of diſperſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured limbes ſhall bee paid-in from all countries and creatures: when there ſhall be a Reſurrection of diſeaſe, of ſleepe, of death, of the winding-ſheet, of the graue, of rottenneſſe; all which ſhall be purified into health, into watchfulneſſe, into life, into a robe of glory, into a throne of glory, into immortalitie: when there ſhall bee a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of earth and heauen, which ſhall be both renewed: when there ſhall bee a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of God himſelfe; whoſe glory, which ſeemed buried in this world, ſhall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly ariſe in the face of heauen &amp; earth: when there ſhall bee a new Reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus; who ſhall no more ariſe from the graue, but from heauen: when the Iew and hell ſhall tremble, &amp; thoſe wounds of glory appeare, which are the bloudie ſeales of our ſaluation! So raiſe vs then, O thou Lord of life, vnto holineſſe of life, that when theſe things ſhall come to paſſe, wee may not only riſe in judgement, but alſo ſtand in it; and in theſe bodies both behold and follow thee into thy Heauen that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body prepared for the glorified bodies
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4372:45"/>
of thy Saints; where thy crucified body ſits at the right hand of thy Father: where thy glorious company of Apoſtles praiſe thee: where thy goodly fellowſhip of Prophets prayſe thee: where thy noble armie of martyrs praiſe thee! And with their bodies, O let our bodies find a labour to be learned in Heauen, and let our ſoules euen there feele a new affliction, that whiles we cannot grieue enough that we cannot prayſe thee enough, our increaſing gratitude for our bodies reſurrection, may be our ſoule's eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:4372:47"/>FOr man to goe into Heauen, is almoſt impoſſible: for God to goe into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is impoſſible. To vnderſtand then the wonder of Chriſt's aſcenſion, we might wiſh that our ſoules could but aſcend like his bodie: which, whiles it was on the earth, receiued motion from his ſoule; but when it left the earth, receiued motion from his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie; without which, that motion can now bee no more vnderſtood, then it could then be performed. The greateſt wonder of mans bodie has beene the ſtructure: but the greateſt wonder of this bodie is now the motion. The force of mans hand can make earth aſcend towards Heauen: but only the power of God can make earth aſcend vnto Heauen. Man can raiſe earth aboue its Spheare: but only God can fixe it aboue its Spheare. This day you may ſee both theſe wonders: whiles the bodie is made as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull as the ſoule: whiles the bodie is made the wonder of the ſoule; and goes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with as much eaſe, and with more weight. And indeed Philoſophie may ſeeme to haue come ſhort at leaſt of perfection, if not of truth, whiles it has diſcouered the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4372:48"/>
of its owne ignorance, inſteed of the cauſes of aſcenſion and deſcenſion. Which now ſeeme not to bee the workes of weight and lightneſſe, but of ſinne and innocence: ſeeing that a bodie free from ſinne has lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to aſcend; and ſpirits loaden with ſinne haue ſunke themſelues from Heauen, to the puniſhment and center of ſinne. And yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence is rather a preparatiue, then a cauſe of this wonder: a bodie cannot aſcend without it; a bodie cannot aſcend by it. It has more power vpon the ſoule, then vpon the bodie: yet it has not this power vpon the ſoule. And as the ſoule cannot aſcend by the power of innocence: ſo neither can the bodie aſcend by the power of the ſoule. The ſoule can affoord vnto the bodie the motion of progreſſion, but not of aſcenſion: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion being made by the power of the ſoule, but by the parts of the bodie; and it is a kind of friendly attraction, when one foot inuites the other to a ſucceſſion of motion, by a ſucceſſion of precedencie. But the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the bodie cannot bee performed, but by ſomewhat that is aboue the bodie; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue it, not ſo much in place, as in power.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4372:48"/>
The bodie can beſtow vpon it ſelfe an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocall aſcenſion, when a part of the foote ſhall be raiſed into the ſtature of the bodie: but this is rather an aſcenſion in the bodie, then of the bodie; Nay, we cannot at all call it an aſcenſion, but by leaue; when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die has by chance an erect ſituation; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſture making it deſcend as much to the name, as to the ſimplicitie of extenſion. The foules of the aire alſo haue their aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but it is as well by the aire, as in it; and their cunning wing, which diuides the aire into away, compacts it into a helpe. Thus do they aſcend with an eaſie wonder: it being performed by the power of nature, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the power of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But for mans bodie to aſcend, without the actiuitie of a wing, aboue the actiuitie of a wing, is ſo ſtrange, that it was ſtrange euen in Chriſt's bodie; nay, it might haue beene ſtrange to his owne bodie: which had it not beene inſtructed by his diuinitie, might haue maruail'd at its owne motion; And it did no leſſe amaze Heauen then poſſeſſe it; making a great part of the Angels thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold earth, without deſcending to it. And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4372:49"/>
this bodie aſcended rather to Heauen, then to God. The Diuinitie was with it, yet did not aſcend with it: ſince it does not change place, but fill all place. His ſoule did aſcend with it; yet did rather effectually change place, then properly: whiles it did only not change that bodie, which did change place. The whole perſon did aſcend: not that the Diuinitie left any place, where the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had beene; but that it was in euery place, where the humanitie was to be. And this aſcenſion of Chriſt's bodie was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farre from the nature, but alſo againſt the nature of his bodie: which acknowledg'd the burden and tyrannie of our Elements, till by reſurrection it was refined into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of a glorified nature, and taught to obey its owne preferment: which, the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſo beſtowed both vpon bodie &amp; ſoule; that they were almoſt not more neere vnto it, then like vnto it. And that they might be more like vnto it, the Diuinitie became vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily as humble, as the humanitie was naturally; and voluntarily made the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie as high as the Diuinitie was naturally. Which great worke of the aſcenſion did not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4372:49"/>
only need a Diuinitie to performe it, but alſo to perſwade men, that it could bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; the beliefe of the aſcenſion being the next wonder to the aſcenſion. As then God did effect it, ſo he did teach it: he humbled himſelfe to man; hee humbled himſelfe in man: making the degrees of his inſtruction deſcend by the degrees of mans apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And firſt he did diſcouer the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of aſcenſion to the Vnderſtanding: by which wee doe as truly as Moſes, though not as cleerely, ſee Enoch's aſcenſion; which was not, for ought we know, ſeene by any eye, but the eye of the vnderſtanding: the aſcenſion of his bodie being no more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned then the aſcenſion of his ſoule. God tooke him bodie and ſoule: his bodie being by a holy obedience to his ſoule made ſo like his ſoule; that it did aſcend as eaſily; nay, as ſoone as his ſoule. Holineſſe, which to other men is a reſurrection of the ſoule, was to him a reſurrection alſo of the bodie: which was refined without the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate corruption of a graue; It was refined ſooner then it could be corrupted; It knew no graue but ſinne: from which it did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:4372:51"/>
as it did aſcend from its owne morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: but his ſoule did firſt by righteouſneſſe aſcend in his bodie before it did aſcend with his bodie. God tooke him to himſelfe; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſtorie to poſteritie and faith: as if he would teach the world by this inferiour proportion, that aſcenſion ſhould be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith. The next apprehenſiue facultie in man, to which God deſcended to teach it the poſſibilitie of aſcenſion, was the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie. Thus Iacob ſaw the angels goe vp to Heauen: though this was an aſcenſion but by the helpe of a ladder; and that helpe, like that aſcenſion, but in a dreame; and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which aſcended were but like a dreame, hauing no more ſubſtance, then a dreame. But Saint Paul did by the phantaſie not ſee the aſcenſion of another; but enjoy one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and to that degree of truth, that hee doubted whether his bodie did not as much poſſeſſe Heauen, as the Viſion poſſeſſed his bodie. At laſt the diuine inſtruction taught the aſcenſion to the Senſe: it taught the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the bodie to the bodie. Thus did Eliſha ſee Eliah aſcend: he ſaw him aſcend like the fire in which he did aſcend; in which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4372:51"/>
he did aſcend, till he aſcended aboue it. Hee ſaw the ſtate of his aſcenſion in a Chariot; he ſaw the ſpeed of his aſcenſion in his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; he ſaw and he heard the whirle-wind in which Eliah ſuffered a triumph and rapture of his bodie; as other Prophets had ſuffered a rapture only of their ſoules. Nay, Eliſha's touch too did apprehend the aſcenſion; whiles it tooke vp the mantle that did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; for the mantle too had an aſcenſion, though not to Heauen, yet toward Heauen, and to the working of miracles. But all Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha was but a witneſſe of this aſcenſion; whiles God tooke-vp Eliah, and left the Prophet with Eliſha: whom he clothed not ſo much with the mantle, as with Eliah! But if you would heare of one, that had gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heauen and come downe againe, as if he would be a witneſſe of his owne aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber Abacuc; with whoſe ſtory wee may bee ſatisfied, as much as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel was with his prouiſion; Whom yet if carefully we will obſerue, we ſhall perceiue him caſt into the Lions denne ſo late in the euening, and deliuered thence ſo early in the morning, that there will bee no more
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4372:52"/>
need, then there was time for the aſcenſion of Abacuc, and the miracle of the dinner; Nay, had it come, it would haue beene as great a miracle, to haue kept the Lions from the food, as to haue kept them from Daniel; And had Abacuc liued till Daniel's impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he would indeed haue had need to bee carried, though his journie had beene farre ſhorter, then from Iury to Babylon. Thus did death make this Prophet preuent this aſcenſion of his bodie, by an aſcenſion of his ſoule. But Simon Magus did aſcend in earneſt: nay, and hee prooued it too, by deſcending in earneſt. Only it was an vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſcenſion: he did aſcend by the power of the Deuill; but hee deſcended by the power of God; he deſcended to that power, by which he aſcended. Now as this Sorcerer was made to deſcend by the prayers of Saint Peter: ſo Saint Thomas of Aquine (as ſome haue told vs) aſcended by his owne prayers; hee aſcended without preſumption a foot or two. Which petty aſcenſion may ſerue for a mannerly miracle; if the Saint-maker's eyes were not as dimme as his deuotion; and by an apocope of that Saint's bodie, miſtooke
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4372:52"/>
not his knees for his feete, vpon which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture hee ſtood praying; and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake was as eaſie as the miracle. But wee haue heard of ſome Dead bodies that haue aſcended; thus ſome haue buried Moſes in Heauen, ſtriuing to make his tombe as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as his holineſſe; and belike leſt the Deuill ſhould haue made his body an Idoll, they ſent it to his ſoule to make-vp a Saint. And ſome haue ſent the bodie of the bleſſed Virgin thither, with much reuerence and opinion, though as farre from vſe as from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie. And ſome haue giuen two or three little aſcenſions to her Temple: which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as yet to be honoured at Loretto; which is pleaſed as yet to honour Loretto, &amp; make that place aſcend aboue other places, by not aſcending from that place. Nay, the Turkes too boaſt of an aſcenſion, not of a temple, but of their Mahomet; though had this beene, it had beene an aſcenſion without a reſurrection; an aſcenſion not ſo much of his carcaſſe, as of his coffin: which being of iron has beene reported to aſcend to the roofe of his temple, or rather to the ſecret vertue of many Load-ſtones fixt with as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4372:53"/>
much ſecrecie in the roofe of his temple. Yet euen this aſcenſion alſo will proue to be the worke rather of Poets, then of Load-ſtones. Which can indeed make iron aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, nay, make other Load-ſtones aſcend from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon center; though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, if not violently ſuſtained, doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſcend and acknowledge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon center. Yet ſince without reſpect one to another, each does attract with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute intention; and ſince the application in ſuch attraction is moſt aptly made from ſome point in the ſtone to ſome point in the iron: the defect of ſuch forme in the iron, and the number of the ſtones, which was inuented to helpe the inuention, does with the honeſtie of Philoſophie quite betray it; ſince the iron by a confuſed command of its dutie, could not apply it ſelfe to any one, and therefore not to any. And thus you ſee that Mahomets preſumptuous ſinnes did aſcend higher, then his bodie, or then the inuention of his idolaters. But if we would ſee a low aſcenſion, and yet a wondrous one, we may behold our Sauiour's walking vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4372:53"/>
which was an aſcenſion in reſpect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though not of our Sauiours perſon: it was an aſcenſion of his power, though not of his perſon: nay, it was an aſcenſion of his perſon, becauſe it ſhould naturally haue beene a deſcenſion of his perſon. And leaſt wee might thinke that this aſcenſion could only bee effected in Chriſt's perſon, as it could be effected only by his power, he did effect it in Peters perſon; And though he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſt's hand, as much as his inuitation, yet was it his vnbeliefe that was heauier, then his bodie. But Chriſt's bodie was at laſt to aſcend aboue all the elements, except ſo much of them as compoſed his bodie: which aſcended to immortalitie fortie dayes ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then it aſcended to Heauen; and now as much required to be placed aboue the place of our bodies, as it was aboue the condition of them. When therefore he was to aſcend, he led his Diſciples out of Ieruſalem; it was the firſt degree of his aſcenſion to ſeparate himſelfe from the trouble of the Citie; to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himſelfe from the impiety of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: whoſe malice, whiles it was increaſed in procuring his death, was admirably delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4372:54"/>
in procuring his aſcenſion. Hee led: his Diſciples vnto Mount Oliuet; a place from whence his prayers had often aſcended, as now his perſon. It was not farre from Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, a Village not great (it ſeemes) either in people or ſinnes; and ſo peraduenture as neere to the benefit of the aſcenſion, as to the aſcenſion. And being now to goe vp to to the Kingdome of God, he diſcourſeth to his Diſciples of the Kingdome of God; as if their eare ſhould prepare their eye; whiles he himſelfe will make himſelfe the illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and proofe of his owne doctrine. Yet to ſhew the truth of his loue, as much as the truth of his words, firſt be lifts-vp his hands, at which they lift-vp their eyes and hearts; and then hee lift-vp his voice and bleſſes them. See, with what kind preuention hee ſupplyes his future abſence by his preſent bleſſing; hee makes his bleſſing the Deputie of his perſon: which whiles they behold with eyes as earneſtly fixt by loue, as they could be by death, behold hee aſcends, and they loſe the ſight of him, ſooner by a cloud, then by diſtance. Which ſhortneſſe of the the pleaſure of their ſight was happily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4372:54"/>
before, by the intention of their ſight. His bodie was but a cloud to his Diuinitie; and now his body aſcends in a cloud: which did as eminently ſhew his power, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his perſon. A cloud full of God is the Chariot of his triumph; and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of his Chariot are the wings of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins! Lift vp your heads, O yee gates, and bee yee lift vp, yee euerlaſting doores, and the King of glory ſhall come in. But whiles the Apoſtles ſtedfaſtly gaze after him, as if they would turne their eyes into Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues, or attend him as farre with their ſight as with their deſire; behold their paſſion is not ſatisfied, but changed; and heard by them, to ſaue them the labour of gazing, they behold inſteed of one Chriſt two Angels; and their white apparell inſteed of a cloud; though their number was not ſo much for a ſupply of Chriſt, who was gone into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as for a more ful ſecuritie of his returne from Heauen. The expectation whereof, if any ſhall thinke tedious, they may aſcend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, &amp; peraduenture before his returne; not by ſeeking the impreſſion of his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps on Mount Oliuet, but by finding the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4372:55"/>
ready way in his precepts: by which wee may aſcend to the vnderſtanding of his aſcenſion: by which wee may aſcend to the height of his aſcenſion. Which was aboue all the Heauens, that eyther Philoſophers or the Starres had beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; nay, into that Heauen, of which Copernicus might without errour haue ſaid, that it ſtands ſtill; the Heauen in which the Saints reſt like the Heauen; the Heauen in which Chriſt reſt's like the Saints. And yet you ſhall not only ſee his aſcenſion into this Heauen, but you ſhall ſee alſo his aſcenſion in this Heauen; that was the aſcenſion of his perſon, but this of his glory. Enoch and Eliah aſcended to this Heauen: but you ſhall ſee Chriſt Ieſus in this Heauen aſcend to the right hand of God! Behold this day the humanitie made the favourite of the Diuinitie! Behold Chriſt on the right hand of God! O what a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle would this haue beene for Herod and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late! they would haue cryed out that their worſt Hell had beene from Heauen; and to haue ſcaped the horrour of this ſight, they would haue choſen vtter darkneſſe! But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt on the right hand of God! In
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4372:55"/>
whoſe right hand are pleaſures for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more! And yet can wee behold thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which no eye hath ſeene? Nay, can we behold the hand in which thoſe pleaſures are? Nay, can the hand be found, that wee might behold it? Shall vvee dreſſe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie with ſhape? and by an idolatrous gratitude beſtow the figure vpon God, which hee has beſtowed vpon vs? Shall we giue hands to him, that were not able to giue them to our ſelues? No, wee giue not hands vnto him: but he giues them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yet hee giues them not for himſelfe, but for vs; not to aſſiſt himſelfe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs. He makes vs vnderſtand his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fauours, by his leſſe fauours; and ſo by this happineſſe in their vſe, makes his leſſe fauours greater. He teaches vs the parts of Chriſts triumph by the parts of our bodie: and makes it as eaſie in ſome meaſure to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betweene the glory of Chriſt and of the Angels, as betweene our right hand and our left; as betweene Gods right hand and ours; nay, to judge of Gods right hand by ours. In the right hand of man is his ſtrength: and the Almighty calls his owne ſtrength his right hand. The right hand of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4372:56"/>
man, nay, euery right ſide limbe of man is by ſituation and power of that prioritie by nature, that as if God had ſhewed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred vnion and diſtinction of ſexes in the ſame body, our left limbes are but female limbes; and ſo our left hand may be a helpe vnto our right: but our right is a defence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our left. And this courteous purpoſe of nature, as it is alwayes promoted by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: ſo was it more ſingularly by wit and courage in thoſe Amazonian warriers; who conueighed their right pappe into their arme, bringing-vp that, as the heire of their ſtrength, and prouiding victory for its inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. And yet theſe were not monſters, but wonders; whiles they had not two right armes, but a double one. But nature it ſelfe without this ſupportment of vſe and art, has built the right arme vpon the foundation of a greater bone, then the left: that if theſe bones were brought to the juſtice of the balance, wee ſhould with no leſſe admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then truth confeſſe the right to exceed the left in weight and myſtrie. And as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has thus honoured our right hand, ſo likewiſe has Cuſtome. It is the hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4372:56"/>
wee command, as if it claimed to her the ſcepter of reaſon, and would expreſſe as well the majeſtie as the purpoſe of the will. It is the hand wherewith wee direct, with courteſie in part performing our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whiles with skill we teach it. It is the hand wherewith we promiſe, in which forme of couenant the hands of men we ſo firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited, to profeſſe the intended vnion of their word and deed. It is the hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we bleſſe, wiſhing the ſtrength of our hand to be the Embleme of our bleſſing. It is the hand wherewith we defend, and which by the artificiall mercy of protection, we can beſtow vpon another, and yet nere part from it.

Heere let vs with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent compariſon and delight behold God and Chriſt, Chriſt with God, at the right hand of God; the neereneſſe preſenting them both to the ſame view; the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe expounding them both by the ſame

view. It is ſupreame glorie with God to haue equall glory of Diuinitie with God; And Chriſt had this, the ſupreame part of Chriſt, his Diuinitie: which ſince it did from eternitie enjoy ſuch equalitie, this is rather to bee the right hand of God, then to be at the right hand of God: to be at the right hand of God, being a triumph which Chriſt could not receiue before his hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall vnion; a triumph, which hee did not receiue till after his aſcenſion. Leauing then only vnto wonder, ſuch wonders of his right hand, we may only behold the pleaſures (though they are wonders too) the pleaſures in that hand; and not without pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difference betwixt his hand and ours: ſince ours venters to be but the Gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie-prophet of our owne ſucceſſe; but his right hand of truth and bountie, does by a Catholike and vnfeigned Palmiſtrie, ſhew the bleſſings prouided for other men! And O how admirable are the bleſſings of the man Chriſt Ieſus! Bleſſings that more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſe him then the cloud hee aſcended in! Bleſſings as ineffable, as his generation! Bleſſings as immenſe, as his loue! Bleſſings as inſeparable, as his Diuinitie! Bleſſings as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4372:57"/>
exquiſite, as his torments! O how are thoſe hands, thoſe feet, that ſide, which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the point of the naile, &amp; of the ſpeare, and of the Iew, made now as impenetrable, as the hearts that prepared them; made now as glorious as the patience that admitted them! The face, which receiued ſpittle as vile almoſt as the mouth that ſent it, how does it now ſhine like the Sun in his ſtrength, that now for the brightneſſe of it, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers could not ſee how to ſpit vpon it! The head, which did no more deſire a crowne, then a crowne of thornes ought to bee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how is it now crowned with the merit of that bloud, which the thornes did ſhed! with the mercy of that bloud, which was readie to forgiue thoſe that ſhedde it! The ſoule, which was ſo intentiue to its owne ſorrowes, that it almoſt forgot to animate the bodie, for which alſo it in part did ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; how is it now delighted as much with the ſocietie of the ſoules, whom it has deliuered, as with its owne righteouſneſſe, by which it deliuer'd them! O happy Saints, who in peace behold our Sauiour in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of peace! A triumph attended by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4372:58"/>
peacefull Melchizedeck: who now inſteed of bleſſing Abram, does with Abram bleſſe the God of Abram; and inſteed of preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bread and Wine, the bleſſings of peace, preſents himſelfe a King and Prieſt of peace! A triumph attended by the peacefull Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: from which ſeed of Dauid God would not take away his bleſſings for euer; nay, in his mercy hee has for euer giuen him more bleſſings, then hee had women and children; and has now requited his Temple with a Temple; which more exceeds Solomons in wonder, then his exceeded Gods in the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the building; his being the worke &amp; ſtudy of ſeuen yeeres, but Gods being the work but of a day; nay, but of the firſt inſtant of Gods firſt day; a day when yet there was no Sunne wherewith to meaſure a day; a day when yet there was no man, for whom to meaſure a day! A triumph attended by the peacefull Ezechias: who now is in a Temple ſafer from Sennacherib, then Sennacherib was in his owne temple from his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; who now is at more reſt, then the Sun was in his Diall; in which though it went not forward, yet it ſtood not ſtill; and now
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4372:58"/>
his repreeue from death for fifteene yeeres is liberally improued into eternity! A triumph attended by the peacefull Ioſiah: who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of celebrating his ſolemne Paſſeouer, does now feaſt with the true Lambe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and though that peacefull Ioſiah did not end in peace, yet by that end he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes a peace; a peace as harmeleſſe as that Lambe, with which he enjoyes it! A triumph now attended alſo by our peacefull Iames: who ſo loued peace, that hee loſt his owne, whiles he ſtudied ours; who ſo loued peace, that excepting the combates of each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with himſelfe, hee would not haue had the Church to bee Militant heere on Earth; making it almoſt Triumphant heere on Earth; who loued peace, as much as the Prieſt ought to doe; nay, who loued peace as much as he loued his Prieſt! And now hee is aſcended thither, where only is to bee found a peace equall to his loue of peace; and now without going to Spaine, wee can find a Saint Iames, Saint Iames of Britaine, Defender of the Faith and the Cleargie! O happy Saints, who doe in peace attend our Sauiour in his triumph of peace!

And O the happineſſe of holy Stephen! whoſe eie was as full of wonder, as his ſoule of grace; and did ſo ſtedfaſtly looke vp into Heauen, as if his eye had imitated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of his ſoule. And hee beheld with that zeale of looke, the ſonne of man in his triumph of zeale: which was ſo raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Stephens perſecutors, that he ſtood-vp at the right hand of God; as if for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ſake, had it beene poſſible, hee would haue ventured againe among the Iewes; his loue making him readie to forſake his glory, rather then his Saint! Whom yet he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their crueltie, whiles hee ſeemed not to deliuer him. Hee deliuered him from their crueltie by their crueltie; and by the ſpeed of death, reſcued him into Heauen; whiles he was as conſtant in his prayer, as in his death. And it ſeemes his prayer was heard for Saint Paul: whoſe firſt zeale did not more delight in Saint Stephens perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then his ſecond zeale delighted in Saint Stephens zeale; and now with joy both doe attend vpon our Sauiour in his triumph of zeale! And O the happineſſe of diuine Iohn! who heere on earth had the honour to ſee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4372:59"/>
our Sauiour in Heauen in his triumph of honour! And he ſaw the Elders fall downe before the Lambe, imitating the humilitie of the Lambe; and by the imitation preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto him the remembrance of his owne humilitie; and they triumphed more in their dutie, then in their age; and by fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gratitude, gaue honour to themſelues, whiles they gaue it to the honorable ſonne of God! And now Saint Iohn is become a part of that wonder, which hee wondred at: whiles by his owne aſcenſion hee increaſes the number and triumph of thoſe Elders; hauing put off his own bodie, that he might bee neerer to our Sauiours bodie. O happie Saints, who are neere the right hand of God, whiles they are neere him who is at the right hand of God! whoſe dwelling ſeate is at the right hand of God; a ſeate which the malice of the Iew cannot reach vnto; nay, which the prayer of the Iew cannot reach vnto! Whoſe judgement-ſeate is at the right hand of God; nay, the judgement-ſeates of his Saints are at the right hand of God: for they alſo with him ſhall judge the twelue Tribes of Iſrael. Yet marke the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4372:60"/>
of our Sauiour: they ſhall with him judge the world, but only he ſhall ſaue it! And againe, marke the prerogatiue of our Sauiour: by which hee is as wonderfully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from them, as hee is by his loue vnited to them. As then you haue beheld the aſcenſion of his glory, ſo in this aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now behold a jealous aſcenſion, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable aſcenſion of his power; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and authorities and powers being made ſubject vnto him! The glory of a Prince is in the multitude of his people: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Prince in the power of his people; but the greateſt power of God is in himſelfe; yet hee communicates a great power vnto his angels. To know the number of whoſe angels, is as much beyond our abilitie, as beyond our vſe; and it is enough glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that wee know their number to bee ſo great, that we cannot know it. To know the power of the angels is as eaſie as to know our owne weakneſſe: of which, our bodies are able to inſtruct our ſoules. But to define the Orders of the angels, is not an act of man's knowledge, though it has beene of phanſie; but like ſome to build the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4372:60"/>
nine-ſtorie-high, were ſuch a piece of architecture, that Virtuoius himſelfe would haue thought it to haue no more art in it, then ſafetie: and hee would haue beene as much confounded with wonder, as the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding would bee with its owne height! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it would exceed the tower and vanitie of Babylon: the foundation of this angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tower being higher then the top of that. Yet that of Babylon would in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect exceed this; ſince that had a ſtronger foundation, though not a wiſer. But perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture theſe Dionyſian builders layd their foundation vpon a Dreame, and tooke their imitation from Iacobs Ladder: vpon which becauſe Iacob did behold angels, they haue by finer workmanſhip rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed a Ladder of angels; And that the inuention might ſeeme new by the ſeene, as his aſcent reacht vnto Heauen, ſo theſe are made to reach vnto God. Whoſe wiſedome has indeed diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed his angels, but rather by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment then their nature: as he has diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the ſoules of men, not by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but their endowments. Thus ſome of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4372:61"/>
his Angels are Seraphins: whoſe loue is as hote as fire; whoſe loue is as pure as fire. Some are Cherubins: the intuitiue expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and extent of whoſe knowledge may be named and figured by a wing. Some are thrones: who are ſafe from the feare of Gods judgements, whiles they are made the ſeats of his judgements, the miniſters from whom his judgements are ſent forth. You may deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to dominions, principalities and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities: but this middle Region of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is ſo full of clouds, that we can only ſee the clouds, through which wee cannot ſee. You may deſcend yet lower, to Powers, arch-angels and angels: and yet thus neere we ſhall be troubled with miſts, that we can ſcarce ſee our hand, wherewith to point-out the differences. Beſides, the Almightie can as eaſily appoint the change of their offices, as their offices; and by the weight of his meſſage promote an angell into an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell; or hee can ſend the ſame angell to Balaam and to his Aſſe; or hee cannot only change their offices, but alſo mixe them; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame angell that killed the firſt-borne
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4372:61"/>
of the Aegyptian, preſerue the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite to confeſſe the diſtinction. And becauſe this diſtinction is rather the cauſe of thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, then the effect of curioſitie, let vs more conſider their ſtrength, then their Heraldrie; yet rejoyce more in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then in their ſtrength; they being all made ſubject to our Sauiour; all, whether they are angels of authoritie to declare his pleaſure, or angels of power to execute his pleaſure. And it is his pleaſure that as they are ſubject to him, ſo they ſhall bee ſubject for vs. It was for vs that he ſent two angels to be a witneſſe and an effect of his aſcenſion. It was an angell deliuered Peter from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and kept him ſafer then the jailou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> could. It was an angell deliuered Paul from the wrath of the tempeſt, which was not ſo obedient to the angell, as the angell was to Paul. And when at the laſt Day the trumpet ſhall found, the angels ſhall make as much ſpeed as the voice of the trumpet, and bee as officiouſly obedient as the bones of the dead: which they ſhall raiſe and attend, at that laſt aſcenſion. And then ſhall they waite
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4372:62"/>
for euer after, rather vpon the perſon then the meſſage of their Prince Chriſt Ieſus; of our Prince Chriſt Ieſus. Who is aſcended to rayſe vs to an aſcenſion of Faith; by which, it being of things not ſeene, wee doe not only honour the perſon in whom wee truſt, but modeſtly oblige him; And thus the skilfull mercie of our Sauiour vouchſafes to make himſelfe beholding to vs, by his owne work, for his owne worke, for our faith in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; rather then to make vs beholding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for our delight in his preſence. Hee aſcended therefore to rayſe vs likewiſe to an aſcenſion of Hope: which has obſerued his loue to bee ſo vnited to his power in his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our nature vnto his nature: that by the great act of his aſcenſion, it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expects the aſſumption of our perſons vnto his perſon. Hee aſcended likewiſe to rayſe vs to an aſcenſion of Loue: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like fire ought to aſcend: and being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the fire ought to aſcend aboue the fire; and ſince the fire can aſcend to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, loue ought to exceed it, and aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heauen. Into which holy place our high
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4372:62"/>
Prieſt is entred, not ſo much to begge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don as to giue it; and by his entring into this holy place, that he might make the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our peace equall to the myſterie of it, he has prooued our Prieſt to be equall to our God. Hee had before made man but little leſſe then the angels: but now the man Chriſt Ieſus is aboue all the angels: to whom Enoch's aſcenſion was newes, but this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement! And as it was their ſingular wonder, ſo let it be our ſingular joy. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we may well rejoyce, when by aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſhall bee purged from the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our humanitie: when our faith ſhall be happily loſt into ſight: when wee ſhall bee paſt hope, not by deſpaire, but by poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: when we ſhall be more tranſported by loue, then by angels: when we ſhall bee no longer their charge, but their company: when God ſhall ſo delight in vs, that if wee could ſinne, we ſhould be proud, that hee ſo delighted in vs: when we ſhall ſo delight in God, that if there could bee ſorrow in that delight, we ſhould bee ſorrie, that wee had not alwayes delighted in him; and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4372:63"/>
of this delight, ſhall be an aſcenſion of this delight. O happy and full Viſion, when Iacob ſhall not dreame that hee ſees angels goe vp to Heauen, but ſhall goe thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and now adore the angell, whom once he wreſtled with: and as he then would not part from him, till he had a bleſſing, ſo now he neuer ſhall part from him, becauſe he has this bleſſing! O happy and full viſion, when Moſes ſhall ſee the face of God and liue; nay, when he ſhall liue, becauſe hee ſees the face of God! when Moſes his face ſhall ſhine ſo bright, that now it would ſhine through his veile; and yet his righteouſneſſe ſhall bee more glorious then his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance! when now hee ſhall not need to goe to the top of Mount Nebo, to ſee the land of promiſe; but on the top of this holy hill, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the true land of promiſe, and the God that promiſed it! O happy and full Viſion, when Simeon ſhall with more joy bee taken vp into Heauen, then he tooke-vp the child Ieſus into his armes; and ſhall find himſelfe more increaſed in joy, then the child his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour increaſed in ſtature; when hee ſhall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4372:63"/>
ſee his Sauiour honoured at the right hand of God, who once vouchſafed to honour Simeons armes! O happy and full Viſion, when Peter ſhall ſee himſelfe as much tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured as Chriſt; when Peter ſhall ſee Chriſt more then transfigured; and now ſhall with delight behold our Sauiours face, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for feare he fell vpon his owne! O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and full Viſion, when Paul ſhall ſo ſee Chriſts bodie in Heauen, that he ſhall know himſelfe to bee there in bodie! when Iohn ſhall no more need to ſee the new Ieruſalem come downe from Heauen, but ſhall goe-vp vnto it! Vnto which, O thou Lambe of God, grant that by the imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we may aſcend: that we may aſcend to that Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, by thy light, who art the light of that Ieruſalem that the ſight of thy triumph may bee our triumph: that our petitions may now ſo aſcend, that they may make way for the aſcenſion of our ſoules and bodies: that with thy Cherubins and Seraphins continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wee may cry, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbaoth; who doeſt now with vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie reſt from thy paſſion; And though wee

cannot hope, for the glory of thy right hand, vouchſafe vs the protection! Heare thou that ſitteſt at the right hand of God the Father, and haue mercie! For thou only art holy, thou only art the Lord, thou only O Chriſt, with the Holy Ghoſt, art moſt high in the glory of God the Father!
