         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His being Choſen a MEMBER to ſerve in the

Relating to the Point of
Succeſſion to the Crown: SHEWING
From <hi>Scripture, Law, Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> how
Improbable (if not impoſſible) it is to Bar the

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have been pleaſed (among far better choice) to conſult
a mean Man in a great Point now depending before you in
Parliament, and agitated in every Man's mouth; it is no
leſs than, <hi>Whether the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>may by their Act
exclude, and diſable the next Heir of the Blood Royal from
Succeſſion to the Crown.</hi> I know it hath been commonly
diſcours'd, that the Statute of 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. hath already
ſetled this Point, and anticipated the Debate thereof,
wherein it is Enacted; <hi>That whoſoever ſhall after the Death
of that Queen affirm, That the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>hath not full Power to bind the
Crown in Point of Deſcent, and Succeſſion, ſhall forfeit his Goods and Chattels.</hi>
But, Sir, under favour this Law doth not in any wiſe affect either you or me,
as this Caſe is. It doth not affect you, becauſe you being a Member of the
Grand Council of the Nation, have thereupon a part and ſhare in the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is, in the making new, and abrogating of Old Laws; and all Men
know that Freedom and Liberty of Speech, and Debate, are the very Eſſence
and Soul of all Councils. It doth not affect me, becauſe this being a Point ſtir'd
in your Houſe, and being alſo of that ſublime Nature and Importance, it is but
natural for any Member thereof freely to adviſe with his Friend about it with
mutual ſecurity; for if it were enacted even by Parliament that no Member thereof
ſhould conſult his Books, or Friends, about any Affair moved in either Houſe, that Act
would be null, and void in it ſelf, as being ridiculous and impertinent. And I am
able to prove by irrefragable Records of Parliament which I have perus'd, That the
Members of your Houſe in ancient time, have ſometimes demurr'd to paſs certain
Bills of extraordinary Nature, till they have confer'd and advis'd with their
Countreys who had intruſted and choſe them. And if the Queſtion now before
you be not of that Nature, I know not what is. But becauſe the Objection
founded upon the ſaid Statute of 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>El.</hi> is one of the <hi>Herculcan</hi> Arguments now in
every Man's mouth, and of which I obſerve ſome Men are not a little fond, and
lay a great part of their ſtreſs upon it, it ſhall not ſo eaſily eſcape my Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and therefore towards the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, I hope you will find
I have ſtab'd it into the fifth Rib. Only I conceived it not altogether unſeaſonable
to pinch this ſturdy Objection a little in the beginning by way of Anticipation.</p>
            <p>Sir, There is no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man hath a more profound Veneration and Deference
for the public Sanctions and Eſtabliſhments of my Country than my ſelf; I know
well they contain the collective Wiſdom and Providence of the Nation. They
are in great meaſure the Ramparts and Sea-walls of the Common Liberties and
Propriety. They are (humanly ſpeaking) the Fountains and Sources of all
that is dear to our Souls and Bodies; but withall it is to be remembred, That God,
Nature, and the immutable Cuſtoms of this Realm, have plac'd ſome Things
and Matters above their Influence and Coercion. And we know that the Judges
of the Common Law (to whom alone by a deep Polity the Conſtruction and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
of all Statute-Laws is intruſted) have in all Ages made bold ſometimes
to weigh the ſame Statute-Laws in the Ballance, and for certain Reaſons appearing
to them, have now and then (without deflowring their Conſciences and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity)
adjudged them null and void. Of this kind I ſhall produce ſome
Inſtances in their proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58871:3"/>
Neither is it to be forgotten that his Sacred Majeſty (whoſe concernment in the
Fate and Event of this Queſtion is not ſmall) hath in ſeveral of his late Speeches,
Printed and Publiſh'd by his Special Command, admoniſh'd the Two Houſes,
<hi>That they do not in any of their Bills Impeach the Right of the Succeſſion, nor the
Deſcent of the Crown in the true Line.</hi> Upon this Foundation it is; together with
that profound Duty which I owe to my gracious Soveraign; and Love to my
Country (to ſay nothing of my particular reſpect to your ſelf) that I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the following Diſcourſe. In the which you will perceive I have laid before
you my Sentiments and Notions with that Freedom and Aſſurance which becomes a
faithful Adviſor and Friend. And I ſhould be ſorry you ſhould find any thing in
the whole Diſcourſe contrary to right Reaſon, or the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or not
munited with Authorities Sacred and Inviolable.</p>
            <p>There is one Thing I had almoſt forgot to tell you (which yet perhaps may ſeem
ſuperfluous enough to your ſelf, who knows me ſo well) which is, That I am
an unworthy Member of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I was Baptis'd in that Faith, and
I deſign (by God's Grace) to Live and Dye in it. And (which doth not always
happen) I know no Relation I have in the World of a contrary Perſuaſion. For
my Principles, as they reſpect the State, I am for ſupporting the Monarchy of
<hi>England,</hi> with thoſe Regalities and Flowers with which the Laws of my Country
have embelliſh'd and illuſtrated the Crown; And yet am, and ſhall upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
appear as Zealous in the Defence and Vindication of the Common Liberties
and Property of my Country-men as any Man whatſoever; And (if I may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it without too much Oſtentation, or Envy) my Relations were Fidele and
Loyal to the Crown during our late Domeſtic Revolutions, the tragical Marks
whereof (I praiſe God) we have chearfully born in our Bodies and Eſtates.</p>
            <p>Having thus premiſed theſe things, I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to the Debate
of the principal Matter, wherein, <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt all a long ſo conſider your Time and
Patience, that I muſt much more conſider the Dignity, and Nature of the Argument,
and ſubject matter. And I doubt not (under favour) effectively to maintain and
prove,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Parliament of </hi>England <hi>cannot by their Act, exclude, or diſable the next
Heir of Blood Royal from Succeſſion to the Imperial Crown of this Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall make good by great and important Reaſons and Authority drawn
from the Laws of God, Nature, the Laws of <hi>England</hi> Common and Statute,
the Canon and Civil Laws, Hiſtories Ancient and Modern, and Records of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and other Courts; from which Foundations a Point of this nature and
ſublimity is to be decided.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Reaſon.</note>Firſt then, I ſhall lay this down for a Ground: That the Succeſſion of the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by the Laws of God and Nature, is inſeparably annexed
to proximity and nextneſs of Blood: And then all Statute-Laws contrariant to
the Laws of God and Nature are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void. So then I am here to
prove two Things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Succeſſion to the Crown is inſeparably annexed to proximity
of Blood by the Laws of God and Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Statute-Laws contrariant to thoſe Laws are null and void.
That the Succeſſion of the Crown by the Laws of God is inſeparably annexed to
proximity of Blood, appears plainly by that Statute-Law (or Statute of Judgment,
as it is there call'd) which God himſelf with his own mouth pronounced for the
ordering the Deſcent of Honors and Poſſeſſions, <hi>Numb. chap.</hi> 27. which are there
by his immediate direction to be conferr'd by Birth-right, and Propinquity of
Blood; and not by the Election or Diſcretion either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> their Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
or the Community of the People, a part, or both in conjunction. And
there, <hi>Verſes</hi> 9 and 10, it is expreſly enjoyn'd by the ſame Divine Authority,
<hi>That if a Man have no Son, or Daughter, his Inheritance ſhall deſcend upon his
Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preference likewiſe and prerogative of Primogeniture in point of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Poſſeſſions, is of the ſame Divine Inſtitution, as appeareth in ſeveral
places of the Holy Scriptures. As where God ſaid<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> to <hi>Cain</hi> of his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58871:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Abel. His deſires ſhall be ſubject unto thee, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi>
Again, where he forbiddeth<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 21. 17.</note> the Father to diſinherit the Firſt-born of his double
Portion, becauſe by right of Birth it is due unto him. And laſtly, where he
maketh choice of the Firſt-born<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 13. 1. 22. 9.</note> to be ſanctifi'd and conſecrated to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Conſonant hereunto are the Suffrages of the Fathers,<note place="margin">Numb. 3. 13. Luc. 2. 23.</note> and Doctors of the Civil
or Imperial Law. St. <hi>Hicrom</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">In Epiſt ad Onagr. Et in Gen. 49.</note> writeth, <hi>That a Kingdom is due unto the Firſt-born.</hi>
St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Hom. 5. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus Judaos.</note> ſaith, <hi>The Firſt-born is to be eſteemed more Honourable than the reſt.
Bodine,</hi> the Great <hi>French</hi> Lawyer, tells us,<note n="f" place="margin">De Repub. lib. 6. cap. 5.</note> That it is not enough that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
go in Succeſſion, but that it deſcend alſo upon the eldeſt iſſue Male, where
he is next of the Blood, <hi>[ſic enim Ordo non tantùm Naturae, &amp; Divinae Legis,
ſed etiam omnium ubique Gentium poſtulat.]</hi> For ſo (ſaith he) not only the Law of
God, and Nature, but alſo of all Nations doth require. And <hi>Baldus,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Lex hoc D. de Juſt. &amp; Jure.</note> (a famous
Doctor of the Civil Law) ſaith, <hi>[ſemper fuit, &amp; ſemper erit, &amp;c.]</hi> Always it
hath been, and always it ſhall be, That the Firſt-born, and next of Blood, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
in the Kingdom. Wherein he is followed with open Cry of all the choice
Interpreters, both of the Canon and Civil Law; as namely <hi>Panormitanus,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Iac. licet de voto.</note> 
               <hi>Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis,

               <note n="k" place="margin">In l. obve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire D. de verb. ſig.</note> and innumerable others.</p>
            <p>Now what hath been ſaid here of Primogeniture in Point of Succeſſion to the
Crown, is ſaid likewiſe with equal conſequence of proximity of Blood. For by
the Civil Law, if a King have iſſue, five Sons, and the Firſt-born die before the
Succeſſion fall, or if he being poſſeſs'd of the Kingdom die without Heirs of his
Body, his right of Primogeniture devolveth unto the next in Blood; and if he
dyeth in like manner, then unto the third; and ſo likewiſe to the next in Order.

            <p>And herein the Common Law of this Nation accordeth with the Civil Law.
And therefore the ſecond Son of the King of <hi>England</hi> (after the Death of the
Firſt-born) is eldeſt Son within the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.<note n="r" place="margin">Cokes <hi>3d. Inſt.</hi> 8.</note> where it is enacted,

<hi>Charles,</hi> upon the Death of his elder Brother Prince <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which it appeareth, that Proximity of Blood is ennobled with all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
and Preferences of Primogeniture.</p>
            <p>But leaving this way of arguing the Point, to be farther illuſtrated and purſued
by the Church-men and Civilians; I ſhall for the moſt part derive my own Proofs
thereof from the Authority of the Common and Statute-Laws of <hi>England,</hi> from
Records of Parliament, and other Eruditions of that kind, as beſt ſorting with
my Perſon, and Profeſſion, and a Diſcourſe of this nature.</p>
            <p>Firſt then it is moſt evident, That all the Human Acts and Powers in the World
cannot hinder the Deſcent of the Crown upon the next Heir of the Blood, (I do
agree they may hinder the poſſeſſion, and enjoyment, and ſo they have often
done by open Hoſtilities and Violence) but I ſay they cannot hinder the Deſcent.
And the reaſon is plain, becauſe this is a Dowry which the great King of Kings
hath reſerved to his own immediate Donation, and hath plac'd above the reach of
a mortal Arm; and Mankind can no more hinder or intercept this Deſcent, than
it can the Influences of the Stars, or the Heavens, upon the ſublunary World,
or beat down the Moon: And this (though perſpicuous enough in it ſelf) I ſhall
farther prove anon in my laſt Reaſon of this Point, by irrefragable Authorities
of the Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> and in my Anſwer to the ſecond Objection.
This being ſo, I ſhall add, That in the very moment of the Deſcent, the Perſon
on whom it deſcends, by the Law of this Nation, becomes compleat and abſolute
King to all intents and purpoſes. And ſo it was expreſly Reſolv'd by all the Judges
of <hi>England,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Jacobi, Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clarks</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58871:4"/>
thus compleat and abſolute King by the ſaid Deſcent, I do then farther add, That
the Ligeance and Fidelity of the Subject is due to that perſon by the immutable
Law of Nature. And ſo it was ſolemnly adjudged by the Lord Chancellor, and all
the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> in the Exchequer Chamber in the great Caſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi>
6 <hi>Jacobi. Coke</hi>'s <hi>7th Rep. 12. v. 13. a. &amp;c. &amp; 25. a.</hi> And herewith concurs the
Principal Secretary, or <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> of Nature, I mean <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who<note n="t" place="margin">Ariſt. Ethic. Nicomac. lib. 8. cap. 13.</note> writes,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. By the Law of Nature the
Father hath the Rule over his Children; and the King over his Subjects. And
<hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſopher hath a ſaying not<note n="u" place="margin">De Clemen. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> unlike, <hi>Natura commenta eſt Regem.</hi>
Nature (ſaith he) did firſt find out a King.</p>
            <p>And for this Reaſon it is, that our<note n="x" place="margin">24 H. 8. cap. 12. 34 H. 8. cap. 1. 23 Eliz. cap. 1. &amp;c.</note> Statute-Laws do ſo frequently ſtile the
King our Natural Liege Lord, and the People, Natural Liege Subjects; And the
Fidelity which the Subject owes to the Crown, Natural Obedience. And this
more clearly appears in Indictments of Treaſon (which of all other Law Proceſs,
are pen'd with the greateſt Niceneſs and Certainty.) And therefore in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord <hi>Dacre</hi> (upon the Northern Rebellion) 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is ſaid,
<hi>Predictus Dominus Dacre debitum fidei, &amp; Ligeantiae ſuae quod prefat. Domino Regi
Naturaliter, &amp; de jure impendere debet, minime curans, &amp;c.</hi> The ſaid Lord
<hi>Dacre</hi> not regarding the Faith, which he did Naturally and of Right owe to the
King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Reginald Poole</hi> (a Cardinal of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> was Indicted
30<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>H.</hi> 8. for committing Treaſon <hi>[contra Dominum Regem ſupremum &amp; Naturalem
Dominum ſuum.]</hi> Againſt the Lord the King, his ſupreme and Natural Lord.
And the conſtant form of the Indictments againſt the Perſons lately executed for
the Popiſh Plot, is, That they as falſe Traitors againſt the moſt Illuſtrious, moſt
Serene, and moſt Excellent Prince <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Supreme and
Natural Lord; the cordial Love, and natural Obedience, which faithful Subjects
ſhould, and of right, ought to bear to our ſaid Soveraign Lord the King, wholly
withdrawing, did compaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore as the Common Law is more worthy than the Statute, ſo the Law
of Nature is more worthy than both.</p>
            <p>So then, no Human Power can hinder the Deſcent upon the Right Heir of the
Crown. The Deſcent makes the King, Allegiance is due to the King by the
Law of Nature; the Law of Nature cannot be abrogated by Human Power; <hi>ergo,</hi>
The right Heir of the Blood cannot be excluded by Parliament, which is a Human
Power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is evermore a certain Veſtigue or Footſtep of a Law founded in
Nature, when a Thing diſplac'd is ſeldom or never in a State of Reſt, until it
be compos'd again in its own Native Centre, and Repoſitory. For though all
human and written Laws may be worn out by Deſuetude, and <hi>tacit</hi> Conſent, yet
the Inſtitutions of Nature will never be aboliſh'd by the longeſt tracts, and courſes
of Time, but will always retain an <hi>Animum revertendi,</hi> and will certainly at
length attain it. And of this kind is the Law of Succeſſion to the Crown by the
right Heir. For we find in the Stories of all Nations, as well Barbarous as Civil,
that during Uſurpations and Invaſions upon the Crown, though countenanced even
by public Eſtabliſhments and Conſent of the People, that thoſe States notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
have always continued under Convulſion, and Diſeaſe, like a Magnetic
Needle, that never ceaſeth to tremble and trepidate 'till it have found out its
beloved North-Pole. And in ſuch Caſe it hath conſtantly far'd with thoſe Bodies
Politic, as with a Body Natural upon Diſlocation of a principal Bone; they have
breathed it may be, and moved a little, but ſtill under Languors, and Anguiſh,
and Feavoriſh Habits, and Diſpoſitions, and never well 'till the Bone was ſet
again, and reduced to its right place. I will rather chooſe to extract ſome ſhort
Inſtances of this kind out of the Memoirs of our own, than foreign Nations,
(as being <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem.)</hi> And ſhall for brevity aſcend no higher
than the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt. And the ſame Inſtances ſhall be of Uſurpations upon
the Crown, contenanc'd by the Public Sanctions of this State.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>William,</hi> and firſt <hi>Henry,</hi> uſurp'd the Crown, and thereupon this Realm
remain'd conſtantly under inquietude, and commotion, until the Death of <hi>Robert</hi>
their elder Brother, and his Son <hi>William,</hi> without Iſſue, whereby the Right of the
Crown centred in the ſaid <hi>Henry.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58871:4"/>
The Uſurpation of <hi>Stephen</hi> upon <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs (Daughter and Heir of
the ſaid <hi>Henry)</hi> was accompanied with Tragical Convulſions of this Nation, which
never ceaſed till the Reſtauration of the right Heir, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> the ſecond Son of
the ſaid <hi>Maud,</hi> in which <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Bloud was likewiſe reſtor'd, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
being next Heir of the Bloud to <hi>Edgar Atheling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Diſinheriſon of the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> by that of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> this State
ſuſtain'd a Convulſion not to be parallell'd in all the Stories of the World. It is
infinite to recount the Laniages, the Butcheries, the Rapines that were committed
here: There were fought in this Iſland during this Tempeſt of War (as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Author hath obſerved) 17 pitch'd Battels, and no leſs than 8 Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Bloud, 40 Dukes, Marqueſſes, and Earls, beſides Barons and Gentlemen
innumerable, and 200000 of the Common People ſlaughter'd and deſtroy'd. And
though this Combuſtion continued 60 years, (for ſo long it was from the Uſurpation
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, to the Expulſion of his Grandſon <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth) yet the
Body Politic enjoyed little eaſe till it had purged out the Uſurpers: like a Body
Natural, that having received into the Stomach matter inimical and contrariant to
Nature, is never at quiet till it have work'd out the ſame noxious and malignant
matter by all the Paſſages of Evacuation, though to the manifeſt hazard or deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Man himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Uſurpation of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third determined in his own death, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of the right Heir ſome time after.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Jane Grey</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> was but an Offer of Uſurpation,
as being a Quotidian Ague that laſted but nine days, which ended upon the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, it's a matter of freſh and bleeding ſentiment and experience, what Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Throws the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſuſtained after that fatal and impious ſtroke
given to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of ever Glorious Memory: Nature is wanting in
adequate Metaphors and Similitudes to expreſs ſo great a Calamity. This State
was like the Demoniac in the Goſpel; ſhe was torn, worried, and ſhak'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
and of this there was no intermiſſion untill the evil ſpirit was diſpoſſeſſed, and
His Gracious Majeſty that now is (whom God long preſerve) reſtor'd to that Crown
which God, and Nature, and the immutable Cuſtoms of this Nation had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him.</p>
            <p>So then it doth moſt evidently appear by theſe Inſtances, that the Succeſſion of
the Crown to the next of Bloud is a Law eternal, and wrote with the immediate
hand of God and Nature. And that although Nature may for ſome time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
and kept off with the Forks and Inſtruments of humane violence, that yet it
will ſooner or later ever more recur, and return with the greater ſwing and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.
And that therefore a Dominion obtain'd by Uſurpation is like a vaſt and
ponderous Globe of Iron, ſupported in the Air by main ſtrength of Arms, which
upon removal or withdrawing of the ſame force by fatigue or imbecillity of the
Bearers, will at length certainly attain its Centre of Gravity, and with the fall cruſh
and confound the Supporters.</p>
            <p>And where ever this eternal Law and Rule of Nature hath been impeached and
violated, that hath evermore been done by the immediate and moſt viſible act and
finger of the Divinity it ſelf, who is King of Kings, by whom they reign, and
that giveth the Kingdoms of men to whom he will, (as the holy Scriptures tell us.)
And who being the Creator of Nature, can alone (when it pleaſeth him controul
her Methods and Operations, as appeareth by the Interruptions of the Succeſſion
in the caſes of<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 16 1.</note> 
               <hi>David, Solomon,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">2 Kings 9. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Jehu,</hi> and the like. And they that from theſe
and other inſtances of this nature do fancy they may maintain the Lawfulneſs of
impeaching the Succeſſion of the Crown in the true Line, may as well infer, that
they may lawfully rob and ſpoil their Neighbours, becauſe God commanded the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſpoil the<note n="d" place="margin">Exod 11. 2. 12. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Egyptians.</hi> In thoſe caſes we are bound to the Law, but not
to the Example.</p>
            <p>I come now to Records of Parliament, which ſhall be three in number.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that of the 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6.<note n="e" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 39. Hen. 6. Num. 10. 13, 15, 27.</note> wherein the daring <hi>Rich Plantagenet</hi> D. of <hi>York,</hi> by his
Council exhibited to the Lords in full Parliam. a Writing, containing his Right and
Claims to the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Againſt which Claim it was objected
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58871:5"/>
on the King's part, That the ſame Crowns had been entailed by Act of Parliament
upon the King's Grandfather King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and the Heirs of his Body,
from whence the ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth did lineally deſcend. <hi>The which Act</hi>
(ſay the King's Friends there) <hi>is of Autoritee to defeat eny mannere Title made to eny
perſon,</hi> (for ſo are the words.) To which Objection the ſaid Duke of <hi>York</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth,
(I ſhall cite the words of the Record as they are entered up in the old
<hi>Engliſh) That if King</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth might have obteigned and rejoyſed the ſeyd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones
of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Fraunce <hi>by Title of Enheritaunce, Deſcent, or Succeſſion, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needed nor would have deſired, or made them to be granted to him, in ſuch wiſe as
they be by the ſeyd Act. The which taketh noo place, neither is of any force or effect
againſt him, that is right Enheritor of the ſeyd Corones; as it accordeth with God's Laws
and all natural Laws,</hi> (ſaith the Roll.) And this Anſwer of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to
the King's Title, and his ſaid Claim, is afterwards by expreſs Act of the ſame
Parliament, declar'd and recognized to be <hi>good, true, juſt, lawful, and ſuffiſaunt,</hi> (as
it is there worded.) And at the ſame time for preventing Effuſion of Bloud an
Accord, by the free conſent of the ſaid Duke, is likewiſe eſtabliſhed, That King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Sixth ſhall during his Life enjoy the Crown, and that from thenceforth the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould be reputed Heir Apparent to the Crown.</p>
            <p>The next Record is that of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.<note n="f" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 1 Ed. 4. num. 8. &amp;c. &amp; 9 Ed. 4. 10. a. Bagot's Aſſiſe.</note> wherein after that Parliament hath in a long
Pedigree diſclos'd the Title of the ſame King <hi>Edward</hi> to the Crown, as being in a
right line deſcended from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son to King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third; and, upon the death of his Father the above mentioned <hi>Richard Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet,</hi>
next Heir of the Bloud Royal, they immediately add theſe very words;
<hi>Knowing alſo certainly without doubt and ambiguity, that by God's Law and Law of
Nature, he</hi> (i. e. King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth) <hi>and none other, is and ought to be true;
rightwys, and natural Leige and Soveraigne Lord. And that he was in right from the
death of the ſeyd noble and famous Prince his Father, very juſt King of the ſame Realm of</hi>
England.</p>
            <p>So here it is moſt expreſly declared by two Parliaments of different Complexion
and Intereſt, and therefore the more remarkable, that the Succeſſion of the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> is inſeparably annexed to Proximity of Bloud by the Laws of God and
Nature: And that a Title of this Sublimity and Grandeur is not at all impeachable
even by Act of Parliament. And beſides the ſaid Parliament of 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. doth
make the ſame Declaration to the manifeſt prejudice of the Title of the King in
poſſeſſion, who was ordained alſo by the ſame Accord to reign over them during
his Life, and whom for that reaſon it muſt be preſum'd they would have favour'd, if
they had found but the leaſt colour ſo to have done.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Jac. c. 1.</note>The laſt Record is the Statute of Recognition made in the firſt year of King<hi>James</hi>
 by the whole Parliament, in which among other things, <hi>They do in moſt
humble and lowly manner</hi> (I ſhall all along uſe the very words of the Act) <hi>beſeech His
moſt Excellent Majeſty, that as a Memorial to all Poſterity, it might be publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
and enacted in the High Court of Parliament, That they being bound thereunto by
the Laws of God and Man, did with unſpeakable Joy recognize and acknowledge, that
immediately upon the Deceaſe of Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi> the Imperial Crown of the Realm of</hi>England, &amp;c. <hi>did by inherent Birthright, and lawful and undoubted Succeſſion, deſcend
and come to His moſt Excellent Majeſty, as being lineally, juſtly, and lawfully next and
ſole Heir of the Bloud Royal of this Realm. And that by the goodneſs of God Almighty,
and lawful Right of Deſcent, His Majeſty was King of</hi> England, &amp;c. <hi>And to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition
we do </hi>(ſay they) <hi>moſt humbly and faithfully ſubmit, and oblige our ſelves and
poſterities for ever, untill the laſt drop of our bloud be ſpent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> ſome time after in the great Caſe of <hi>Calvin</hi> in the
Exchequer Chamber do reſolve,<note n="h" place="margin">6 Jac. Co. 7 Rep. 10. v. &amp; 14. v.</note> 
               <hi>That King</hi> James <hi>his Title to the Crown was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Law of Nature, </hi>viz. <hi>by inherent Birthright and Deſcent from the Bloud Royal
of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this Parliament doth not in the leaſt manner pretend to give any Title to
King <hi>James</hi> or his Poſterity by their own Act and Eſtabliſhment, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
doth expreſly recognize, that the ſame King's Right and Title to the Crown
doth accrue to him by the Laws of God and Man onely, as the ſaid Judges do by
the Law of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> as next and ſole Heir of the Bloud Royal. By all which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58871:5"/>
it doth moſt manifeſtly appear, That in the Opinion of the three ſeveral Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Succeſſion of the Crown is united to Proximity and Nextneſs of Blood,
by the Laws Divine, Natural, and Human: And a threefold Cord of this Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and Strength is not eaſily broken; to ſay nothing of the ſaid Reſolution of
all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> in the Point, which (as our Books tell us) in matters
of Law, is of the moſt ſacred Authority next unto the Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>This being thus made out, I come now to prove, That Statute-Laws contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to the Laws of God and Nature, are <hi>ipso facto</hi> null and void.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall firſt obſerve, That by a profound Polity of our Law, the
ſole Power of expounding Statute-Laws, whether relating to Church or State,
is intruſted and lodged in the Judges of the Common Law, as King <hi>Charles</hi> the
firſt hath noted in his<note n="i" place="margin">Printed in <hi>Poulton</hi>'s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. 3 Car. 1.</note> Speech to both Houſes, upon paſſing the Bills of 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of
his Reign. And as the Authorities of<note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Coke</hi>'s 1. Iaſt. 344. a.</note> Law are very clear, now the Judges have
exerted this conſtructive Power in expounding Statute-Laws, ſometimes even null
and void for certain Reaſons to them appearing.</p>
            <p>As ſometimes for Repugnancy, and Impertinence, and therefore where the
Statute of <hi>Carlile</hi> enacted, That the Common Seal of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
Monks ſhould be in the Cuſtody of the Abbot, and four others of the Covents;
And that any Deed ſeal'd with the ſame Seal, not ſo kept, ſhould be of no effect.
This Statute was adjudged void<note n="l" place="margin">27 Hen. 6. Fitch Title Annuity 41.</note> for Repugnancy, becauſe the Seal being in the
Cuſtody of the four, the Abbot could not Seal with it; and when it was in
the hands of the Abbot, it was out of the Cuſtody of the four. And ſo by
this Statute, theſe two Orders could make no Deed valid in Law.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for Abſurdity, as where the Statute of<note n="m" place="margin">1 Edw. 6. cap. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. gives Chantries to
the King, ſaving to the Donors, and Founders, all Services, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Act was
adjudged void as to the Services. For it is abſurd and contrary to Common Reaſon
(ſaith the Book) that the King ſhould hold of, or do Service to his Subjects.

            <p>Laſtly, the Judges have expounded Statute-Laws void in themſelves, when
they are contrary to thoſe of God and Nature; and they are bound to adjudge
them ſo, when ever ſuch Statute Laws come before them; becauſe the Laws of
God and Nature are the Rays, and Emanations of the Divinity, they are eternal,
indelible, immutable, and therefore cannot be altered, or Impeached by any
human Power, or Authority, but only by the God of Nature it ſelf, who did
originally ordain them. And of this (becauſe it is the principal Matter now in
hand) I ſhall be the more plentiful in Inſtances.</p>
            <p>And therefore if it ſhould be enacted by Parliament, That no Man ſhould
honour the King, or love his Parents or Children, or give Alms to the Poor,
or pay Tithes to the Parſon of his Pariſh, or the like, theſe Acts are <hi>ipſo facto</hi>
void, becauſe they are contrary to the expreſs Divine Commands. <hi>Dr. &amp; Stud.
lib. 1. cap. 6. 21 Hen. 7. 2. v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So where a Man was made Judge in his own Cauſe by Act of Parliament, This
Act hath been adjudged void; becauſe (ſay our Books) it is contrary to the Law
of Nature, that one and the ſame Perſon ſhould be Judge and Party. <hi>Cokes</hi> 8
Rep. <hi>a. &amp; v.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Caſe. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Rep. 87. <hi>Day. v. Savadge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So an Act of Parliament can never make the Grant of an Ideot or Lunatic good,
for <hi>Jura Naturae ſunt immutabilia</hi> (ſaith the Book.) The Laws of Nature are
immutable. <hi>Hob. 224. Needler</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
            <p>By the Statute of the 25 <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 22. a Man attainted in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> is

            <p>The Statute of 23 <hi>Hen 6. cap.</hi> 8. and ſeveral other Statutes enact, That no
Man ſhall be Sheriff of any County above one year; and that any Patent of the
King to any perſon for a longer Term, though with an expreſs Clauſe of <hi>Non
obſtante,</hi> ſhall be abſolutely void, and of none effect; and the Patentee perpetually
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58871:6"/>
diſabled to bear the Office. And yet notwithſtanding it is reſolved by all the
Judges of <hi>England,</hi> That theſe Acts of Parliament are void. And that the King
may by <hi>non obſtante,</hi> conſtitute a Sherif for Years, Life, or Inheritance. And
what is the Reaſon which the Judges give of this Reſolution? Why becauſe,
ſay they, in expreſs words this Act of Parliament cannot bar the King of the
Service of the Subject, which the immutable Law of Nature doth give unto
him; for Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ligeance of the Subject (add they) is due to the
Soveraign by the Law of Nature. See 2 <hi>Hen. 7. 6. v. Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, 14. <hi>a.</hi>
in <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>7th</hi> Rep.</p>
            <p>And thus upon the whole Matter of my firſt Reaſon, I have (as I conceive)
effectually prov'd theſe two Propoſitions: Firſt, That the Succeſſion of the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> is inſeparably annexed to Proximity of Blood by the Laws
of God and Nature. Secondly, That Statute-Laws contrariant to thoſe of
God and Nature, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void. And from hence it doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow, That the next Heir of the Blood Royal, cannot be barr'd from the
Succeſſion by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">2 Reaſon.</note> The Succeſſion of the Crown to the next Heir of the Blood Royal,
is a fundamental and primary Conſtitution of this Realm; and, indeed the <hi>Baſis,</hi>
and Foundation of all our Laws. Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Preface to his fourth Rep. <hi>in principio.</hi>
               </note> ſays, <hi>That the Kingdom of</hi> England
<hi>is a Monarchy ſucceſſive by inherent Birth-right, of all others, the moſt abſolute and
perfect form of Government, excluding</hi> Interregnums, <hi>and with it infinite inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
The Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton</hi> tells<note n="p" place="margin">His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Caſe of the <hi>poſtnati. pag.</hi> 36.</note> us, <hi>That in Caſes of the Crown the
Eldeſt, ſole (or alone) is to be prefer'd.</hi> And this he reckons among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cuſtoms of this Nation, <hi>againſt which there never hath been</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>nor ought to be any Diſpute.</hi> And indeed if the Parliament may alter ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and fundamental a Cuſtom, or Conſtitution, then the Monarchy of
<hi>England,</hi> which by the Law is, and ever ſince we were a Nation, hath been
Hereditary, will immediately become Elective, and diſpoſable at the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Will of the People. And by the ſame reaſon, that they may exclude,
and reprobate the next Heir, they may the next to that, and ſo by conſequence
the whole Line: For when Men have once tranſgreſs'd, and broken down the
Boundaries which the Law hath ſet and prefix'd, the Progreſs is infinite, and
there is no ſtop: And though the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> (which, as I have ſaid,
doth ſuperintend all Statute-Laws) doth allow the Parliament to repair and amend,
and improve the Building, yet it doth never allow them to pull it down, and
ſubvert the Foundations thereof.</p>
            <p>And it is ſome odds that ſuch Electors may in time believe, that they have a
Power to mar what they can ſo eaſily make, and that with good Conſcience they
may deſtroy (when they think fit) their own Creature, and Work of their own
hands: And therefore thoſe Kings of <hi>England</hi> who have ſubmitted their Necks to
this popular, or Statute-Kingſhip, (as I may call it) it is plain they came not in
at the Door, but evermore at the Windows; and have been conſtrain'd, during
their whole Reigns, to ſtand upon their Guards, and to defend their wrongful
Poſſeſſions by Divine Right of the Sword, (as ſome in Raillery have call'd it) as
well even againſt the People that choſe them, as the Right Heirs. As I ſhall anon
Demonſtrate at large.</p>
            <p>And this alteration of the Monarchy in ſo fundamental a part thereof, from
Inheritance to Election, may prove equally miſchievous alſo to a King in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
though he claim too by Inherent, and undoubted Birth-right; for the
ſame Reaſon which the People may think ſufficient to exclude the Right Heir, may
(when they pleaſe) be deem'd valid enough alſo to depoſe, and eject the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Poſſeſſor of the Crown.</p>
            <p>Thirdly;<note place="margin">3 Reaſon.</note> No Perſon, or Community of Mankind, can give away, or transfer
a thing, which they never had in them to give. And of this Nature is the Right
of Succeſſion to the Crown, which is not the Gift of Man, but the immediate Dowry
of God, Nature, and the immutable Cuſtoms of the State. This may be prov'd by
the Scriptures, Fathers, Councils, Canon, Civil, Common, and Statute-Laws, of
which I ſhall give only a Taſt.</p>

Right of the Crown, and a Right annexed and ſecured to the ſame Heir,
not onely by the Laws Divine, Natural, and Humane, but alſo (as I have clearly

            <p>

ſhould be an</hi> Interregnum, <hi>which the Law will not ſuffer.</hi> This I ſhall now proceed
to make good by two great and impregnable Inſtances, drawn out of our Books of
Common Law, Hiſtories, and Records.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth,<note place="margin">K. H. 6 Rot. Parl. 1 Ed. 4. num. 12, 22.</note> who being diſcomfited in Battel by
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, was in the firſt of the ſame King <hi>Edward</hi> diſabled from
all Regiment, and attainted of High Treaſon by Act of Parliament. The ſaid
King <hi>Henry</hi> ſome years afterwards (by the aſſiſtance of the great Earl of <hi>Warwick)</hi>
was reſtor'd again to the Crown, and held a Parliament. And the Judges of that
time were all of opinion, That notwithſtanding the Parliament of <hi>Edward</hi> had
diſabled <hi>Henry</hi> from all Government, and attainted him of Treaſon, that yet in
the ſame moment that <hi>Henry</hi> reaſſumed the Crown, the ſaid Parliamentary Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
were to all intents diſcharged and avoided. And yet <hi>Henry</hi> was at firſt
but onely King <hi>de facto,</hi> the true and legal Title abiding in the Houſe of <hi>York.</hi> See
to prove this <hi>Brook Parl. pl. 105. 1 H. 7. 4. v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Inſtance is that of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.<note place="margin">K. H. 7.</note> This King while he
was Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> (together with many Lords and Commons that took his part)
were all attainted of High Treaſon by the Parliament of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
at the Battel of <hi>Boſworth</hi> the Earl obtain'd the Victory, and ſlew <hi>Richard</hi>
in the Field, and on the ſame day aſſum'd the Crown upon him, and preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſummon'd a Parliament.</p>
            <p>On the firſt day of this Parliament (ſay our Books of Law and Hiſtories) all the
Judges of <hi>England</hi> were aſſembled in the Exchequer Chamber, to reſolve a very
rare and perplex'd Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> What ſhould be done about the reverſal of the ſaid
Parlementary Attaindors of the King, and divers Lords, and many Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and Burgeſſes, that were to ſit in Parliament that day. And after mature
Deliberation had among themſelves they all Reſolved, That for all the Lords and
Commons that were attainted, they adviſed them not to ſit in Parliament till an Act
of Parliament was paſſed by the other Lords and Commons not attainted, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to by the King, for the reverſal of thoſe Attaindors; and after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
then all of them to ſit in the Houſes: For that it was not convenient that any
ſhould ſit as Judges in thoſe Houſes that were attainted. But concerning the King
himſelf they unanimouſly Reſolved, <hi>That the Crown takes away all defects in Bloud
and Incapacities by Parliament. And that from the time the King did aſſume the Crown
the Fountain was cleared, and all the ſaid Attaindors and Corruptions of Bloud, and
other Impediments, abſolutely diſcharged</hi> And yet the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh
was onely King <hi>de facto</hi> alſo, the legal Title (as I have before obſerved) abiding
in the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> See to prove all this the Books of 1 <hi>H. 7. 4. v. Fitz. Parl. pl. 2.

            <p>The laſt Inſtance is that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> an Inſtance of freſh and recent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.

            <p>Moreover by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> the right Heir becomes abſolute, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
King, in the very moment that the Crown deſcends upon him, though he
happen to be at the ſame time in the remoteſt parts of the World, and before he

            <p>Having thus (as I conceive) made my Point good and impregnable, <hi>Viz.</hi>
That the next Heir of the Blood cannot be excluded from the Succeſſion by Act
of Parliament. I come now to anſwer certain Objections, which ſome Men I perceive
are fond of, and do not a little glory therein; and the moſt conſiderable of them
are three in Number.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Objection.</note> (ſay they) there are ſeveral Inſtances of Kings of this Realm, whoſe
Titles to the Crown depended purely upon the Election of the People, and Acts
of Parliament, and not upon Proximity of Blood, and Inherent Birth-right,
as (to go no higher) the Titles of King <hi>John, Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the
ſeventh. Moreover <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth entail'd the Crown upon himſelf, and
his Children, by Act of Parliament. And theſe Eſtabliſhments by Parliament
were look'd upon as good Titles to the Kings in Poſſeſſion, and bars againſt the
next Heirs.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> they were never look'd upon as good Titles to the Kings in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
or bars againſt the right Heirs, neither ought they to be deemed ſo, as doth
moſt evidently appear by the former part of this Diſcourſe. And which I ſhall
now farther demonſtrate by Enquiry into the Titles, and Circumſtances of each
particular King, mentioned in the Objection.</p>
            <p>Firſt for King <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>King</hi> John.</note> it is plain he was King <hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de jure,</hi>
for he invaded the Crown againſt the Right of his Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi>
(who was the Son of <hi>Geoſſry, John</hi>'s Eldeſt Brother) as all the Hiſtories of that
time do obſerve and lament. And therefore wanting that Title which God, Nature,
and the immutable Cuſtoms of this Realm give to the Right Heir, he was conſtrain'd
to pray in Aid of the People, and to patch up a Title from them by Election. The
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58871:8"/>
Story is this,<note place="margin">Vita <hi>Johannis.</hi> fol. 197.</note> (as I have extracted it out of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> a learned Monk,
who lived in that time, and who became afterwards Chronologer Royal to King
<hi>Henry</hi> the third, Son of the ſaid King <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> (ſaith the Monk) upon the Death of his Brother King <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt,
was advanced to the Throne by the favour and help of the great Miniſters of State;
and at his Coronation, in the preſence of the Clergy, Nobility, and Populace,
<hi>Hubert,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> (a Man of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Subtilty and Reach) tells them all in a very fine Harangue, That no Man
whatſoever was to ſucceed in the Kingdom here, upon any previous Reaſon, unleſs
he were freely Elected by the univerſality of the People, with conſideration had
of his Moralities, and other perſonal Vertues, after the Example of <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Election; and then he added, That <hi>John</hi> was a well qualified Perſon in that kind,
and that therefore they ought to chooſe him for their King. But when the ſaid
<hi>Hubert</hi> was afterwards demanded, why in ſo great an Aſſembly he durſt broach ſo
notorious a falſhood, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> was Elective; O, ſaith
he, this I did out of certain Revelations and Propheſies that I have received,
That <hi>John</hi> will at ſome time or other endanger the Realm, and bring all into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
<hi>[Et ne haberet liberas habenas hoc faciendi, ipſum Electione, non Succeſſione
haereditaria eligi debere, affirmavi;</hi> for ſo are the Hiſtorian's Words.] And that
I might curb him with this Bridle from effecting theſe things, I did pronounce him
admitted to the Crown by Election, not by hereditary Succeſſion. So then we
ſee here that the pronouncing the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> to be Elective, was done
only by way of Umbrage, and Diſſimulation, and to ſerve a turn at a certain
<hi>Criſis,</hi> and juncture of time. And the truth is, the People did accordingly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
check this unfortunate King with the ſame Bridle, and reduc'd him to a
very low condition, and they choſe <hi>Lewis</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> King's Son) their King.
And this was the conſequence of King <hi>John</hi>'s Election by the People, and Invaſion
of the Right of his Nephew; which Tenure was good only ſo long as he could
maintain it with his Sword; and ſo likewiſe is the Tenure of Pyrats, and Robbers,
when they have raviſh'd the Properties of other Men.</p>
            <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">Henry 4th.</note> For King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, he was likewiſe King <hi>de facto</hi> only, and
not <hi>de Jure,</hi> for he laid violent hands upon the Crown, by the treaſonable, and
barbarous Depoſition, and Murder of his natural Lord and Soveraign King <hi>Richard</hi>
the ſecond, after whoſe Death, without Iſſue, the legal Title remain'd in the
Houſe of <hi>Clarence,</hi> being the elder Line; and ſo King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to truckle under an Election by the People, and their Eſtabliſhment in
Parliament, which Eſtabliſhment was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void and null in Law againſt the
Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> (which married afterwards with the ſaid Houſe of <hi>Clarence)</hi> as I
have evidently proved by the Roll of Parliament of 39<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 39.</note> recited
by me at large here in the beginning of this Diſcourſe.<note place="margin">H. 6. Num. 10. 13, 15. 27.</note> And indeed this very
King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, well knowing how much a Title to the Crown by the
Common Law, and Inherent Birth-right, exceeded a Title by Statute, and
Suffrage of the People, made his ſolemn Claim to the Crown in Parliament by
Deſcent from King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which though it was the meereſt figment and
pretence that ever was, (as all the World knows) yet he thought he might with
more ſecurity rely upon that (though fictitious) than popular Eſtabliſhment,
though real: The Story is conſiderable, and therefore I ſhall extract my Account
thereof from the Roll of Parliament of that time.<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 1 H. 4. Memb. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Forthwith (ſaith the Record) upon vacancy of the Realm by Depoſition of
King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> riſing from his Seat, and
ſtanding up, ſo that he might be well ſeen by the People, and humbly croſſing his
Forehead and Breaſt, calling upon our Saviour's Croſs, he claim'd and challeng'd
the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> thus void; in his Mother-Tongue, under this very form
of Words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Name of Fader, Sonne, and Holy Goſt, I </hi>Henry <hi>of </hi>Lancaſtre <hi>challenge
this Rewme of </hi>Ynglonde,<hi>and the Crown, with all the Membres, and Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
als I that am deſcendit be Ryght Lyne of the Blood, comynge fro the gude

ſent me, with helpe of my Kin, and of my frends to recover it, and which Rewme was
in poynt to be ondone for defaut of governance, and un endoying of the gude Laws.</hi> 
            </p>
            <p>So we ſee here, that the Title he laid ſtreſs upon was, <hi>Als deſcendit be right line
of the bloud comynge fro the gude Lord King</hi> Henry <hi>Therde;</hi> he meant from <hi>Edmund</hi>
ſecond Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, from whom the ſame <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth
by the Mother's ſide lineally derived, and who would fain have fac'd down the
World, that the ſaid <hi>Edmund</hi> was elder Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his own knowledge, and that of all Mankind in that Age, and the expreſs Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony

            <p>Thirdly;<note place="margin">Henry 7.</note> For King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, he was alſo King <hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de jure,</hi>
the legal Title abiding at that time in <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Fourth, with which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> did afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Now becauſe the Claim of the ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh to the Crown is
not generally underſtood, and it will conduce much to my preſent purpoſe to clear
that matter, I ſhall crave leave here briefly to open it.</p>
            <p>It is to be known then that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh laid claim to the
Crown, as deſcending in a right line from <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> eldeſt Son to
<hi>John of Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> by his third Wife <hi>Katharine Swinford,</hi> by which
<hi>Katharine</hi> the ſame <hi>John of Gaunt</hi> had Iſſue the ſaid Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and other
Children, before Marriage with her; and during his Marriage with his ſecond
Wife the Lady <hi>Conſtance,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> So the
ſaid Children were plainly all Baſtards by our Law, and by conſequence not capable
of inheriting any thing. After the death of his ſecond Wife, <hi>John</hi> for the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
affection which he bare to his Children by <hi>Katharine,</hi> married her; and ſome
time after procured them by Act of<note n="c" place="margin">R. 2 num. 29. Rot. Parl. 20. Rot. Parl. 20. Ri. 2. Pars ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda memb. 6. Rot. Parl. 8 H. 4. Pars prima memb. 14.</note> Parliament to be legitimated, and made inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to all Preheminences, Honours, Dignities, &amp;c. <hi>[Exceptâ Regali Dignitate,</hi>
for ſo are the very words of the Record, <hi>Excepting the Regal Dignity.]</hi> Beſides,
<hi>Margaret</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> the Mother of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
(through whom he muſt neceſſarily derive what ever Title he could pretend
to) died not till<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lord</hi> Herbert H. 8. fol. 8.</note> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>So then here are four plain Legal Impediments in the Title of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Seventh: 1. He derived from a Baſtard Stem or Slip. 2. Though the ſaid Children
by <hi>Katharine Swinford</hi> were legitimated by Parliament, yet the Dignity Regal was
excepted by the ſame Parliament, and they remained illegitimate as to that. 3. His
Mother out-liv'd him. And 4. (which was worſt of all) the onely true and legal
Title remained in <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eldeſt Daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, (who
deſcended lineally from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, John</hi>'s elder Brother) with
which <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> afterwards married, as I have obſerv'd. And
therefore this Prince having ſo many palpable Flaws and Impediments in his Title,
and well knowing that the Laws Divine, Natural, and Humane, were all againſt
him; no man (I ſuppoſe) will wonder that he made his Courtſhip and Addreſſes to
the People for their favour and good will, and was ſo ſollicitous of an Eſtabliſhment
by them.</p>
            <p>And as the moſt conſidering and thinking men of that Age had no great opinion
of this Prince's Parliamentary Title, ſo it is plain that this King himſelf laid no
great ſtreſs upon it; which is the more remarkable, becauſe all our Hiſtorians do
with one voice proclaim him one of the wiſeſt and moſt ſagacious Princes, that ever
ſway'd the Scepter in this Realm.</p>
            <p>Now that he himſelf relied not upon this Statute-Kingſhip is moſt plain from
two Acts of Parliament which I that produce.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by that very Statute Law by which the Crown was eſtabliſh'd upon him:
for,<note place="margin">Bacon Hist. 11. 12.</note> as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath obſerv'd, he did not preſs to have that Act penn'd by
way of Declaration or Recognition of Right, as on the other ſide he avoided to
have it by new Law or Ordinance; but choſe rather a kind of middle way, by
way of Eſtabliſhment, and that under covert and indifferent words, <hi>viz. That the
Inheritance of the Crown ſhould reſt, remain, and abide in the King, &amp;c.</hi> Which
Words might equally be applied, That the Crown ſhould continue to him, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58871:9"/>
whether as having former right to it, (which was doubtful) or having it then in
fact and poſſeſſion, (which no man denied) was left fair to Interpretation every
way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">11 H. 7. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>from that Act of Parliament which he procur'd to be made in the
11th. of his Reign, in which it was ordain'd,</hi> That no perſon that ſhall ſerve the King
for the time being <hi>(for ſo are the very words)</hi> in his Wars, ſhall therefore be attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or impeach'd in his Perſon or Eſtate, what fortune ſoever fall by chance in Battel
againſt the mind and will of the ſame King for the time being.</p>
            <p>This Law (ſaith the Lord Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Hiſtory of <hi>H.</hi> 7. fol. 144.</note> who comments very handſomly
upon it) had in it parts of prudent and deep foreſight, for it took away occaſion
for the people to buſie themſelves in prying into the King's Title to the Crown; for
howſoever that fell out to be good or bad, the People's Safety was already provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for.<note place="margin">Ib. fol. 233. &amp; 217.</note> And the ſame Author in the cloſe of this King's Life, reckons his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and ſeaſonable Death among his greateſt Felicities, which withdrew him from
any future blow of Fortune; which certainly (continues he) in regard of the Title
of his Son, being then 18 years of Age, and a bold Prince, had not been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have come upon him: Becauſe upon the deceaſe of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Queen, in
whom (as I have often ſaid) the true Title lodged, and who died ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Crown immediately by the Law of <hi>England</hi> deſcended upon Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
for there can be no Tenancy by the Courteſie of the Crown. So then in the
Opinion of the ſaid Lord Chancellour alſo this King's Title by Statute was of ſmall
account in reſpect of that of his Son by Common Law. By all which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that this King had no legal or inherent Right of his own to the Crown; and
therefore full contrary to his own inclination he was conſtrain'd to ſtoop and truckle
under an Eſtabliſhment of the People, which notwithſtanding was invalid and null
in Law, as I have proved.</p>
            <p>For King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">Henry 8.</note> though no man ever doubted but that he was King
<hi>de jure,</hi> as bearing (united in his own individual Perſon) his Father's pretended
Title of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and his Mother's legal and undoubted one of <hi>York;</hi> yet there
happened to fall out in this Prince's Caſe certain anomolous and odd Circumſtances,
and Niceties, and ſecret Intrigues, which neceſſitated him (contrary to his better
knowledge and the native greatneſs of his Soul) to allow his People a ſhare or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnerſhip
(as I may ſay) in the ordering the Succeſſion of the Crown, that ſo the
matter might go as far as Human Power could carry it.</p>
            <p>And therefore firſt by the Statute of 25 he confirms his Divorce from <hi>Katharine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 22.</note>
and baſtardizeth <hi>Mary</hi> her Daughter; and on the other hand corroborates his
Marriage with <hi>Anne,</hi> and legitimates <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Daughter, and makes her
inheritable to the Crown. The Legitimation or Baſtardy of theſe two Daughters
depending much upon the validity or weakneſs of the Papal Diſpenſation in the firſt
Marriage; and this point being a <hi>Vexata Quaeſtio</hi> in thoſe days, he had hoped to
have cut this <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot (which he could not untie) with the Sword and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Omnipotency of a Parliament. And then after he had done this, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
marries <hi>Jane Seymour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">28 H. 8. cap 7.</note> and by the Statute of the 28 attaints his Wife <hi>Anne,</hi>
and baſtardizeth <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Daughter; and ſo then (according to the Poet)</p>
            <q>
               <l>Qui color albus erat nunc eſt contrarius albo.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And then breaking down the Boundaries of all Law and common Reaſon, and with
a prodigious wildneſs and extravagancy he procures it to be Enacted, <hi>That in caſe he
had no Iſſue by</hi> Jane, <hi>he might diſpoſe of the Crown to whatſoever Perſon he did in his
own diſcretion think fit.</hi> And the whole Nation was oblig'd by the Sanctimony of an
Oath to the defence of this Law. This he did that he might advance to the
Throne his Natural Son <hi>Henry Fitz Roy</hi> Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heylin's Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia reſtaurata, fol. 5.</note> whom he loved moſt
paſſionately, (who yet died not long after) and ſo to exclude for ever his Siſter
<hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all her Deſcendents.</p>
            <p>Then by the Statute of 35 he entails the Crown upon himſelf,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. cap. 1.</note> Prince <hi>Edward,</hi>
and the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and in caſe they happened to have no Iſſues of
their Bodies, then he was again impower'd by the ſame Act of Parliament to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the Crown to what perſon or perſons ſoever he pleaſed by his laſt Will and
Teſtament. And the whole Narion was likewiſe ſworn to the Maintainance of this
Law. And by virtue of this extravagant Power (in caſe his three Children died
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58871:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without Iſſue, as afterwards they did) he bequeathed the Crown to the Houſe
of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> being the younger Houſe, and in defiance of all Laws, and Brotherly
Affection diſinherited, and totally excluded the elder Houſe of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And
therefore all thoſe Niceties and Deſigns conſidered, it is moſt plain King <hi>Henry</hi> was
conſtrain'd to pray in Aid of the People, to give ſome Colour at leaſtwiſe to all the
Contradictions and Impoſſiblities. And therefore, I conceive that no Man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reaſon, or that bears true Faith and Allegiance to His Majeſty that now is, or
his Crown, will draw Arguments from the three Statutes above mentioned, to prove
that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> may exclude the next Heir of the Blood.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter of this firſt Objection, it appears moſt plainly,
That the Princes which ſubmitted and ſtoop'd to theſe tumultuous and Statute-Kingſhips,
either it was becauſe they invaded and uſurp'd the Crown contrary to
the Laws Divine, Natural, and Humane, or to give a colour and varniſh to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
and Impoſſibilities, and private Intrigues and Deſigns. And yet
after all theſe popular Eſtabliſhments, though munited, and fenc'd about with
the higheſt Penalties and Oaths that mortal Men could deviſe; yet could not in
reality transfer the Right from the next Heir of the Blood (that being a Dowry,
as I have ſaid, which God reſerves to his own immediate Donation, and hath
plac'd above the reach of a mortal Arm.) For though an Act of Parliament ſhall
command me to ſay, That an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> is White, and that under the higheſt
Oaths and Penalties; or, That an Ape is a Man; yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Ethiö<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
can never in truth change his Skin, or Complexion, nor the Ape his <hi>Species,</hi>
and commence a Creature rational.</p>
            <p>Ay;<note place="margin">2 Objection.</note> but (ſaith another) Why may not the Crown be transfer'd from the
next Heir of the Blood by Parliament, as well as all other Inheritances, and
Poſſeſſions whatſoever in the Kingdom may, from the Right Heir of the
Subject?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer there is no ſimilitude between the Caſes.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> For; 1. Private Men
derive their Inheritances from their Anceſtors; but the next Heir of the Blood
Royal derives not the Crown from his Predeceſſor, or the People, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from God;<note place="margin">Nil dat quod non habet.</note> as I have prov'd at large in this Diſcourſe. And no Perſon, or
Community can give away, or transfer a Thing, which they never had veſted
in them, either in Poſſeſſion, or ſo much as Right.</p>
            <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">1. Inst. 11. v. &amp; 344. a.</note> The Law of the Crown (which yet is a principal part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law of <hi>England)</hi> differs from the Law of the Subject in Point of Deſcents;
and therefore that may be Law in caſe of the Crown, which is not in caſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Subject, of which I ſhall here give ſome Inſtances.</p>
            <p>A Private Man being an Alien Born, cannot by our Law inherit Land here,
But the Crown ſhall deſcend upon the next Heir of the Blood, though an Alien;
as it happened many years ago, in the caſe of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, who
was an Alien born, and begot of a Father who was alſo an Alien: And the
like happened not long ſince in the caſe of King <hi>James,</hi> of ever bleſſed
Memory.</p>
            <p>If a King of <hi>England</hi> have three Daughters, and dye, the Crown ſhall
deſcend upon the Eldeſt alone; but in caſe of a Subject, the Inheritance ſhall go
to all three Daughters. <hi>Co.</hi> 1. Inſt. 165. <hi>a: 25 H. 8. cap. 22. circa medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Subject marry an Heireſs, and hath Iſſue by her, a Son, and the Wife
dye, the Husband ſhall enjoy the Wive's Lands during his Life; but if a Man
marry a Queen Regnant of <hi>England,</hi> and hath Iſſue by her a Son or a Daughter,
and then ſhe dyes, here the Crown deſcends immediately upon the Iſſue, which
becomes King or Queen preſently, though the Father be alive; as ought to have
been in the Caſe of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and his Son Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> (as I have
before obſerved;) and would have been in the Caſe of <hi>Philip</hi> that married Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> if ſhe had dyed having Iſſue. <hi>Elleſmere</hi>'s <hi>Poſtnati</hi> 36. Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s
<hi>H. 7. fol.</hi> 4. 121, 217, 231.</p>
            <p>So the half Blood is no Impediment to the Deſcent of the Lands of the
Crown, as it happened in the Caſes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth and the two Queens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58871:10"/>
               <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and yet in the Caſes of Subjects it is clearly otherwiſe.
<hi>Plowd. Com. 245. a. Co.</hi> 7. Rep. 12. <hi>v. Poſtnati. Co.</hi> Inſt. 15. <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe if the Right Heir of the Blood, or the Father or Mother of the
Right Heir from whom the Crown deſcends, are attainted of High Treaſon by
Parliament, theſe Attainders yet are no Obſtructions to the Deſcent of the Crown,
as it happened in the Caſes of our King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and his Father
<hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who were both attainted of High Treaſon
by Act of Parliament.<note place="margin">

Judges that gave Sentence upon her, ſet forth a public Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That the Attainder of the Mother did not at all derogate
from the Right of her Son to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> But all Men
know 'tis otherwiſe in the Caſe of Subjects, whoſe Deſcents are
obſtructed by the Attainders of their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>I could be infinite in Caſes of this Nature, but by theſe few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
(wherein the Law, for ought I know, is no more alterable by
Parliament than the Succeſſion) it doth plainly appear, That there is
no ſmall difference in Point of Law; between the Deſcents of the
Crown, and Private Inheritances. And therefore, though an Inheritance may
thus be given away from a Subject, yet it doth not in any wiſe follow that the

               <note place="margin">3 Objection.</note> 
               <hi>and laſt Objection is founded upon the Statute of</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Eliz. cap. 1.
<hi>wherein it is enacted,</hi> That if any Perſon ſhall affirm, That the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> hath not full Power to bind, and govern the Crown in Point of Succeſſion and
Deſcent, that ſuch Perſon (during the Queen's life) ſhall be guilty of High
Treaſon, and after her Death; ſhall forfeit his Goods and Chattels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Firſt, it is to be obſerved; That this Law was made in the time of
a Queen, whoſe Title to the Crown depended upon Statute-Law, as appears by
the very Act recognizing her Title to the Crown;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Eliz. cap. 3.</note> and this Act of 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> was made
in affirmance and vindication of ſuch Title to the Crown by Statute; and this is plain
from the Body of the ſame Act, wherein it is expreſly Enacted, That if any
Perſon ſhall affirm, That any Statute for recognizing the Right of the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> to be lawful in the Royal Perſon of the ſaid Queen, is not, or ought
not to be for ever of ſufficient force to bind all Perſons, and their Rights, that
in any wiſe may, or might claim an Intereſt to the ſame Crown in Poſſeſſion, or
otherwiſe, ſhall, during the Life of the Queen's Majeſty, be judged a High
Traitor; and therefore the ſame Queen had little reaſon to ſcruple the paſſing a
Bill of this Nature. But I much doubt, whether a Common Law-Prince (who
owes his Title only to God, Nature, and the immutable Cuſtoms of the Nation)
unleſs under like Circumſtances with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, would have aſſented
to an Act, ſo derogatory to the Regalties; for the manifeſt Inconveniencies that
might inſue to himſelf, and poſterity, by ſuch Aſſent and Condeſcention: Some
of which I have diſcovered in the beginning of this Diſcourſe in my ſecond
Reaſon, why the Succeſſion of the Crown is annexed to Proximity of Blood.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Wiſe men do not only conſider Things that are acted, but more
eſpecially the Seaſon and Junctures of Time, when thoſe things were acted; and
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> (a great Maſter in the Science of our Law) doth frequently
admoniſh us,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> a.</note> That the true Scope and Deſign of our Statute-Laws, are oftentimes
not at all intelligible, without the help of the Chronicles and Memoirs of that Age,
wherein the ſaid Statute-Laws were made. Of which there cannot be a more
pregnatn Inſtance than this here. And therefore I will in Charity believe, That
the Contrivers of this Objection did never rightly inform themſelves of the Hiſtory,
and true Reaſon of making this Statute, which in Truth was this:</p>
            <p>Some time before this Statute, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (Dowager of <hi>France,</hi>
and the Mother of our King <hi>James)</hi> being diſcomfited in Battel by her own
rebellious Vaſſals of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe (like a Dove purſued by Vultures) fled into
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58871:10"/>
the boſom of her Kinſwoman <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for Protection. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
(who inherited her Father's Malaverſion to the Houſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and contrary
to thoſe Royal Sympathies which one Sovereign Prince ought to have for another
in Diſtreſs; and indeed againſt the Rules of common Hoſpitality) commits <hi>Mary</hi>
to a loathſom Priſon. The Pope, with ſome of the Catholick Princes, and others
of her Friends, thought this was no very kind Treatment, and therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not onely to ſet her at liberty, but alſo to advance her to the Throne; the
generality of Mankind in that Age looking upon the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi>'s Title to be much
clearer than that of the Queen in poſſeſſion,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. cap. 7.</note> the later being baſtardiz'd, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
incapable of the Crown by ſolemn Act of Parliament, which ſtill ſtood unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd,
and therefore valid in Law; at leaſtwiſe but a Statute-Queen, as I prov'd
before: And the former deriving (as is ſhew'd above) by the Common Law, and
a direct true line from <hi>Margaret</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh,
and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Queen. And beſides, in the very year this Statute was made,
there was a Marriage warmly proſecuted between the ſaid Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cambden in 13 Eliz.</note> and
<hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> (who afterwards became King of <hi>France,</hi> upon the death
of his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth;) and no ſmall care was then taken for Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Succeſſion upon the Iſſues proceeding from the ſame Marriage.
And there is a remarkable Clauſe among others in the ſame Statute of 13, <hi>viz.
That every perſon or perſons, of what Degree and Nation ſoever they be, ſhall during the
Queen's Life declare or publiſh, that they have any right to enjoy the Crown of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>during the Queen's Life, ſhall be diſenabled to enjoy the Crown in Succeſſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
or otherwiſe after the Queen's Death.</hi> Which Clauſe was moſt apparently
contriv'd againſt the ſame <hi>Mary</hi> and her Son King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the plain ſcope and deſign of this Statute was, utterly and for ever to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and diſinherit the ſame <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and all her Poſterity, and to
extinguiſh abſolutely that Right to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, which the Laws of God and
Nature, and the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> had given to her and them. And
therefore how any man that pretends Loyalty or Allegiance to His Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
that now is, (who derives his Title lineally from the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of
<hi>Scots)</hi> can object this Statute was a Precedent for Excluſion of the next Heir by Act
of Parliament, I cannot underſtand. And the Objector may do well to conſider,
how far he may enforce this Objection without hazard to his Perſon and Eſtate; for
no man can maintain the validity of this Statute, without manifeſt Derogation and
Injury unto his Majeſty's Title.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; To affirm that the Parliament hath no Power to bind the Succeſſion of
the Crown in point of Deſcent; and to affirm that the Parliament hath no power
to exclude the next Heir of the Bloud Royal, is the ſame Propoſition. Now I have
proved above, That the Succeſſion of the Crown is annex'd to Proximity of Bloud
by the Laws of God and Nature, and that Acts of Parliament contrariant to thoſe
Laws are void. So then the Caſe is no more than this; An Act of Parliament or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains,
that no Perſon under a certain Penalty ſhall dare to affirm, That Statute-Laws
contrary to thoſe of God and Nature are null and void; I think no man ever
did, or doth, or will doubt, but that ſuch Act of Parliament is abſolutely void in
it ſelf, and that the Judges are oblig'd to expound it ſo, when ever it comes before
them in Point of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; This Act of 13 being a Law made (as I have proved above) in diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or rather in open and hoſtile Defiance of the Title of <hi>Scotland</hi> to this Crown,
it was by tacit and implied conſent of the Law, and the whole Nation, utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
upon the firſt moment of the happy Union of the two Crowns in the perſon
of King <hi>James;</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Jac. cap. 1.</note> or at leaſtwiſe by the ſolemn and expreſs Repeal here of all hoſtile
and unkind Laws between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which I am ſure this of 13 was
none of the leaſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall draw towards a Concluſion with a certain appoſite Note,<note place="margin">Rerum Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum Annales lib. 3. Vita Mariae Ré</note> which one of
our <hi>Latin</hi> Hiſtorians makes upon the nine days Reign of <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> and the eaſie
Admiſſion of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tali &amp; conſtanti veneratione nos Angli legitimos Reges proſequimur, ut ab corum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito
obſequio, &amp;c.</hi> Such and ſo conſtant a Veneration (ſaith he) have we <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
for our lawful Princes, that we are not to be drawn from our Allegiance and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58871:11"/>
Loyalty to them, by any colours or ſpecious pretences whatſoever, no not with
the Bait even of Religion it ſelf; of which matter this Caſe of <hi>Jane</hi> may be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
and plain Inſtance: For though the Foundations of her Government were
laid as firm as was poſſible, and the Superſtructure alſo wrought with all the Art and
Cunning in the world; yet as ſoon as ever the lawful and undoubted Heir of the
Crown appear'd, and ſhew'd her ſelf to the People, all this fine and curious Frame
preſently fell to the ground, and was ruin'd as it were in the twincle of an Eye;
and that principally by the hands and induſtry to thoſe very perſons, who upon the
account of Religion were thought to have moſt favoured the Intereſt of <hi>Jane.</hi> And
though the Duke of <hi>Northumberland (Jane</hi>'s Father in Law, and a man of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Subtilty) had inſtructed the Preachers of <hi>London</hi> to cry down the Title, and
blacken the perſon of <hi>Mary</hi> in their Pulpits by all the ways imaginable; yet this
Device was ſmoak'd, and would not take even with the <hi>Londoners</hi> themſelves; no
though <hi>Ridley</hi> their Biſhop (a man of ſingular Sanctity and Perſuaſion, and whoſe
Perſon they paſſionately revered) laboured in the matter with all his Might, &amp;c. So
far the Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>Thus I have (as I conceive) anſwer'd all material Objections, and have likewiſe
made good my Propoſition, <hi>viz. That the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>cannot by the Laws
of</hi> England <hi>exclude the next Heir of the Bloud from Succeſſion to the Crown.</hi> And I
doubt not His Sacred Majeſty that now is, will not in his time ſuffer a Pearl of this
Magnitude and Oriency to be raviſh'd by any Hands out of the Imperial Diadem
of this Realm.</p>
