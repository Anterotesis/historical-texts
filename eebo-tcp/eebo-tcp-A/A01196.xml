            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Trange and wonderfull changes, haue by Gods iust iudgement happened heretofore vnto men, for their horrible and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious crimes, euen in the greatest Empires, Monarchies, and common weales. And like as God, who knoweth how to pull downe the pryde euen of the greatest which abuse their authoritie, hath executed those iudgementes too manifest his iustice: so hath he also set them foorth for example to such as shoulde come after, into whose handes hee woulde put the scepters to rule folke withall: to the intent they might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, that as they report them selues to reigne by his grace, so in very deede they be his Lieuetenantes, &amp; Ministers of his iustice vpon earth, and therfore ought not to abuse that soueraigne and welneere diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, wherewith he hath inhonored them.</p>
            <p>Also, (which thing hath not come to passe without Gods prouidence) there haue euer bin learned men of rare wittes, whiche haue
<pb facs="tcp:12989:3"/>
conueyed the remembrance of suche chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ouer to posteritie, to serue them for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: leauing in writing the causes of such chaunces, with their effectes and diuersities of falling out, to the ende that whensoeuer the like turnings come againe, men may bee in a readines to take the counsel which may be most for their welfare, or at leastwise w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may bee least hurtfull to their Countreys &amp; to their owne personnes. Thucydides the prince of Historiographers among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, affirmeth that his taking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to write the ciuill wars among the Greekes, called the warres of Peloponnesus, whiche were full of diuers chaunges: was for the example of them that were to come after him, when they lighted into warres of the like kinde. And of a trueth, wise men whiche haue aduisedly examined the causes of the ciuill warres, as well which haue been in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ages past, as which haue bin in our age: haue founde many thinges resembling the saide warres of Peloponnesus, whither it be in the causes and the effectes, in difficulties of resolution, in differences of dispositions, in lettes of execution, in treasons, trecheries, surmizes, misreportes, or slaunders agaynste good men, and in such other like incidentes. The like also is to bee seene in other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers:
<pb facs="tcp:12989:3"/>
For the more precisely &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they haue written, the more haue they done vs to vnderstande, that this saying of the Orator is true, <hi>That an Historie is the Scholemistresse of mans life.</hi> And soothly if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any change in the world were notable &amp; worthie to bee imparted to posteritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is that which hath hapned in these Low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </gap> into these warres: or to the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of their forces: to the diuersitie of the causes which mooued them to enter into armes on either part: to the diuersity of their successe, on the one part with secret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises sagely demeaned, and on the other part with wiles, deceites &amp; mischeeues prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised: or to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> treaties of peace &amp; vnitie made, double made, and vnmade againe: to the diuersitie of partes whiche some selfe same persons haue followed almost at one time, or finally to the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the prince that had bin followed with long, aduised, &amp; sage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and to the incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terings that haue bin made to the contrary, &amp; the things that are to ensue therof hereafter: these things (I say) being dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly examined, will shew how there haue been feawe chaunges heretofore,

whiche haue better deserued to come to light, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>that which we haue prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly before our eyes. Which thing maketh vs to hope, that God will not suffer so goodly and rare an example to bee buried, but that hee will stirre vp some wise, learned, and eloquent man, meet to set it forth in writing, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende it to posteritie. Howebeit forasmuch as it is our duetie to helpe him that shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise so great, so high, and so difficulte a woorke: and one (as it were) of most principall and speciall poyntes, fallen out in the inuesting of the Duchie of Brabande in the person of the Lorde Frauncis, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye brother of the Frenche King, Duke of Aniow: and in his entering into the right renowmed citie of Antwerpe: I thought it my duetie to write downe the same truely now while the remembraunce thereof is yet freshe: as well to giue knowledge thereof to stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nations, as to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>¶ The departing of the Mounsire the Duke of Aniow out of England, and the receiuing of him into Zeland.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Queene of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and Mounsire the Duke of Aniowe vnderstoode by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port made to her Maiestie and his highnes by Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire de Pruneaux, (who had bin sent ouer a litle before from the Duke to the Prince of Orenge, and had prosecuted the treatie the former yeres as his ordiniarie Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,) what good will &amp; great longing he had found in the prince of Orenge, who was come into the Ile of Walckeren with a great number of Gentlemen, and with the deputies of the States &amp; of the chiefest and best Cities of the Lowe Countrey, to receiue his highnes and to do him most humble seruice: And when they had also heard the Ambassage of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lords of Ohain and Iunius, sent from the Lordes of the State to the Duke, to shewe vnto him the exceeding great desire whiche all the people had to see his highnes, for the present ratifiyng of the former couenants y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> had passed betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishing wherof it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he shoulde passe ouer with all speede:
<pb facs="tcp:12989:5"/>
wherby the same thing was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed whiche had bin declared oft afore by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord of Mount Saint Aldegond, ordinarie Ambassador to her Maiestie and his highnes: Upon the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of these things, it was resolued by her Maiestie and his highnes, that the Mounsire shoulde depart. Wherevpon the Queene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Lord Haward, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him (for the Erle of Lincolne the high Admirall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sicke,) to take vpon him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge of the Admiralship, and to goe to Rochester, &amp; there to chooze vessels meete for the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Mounsire and his traine, and to furnish them with men of warre, Marriners, and all maner of necessaries as well of warre as of vittels. Which thing was done with such diligence and speede, that the ships being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with all thinges in lesse then eyght dayes, passed out of the riuer of Rochester and the Thames, and were conueyed to the Downes nere to the town of Sandwich, where y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was to take shipping. And forasmuchas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mounsire came into Englande accompanied but with a fewe princes and Lordes, and they also had left their traine in France, &amp; some of the same Lords were sent backe againe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by his commandement &amp; for his seruice.
<pb facs="tcp:12989:6"/>
The Qneene determined to giue him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie &amp; traine meet for his greatnes, taking his iourney about so great and noble exployt. And therefore shee commaunded the Erle of Leycester master of the Horses, the Lorde of Hunsdon gouernour of Barwicke, her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties neare kinnesman, &amp; the L. Hawarde the Uiceadmirall, (of whom the first two were of her priuie Counsell, &amp; al three were Knightes of the order of the Garter,) to attende vpon him, and to assemble as great a number of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe Lordes and Gentlemen, as coulde bee gotten in so litle time, to honour him withall: Whereunto the saide Lordes obeyed verie willingly: and there went with them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, the Lord Willowghbie, the Lorde Windsore, the Lorde Sheffeelde, the Lorde Hawarde, and the Lord Awdley, second sonne to the late Duke of Norffolke: master Sydney, Nephewe to the forenamed Erle of Leycester, sir George Caree, and master Iohn and Robert Caree all three sonnes of the saide Lord of Hunsdon: master William Hawarde brother of the said Lorde Haward: sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shorley, sir Iohn Parrat, sir William Russell, sir William Drurie, and sir George Bowser Knightes, and a great number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:12989:6"/>
Gentlemen, so as the whole traine that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vpon the said Erle, was to the number of a hundred Gentlemen, and of mo than three hundred Seruingmen. The Lord of Hunsdon had of Gentlemen and others together to the number of a hundred and fiftie: and the Lorde Hawarde had as many.</p>
            <p>The Queene determined to accompanie the Mounsire to the seas side: and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse commaunded the said Lords to keepe their course, and to attende vpon his highnes to the said place, with all maner of solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, interteynments and feastings. Hee on the other side desired and besought her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, not to depart out of London, as well for that the iourney would be painefull vnto her, as for that he sawe the wether fayre and winde fauourable, and therefore was loth to loose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion of perfourming his voyage withal speede. But hee coulde not preuaile. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon her Maiestie tooke her iourney with her whole Court, the first day of Februarie, and lodged that night at Rochester. The next day, abiding stil at Rochester, her Maiestie shewed him all her great ships w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in that place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to most whereof his highnesse and the Prince and Lordes of his trayne entered, not without

great admiration of the Frenche Lordes and Gentlemen, who confessed that of good right the Queene of Englande was reported to bee Ladie of the Seas. Also he behilde howe all those shippes were ready furnished and well appointed. And her Maiestie tolde him, that al those vessels and the furniture of them, shoulde doe him seruice whensoeuer he would imploy them: For the which he humbly thanked her Maiestie: and so after all the great ordinance had bin shot of, they returned for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day againe to Rochester.</p>
            <p>The third day they went to Sittingboorne, where dining both together, the Queene was serued after the Englishe maner, by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Ladies of her Court: and the Mounsire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Frenche maner, by the Gentlemen of his traine, which Ladies and Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dined afterward togithers.

Maiestie and the Mounsire. Whiche thing was perceiued also in the Lordes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of both the nations, and likewise in the Ladies, to all whom it was like greefe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part after they had been conuersant and had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued friendly and brotherlie together, by the space of three monethes, without any change or alteration of their good willes. But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which inforced his highnesse, asswaged his griefe, and made him to proceede on his iorney with the said Prince and Lords of both the nations.</p>
            <p>The sixt day of the same moneth, whereas hee was determined to haue taken shippe, hee was counseled to lodge that night at Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiche, because the winde was somewhat chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Howebeit, some of the Englishe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, namely master Killegrey, master Dier and others, to eschewe thronging at their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking, went to Douer, &amp; there taking shipp the same night lay a while at anker, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what after midnight sailed away with certain other vessels.</p>
            <p>The seuenth day, in the morning about ix. of the cloke, his highnesse tooke the sea in three great ships of war. In y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> named <hi>The Discouerer,</hi> sailed the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sire himselfe

with the Erle of Leycester, and the Lorde Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the Uiceadmirall: In the seconde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sentinell,</hi> went the Prince Daulphin: and in the thirde went the countie of Lauall, and the Lord of Hunsdon. Nowe as his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was yet at anker, there came a poste from a Lord of Englande, who brought him worde that the States of the lowe Countreys were reuolted, and namely the citie of Antwerpe, and therefore he prayed him not to depart, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had more certayne newes. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, his highnes determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and so sayled away with fifteene shippes: and hee had so fayre a weather, (whiche conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued euen vntill after his entering into Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe, and his feasting &amp; solemne entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there): that the heauen, the windes, the sea, and the earth seemed all to fauour his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, &amp; to further y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gladnesse which the people shewed in receyuing him with so great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the Prince of Orange, seeing the time fit, departed from Middlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowgh where hee had taryed the Mounsires comming sixe weekes and more, and came to Flushing, to take order for althings that were requisite for the honourable and commodious

interteyning of so great a Prince. At y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which place, vnderstanding by the letters of the saide Lords Ambassadors &amp; others, that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was departed from London and comd to Cauntorburie: and therefore thinking that it woulde not be long ere he arriued there: hee dispatched Mounsire Treslon his viceadmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Zelande with a little Pynnesse called the Chasse, to goe before to meete the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: commaunding him that as soone as hee had discouered his fleete, hee shoulde giue him a watch worde thereof by the shot of two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. Mounsire Treslon hauing about noone tyde discouered the shippes that were parted from Douer, and thinking that they had been the great fleete: gaue his watchworde, whiche was the cause that a certaine vessel went forth to the sea to meete his highnesse. But anone after, perceiuing his errour, he returned to Flushing, where by and by the fleete of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer arriued. Then Mounsieur Treslon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth, founde the Mounsire and the great fleete betweene Newporte and Dunkirke: where after salutation giuen and taken on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the Mounsire standing vpon the Hatches of his shippe, espied his owne Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

His shippes were perceiued by them of Flush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where anone after midnight arriued the Lorde of S.

Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prince of Orenge and the prince of Es pynoy with a great number of Gentlemen tooke sea the next morning, but because the tyde was against them: and on the other part the Mounsire hauing a side winde with him was constrained to haste to the Lande: by meanes thereof the Prince being not able to come aboorde to him with his ship, was fayne to turne sayle back againe to Flushing, where the Prince Daulphin had taken lande alredy,

and sought euery where for the prince his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Whereunto the Mounsire answered very wisely and breefly, And when he had imbraced him with such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as was dew in respect of his age and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: he came a land, and was brought by the prince to the palace of the citie, howbeit not

The Mounsire found in that place all sortes of his Officers: for his housholde and his garde of Swisses and Frenchmen, departing from Caleis and Bolloin foure dayes afore, were come to Middlebrowgh.

            <p>Unto all these Orations his highnesse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered very sagely and breefly as vnto all the residew, to the well liking and coutentment of all that stood by.</p>
            <p>The prince of Orendge taryed a while with the Mounsire in the towne house of the citie: and then taking his leaue went to visit the princes and Lords of both the nations that came with him, to see how they fared, and to take order that they shoulde want nothing, so farre foorth as the abilitie of the towne of Flushing (whiche is none of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test) coulde extende, where suche prouision was made, that all were well lodged and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, notwithstanding that aboue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Also the foure members of Flaunders, which came by the councell of the prince of Orendge, wayted to present themselues vnto

            <p>The Prince of Orendge perceyuing that the Monsyre was mynded to go next daye too middlebrowgh, told him that there were three wayes The one about by the castle of Rame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins to euter in at the great chanell of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlebrowgh, by the bowght of the foreland. An other by the little chanell through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye: and that he had kept shippes in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes too goe the outer way, and a greate sorte of boates to goe the inner waye, because his highnesse could not iourney eyther by coche or on horsebacke by reason of the winter: and there was but onely one causey whereby folk traueled ordinarily on foote. The Mounsire beholding the fitnesse of the time, (for in deede it was very fayre wether, and vnderstanding that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way was not past a good french league in length, vndertooke to go it on foote: and so did all the rest of the princes lordes and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as well of the same countrie, as of Fraunce and England. A greate sorte of the Mounsires house whiche were lodged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at Middlebrough, came to meete him, specially his gard of Frenchmen and Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.

as it were about a third part of the way: and there making an oration to him, tolde him of the great and long desire which all the people had of his comming, and that the people of Middlebrowgh for their owne parte thought themselues greatly honoured, in that hee had voutsafed to come to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His gard also met him in the same place, and then began y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Swis sers to march on in their order, stryking vppe their drums after their maner.

            <p>The deputies of the states of the Erledome of Zeland, wayted his comming at the towne gate. Who hauing declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gladnes which they conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braye by his armye and in his owne person, and in his passinge into England, which they knewe he had taken vpon him for none other cause, then for the furtherance of the affaires of those countries, &amp; finally for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hauing put his person in danger of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> passage, he was now

happilie arriued in zeland: most humbly than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his highnes, &amp; declaring what hope they had conceiued of his presence and therewithall offering right humbly what soeuer their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required.</p>
            <p>At the entery of the gate one brought him a courser of Naples: but he determined with himselfe, (seeing that the princes and Lordes had not their horses there) to go through with his iourney on foote, and so entered into the citie of Middlebrowgh in this order.</p>
            <p>First went the Magistrates of the citie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their vnder officers and ministers of Justice. Next them the deputies of the states of Zela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. After them followed diuers Gentlemen of all the three nations, with the deputies of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Braband, and of the foure members of Flaunders. Then marched the Swissers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their accustomed fashion: in whose traine were a great sort of noblemen and Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of whom the most part were Englishmen of the retinew of the three Lords sent thither by the Queene. Behind them insewed as it were in one troope togither, the Prince Daulphin, the Earle of Leycester, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of Espinoy, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> countie de Laual the lord of Hunsdon, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lorde
<pb facs="tcp:12989:13"/>
Haward, and the rest of the Lordes. Then came the Mounsire himselfe, hauing on his left hand some what more than halfe a pace beneath him, the prince of Orendge, of whom he alwayes asked some question. After him followed his gard of Frenchmen, and after them the garde of the Prince of Orendge, and last of all the six ensignes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stood in battel ray without the citie, and tenne others whiche had marshalled the streetes vnto the market place, where all the rest of the citizens were imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled. Throughout all the streetes from the gate to the Mounsires lodging, there were rayles: and at euery tenth pace on eyther side were burning cressets. And so his hignesse and all the nobilitie which accompanied him, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on, maruelling to see so goodly a citie in so little an yle, and so neere to three other good townes, not distant one from another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue one league. But most of all they woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the beautie of the marketsted, and of the common hall of the citie. His highnesse lodging was verie well and richly hanged &amp; furnished, considering the small respit that the inhabitants had: so as hee was very well and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that attended vpon him. That euening was passed in feasting, in making of bonfires in the streetes, in artificiall fire woorkes vppon the towres and steeples, and in sounding of trumpets.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the twelue deputies of the foure members of Flaunders, speaking to his hignes by the mouth of Mounsire Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the Recorder of Gaunt, declared at large the great good wil of al the people of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders cowards him, and that lyke as they had been of the first that had sent vnto him, so they hoped to be of the first that should yeeld al hum ble seruice and subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him. Wherunto his highnes answered very discreetly, as his custome was. He passed the rest of the time in playing at tennis, with the Prince of Orendge and afterwarde with the other Lordes.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth day he had a solemne feast made him in the Townehall, where his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes commaunded the tables too bee prepared of purpose, that he might haue the company of the Prince Daulphin, the prince of Orendge, the Earle of Leycester, the Prince of Espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, the Countie de Lauall, the Lord of Huns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the Lord Haward. For the Lordes
<pb facs="tcp:12989:14"/>
of England were highly regarded and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euery where, both in respect of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie which sent them, and also for the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of their persons. The feast was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well furnished of all things, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of tapistrie worke and other deuices of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: insomuch that both the Frenchmen and Englimen confessed, that they had not beene woont to see suche maner of seruices in their countreys.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth day, the prince of Orendge would needes goe see the putting of the ships in a readines, which should cary the Mounsire and his traine, which were in number foure and fiftie: and therefore he would haue gone to the foreland of Middlebrowgh. Whereof the Mounsire hearing, woulde needes goe with him.</p>
            <p>On thursday the fisteenth of that moneth, his highnes went to see the town of Ermwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which is about halfe a league from Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlebrowgh. And vnderstanding that the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish lords were gone to see the Towne of Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, (called by straungers Camfer by reason of the passage that was sometime in the towne of Camp which is now drowned) he also tooke boate and went thither, where all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany

was very well receiued by the inhabitantes, notwithstanding that they were taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided.</p>
            <p>The sixteenth day, his highnes was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to haue taken ship: but there arose so great a storme, that the marriners counselled him to forbeare the sea for that day: by reason whereof his imbarking was deferred till the next morrow, at which time his highnes wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This fleete came y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> daye against Beerlande in the yle of South Beueland, where they cast ancre &amp; spent that night there.</p>

And therefore when great personages (who can better iudge of matters tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plain simple folk can) do make discourse of things that are beautifull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable to behold: they speake of gold, siluer, precious stones, pictures, vessels, tablets, and diuers other exquisit Iewels: but yet they passe ouer those things and stand not vppon them, but when they come to talke of fayre armour, good horses and suche other thinges as belong to knighthoode and chiualry: then
<pb facs="tcp:12989:17"/>
they make such taryance vpon them, as they hold it for a thing fully agreed vppon and graunted that in beautie and glory nothing is comparable to a goodly armie. Onely this matter remaineth still in question vndecided: namely whether is the pleasanter sight, to see three or foure great battels of footemen well appointed in bright armour, wel flanked with small shot, and with their greate ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: or to see as many Squadrons of horsemen, or else twoo or three hundred ships furnished with their flagges and banners, and raunged in order as if they were ready to giue battel.

<pb facs="tcp:12989:18"/>
of Frauncis Duke of Brabant into the Citie of Antwarpt, seemed so goodly and royall to all suche as sawe it: insomuche that there hath not been anye of them whiche hath not confessed that hee neuer saw the like. And yet were there very many present at it, as well of the same countrey as of straungers, whiche haue seene many stately and royall meetings, both in the same citie and in other cities of the Lowe countreys, and also in other great cities of other Countreys, as Paris, London, Roan, and Lions: and yet neuerthelesse the common voyce is, that this last hath passed all the rest. And truly the Citie had no more but sixe daies respit to prepare for it, as I sayde before: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they coulde not put to making any worke of silke, nor of golde aud siluer beaten or wouen, nor any embroderie: no nor in so shorttime make any meane apparell newe, nor any rare costlinesse of imagertes, pillers, tryumphall arches or other pageantes: but were constrayned to make a shifte with suche thinges as they had in a readinesse aforehande of their own store. In other entertemements, there haue in deede been seene great plentie of riches and royalties in attires of Kinges and Queenes, Princes and Princesses, Lords and
<pb facs="tcp:12989:18"/>
Ladies, Citizens and their wiues: but in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> entertainement no such were seene: howebeit there was not any grossenesse, nor ought that might not well beseeme the neatnes and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that people, although it came nothing neere the sumptuousnesse of other intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As touching triumphall arches, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, Portratures and such other Showes: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were many wittie inuentions &amp; agreeable to the time: yet haue men seene of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in other places, which might match these. And as touching the number of their people, although it was great: yet it is well knowen that Paris exceedeth them in that behalfe. But the only reason of this contentment, commeth chiefly of the great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people in armour, being not fewer then twentie thousande, in so good and so fayre armour: and of their order &amp; obedience, and of the small noyse which al that huge multitude made: insomuch that if it had not bin for the thundering of the Canons, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sounding of Trumpets, Clarions, Halboies, and other instrumentes, there was no more noyse than is among a Counsel of graue men. That the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in mine opinion the onely very cause, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was greatly furthered by their behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Mounsire of Braband, who represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the

statelines of old tyme, was clothed in a large Mantle, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bonnet of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon his head: so that among that great number of people, which were so well armed that three of the best cities in Christendome coulde not shewe so many fayre armours of their owne:) his highnesse resembled a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone or Iewel set in fine gold. And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that they which were the beholders ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (for they could not be euery where, nor see e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing) will be very glad to vnderstand of the things that so escaped them, and delight their mindes now with the remembrance of the things which they sawe before, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted their eyes and mindes with the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them that day: And strange nations too whom the fame of that so renowmed daies woorke is come, will take pleasure to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the same, whereof they could not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: Therefore is this booke set foorth, for the satisfiyng of all men, and also to make it knowen to a number of men, (who partely for enmitie, partly for enuy, and partely for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther surmizes and mistrustes will not beleeue it,) with what mind and affection the Prince of Orendge, and the other Lordes and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Braband, the good cities, and the small

Townes, and namely the most renowmed ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Antwerp, haue receiued their new prince and soueraine Lord.</p>
            <p>The nienteenth day of the foresaid moneth in the forenoone, Mounsire y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Duke of Aniow departed from Lisloo and sayled towardes Antwery, hauing in his companie but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shippes: for the rest had gotten to Antwery afore, as well to put themselues in a readines as for other affaires.

By the waye he heard all the Canons shot of from that part of the towne which faceth the riuer, &amp; from a great number of shippes which rode at ancre there: and he saw all the wharfes furnished with men of warre of the citie, well armed, who welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med him with their shot, and were answered againe by the shippes of warre that accompanied him, conducted by Mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12989:20"/>
the Canon wharfe of Antwerpt. The states of Braband, the Magistrats of the Citie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other States, comming in like order on horsebacke to the same place with their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Serieants and Heraults apparelled in cotes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armes of Lothyer, Braband, &amp; Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourge: alighted there, and wayted on foote at the wharfe to receiue his highnesse, and to shewe him the good will and affection of the States and people. But the preace of people was so great, which resorted thither to see the prince, whom they looked for to be their duke: and againe there were so many impediments in his landing: that it was founde better for them by the aduice of the prince of Orenge, to returne backe and to tary for his highnesse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Theatre which was prepared for him.</p>
            <p>This Theatre was set vp towards a corner of the Castle, and opened towardes the citie, so as his highnes being there, might at one time view both the Citie and the Castle, and behold the Counterskarfes: the deepe Ditches full of fayre water cleere to the verye bottome of the chanell, inclozed on eyther syde with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen stone: the great and fayre buildinges, the goodly walles, beawtifull to looke on and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

The Mounsire was brought vp to this Theatre accompanied with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prince Daulphin the only sonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panuser: the Erle of Leycester, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Lords representing the Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande: the Princes of Orendge and Espinoy, the countie de Lauall, the other english Lords, the Countie de Chateauroux, and a great sort of other barons, lords &amp; gentlemen, besids the chiefe Magistrates and Maisters of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Citie of Antwerpe.</p>
            <p>The Lordes of the State of Brabande waiting vpon the Theatre, came duetifully downe to go meete his highnesse: which thing hee perceiuing, did stand still. Then the prince of Orendge stepped foorth to take his place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the States, as one of the chiefe Lordes and Barons of the Duchie of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. As soone as they had saluted his highnesse, and with great humblenesse kissed his hande, they mounted vp the steppes againe with him, after whom followed the Princes and Lordes of Fraunce and Englande, and when they were come vp aboue, they raunged
<pb facs="tcp:12989:21"/>
themselues on eyther side. There was set for the Mounsire a chayre couered with cloth of gold, wherin he sat him down.

            <p>

            <p>Then Mounsieur Hesselles taking the book ageine, told the people that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Dukes of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band made another second othe to the Baro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Noblemen, Cities, Boroughes, and all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes and subiectes of the countrey, too bee to them a good and iust Prince, and not to deale with them after his owne will, nor by way of rigor, but by law and iustice, and according too their priuiledges.

Wherevntoo when his highnesse had agreed: the Prince did first put vpon him the sayde mantle, and fastening the button thereof, sayd theis wordes: My Lord, you must keepe this button fast clozed, that no man may pull your mantle from you. And then he set the bonnet vppon his head, and sayde vnto him: Sir, I pray God you may well keepe this attyre, for nowe you may well assure your selfe that you be Duke of Braband.</p>
            <p>Then the saide Hesselles tolde him howe the custome required, that the States shoulde presentlie bee sworne too him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine, to yeelde him fealtie. Wherevppon he vttered to the people the forme of the othe: and then the saide Chauncelor required it of the Barons, noblemen and deputies: and they pronounced it after him according too

the manner of the former othes, reuerently doing againe their homage, &amp; promising their fealtie and obedience.</p>
            <p>After the taking of the othes on both sides, as well by the Mounsire as by the States of Brabande, whyle his highnesse was yet still in his robes of estate, the Magistrates of Antwerpe commaunded their Recorder and Counseller Master Uan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwerck too come vp vpon the stage, to make him an offer of the Marqueshipp of the sacred Empyre, in the name of the citie of Antwerp. Which thing he did as followeth:</p>

But now, forasmuch as they see your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not onely arriued in the countrie of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but also receiued for Duke, and for their prince &amp; lord: their foreco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ioy is greatly increased and made fully perfect: trusting y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by this your comming, there will once ensue an end of the desolations, calamities and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whereinto the Country hath bin brought by the vniust gouernment past, &amp; by the more vniust and wrongfull warre which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hold yet still, to bring the whole country too destruction, with all manner of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and oppressions, which they are able to deuise.

               <p>His highnesse passed on and with verie much adoo came to the great Market place, by reason of the infinite multitude of people, which could not be put asunder without great payne. As soone as hee was alighted from his horse, he went vp a scaffold which had bin set vp for the same purpose, in the middes of the Market place hard by the Towne howse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom went the Magistrate of the citie, and a greate number of Princes Lordes and Gentlemen. This Scaffold being great and large, of the heigth of fortie foote, was hanged with scarlet. Upon it was a cloth of estate, the backe whereof was cloth of gold frized, vnder the which was a chayre of the same. The day of his first comming thither, there had bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto him on the right side, <hi>Wisdome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him a golden Scepter:</hi> on his lefte side, <hi>Iustice offering him the sworde of Iustice from aboue the Chayre:</hi> and behinde him <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie offering him the Cap of the Dukedome.</hi> Before the chayre as it were at the feete of it, were <hi>Obedience, Faithfulnes, Loue of God, and Reuerence.</hi> And by the chayres sides

But on this day when his highnesse went vp too this stage, the Nymphes were away. And in steed of them, the chaire was garnished on both sides with pyllers. On the right side be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the pillers was a Lyon holding a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked swoorde, to betoken the authoritie of the magistrate. Aboue the Lyon was an Eagle feeding her young, and turning her selfe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes the shyning of the Sunne, as taking her force of the Prince. On the left side was an Oxe with a yoke on his necke, and aboue him a Hen brooding her chickens, and by her a cocke.

Assuring them selues that your heighnesse wilbe vnto them a good, righteous, and lawfull Prince, to gouerne them according to their fraunchises, Lawes and Customes: And promising mutually on their behalfe to your heighnesse, to bee good, loyal and faythful subiects vnto you, to spend all their goodes yea and their liues in your seruice, and in the maintenaunce of your dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, rightes and preheminences. And like as God hath put into your highnes minde, to take vpon you, first the protection and defence, and secondly the whole Souereigntie of the Low Countries and Prouinces, which haue entred into league with you, vpon hope that the same God, will of his gratious goodnesse and mercie, so blesse and prosper your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and enterprises: as that they shall out of hand see the effecte of that communication

               <p>When Uanderwerk had made an end, and the Dukes heighnes had aunswered him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to that which hee had spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Towne: the said Uanderwerk told the people alowd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Duke was ready to take &amp; receiue his oth, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hand of the Magistrate &amp; of al the people &amp; Inhabiters of the Citie of Antwerp. And that god had vouchsafed to se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Prince of so rare and heroycall vertues, of so great puissaunce, and the onely brother of so great a king: that they might well hope, that the same God would inable him to ridde these Countries within a while, from the great number of calamities and myseries wherewith they were oppressed. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as his heighnesse had beene recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with solempne delyberation of the states
<pb facs="tcp:12989:46"/>
confederate, yea and with solemne resolution of all the members of that Citie, and GOD had commaunded men to loue, honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Princes: he exhorted the people to yeelde him all humble obedience according to Gods commaundement. To which intent, the oth as well which his highnesse should make to the people, as which the people shoulde make to his highnes, should be read vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Praying God to giue such grace vnto his heighnes, as he folowing the same, might wel rule &amp; gouerne: and vnto the Burgesses and Citizens of Antwerp, as they might perform their obedience like good, loyall and faythfull subiects: that Gods name might be sanctified, to the benefit, prosperitie and safegarde of the Citie, and to the great increase of the Dukes puyssaunce, honour and glory.</p>
               <p>Then the same Underwerk red the othe which was to be made by the Duke, with the style of the Duke of Brabande, and all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tytles.

               <p>Uppon the finishing of these solemnities, the Duke himselfe did cast twoor three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulles of golde and siluer amonge them, and then the Herauldes cryed Alargesse, and the trumpettes and drummes were sounded eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye where, and many instruments of musicke were played vpon, as had beene doone afore at his first arryuall.</p>

Hee wan the victorie in nine foughten fieldes, in most of the which hee was put to the tryall and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde of his person, by fighting with his own handes. He was a very sage Prince, and such a one as had to deale with the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Christendome: of whom some were his aduersaries, and yet hee behaued himselfe so wisely, that he atchieued all thinges to his honour, whatsoeuer hee tooke in hande. Also hee was very rich: insomuch that for all his wars, which lasted aboue thirtie yeares, hee lefte behinde him more substance and readye monie then any other Prince of his time, as the Writers of the hystories of that age doe witnesse vnto vs. And yet notwithstanding, for al these great vertues and qualities of his, he was not named Philip the sage, nor Philip the valiaunt, nor Philip the rich: but Phillip the good. So well doe al folke by generall consent vnderstande, which is the vertue that best beseemeth and beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a great Prince, and is best lyked of his people: namely that a Prince bee good and louing to his subiectes. Surely Syr, all men hope that your Heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

will followe the example of that good Prince, the first bringer of the state of this Countrie to perfection, a right noble and renoumed prince of the house of France. And we praise God, for that as manye as haue had the honour to come into your heighnesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, yeelde record that you haue very great likelyhods of these vertues, which we prays God so to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish and make perfect in you, as al his people may to your great honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the perfect and rype fruits of them. And this doe al the rest of the people desire as wel as we. Howbeit, we haue a most humble suite to make perticularly to your heighnes, which we most humbly beseech you to graunt. The thing that induceth vs to doe it, is that you beare the name of Frauncis. For as oft as we heare that name named: the remembraunce of that great king Frauncis, your heighnesse graundfather commeth to our minde. He was a right valiant, couragious, noble and godlye Prince: and yet notwithstanding, all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth, did by one common consent surname him the Father of learning. For of a truth, since that Emperour and great king of Fraunce, called Charles the great, there was neuer any king of Fraunce that so heighly
<pb facs="tcp:12989:50"/>
fauoured learning, as this great king Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. And as the sayd king Charles was the founder of the famous vniuersitie of Paris: so was king Frauncis the restorer thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and both of them to their great costes &amp; charges, called men of excellent knowledge thither out of straung countries, to teach the languages &amp; al kindes of artes and sciences. The house of this great king Frauncis was as an vniuersitie, and his table was a place of conference concerning al maner of learning. And like as other great Princes of his time following his example, inriched their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and kingdomes with learned men and learning: so wee most humbly beseech your heighnes, to follow the example of this great king your grandfather, in doing the like, and to make singular account of learning, and to take the professours thereof vnder your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. True it is Syr, that through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of men, war is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the ouerthrower of fearning.

In respect whereof, as wee meant not to desire your heighnesse to forget those which make profession of chiualrie, whome you ought to imbrace as your strength: so we most humbly beseech you to vouchsafe to succour learning, and to maintaine learned men with your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fauour. Sir, very needeful causes moue vs to make this humble petition to your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: first for that we being professors of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:12989:51"/>
ought to haue learning in singular esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and to procure, if it be possible for vs, that the fruite of the thinges which we haue inioyed for a time, may be conueied to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie: and secondly for the othes sake which we haue taken at the time of our proceeding in our degrees, which is, to maintain and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the schooles and learning of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, in what degree soeuer wee come vnto. And therefore wee hope that your heighnesse will doe vs the honour, to take this most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble request of ours in good parte. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own persons, we promise your heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all obedience, faithfulnesse and subtecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that according to our small abilitie, wee will doe our indeuour towardes such as we may haue accesse vnto, that they also may yeelde obedience to your heighnes, and to the Magistrates whome it shall please you to set ouer the people. And here to make an ende, wee hartely pray God to preserue your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes long time, in happy estate amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to giue you the grace to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them iustlye and vprightly: to rydde them out of the handes of their enemyes: to maynetayne them longe in happy peace, and to restore this state agayne to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

dignitie, greatnes, renowme, &amp; feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie: that after your deceasse you may leaue a most blessed and famous rememembrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong al nacions. And for the bringing hereof too passe, wee yet agayne beseech the king of kings &amp; great prince of princes, too make you as valiant as Dauid, as wyse as Salomon, &amp; as zelous of his glorie as Ezechias.</p>
