         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Considering that in these first foure Verses hee defineth, or rather describeth what IEALOVSIE is; and there being two manner of Distinctions, the one, which declareth her name, the other, which sheweth her nature: pleaseth it you first to vnderstand that this Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Gelosia,</hi> that is, IEALOVSIE, commeth in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) signifieth no other thing, than a certaine Emulation, or an Enuy, of Forme, or Beautie: which name it seemeth that the Latines want. <note n="*" place="margin">Definitions of IEALOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIE.</note> True it is that that famous Orator <hi>Marke Tully,</hi> translated it <hi>Obtrectatio,</hi> and defined it to be a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, wherewith some one man is possessed, least another, should holde and enioy that vvhich hee, onely coueteth to possesse and keepe alone. Others affirme, that IEALOVSIE is a certaine suspition which the Louer hath, of the party he chiefely loueth, least she should be enamoured of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19642:15"/>
another. A third sort there is, that saith, IEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVSIE is a fearefull and timerous suspicion or Doubt in the Louer, least the Woman whom hee affecteth, and whom hee would not haue to be common with any other man, should lend her body vnto another. All which three are in effect one, and the selfe-same thing, but yet particularly, and not vniuersally, as the right and perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions vse to be set downe, because they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that Party onely, which is iealous, by reason of his owne desire and proper longing or coueting; that is, that hee might (alone) enioy, what hee most wished for; as if there were no Iealousie to be had of our Daughters, Mothers, Sisters, or others, eyther shee kinred or Friends, which are left in our Custody, Wardship, and Protection, and whom wee desire to haue (not to enioy them our selues) but least some other, whom wee mislike or disdayne, should (against our wils, and to the disparagement of our Honor) get possession and interest in them.<note place="margin">The Authors defining of IEALOVSIE.</note> And therefore wee will say that IEALOVSIE is a certaine Feare or Doubt, least any one whom we would not, should enioy a Beautie that wee make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of; and, this, for two Reasons, eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee our selues would enioy the same alone, or else, that such a one as we like and desire, might haue the sole fruition and possession thereof. Now there is no doubt but that <note n="g" place="margin">Enuy is a vice that inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth those most extreamely, that vse itmost, and it (imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately) succeedeth Pride, by nature; for a proud man so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himselfe, that he grieues that any should excell him, which when he cannot auoid, then hee enuies them: and this is the difference betwixt Hatred and Enuy; Hate extendeth to Some, Enuy to All, whereupon one saith: <q>
                     <l>Enuy is nothing else but griefe of minde,</l>
                     <l>Conceiu'd that Others Happinesse doe finde:</l>
                     <l>'Tis Honours shame, and Glories secret Foe,</l>
                     <l>Whose Fruits are Hate, Despight, sad Griefe and Woe.</l>
                  </q>
               </note> IEALOVSIE is a Spice or Species of Enuy, and although it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not of necessitie, that wheresoeuer Enuy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19642:15"/>
is, there IEALOVSIE should be, yet is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that wheresoeuer IEALOVSIE is the Precursor, there Enuy must be the Follower al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as that which is a liuing Creature, is not a man, and yet euery man is a liuing Creature. Whereupon <hi>Plato</hi> defineth a Iealous man to be one, that hath an enuie or malice towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reason of some amorous suspicion, which hee conceiueth against him. And for this cause (perhaps) our non-paraleld Poet <hi>Petrarcq</hi> in one of his sweet Sonnets, saith thus:

And <note n="t" place="margin">Poetry is farre more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended then Prose, being far more honor to the Language it writes in, than the other, both because Poets were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Orators, and for that to write in Verse is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, more cunning, and more delightfull euery way.

Now, the reason of this is, for that whosoeuer doth feare, waxeth pale and colde as a stone, because Dread and Feare draw vp, and weaken the heart, wherevpon Nature (to succour and comfort the same) the <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Booke <hi>De na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Anim.</hi> saith, the heart of man, is lodged on the left side of his body, but in all other creatures else, it is naturally in the middest of their brest. And it is a common receiued opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among all Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that the very first part which is formed of man, is the heart of man, (as the maine roote of all his other members, and the spring and fountaine of naturall heate) and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the onely member that last looseth his moouing, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man; It being a member so noble and delicate, that it cannot endure any touching, but presently the party dyeth.</note> Heart being the most noble part of man, and being that which (according to the <hi>Peripatetical</hi> Philosophers, is the first of all the Body that hath life, and the last that dyeth) disperseth and sendeth the bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that is aboue it, and finding that not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, conueyeth that bloud also, for his ayde and helpe which is below; and hereof commeth the palenesse in a mans face, and the fearefull cold, hee hath therewithall. Besides, a man trembleth and shaketh for Feare, by reason that (the Heart trembling) all the whole Body shaketh after his first stirring.

                  <l>Tutto il regno d' Amor turbi &amp; contristi.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>By which (thou) all the Kingdome of milde Loue</l>
                  <l>Dost trouble, heauy make, and too much moue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In these few words of this Verse onely, all the griefes and discontentments which can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in loue, are here (generally) contayned, which by how much it is pleasing and sweet of it selfe, by so much the more it is distastfull and vnpleasant, being mixed with IEALOVSIE, no otherwise than if a most bitter poyson should be mingled with some excellent and pure Sugar or Honey.</p>
            <p>But it is now high time, to come vnto the rest of the other Stanzaes, which we will quicklie dispatch as soone as we shall deliuer and show, that not without great skill and Iudgement, these foure first verses were wouen, and knit together, for as much as euery one of them concludeth with a fit sentence (as it were) and so likewise end: which, besides a certaine kinde of Grauitie, with a maiesticq manner of disdaine, (that is included within them) force there Auditors, the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely to heare them: this sort of workmanship being as cunningly contriued by our fore-said graue <hi>Bembo,</hi> in a Sonnet of his where hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <note n="z" place="margin">Hope is a pleasant passion of the minde, which doth not onely promise vs those things that wee doe desire, but such things also as we haue vtterly despayre of, and therefore one speaketh wittily to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, saying; <hi>Hope</hi> is the Fooles God, the Merchants Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the Souldiers Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Ambitious Mans poyson: but yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this last Definition, <q>
                     <l>Hope is the sad Hearts helpe, the sicke Thoughts Friend.</l>
                     <l>And what Distrust impaires, Hope doth amend.</l>
                     <l>True Hope is swift, and flyes with Swallowes wings,</l>
                     <l>Kings it makes Gods, and meanest Creatures Kings.</l>
                  </q>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hope</hi> thus:
<q>
                  <l>Speme, che gli'occhi nostri veli, &amp; fusci,</l>
                  <l>Sfreni, &amp; sferzi le voglie, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Thou <hi>Hope,</hi> which cloud'st and shadow'st our sight still,</l>
                  <l>Which forward yerk'st &amp; whipst our courage &amp; our wil.</l>
                  <l>Thou <hi>Hope,</hi> the Bread and Food of hungry men,</l>
                  <l>(Louers I meane) they oft are hungry then.</l>
               </q>
And so forth, as in the Sonnet.</p>

               <hi>Giacci,</hi> and not <hi>Campi,</hi> you must read (as I haue seene in some Copies) and this is a certaine Poeticall description of HELL, and very rightly, and fitly doth he will her to returne to Hell, from whence she came; since (certainely) it is a right Furie indeed, <hi>Ariosto</hi> hauing Christned it by the name of an infernall plague. And therefore you must note, that as euery thing which is good and fayre, is said to proceed and come from Paradise; so contrariwise, All, whatsoeuer is foule, and bad, we terme to come from Hell? as <hi>Virgill</hi> saith that desperate Gaming, and ghastly Famine issue from thence: <hi>Petrarcq</hi> speaking as much of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> Looking-glasse, after this manner:
<q>
                  <l>Questo fu fabricato sopra l'acque,</l>
                  <l>d' Abisso, &amp; tinto nel eterno oblio,</l>
                  <l>Onde il principio dimio morte nacque.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>No doubt, some Fiend, this Looking-glasse did make,</l>
                  <l>Within the waters of th'infernall Lake;</l>
                  <l>Forgetfulnesse eternall, dyed the same</l>
                  <l>From whence (at first) did spring my mortall bane.</l>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:19642:30"/>
And in another place, taxing the Court of Rome, he calleth it the HELL of the Liuing; as in a third passage hee termeth the World after this manner; when he wrote thus:

But now to the rest.

Meaning, she should there tortor her selfe, and not be grieuous and troublesome vnto others, and in this sort doth he paint and set forth the Nature and Conditions of IEALOVSIE, which <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douicq Martelli</hi> hath no lesse elegantly, than elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently set downe in one of his Canzons, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Loue, and which, because I perceiue you stand attentiue to heare, I will most willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you withall.</p>

Yet neuerthelesse, the same Poet in the first Stanza of his Canzon, of his transformations, taketh it in this our sense, when he saith:
<q>

               </q>
And this is worth the noting (as I said a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that one Tuscan word alone, should signifie two things; and those so much different one from another: the Latines likewise, hauing the like sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in these two Verbes: <hi>Miseret,</hi> and <hi>Taedet:</hi> It pittieth me, and it irketh me.

               </note> discontentment and disquietnesse in the minde, so that hee is not able, nor hath-any power to giue ouer from vexing himselfe, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (alwayes) watchfull with his cares wide open, to hearken and listen to euery word, euery voyce, euery sound, and euery winde: all which, hee taketh in a wrong and sinister sence, conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing (euermore) worse of the same than hee neede. And therefore <hi>Propertius</hi> excuseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, about this fault, in one of his Elegies, thus:
<q>
                  <l>Omnia me terrent, timidus sum, ignosce timori,</l>
                  <l>Et miser in tunica suspicor esse virum;</l>
                  <l>Me laedit, simulta tibi dabit oscula, mater</l>
                  <l>Me, Soror, &amp; cum qua dormit Amica simul.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Each thing affrights me, I doe feare</l>
                  <l>Ah pardon mee, my feare.</l>
                  <l>I doubt a man is hid within</l>
                  <l>The cloathes which thou dost weare:</l>
                  <l>If thine owne Mother kisse thee (oft)</l>
                  <l>Or Sister thine, I grieue:</l>
                  <l>I feare the Mayde that lyeth with thee,</l>
                  <l>And in thy House doth liue.</l>
                  <l>Each thing makes me suspect; I looke</l>
                  <l>With iealous watchfull eye;</l>
                  <l>The Nurse makes me to doubt, and Childe</l>
                  <l>That doth in Cradle lye.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And this, <hi>Petrarcq</hi> reprehending as a vaine and impossible thing, saith:
<q>
                  <l>Pur come Donna in vn vestire schietto.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:19642:32"/>
                  <l>As if a woman in her Gowne,</l>
                  <l>Or in a slender Vayle,</l>
                  <l>A liuing man should (secret) hide,</l>
                  <l>Which is a senslesse tale.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, this franticque Humour, runneth on (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes) so farre, as it taketh away a mans senses, as if hee were not the same partie hee was before: whereupon, all those things not onely proceede which <hi>Horace</hi> setteth downe in that pleasant Ode of his: beginning,
<q>
                  <l>Cum te Lydia, Telephi, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>With thee my wanton Lydia,</l>
                  <l>Who giuen art o'er much to play &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But, which is more, we are afraid of our owne shadow: which <hi>Propertius</hi> confesseth thus:
<q>
                  <l>Ipse meas solus (quod nil est) aemuler vmbras,</l>
                  <l>Stultus, quod stulto saepe timore, tremo.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>I mine owne shadowes dread, alone,</l>
                  <l>Which (nothing are) in vaine,</l>
                  <l>And, like a foole, through foolish feare,</l>
                  <l>Oft put my selfe in paine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And the learned <hi>Molza,</hi> imitating this Poet, beginneth one of his Sonnets, after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, writing thus:
<q>
                  <l>Io son del mio bel sol, tanto Geloso.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>So Iealous am I of my beauteous Sunne,</l>
                  <l>As (scarsely) can I brooke,</l>
                  <l>(Such is my doubt) that any should</l>
                  <l>As much as on her looke.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And because (as I said before) IEALOVSIE is a kinde of <hi>Enuy,</hi> grieuing as much at anothers Good, as shee doth at her owne hinderance and hurt. Iealous folke are content to endure any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity whatsoeuer, vpon condition that no other shall enioy the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>And hereupon our amorous Poet <hi>Tibullus,</hi> speaketh thus in an Elegie of his:
<q>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:19642:32"/>
                  <l>At tu fallacis Coniux incaute puellae,</l>

               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>But thou (kinde Witall) Husband thou</l>
                  <l>Vnto my subtle Wench,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What shall I say more: such as be iealous, feare not men onely, but likewise suspect and doubt the Gods themselues; and therefore saith <hi>Ouid</hi> in his Epistles for <hi>Sappho:</hi>

               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>I dread (<hi>Aurora)</hi> least for <hi>Cephalus</hi> thou would</l>
                  <l>Haue chosen him, saue that thy former Rape doth thee with-hold:</l>

                  <l>In Iuory Waggon would Dame <hi>Venus</hi> to the Starres</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Many more examples could I alledge for this purpose, most of the Poets, especially the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and the Latines, not talking of any thing so much, nor that toucheth and galleth the Heart so sharply, as this doth: which forced <hi>Propertius</hi> to write thus:
<q>
                  <l>Nullae sunt inimicitiae nisi Amoris acerbae, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>

                  <l>A kinde Foe to my selfe shall be:</l>
                  <l>With what face can I see strange Armes</l>
                  <l>My Wench for to imbrace and twine,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:19642:33"/>When shee anothers shall be tearm'd,</l>
                  <l>Who (but euen now) was called Mine?</l>
                  <l>Sure all things change and Louers mindes</l>
                  <l>Doe change, and (changing) proue.</l>
                  <l>Winne thou in Loue, or doe thou loose,</l>
                  <l>So turnes the wheele of Loue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But our Tuscane <note n="d" place="margin">The worth of Poets and Poetrie, can neuer be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently commended enough, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Iron age hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in contempt, which is not the fault of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but of those dull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasses, now liuing, who make so small account of them, and therefore passing well said hee that wrote this Disticque: <q>
                     <l>The Man that scorneth Poets, and Arts Schoole,</l>
                     <l>Lackes but a long Coate to be Natures Foole.</l>
                  </q> Yet in despight of these worse than nasty Iaylors, that keepe such store of wealth in their bard Closets, and secret places far darker than <hi>Lymbo</hi> it selfe, from those that deserue it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euery way than themselues, (and all which dunghill muck is nothing but the base Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this stinking Earth) I will set downe here the worth of a Poet (more in value by much than their Idolatrous trash) as that sweet Muse of his (who not vnworthily beareth the name of the cheifest Archangell) singeth after this Soule-rauishing manner: <q>
                     <l>When Heauen would striue to doe the best shee can,</l>
                     <l>And put an Angels spirit into a Man.</l>
                     <l>Then all her powers shee in that Worke doth spend,</l>
                     <l>When shee a <hi>POET</hi> to the world doth send;</l>
                     <l>The difference onely twixt the Gods and Vs,</l>
                     <l>Allow'd by them, is but distinguisht thus;</l>
                     <l>They giue them breath, Men by their Powers are borne,</l>
                     <l>That life they giue the <hi>POET</hi> doth adorne:</l>
                     <l>And from the world, when they dissolue mans breath,</l>
                     <l>They in the world doe giue Man life in death.</l>
                  </q>
               </note> Poets, louing more chastly than the Heathen, wrote more discretely, and with a better minde of this subiect, neyther had they so much cause to complayne, or enueigh against this wicked Fury.</p>
            <p>And now as concerning the two first lines of this last Stanza, in my conceit this word <hi>(iui)</hi> (there) is not without good grace and much ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy vttered three times, one after another, not so much to knit and ioyne the Verses following, to those that goe before, as for that Flourish or Figure, called <hi>Repetitio,</hi> by our Rhetoritians, and because of that other which is tearm'd an Article, the conioyning and coupling of the Coniunction <hi>(Et,</hi> And) being not put to any of them.</p>
            <q>I giorni mena.</q>
            <p>This phrase <hi>Menare i giorni,</hi> is, in this place, after the same fashion as <hi>Petrarcq</hi> vseth the same in that Sonnet of his:
<q>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:19642:33"/>
                  <l>Chi e fermato di menar sua vita, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Who is resolu'd to lead his life vnsure,</l>
                  <l>Amid the wauering Seas and Rockes so high</l>
                  <l>Fearelesse of death in Barke which cannot dure,</l>
                  <l>Must make account he to his End is nigh.</l>
                  <l>'Tis good for such an one to hoyse his sayle,</l>
                  <l>And towards the Hauen get for his auayle.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Imitating herein the Latinists, who say, <hi>ducere vitam,</hi> to liue. And yet <hi>Petrarcq</hi> in this Sonnet following, turned it to another sense.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Po ben puo tu portarnclaescorza, &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>Well maist thou (Po) my body carry fast,</l>
               <l>By reason of thy swift and mightie wane,</l>
               <l>My Soule the Ghest within this lodging plac't,</l>
               <l>For all thy force with thee, thou canst not haue:</l>
               <l>This neare giues o'er, but striues to mount on high,</l>
               <l>Forcing (herselfe) vnto the clouds to glide,</l>
               <l>Vntill it to that happy place come nigh,</l>
               <l>Where it doth hope in perfect Blisse to bide:</l>
               <l>Thou Prince of Riuers, prouder than the rest,</l>
               <l>Encountring with the Sunne when day doth breake:</l>
               <l>And in the ponent of that Light quite disposest,</l>
               <l>Where waters thine beginne for to grow weake,</l>
               <l>Beare thou this outward shape alone with thee,</l>
               <l>Whilst my Soule in her sweet lodge longs to be.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And this kinde of phrase is (most commonly) taken after the worse sense, as in the first Chapter of <hi>Loue,</hi> he speaketh thus:
<q>
                  <l>Qual e morte da lui, qual con piu graui, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>What Death is his? what wretched life,</l>
                  <l>That pouer wretch sustaines?</l>
                  <l>Whom Lawes seuere command him lye</l>
                  <l>Shut close, and bound in chaynes, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
But now to our Poet againe.
<q>
                  <l>Non mendi dubbia che dicerta pena.</l>
                  <l>As well for doubtfull as sure punishments, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In my conceit he could neuer more learnedly,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19642:34"/>
nor more, and as I may say, more elegantly expresse and set downe the last difference of IEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVSIE, than hee hath (here) done in this Verse, considering there may (perhaps) be found such a kinde of gnawing Corsiue or inward fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Passion, that may haue part, or the most of these troubles that IEALOVSIE hath, but that there (euer) should be found any one that shall continually, lament and grieue, as much for that which is impossible and doubtfull, as for what is certaine and well knowne, that can I neuer be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to belieue: this one thing being rightly the propertie and nature of this franticque Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And therefore <hi>Ariosto</hi> said likewise well, when (speaking of IEALOVSIE) he wrote thus:
<q>
                  <l>Non men per falso che per ver suspetto, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>This hellish Hag makes men to wayle and rue,</l>
                  <l>Through false suspect, as well as for what's true.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrarcque</hi> intimating as much, when (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is alledged) hee said:
<q>
                  <l>Pur come Donna in vn vestir schietto, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Like to a woman that is finely clad,</l>
                  <l>And vnder garment hers some man she had.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Inferring hereby no other thing, then (as hath beene often repeated before) that Iealous persons are afraid of what they neede not, they being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes full of Suspition and dread, no otherwise than as if it were a likely or possible thing that a woman should hide a liuing man vnder her vaile or her attyre. And in this Sonnet (aforesaid) <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi> setteth downe IEALOVSIE by foure diuers names: <hi>viz.</hi> trembling Cold, shiuering Feare, chilly Ice, and melancholy Suspect <note n="e" place="margin">Well may <hi>Petrarcq</hi> brand Loue with foure such seuerall tearmes, when, that learned Philosopher <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> calleth it a cruell impression of that wonderfull passion, which to be defined is impossible, because no words reach to the strong nature of it, and onely they know it, who inwardly doe feele it. And therefore I will be bold to descant vpon it thus, <q>
                     <l>What is not <hi>LOVE?</hi> tis All, Vertue and Vice,</l>
                     <l>Humble, proud, witty, foolish, kinde and nice;</l>

                     <l>That waking breakes, and fils vs with Extreames.</l>
                  </q> Or rather thus; <q>

            <p>This fourth and last part agreeth meruaylous well with the beginning and middest of this Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, according to <hi>Horace</hi> his Aduice, where hee saith, in his Booke <hi>De Arte Poetica.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>Thus with a kinde of briefe Repetition he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth and shutteth vp the whole substance of his Sonnet, willing IEALOVSIE once more to be packing, and as it were, seeming to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and to chide her, alledging (to perswade her the sooner to be gone,) the Reasons before alledged: for as much signifieth these two Verses:
<q>

<q>
                  <l>L'altra non già ch'el mio bel fuoco è tale, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>

            <p>Now if the woman that is beloued, should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect another, (when there cannot be any Loue true, but of one alone) it must then of necessitie follow, that she should not care for her first friend or Louer, this being the principall point required of her.

common to another. And whosoeuer beleeueth, or is of opinion, that a man may (truly) and from the heart, loue and affect more then one, at one and the selfe-same time, is very much mistaken, as (besides the authoritie of <hi>Aristotle</hi> aforesaid) we haue proued (euen now) in this place: neither doth he rightly vnderstand how that partie who loueth indeed, loueth his Friend as his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and best good, hee crauing and desiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much than that twaine should become one, as <hi>Plato</hi> reporteth, those two Louers answered <hi>Vulcan</hi> very well, and to this purpose <hi>Lodouicq Martelli</hi> spake excellent well, saying:

               </q>
And (me thinkes) he spake as well, when he said thus:

And of this opinion was <hi>Petrarcq,</hi> as you may perceiue in the beginning of that his Sonnet so often, by peece-meale, repeated by vs, although (in the end therof) he to insinuate into her fauour, (and to commend his Mistres <hi>Laura</hi> the more) faineth like a right Poet, that there was no IEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVSIE in him, which neuerthelesse, he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be in any other Louer else; and which our familiar acquaintance Master <hi>Lewes Allemanni,</hi> knowing to be but too true, added (therefore) those speeches (set downe a little before by mee) <hi>Fuor d'ogni vso humano.</hi> Meaning hereby, as if it were a thing against nature any liuing man, should not haue some small spice of IEALOVSIE in him.</p>
            <p>Another doubt is, whether IEALOVSIE be (naturally) in Louers or no, many affirming it is, and withall, alleadging the same likewise to be in euery bruit Beast, as well as in man, <note n="o" place="margin">Considering the great Plagues and Afflictions which many (too too Iealous ouer their Wiues) inflict most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily vpon themselues, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Cuckolds, and kinde Wittols, are to be counted wise, in respect of the other, because they are neuer tortured with such frightfull and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble punishment: for, <q>

                  </q> Nay more, I holde Cockolds for their patience (herein) to be the only true happie &amp; wise men indeed, for if (according to <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Epistles) hee that is Temperate, is Constant; who is Constant is vntroubled, who is vntroubled is without sorrow; who is without sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, is happy, wherefore he that is such a one is Happy, &amp; wisedome is sufficient to a happy man: then say I, that all these Qualities coueriuing in a Cuckold, hee must needes be both Wise and Happy.</note> excepting onely in those kinde of ouerkinde Creatures, to whom our language hath giuen a strange name, by reason they are carelesse and respectlesse of their owne honours, accounting it a small matter for their Wiues to be of the common gender, and more courteous then indeed ciuility or good manners require they should be.</p>
