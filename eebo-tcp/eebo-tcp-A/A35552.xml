         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
ARGUMENT
OF THIS
NARRATIVE
By way of
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Reverend Author of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
ſummary was <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus
de las Caſas</hi> alias <hi>Caſaus,</hi> a
Pious and Religious perſon, (as appears by
his zealous Tranſports in this Narrative for
<pb facs="tcp:97577:3"/>
promotion of the Chriſtian Faith) elevated
from a Frier of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Order to ſit
in the Epiſcopal Chair, who was frequently
importuned by Good and Learned Men, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Hiſtorians, to Publiſh this ſummary;
who ſo prevailed with him, that he Collected
out of that copious Hiſtory which might and
ought to be written on this ſubject, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this conciſe Treatiſe with intention to
diſplay unto the World the Enormities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> committed in <hi>America,</hi> during
their reſidence there, to their eternal ignominy;
and for the Author finding that no Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Reprehenſions, how mild ſoever could
operate upon or ſink into theſe rocky-hearted
Tyrants in thoſe Occidental Parts; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
took up a firm reſolution, being then
about 50 years of age (as he himſelf declares)
to run the Hazards and Dangers by Sea, and
the Riſque of a long Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> there
to acquaint and Certifie the moſt Illuſtrious
<pb facs="tcp:97577:3"/>
Prince <hi>Phillip</hi> the Son and Heir of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth of Bleſſed
Memory, with the Horrid crimes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
perpetrated in thoſe Countries, part whereof
he had ſeen, and part heard from ſuch as
boasted of their Wickedneſs. Whereupon
his <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Majeſty moved with a tender
generous and Chriſtian compaſſion towards
theſe Inhabitants and Countries of <hi>America,</hi>
languiſhing for want of redreſs, he called a
Council at <hi>Valedolid,</hi> Anno Dom. 1542.
conſiſting of Learned and Able Men, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Reformation of the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi>
Government, and took ſuch a courſe, that
from that time their Tyranny and cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> was ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
and thoſe Nations in ſome meaſure
delivered from that intolerable and more then
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> Bondage, or at least the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
ill uſage and treatment of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
was alleviated and abated. This Book
<pb facs="tcp:97577:4"/>
moſtly <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> partly <hi>Typographical,</hi>
was Publiſhed firſt by the Author in <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
at <hi>Sevil,</hi> after that Tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi>
by himſelf; and in proceſs of time into <hi>High
Dutch, Low Dutch, French</hi> and now
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> which is the Sixth Language it
hath been Taught to ſpeak, that every one
of what Nation ſoever might in this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
contemplate and ſee as in a mirror the
diſmal and pernitious fruits, that lacquey and
attend unlimitted and cloſe fiſted Avarice,
and thereby Learn to abhor and detest it,
<hi>Cane pejus &amp; angue:</hi> it being the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
and cheifeſt motive to the commiſſion
of ſuch inexpreſſible Outrages, as here in part
are faintly, not fully repreſented. Which
ſin the Pagan <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves did expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with all Detestation,
Ignominy and Diſgrace: for when they had
taken ſome of them Priſoners (which was
rarely) they bound them hand and foot,
<pb facs="tcp:97577:4"/>
laid them on the ground, and then pouring
melted Gold down their Throats, cried out
and called to them aloud in deriſion, <hi>yield,
throw up thy Gold O Chriſtian! Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and ſpew out that Mettal which hath
ſo inquinated and invenom'd both Body
and Soul, that hath ſtain'd and infected
thy mind with deſires and contrivances,
and thy hands with Commiſſion of ſuch
matchleſs Enormities.</hi> I will ſhut up all
this, being but an Extract of what is in the
Prefatory part of the Original. I earneſtly
beg and deſire all Men to be perſwaded, that
this ſummary was not publiſhed upon any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Deſign, ſiniſter ends or affection in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

            <head>THE
CRUELTIES
OF THE
Spaniards
Committed in
AMERICA.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AMERICA</hi> was diſcover'd and found out <hi>An. Dom.</hi>
1492. and the Year inſuing inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and afterward a multitude of them travelled thither
from <hi>Spain</hi> for the ſpace of Nine and Forty Years. Their
firſt attempt was on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iſland, which indeed is
a moſt fertile Soil, and at preſent in greateſt Reputation for its Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
and Length, containing in Circumference Six Hundred
Miles: Nay, it is on all ſides ſurrounded with an almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number of Iſlands, which we found ſo well peopled with
Natives and Forreigners, that there is ſcarce any Region in the
Univerſe fortified with ſo many Inhabitants: But the main Land
or Continent, diſtant from this Iſland Two Hundred and Fifty
Miles and upwards, extends it ſelf above Ten Thouſand Miles in
Length near the Sea-ſhoar, which Lands are ſome of them already
diſcover'd, and more may be found out in proceſs of time: And
ſuch a multitude of People inhabits theſe Countries, that it ſeems as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97577:6"/>
if the Omnipotent God had Aſſembled and Convocated the major
part of Mankind in this part of the World.</p>
            <p>Now this infinite multitude of Men are by the Creation of God
innocently ſimple, altogether void of and averſe to all manner of
Craft, Subtlety and Malice, and moſt Obedient and Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to their Native Soveraigns; and behave themſelves very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
ſubmiſſively and quietly toward the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whom
they are ſubſervient and ſubject; ſo that finally they live without
the leaſt thirſt after revenge, laying aſide all litigiouſneſs, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and hatred.</p>
            <p>This is a moſt tender and effeminate people, and of ſo imbecile
and unequal-balanced temper, that they are altogether incapable
of hard labour, and in few years, by one Diſtemper or other ſoon
expire, ſo that the very Iſſue of Lords and Princes, who among
us live with great affluence, and fare deliciouſly, are not more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
and tender than the Children of their Husbandmen or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers:
This Nation is very Neceſſitous and Indigent, Maſters
of very ſlender Poſſeſſions, and conſequently, neither Haughty,
nor Ambitious. They are as parſimonious in their Diet, as the
Holy Fathers were in their frugal Life in the Deſert, known by
the name of <hi>Eremites.</hi> They go naked, having no other Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but what conceals their Pudends from publick ſight. An
hairy Plad, or looſe Coat, about an Ell, or a coarſe woven Cloth at
moſt Two Ells long ſerves them for the warmeſt Winter Garment.
They lye on a coarſe Rug or Matt, and thoſe that have the moſt
plentiful Eſtate or Fortunes, the better ſort, uſe Net-work, knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the four corners in lieu of Beds, which the Inhabitants of
the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in their own proper Idiom term <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks.</hi>
The Men are pregnant and docible. The Natives tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and capable of Morality or Goodneſs, very apt to receive
the inſtill'd Principles of the Catholick Religion; nor are they
averſe to Civility and good Manners, being not ſo much diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by variety of Obſtructions, as the reſt of Mankind; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that having ſuckt in (if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf) the
very firſt Rudiments of the Chriſtian Faith, they are ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Zeal and Fervor in the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Divine Service, that the very Religioſo's themſelves,
ſtand in need of the greateſt and moſt ſignal patience to undergo
ſuch extream Tranſports. And to conclude, I my ſelf have heard
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97577:6"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves (who dare not aſſume the Confidence to
deny the good Nature praedominant in them) declare, that there
was nothing wanting in them for the acquiſition of Eternal Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
but the ſole Knowledge and Underſtanding of the Deity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt aſſaulted theſe innocent Sheep, ſo qualified
by the Almighty, as is premention'd, like moſt cruel Tygers,
Wolves and Lions hunger-ſtarv'd, ſtudying nothing, for the ſpace
of Forty Years, after their firſt Landing, but the Maſſacre of theſe
Wretches, whom they have ſo inhumanely and barbarouſly but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher'd
and haraſs'd with ſeveral kinds of Torments, never before
known, or heard (of which you ſhall have ſome account in the
following Diſcourſe) that of Three Millions of Perſons, which
lived in <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> it ſelf, there is at preſent but the inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Remnant of ſcarce Three Hundred. Nay the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi>
which extends as far, as <hi>Valledolid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> is diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi>
lies now incultivated, like a Deſert, and intomb'd in its own
Ruins. You may alſo find the Iſles of St. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> both
large and fruitful places, unpeopled and deſolate. The <hi>Lucayan</hi>
Iſlands on the North-ſide, adjacent to <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> and <hi>Cuba,</hi> which
are Sixty in number, or thereabout, together with thoſe, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
known by the name of the Gigantic Iſles, and others, the
moſt infertile whereof, exceeds the Royal Garden of <hi>Sevil</hi> in
fruitfulneſs, a moſt healthful and pleaſant Climat, is now laid
waſte and uninhabited; and whereas, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
here, above Five Hundred Thouſand Men dwelt in it, they
are now cut off, ſome by ſlaughter, and others raviſhed away by
Force and Violence, to work in the Mines of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which
was deſtitute of Native Inhabitants: For a certain Veſſel, ſailing
to this Iſle, to the end, that the Harveſt being over (ſome good
Chriſtian, moved with Piety and Pitty, undertook this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Voyage, to convert Souls to Chriſtianity) the remaining
gleanings might be gathered up, there were only found Eleven Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
which I ſaw with my own Eyes. There are other Iſlands
Thirty in number, and upward bordering upon the Iſle of St.
<hi>John,</hi> totally unpeopled; all which are above Two Thouſand
Miles in length, and yet remain without Inhabitants, Native, or
People.</p>
            <p>As to the firm Land, we are certainly ſatisfied, and aſſur'd,
that the <hi>Spaniands</hi> by their barbarous and execrable Actions have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97577:7"/>
abſolutely depopulated Ten Kingdoms, of greater extent than all
<hi>Spain,</hi> together with the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> that
is to ſay, above One Thouſand Miles, which now lye waſt and
deſolate, and are abſolutely ruinated, when as formerly no other
Country whatſoever was more populous. Nay we dare boldly
affirm, that during the Forty years ſpace, wherein they exerciſed
their ſanguinary and deteſtable Tyranny in theſe Regions, above
Twelve Millions (computing Men, Women, and Children) have
undeſervedly periſhed; nor do I conceive that I ſhould deviate
from the Truth by ſaying that above Fifty Millions in all paid their
laſt Debt due to Nature.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that arriv'd at theſe Iſlands from the remoteſt parts of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and who pride themſelves in the Name of Chriſtians, ſteer'd
Two courſes principally, in order to the Extirpation, and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
of this People from the face of the Earth. The firſt
whereof was by raiſing an unjuſt, ſanguinolent, cruel War. The
other, by putting all them to death, who hitherto, thirſted after
their Liberty, or deſign'd (which the moſt Potent, Strenuous and
Magnanimous Spirits intended) to recover their priſtin Freedom,
and ſhake off the Shackles of ſo injurious a Captivity: For they
being taken off in War, none but Women and Children were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to enjoy the benefit of that Country-Air; in whom they did
in ſucceeding times lay ſuch a heavy Yoak, that the very Brutes
were more happy than they: To which Two Species of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as ſubalternate things to the Genus, the other innumerable
Courſes they took to extirpate and make this a deſolate people,
may be reduced and referr'd.</p>
            <p>Now the ultimate end and ſcope that incited the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
endeavour the Extirpation and Deſolation of this People, was
Gold only; that thereby growing opulent in a ſhort time, they
might arrive at once at ſuch Degrees and Dignities, as were no
wayes conſiſtent with their Perſons.</p>
            <p>Finally, in one word, their Ambition and Avarice, than which
the heart of Man never entertained greater, and the vaſt Wealth
of theſe Regions; the Humility and Patience of the Inhabitants
(which made their approach to theſe Lands more facil and eaſie)
did much promote the buſineſs: Whom they ſo deſpicably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
that they treated them (I ſpeak of things which I was an
Eye-Witneſs of, without the leaſt fallacy) not as Beaſts,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97577:7"/>
which I cordially wiſhed they would, but as the moſt abject dung
and filth of the Earth; and ſo ſollicitous they were of their Life
and Soul, that the above-mentioned number of People died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
underſtanding the true Faith or Sacraments. And this alſo is
as really true as the praecedent Narration (which the very Tyrants
and cruel Murderers cannot deny without the ſtigma of a lye) that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never received any injury from the <hi>Indians,</hi> but
that they rather reverenced them as Perſons deſcended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
until that they were compelled to take up Arms, provoked
thereunto by repeated Injuries, violent Torments, and injuſt
Butcheries.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Iſland HISPANIOLA.</head>
               <p>IN this Iſle, which, as we have ſaid, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the bloody ſlaughter and deſtruction of Men firſt began:
for they violently forced away Women and Children to make
them Slaves, and ill-treated them, conſuming and waſting their
Food, which they had purchaſed with great ſweat, toil, and yet
remained diſſatisfied too, which every one according to his ſtrength
and ability, and that was very inconſiderable (for they provided
no other Food than what was abſolutely neceſſary to ſupport Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without ſuperfluity, freely beſtow'd on them; and one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<hi>Spaniard</hi> conſumed more Victuals in one day, than would ſerve
to maintain Three Families a Moneth, every one conſiſting of Ten
Perſons. Now being oppreſſed by ſuch evil uſage, and afflicted
with ſuch great Torments and violent Entertainment they began
to underſtand, that ſuch Men as theſe had not their Miſſion from
Heaven; and therefore ſome of them conceal'd their Proviſions
and others their Wives and Children in lurking holes; but ſome,
to avoid the obdurate and dreadful temper of ſuch a Nation,
ſought their Refuge on the craggy tops of Mountains; for the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> did not only entertain them with Cuffs, Blows, and
wicked Cudgelling, but laid violent hands alſo on the Governours
of Cities; and this arriv'd at length to that height of Temerity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97577:8"/>
and Impudence, that a certain Captain was ſo audacious as to
abuſe the Confort of the moſt puiſſant king of the whole Iſle.
From which time they began to conſider by what wayes and means
they might expel the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of their Countrey, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
took up Arms. But, good God, what Arms, do you
imagin? Namely ſuch, both Offenſive and Defenſive, as reſemble
Reeds wherewith Boys ſport with one another, more than Manly
Arms and Weapons.</p>
               <p>Which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> no ſooner perceived, but they, mounted
on generous Steeds, well weapon'd with Lances and Swords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to exerciſe their bloody Butcheries and Stratagems, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
their Cities and Towns, ſpar'd no Age, or Sex, nay not
ſo much as Women with Child, but ripping up their Bellies, tore
them alive in pieces. They laid Wagers among themſelves, who
ſhould with a Sword at one blow cut, or divide a Man in two; or
which of them ſhould decollate or behead a Man, with the greateſt
dexterity; nay farther, which ſhould ſheath his Sword in the
Bowels of a Man with the quickeſt diſpatch and expedition.</p>
               <p>They ſnatcht young Babes from the Mothers Breaſts, and then
daſht out the Brains of thoſe Innocents againſt the Rocks; others
they caſt into Rivers ſcoffing and jeering them, and call'd upon
the Bodies when falling with deriſion, the true teſtimony of their
Cruelty, to come to them, and inhumanely expoſing others to their
Mercileſs Swords, together with the Mothers that gave them
Life.</p>
               <p>They erected certain Gibbets, large, but low made, ſo that
their Feet almoſt reacht the ground, every one of which was ſo
order'd as to bear Thirteen Perſons in Honour and Reverence (as
they ſaid blaſphemouſly) of our Redeemer and his Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
under which they made a Fire to burn them to Aſhes whilſt
hanging on them: But thoſe they intended to preſerve alive, they
diſmiſs'd, their Hands half cut, and ſtill hanging by the Skin, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
their Letters miſſive to thoſe that fly from us and ly ſculking on
the Mountains, as an exprobration of their flight.</p>
               <p>The Lords and Perſons of Noble Extract were uſually expos'd
to this kind of Death; they order'd Gridirons to be placed and
ſupported with wooden Forks, and putting a ſmall Fire under
them, theſe miſerable Wretches by degrees with loud Shreiks and
exquiſite Torments, at laſt Expird.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97577:8"/>
I once ſaw Four or Five of their moſt Powerful Lords laid on
theſe Gridirons, and thereon roaſted, and not far off, Two or
Three more over-ſpread with the ſame Commodity, Man's Fleſh;
but the ſhril Clamours which were heard there being offenſive to
the Captain, by hindring his Repoſe, he commanded them to be
ſtrangled with a Halter. The Executiouer (whoſe Name and
Parents at <hi>Sevil</hi> are not unknown to me) prohibited the doing of it;
but ſtopt Gags into their Mouths to prevent the hearing of the
noiſe (he himſelf making the Fire) till that they dyed, when they
had been roaſted as long as he thought convenient. I was an Eye-Witneſs
of theſe and an innumerable Number of other Cruelties:
And becauſe all Men, who could lay hold of the opportunity,
ſought out lurking holes in the Mountains, to avoid as dangerous
Rocks ſo Brutiſh and Barbarous a People, Strangers to all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the Extirpaters and Adverſaries of Men, they bred up
ſuch fierce hunting Dogs as would devour an <hi>Indian</hi> like a Hog,
at firſt ſight in leſs than a moment: Now ſuch kind of Slaughters
and Cruelties as theſe were committed by the Curs, and if at any
time it hapned, (which was rarely) that the <hi>Indians</hi> irritated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a juſt account deſtroy'd or took away the Life of any <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
they promulgated and proclaim'd this Law among them, that One

Twenty Thouſand) are very rich in Mines of Gold; on which
Mountain lies the Province of rich Mines, whence that exquiſite
pure Gold of Twenty Four Carracts weight, takes denomination.
The King and Lord of this Kingdom was named <hi>Guarionex,</hi> who
governed within the Compaſs of his Dominions ſo many Vaſſals
and Potent Lords, that every one of them was able to bring into
the Field Sixteen Thouſand Soldiers for the ſervice of <hi>Guarionex</hi>
their Supream Lord and Soverain, when ſummoned thereunto.
Some of which I was acquainted with. This was a moſt Obedient
Prince, endued with great Courage and Morality, Naturally of a
Pacifick Temper, and moſt devoted to the Service of the <hi>Caſtilian</hi>
Kings. This King commanded and ordered his Subjects, that
every one of thoſe Lords under his Jurisdiction, ſhould preſent
him with a Bell full of Gold; but in ſucceeding times, being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perform it, they were commanded to cut it in two, and fill
one part therewith, for the Inhabitants of this Iſle were altogether
unexperienced, and unskilful in Mine-works, and the digging Gold
out of them. This <hi>Cain</hi> proffer'd his Service to the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
on this Condition, that he would take care, that thoſe Lands
ſhould be cultivated and manur'd, wherein, during the Reign of
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> Queen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt ſet footing and fixed
their Reſidence, extending in length even to <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> the
ſpace of Fifty Miles. For he declar'd (nor was it a Fallacie,
but an abſolute Truth,) that his Subjects underſtood not the
practical uſe of digging in Golden Mines. To which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
he had readily and voluntarily condeſcended, to my own
certain knowledge, and ſo by this means, the king would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Annual Revenue of Three Millions of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crowns,
and upward, there being at that very time in that Iſland Fifty Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
more ample and ſpacious than <hi>Sevil</hi> it ſelf in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what returns by way of Remuneration and Reward did
they make this ſo Clement and Benign Monarch, can you imagine,
no other but this? They put the greateſt Indignity upon him ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
in the Perſon of his Conſort who was violated by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Captain altogether unworthy of the Name of Chriſtian. He might
indeed probably expect to meet with a conveninent time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of revenging this Ignominy ſo injuriouſly thrown upon him
by preparing Military Forces to attaque him; but he rather choſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97577:9"/>
to abſcond in the Province <hi>De los Ciquayos</hi> (wherein a Puiſſant
Vaſſal and ſubject of his Ruled) deveſted of his Eſtate and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and there live and dye an Exile. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain information, that he had abſented himſelf, connived
no longer at his Concealment but raiſed War againſt him, who had
received them with ſo great humanity and kindneſs, and having
firſt laid waſte and deſolate the whole Region, at laſt found, and
took him Priſoner, who being bound in Fetters was convey'd on
board of a ſhip in order to his transfretation to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
but the Veſſel periſhed in the Voyage, wherewith many
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were alſo loſt, as well as a great weight of Gold, among
which there was a prodigious Ingot of Gold, reſembling a large
Loaf of Bread, weighing 3600 Crowns; Thus it pleaſed God to
revenge their enormous Impieties.</p>
                  <p>A Second Kingdom was named <hi>Marien,</hi> where there is to this
day a Haven, upon the utmoſt Borders of the Plain or open Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
toward the North, more fertil and large then the Kingdom of
<hi>Portugal;</hi> and really deſerving conſtant and frequent Inhabitants:
For it abounds with Mountains, and is rich in Mines of Gold and
<hi>Orichalcum,</hi> a kind of Copper Mettal mixt with Gold; The Kings
name of this place was <hi>Guacanagari,</hi> who had many powerful
Lords (ſome whereof were not unknown to me) under his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
The firſt that Landed in this Kingdum when he diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>America,</hi> was an Admiral well ſtricken in years, who had ſo
hoſpitable and kind a reception from the aforeſaid <hi>Guacanagari,</hi>
as well as all thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> that accompanied him in that Voyage,
giving them all imaginable help and aſſiſtance (for the Admirals
Veſſel was ſunk on their Coaſts) that I heard it from his own
mouth, he could not poſſibly have been entertained with greater
Careſſes and Civilities from his own Parents in his own Native
Country. But this King being forced to fly to avoid the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
ſlaughter and Cruelty, deprived of all he was Maſter of, died in
the Mountains; and the reſt of the Potentates and Nobles, his
ſubjects, periſhed in that ſervitude and Vaſſalage; as you ſhall
find in this following Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Third Kingdom was diſtinguiſhed by the Appellation of
<hi>Maquana,</hi> another admirable healthful and fruitful Region, where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97577:10"/>
at preſent the moſt refined Sugar of the Iſland is made. <hi>Caonabe</hi>
then Reigned there, who ſurmounted all the reſt in Power, State,
and the ſplendid Ceremonies of His Government. This King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all expectation was ſurpriz'd in his own Palace, by the great
ſubtilty and induſtry of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and after carried on board
in order to his Tranſportation to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> but there being at that
time ſix Ships Riding in the Haven, and ready to ſet Sail ſuch an
impetuous ſtorm ſuddenly aroſe, that they as well as the Paſſengers
and Ships Riding in the Haven, and ready to ſet Sail ſuch an
impetuous ſtorm ſuddenly aroſe, that they as well as the Paſſengers
and Ships Crew were all loſt, together with King <hi>Canabao</hi> loaded
with Irons; by which judgment the Almighty declared, that this was
as unjuſt and impious an Act as any of the former. This King had
three or four Brothers then Living, Men of ſtrength and Valour,
who being highly incenſed at the Captivity of their King and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to which he was injuriouſly reduc'd, having alſo intelligence
of the Devaſtations and Butcheries committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in
other Regions, and not long after hearing of their Brothers death,
took up Arms to revenge themſelves of the Enemy, whom the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> met with, and certain party of Horſe (which proved very
offenſive to the <hi>Indians)</hi> made ſuch havock and ſlaughter among
them, that the half of this Kingdom was laid waſte and depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Xaraqua</hi> is the Fourth Kingdom, and as it were the Centre and
middle of the whole Iſland, and is not to be equalled for fluency of
Speech and politeneſs of Idiom or Dialect by any Inhabitants of the
other Kingdoms, and in Policy and Morality tranſcends them all.
Herein the Lords and peers abounded, and the very Populace excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſtature and habit of Body: Their King was <hi>Behechio</hi> by name
who had a Siſter called <hi>Anacaona,</hi> and both the Brother as well as
Siſter had loaded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Benefits and ſingular acts of
Civility, and by delivering them from the evident and apparent
danger of Death, did ſignal ſervices to the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Kings. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bechio</hi>
dying the ſupreme power of the Kingdom fell to <hi>Anacaona:</hi>
But it hapned one day, that the Governour of an Iſland, attended
by 60 Horſe, and 30 Foot (now the Cavalry was ſufficiently able
to unpeople not only the Iſle, but alſo the whole Continent) he
ſummoned about 300 Dynaſta's, or Noblemen to appear before
him, and commanded the moſt powerful of them, being firſt croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a Thatcht Barn or Hovel, to be expoſed to the fury of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97577:10"/>
mercileſs Fire, and the reſt to be pierced with Lances, and run
through with the point of the Sword by a multitude of Men: And
<hi>Anacaona</hi> her ſelf who (as we ſaid before,) ſway'd the Imperial
Scepter, to her greater honour was hanged on a Gibbet. And if it
fell out that any perſon inſtigated by Compaſſion or Covetouſneſs,
did entertain any <hi>Indian</hi> Boys and mount them on Horſes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their Murder, another was appointed to follow them, who
ran them through the back or in the hinder parts, and if they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to eſcape Death, and fall to the ground, they immediately
cut off his Legs; and when any of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> that ſurvived
theſe Barbarous Maſſacres, betook themſelves to an Iſle eight miles
diſtant, to eſcape their Butcheries, they were then committed to
ſervitude during Life.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Kingdom is <hi>Hiquey,</hi> over whom Queen <hi>Hiquanama,</hi>
a ſuperannuated Princeſs, whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Crucified, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
and Govern. The number of thoſe I ſaw here burnt, diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and rackt with various Torments, as well as others, the
poor Remnants of ſuch matchleſs Villanies, who ſurviving were
enſlaved, is infinite. But becauſe ſo much might be ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Aſſaſſinations and Depopulating of theſe people, as cannot
without great difficulty be publiſhed in Writing (nor do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that one ſingle part of 1000 that is here contained can be
fully diſplayed) I will only add one remark more of the prementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Wars, in lieu of a Corollary or Concluſion, and aver upon
my Conſcience, that notwithſtanding all the above-named In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
profligate Enormities and other Crimes which I omit, (tho
ſufficiently known to me) the <hi>Indians</hi> did not, nor was it in their
power to give any greater occaſion for the Commiſſion of them,
than Pious Religioſo's Living in a well regulated Monaſtic Life did
afford for any Sacrilegious Villains to deprive them of their Goods
and Life at the ſame time, or why they who by flight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
death, ſhould be detain'd in perpetual, not to be ranſom'd
Captivity and Slavery. I adde farther, that I really beleive, and
am ſatisfied by certain undeniable conjectures, that at the very
juncture of time, when all theſe outrages were commited in this
Iſle, the <hi>Indians</hi> were not ſo much as guilty of one ſingle mortal
ſin of Commiſſion againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that might deſerve from
any Man revenge or require ſatisfaction. And as for thoſe ſins,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97577:11"/>
the puniſhment whereof God hath reſerved to himſelf, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
deſire of Revenge, Hatred, Envy or inward rancor of
Spirit, to which they might be tranſported againſt ſuch Capital
Enemies as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were, I judge that very few of them can
be juſtly accuſed of them; for their impetuoſity and vigor I ſpeak
experimentally, was inferior to that of Children of ten or twelve
years of age: and this I can aſſure you, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had ever a
juſt cauſe of raiſing War againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
on the contrary never waged a juſt War againſt them, but what
was more injurious and groundleſs then any undertaken by the
worſt of Tyrants. All which I affirm of all their other Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and paſſages in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Warlike Engagements being over, and the Inhabitants all
ſwept away, they divided among themſelves the Young Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children promiſcuouſly reſerved for that purpoſe, one
obtained thirty, another forty, to this Man one hundred were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
to the other two hundred, and the more any one was in
favor with the domineering Tyrant (whom they ſtyled Governor)
the more he became Maſter of, upon this pretence, and with this
Proviſo, that he ſhould ſee them inſtructed in the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
when as they themſelves to whom they were committed to
be taught, and the care of their Souls intruſted to them were, for
the major part Idiots, Cruel, Avaritious, infected and ſtained
with all ſorts of Vices. And this was the great care they had of
them, they ſent the Males to the Mines to dig and bring away the
Gold, which is an intollerable Labor; but the Women they made
uſe of to Manure and Till the ground, which is a toil moſt irkſom
even to Men of the ſtrongeſt and moſt robuſt conſtitutions; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them no other food but Herbage, and ſuch kind of unſubſtantial
nutriment, ſo that the Nurſing Womens Milk was exſiccated and
ſo dryed up, that the young Infants lately brought forth, all peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and Females being ſeparated from and debarred cohabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Men, there was no Prolification or raiſing up iſſue among
them. The Men died in Mines, hunger ſtarved and oppreſſed
with labor, and the Women periſhed in the Fields, haraſſed and
broken with the like Evils and Calamities: Thus an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Inhabitants that formerly peopled this Iſland were extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and dwindled away to nothing by ſuch Conſumptions. They
were compelled to carry burthens of eighty or one hundred pound
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97577:11"/>
weight, and that an hundred or two hundred miles compleat;
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were born by them on the Shoulders in a penſil
Vehicle or Carriage, or kind of Beds made of Net-work by the
<hi>Indians;</hi> for in Truth they made uſe of them as Beaſts to carry the
burthens and cumberſom luggage of their journeys, inſomuch
that it frequently hapned, that the Shoulders and Backs of theſe
<hi>Indians</hi> were deeply marked with their ſcourges and ſtripes, juſt
as they uſe to ſerve a tired Jade, accuſtomed to burthens. And as
to thoſe ſlaſhes with whips, blows with ſtaves, cuffs and boxes,
maledictions and curſes, with a Thouſand of ſuch kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they ſuffered during the fatigue of their laborious journeys
it would require a long tract of time, and many Reams of Paper
to deſcribe them, and when all were done would only create Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Conſternation in the Reader.</p>
                  <p>But here it is obſervable, that the deſolation of theſe Iſles and
Provinces took beginning ſince the deceaſe of the moſt Serene
Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> about the Year 1504. for before that time very
few of the Provinces ſituated in that Iſland were oppreſſed or ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with unjuſt Wars, or violated with general devaſtation as after
they were, and moſt if not all theſe things were concealed and
masked from the Queens knowledge (whom I hope God hath
Crowned with Eternal Glory) for ſhe was tranſported with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and wonderful zeal, nay, almoſt Divine deſires for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and preſervation of theſe people, which things ſo exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as theſe we having ſeen with our eyes, and felt with our hands,
cannot eaſily be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Take this alſo for a general Rule, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon what
<hi>American</hi> Coaſt ſoever they arrived, exerciſed the ſame Cruelties,
Slaughters, Tyrannies and deteſtable Oppreſſions on the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Indian</hi> Nation, and diverting themſelves with delights in new
ſorts of Torments, did in time improve in Barbariſm and Cruelty;
wherewith the Omnipotent being incenſed ſuffered them to fall

and <hi>Jamaica</hi> (reſembling Gardens and Bee hives) with the
ſame purpoſe and deſign they propoſed to themſelves in the Iſle
of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> perpetrating innumerable Robberies and Villanies
as before; whereunto they added unheard of Cruelties by Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Burning, Roaſting and Expoſing Men to be torn in pieces by
Dogs; and Finally by afflicting and haraſſing them with un-exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
Oppreſſions and Torments in the Mines, they ſpoiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
this Countrey of theſe Innocents. Theſe two Iſles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſix hundred thouſand at leaſt, though at this day there are
ſcarce two hundred men to be found in either of them, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <head>Of the Iſle of Cuba.</head>
               <p>IN the Year of our Lord 1511. They paſſed over to <hi>Cuba,</hi>
which contains as much ground in length as there is diſtance
between <hi>Valledolid</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> well furniſhed with large and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Provinces and very populous, againſt whom they proceeded
with no more humanity and Clemency, or indeed to ſpeak truth
with greater Savageneſs and Brutality. Several memorable
Tranſactions worthy obſervation, paſſed in this Iſland. A certain
<hi>Cacic</hi> a potent Peer, named <hi>Hathney,</hi> who not long before fled
from <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> to <hi>Cuba</hi> for Refuge from Death, or Captivity du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Life; and underſtanding by certain <hi>Indians</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
intended to ſteer their courſe thither, made this Oration to all his
People Aſſembled together. <q>You are not ignorant that there is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97577:12"/>
a rumor ſpread abroad among us of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Arrival, and
are ſenſible by woful experience how ſuch and ſuch (naming
them) and <hi>Hayti</hi> (ſo they term <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
with their Inhabitants have been treated by them, that
they deſign to viſit us with equal intentions of committing ſuch
acts as they have hitherto been guilty of. But do you not know
the cauſe and reaſon of their coming? We are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it, they replied, but ſufficiently ſatisfied that they are
cruelly and wickedly inclined: Then thus, ſaid he it is, they
adore a certain Covetous Deity, whoſe cravings are not to be
ſatisfyed by a few moderate offerings, but they may anſwer his
Adoration and Worſhip, demand many unreaſonable things of
us, and uſe their utmoſt endeavours to ſubjugate and after that
murder us. Then taking up a Cask or Cabinet near at hand,
full of Gold and Gems, he proceeded in this manner: This is
the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> God, and in honour of him if you think well of
it, let us celebrate our <hi>Arcytos</hi> (which are certain kinds of
Dances and caprings uſed among them); and by this means his
Deity being appeas'd, he will impoſe his Commands on the
Spaniards that they ſhall not for the future moleſt or injure us;
who all unanimouſly with one conſent in a loud tone made this
reply. Well ſaid, Well ſaid, and thus they continued skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and dancing before this Cabinet, without the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
till they were quite tired and grown weary: Then the
Noble <hi>Hathney</hi> re-aſſuming his diſcourſe, ſaid, if we Worſhip
this Deity, till ye be raviſhed from us, we ſhall be deſtroyed,
therefore I judge it convenient upon mature deliberation, that
we caſt it into the River, which advice was approved of by all
without oppoſition, and the Cabinet thrown into the next
River.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the Spaniards firſt touched on this Iſland, this <hi>Cacic,</hi> who
was thoroughly acquainted with them, did avoid and ſhun them
as much as in him lay, and defended himſelf by force of Arms,
wherever he met with them, but at length being taken he was
burnt alive, for flying from ſo unjuſt and cruel a Nation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to ſecure his Life againſt them, who only thirſted after
the blood of himſelf and his own People. Now being bound to the
poſt, in order to his Execution a certain Holy Monk of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan</hi>

of our Faith: which he never heard of before, and which might be
ſatisfactory and advantagious to him, conſidering the ſmall time
allow'd him by the Executioner, promiſing him Eternal Glory and
Repoſe, if he truly believ'd them, or otherwiſe Everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>Once it ſo hapned, that the Citizens of a Famous City, diſtant
Ten Miles from the place where we then reſided, came to meet us
with a ſplendid Retinue, to render their Viſit more Honourable,
bringing with them delicious Viands, and ſuch kind of Dainties,
with as great a quantity of Fiſh as they could poſſibly procure, and
diſtributing them among us; but behold on a ſudden, ſome wicked
Devil poſſeſſing the Minds of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> agitated them with ſo
great fury, that I being preſent, and without the leaſt Pretence or
Occaſion offered, they cut off in cold Blood above Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

               <p>Some time after I diſpatch Meſſengers to all the Rulers of the

or ſeek their refuge by abſence and flight, but to meet us, and that
I would engage (for they underſtood my Authority) that they
ſhould not receive the leaſt of Injuries; for the whole Country was
extremely afflicted at the Evils and Miſchiefs already perpetrated;
and this I did with the advice of their Captain. As ſoon as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht
the Province, Two and Twenty of their Noblemen came
forth to meet us, whom the Captain contrary to his Faith given,
would have expos'd to the Flames, alledging that it was expedient

to uſe any Stratagem againſt us; but with great difficulty and
much adoe, I ſnatcht them out of the fire.</p>

Theſe Iſlanders of <hi>Cuba,</hi> being reduc'd to the ſame Vaſſalage and

other Deſperado's, put a period to their days with a Halter, and
the Husband, together with his Wife and Children, hanging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

               <p>By the ferocity of one <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyrant (whom I knew) above

a multitude of People periſhed by this kind of Death.</p>
               <p>A certain Perſon here in the ſame Iſle conſtituted to exerciſe a

One Hundred and Sixty were deſtroy'd, inſomuch that in a ſhort

               <head>Of the CONTINENT.</head>
               <p>IN the Year 1514, a certain unhappy Governour Landed on the
firm Land or Continent, a moſt bloody Tyrant, deſtitute of all
Mercy and Prudence, the Inſtrument of God's Wrath, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to people theſe parts with <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and although ſome
Tyrants had touched here before him, and Cruelty hurried them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97577:14"/>
into the other. World by ſeveral wayes of Slaughter, yet they
came no farther than to the Sea Coaſt, where they committed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Thefts and Robberies, but this Perſon exceeded all that
ever dwelt in other Iſlands, though execrable and profligate Villains:
for he did not only ravage and depopulate the Sea-Coaſt, but bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the largeſt Regions and moſt ample Kingdoms in their own
Ruins, ſending Thouſands to Hell by his Butcheries. He made
Incurſions for many Miles continuance, that is to ſay, in thoſe
Countries that are included in the Territories of <hi>Darien</hi> and the
Provinces of <hi>Nicaraqua,</hi> which are near Five Hundred Miles of
the moſt Fertil Land in the World, very well peopled, abounding
with Villages, Cities and Towns, and the moſt opulent for Gold
of all the Regions hitherto diſcover'd. And although <hi>Spain</hi> has
bin ſufficiently furniſhed with the pureſt God, yet it was dig'd out
of the Powels and Mines of the ſaid Countries by the <hi>Indians,</hi>
where (as we have ſaid) they periſhed.</p>
               <p>This Ruler, with his Complices found out new inventions to
rack, torment, force and extort Gold from the <hi>Indians.</hi> One of
his Captains in a certain Excurſion undertaken by the Command of
his Governour to make Depraedations, deſtroy'd Forty Thouſand
Perſons and better expoſing them to the edge of the Sword, Fire,
Dogs and veriety of Torments; of all which a Religious Man of
the Order of St <hi>Francis, Franciſcus de S. Romano,</hi> who was then
preſent, was an Eye-Witneſs.</p>
               <p>Great and Injurious was the blindneſs of thoſe praeſided over the
<hi>Indians,</hi> as to the Converſion and Salvation of this People: for
they denyed in Effect what they in their flouriſhing Diſcourſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, and declar'd with their Tongue what they contradicted
in their Heart; for it came to this paſs, that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be
commanded on the penalty of a bloody War, Death and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Bondage, to embrace the Chriſtian Faith, and ſubmit to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King; as if the Son of God, who ſuffered
Death for the Redemption of all Mankind, had enacted a Law,
when he pronounced theſe words, <hi>Go and teach all Nations</hi> that
Infidels, living peaceably and quietly in their Haereditary Native
Country, ſhould be impos'd upon pain of Confiſcation of all their

never ſaw, or heard mention'd before; and whoſe Meſſengers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
themſelves toward them with ſuch Inhumanity and Cruelty
as they had done hitherto. Which is certainly a moſt foppiſh and
abſured way of Proceeding, and merits nothing but Scandal, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion,
nay Hell it ſelf. Now ſuppoſe this Notorious and Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
Governour had bin impower'd to ſee the Execution of theſe
Edicts perform'd, to the end they might appear more Juſt and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable
thereby, for of themſelves they were repugnant both to
Law and Equity; yet he commanded (or they who were to ſee the
Execution thereof, did it of their own Heads without Authority)
that when they phanſied or propoſed to themſelves any place, that
was well ſtor'd with Gold, to rob and feloniouſly ſteal it away
from the <hi>Indians</hi> living in their Cities and Houſes, without the
leaſt ſuſpicion of any ill Act. Theſe wicked <hi>Spaniards,</hi> like
Thieves came to any place by ſtealth, half a Mile off of any City,
Town or Village, and there in the Night publiſhed and proclaim'd
the Edict among themſelves after this manner: <q>You <hi>Cacies</hi> and
<hi>Indians</hi> of this Continent, the Inhabitants of ſuch a Place, Which
they named; We declare, or be it known to you all, that
there is but one God, one Pope, and one King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who
is Lord of theſe Countries; appear forth without delay, and
take the Oath of Allegiance to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, as his Vaſſals:</q>
So about the Fourth Watch of the Night, or Three in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe poor Innocents overwhelm'd with heavy Sleep, ran vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
on that place they named, ſet Fire to their Hovels, which
were all thatcht, and ſo, without Notice, burnt Men, Women
and Children; kill'd whom they pleas'd upon the Spot; but thoſe
they reſerv'd as Captives, were compell'd through Torments to
confeſs where they had hid the Gold, when they found little or
none at their Houſes; but they who liv'd being firſt ſtigmatized,
were made Slaves; yet after the Fire was extinguiſht, they came
haſtily in queſt of the Gold. Thus did this Wicked Man, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the Infernal Furies, behave himſelf with the Aſſiſtance of
Profligate Chriſtians, whom he had liſted in his Service from the
<hi>14th</hi> to the 21. or 22. Year, together with his Domeſtick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Followers, from whom he received as many Portions,
beſides what he had from his Salves in Gold, Pearls, and Jewels,
as the Chief Governour would have taken, and all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
to execute any kind of Kingly Office followed in the ſame
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97577:15"/>
Footſteps; every one ſending as many of his Servants as he could
ſpare, to ſhare in the ſpoil. Nay he that came hither as Biſhop firſt
of all did the ſame alſo, And at the vory time (as I conjecture)
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did depraedate or rob this Kingdom of above Ten
Hundred Thouſand Crowns of Gold: Yet all theſe their Thefts and
Felonies, we ſcarce find upon Record that Three Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Caſtilian</hi> Crowns ever came into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King's Coffers; yet
there were above Eight Hundred Thouſand Men ſlain: The other
Tyrants who governed this Kingdom afterward to the Three and
Thirtieth year, depriv'd all them of Life that remain'd among
the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Among all thoſe flagitious Acts committed by this Governour
while he rul'd this Kingdom, or by his Conſent and Permiſſion
this muſt by no means be omitted: A certain <hi>Cacic,</hi> beſtowing on
him a Gift, voluntarily, or (which is more probable) induced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by Fear, about the weight of Nine Thouſand Crowns, but the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> not ſatisfied with ſo vaſt a Sum of Money, ſieze him, fix
him to a Pole; extended his Feet, which being mov'd near the Fire,
they demanded a larger Sum; the <hi>Cacic</hi> overcome with Torments,
ſending home, procur'd Three Thouſand more to be brought and
preſented to them: But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> adding new Torments to
new Rage and Fury, when they found he would confer no more
upon them, which was becauſe he could not, or otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would not, they expos'd him ſo long to that Torture, till
by degrees of heat the Marrow guſht out of the Soles of his Feet,
and ſo he dyed; Thus they often murder'd the Lords and Nobles
with ſuch Torments to Extort the Gold from them.</p>
               <p>One time it hapned that a Century or Party of One Hundred
<hi>Spaniards</hi> making Excurſions, came to a Mountain, where many
People ſhunning ſo horrid and pernicious an Enemy conceal'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who immediately ruſhing on them, putting all to the Sword
they could meet with, and then ſecur'd Seventy or Eighty Married
Women as well as Virgins Captives; but a great Number of
<hi>Indians</hi> with a fervent deſire of recovering their Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
appear'd in Arms againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and when they drew
near the Enemy, they unwilling to loſe the Prey, run the Wives
and Maidens through with their Swords. The <hi>Indians</hi> through
Grief and Trouble, ſmiting their Breaſts, brake out into theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.

Ten or Fifteen Miles from <hi>Panama,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Paris,</hi> very
Rich in Gold; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave him a viſit, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with Fraternal Kindneſs, and Courteouſly received, and
of his own accord, preſented the Captain with a Gift of Fifteen
Thouſand Crowns; who was of opinion, as well as the reſt of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> that he who beſtow'd ſuch a quantity of Money <hi>gratis,</hi>
was the Maſter of vaſt Treaſure, their ſole Aim and Deſign, and
the Solace of their Labours; whereupon they conterfeit a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Departure, but returning about the Fourth Night-Watch, and
entring the City privily upon a ſurprize, which they thought was
ſufficiently ſecur'd, conſecrated it with many Citizens to the
Flames, and robb'd them of Fifty or Sixty Thouſand Crowns.
The <hi>Dynaſt</hi> or Prince eſcaped with Life, and gathering together
as great a Number of Men as he could poſſibly at that inſtant of
time, and Three or Four Days being elapſed, purſued the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who had depriv'd him alſo by Violence and Rapine of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

them, recover'd all his Gold with the deſtruction of Fifty
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> but the remainder of them having receiv'd many
Wounds in that Rencounter betook them to their Heels and ſav'd

and fall upon the ſaid <hi>Cacic</hi> well-arm'd and overthrow him and all

In truth no Perſon can ſatisfactorily or ſufficiently expreſs
the Fertility, Temperateneſs of the Climate, or the Multitude of

for this Region contain'd ſome Cities that were Four Miles
long; and the abundance of Fruits of the Earth (which was the
cauſe of ſuch a Concourſe of People) was highly commendable.
The People of this place, becauſe the Country was Level and
plain, deſtitute of Mountains, ſo very delightful and pleaſant,
that they could not leave it without great grief, and much diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
they were therefore tormented with the greater Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Perſecutions, and forced to bear the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyranny and
Servitude, with as much Patience as they were Maſters of: Add
farther that they were peaceable and meek-ſpirited. This Tyrant
with theſe Complices of his Cruelty did afflict this Nation (whoſe
advice he made uſe of in deſtroying the other Kingdoms) with
ſuch and ſo many great Dammages, Slaughters, Injuſtice, Slavery,
and Barbariſme, that a Tongue, though of Iron, could not expreſs
them all fully. He ſent into this Province (which is larger than the
County of <hi>Ruſcinia)</hi> Fifty Horſe-Men, who put all the People to
the Edge of the Sword, ſparing neither Age nor Sex upon the moſt
trivial and inconſiderable occaſion: As for Example, if they did
not come to them with all poſſible ſpeed, when called; and bring
the impoſed burthen of <hi>Mahid</hi> (which ſignifies Corn in their Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect)
or if they did not bring the Number of <hi>Indians</hi> required to
his own, and the Service, or rather Servitude of his Aſſociates.
And the Country being all Campaign or Level, no Perſon was able
to withſtand the Helliſh Fury of their Horſes.</p>
               <p>He commanded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to make Excurſions, that is, to rob
other Provinces, permitting and granting theſe Thieving Rogues
leave to take away by force as many of theſe peaceable People as
they could, who being iron'd, (that they might not ſink under the
Burthen of Sixty or Eighty Pound weight) it frequently hapned,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97577:16"/>
that of Four Thouſand <hi>Indians,</hi> Six only returned home, and ſo

<q>Thoſe were Journeys, which we travelled frequently in the

infeſt or moleſt him; and diſpoſe of them to others; upon which it
fell out, that for the ſpace of a Year complete, there was no ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by force plunder the <hi>Indians</hi> of the whole ſtock of Corn that they
had laid up for the ſupport of their Families, and by theſe indirect
Courſes above Thirty Thouſand periſhed with Hunger. Nay it
fortun'd at one time, that a Woman oppreſt with inſufferable Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
depriv'd her own Son of his Life to preſerve her own.</p>
               <p>In this Province alſo they brought many to an untimely End,
loading their Shoulders with heavy planks and pieces of Timber,
which they were compell'd to carry to a Haven Forty Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
in order to their building of Ships; ſending them likewiſe
unto the Mountains to find out Hony and Wax, where they were
devour'd by Tygers; nay they loaded Women impregnated with
Carriage and Burthens fit for beaſts.</p>
               <p>But no greater peſt was there that could unpeople this Province,
than the Licenſe granted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this Governour, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Captives from the <hi>Cacics</hi> and Potentates of this Region; for
at the Expiration of Four or Five Months, or as often as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
leave of the Governour to demand them, they deliver'd
them up Fifty Servants, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> terrified them with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97577:17"/>
that if they did not obey them in anſwering their unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Demands, they ſhould be burnt alive, or baited to Death by
Dogs. Now the <hi>Indians</hi> are but ſlenderly ſtor'd with Servants;
for it is much if a <hi>Cacic</hi> hath Three or Four in his Retinue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have recourſe to the Subjects; and when they had, in
the firſt place, ſeized the Orphans, they required earneſtly and
inſtantly one Son of the Parent, who had but Two, and Two of
him that had but Three, and ſo the Lord of the place ſatisfied the
deſires of the Tyrant, not without the Effuſion of Tears and
Groans of the People, who (as it ſeems) were very careful of their
Children. And this being frequently repeated in the ſpace between
the Year 1523, and 1533, the Kingdom loſt all their Inhabitants,
for in Six or Seven Years time there were conſtantly Five or Six
Ships made ready to be fraighted with <hi>Indians</hi> that were ſold in
the Regions of <hi>Panania</hi> and <hi>Peruſium,</hi> where they all dyed; for it
is by dayly Experience prov'd and known, that the <hi>Indians</hi> when
Tranſported out of their Native Country into any other, ſoon
dye; becauſe they are ſhortned in their allowance of Food, and
the Task impos'd on them no ways diminiſhed, they being only
bought for Labour. And by this means, there have been taken
out of this Province Five Hundred Thouſand Inhabitants and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
who before were Freemen, and made Slaves, and in the
Wars made on them, and the horrid Bondage they were reduc'd
unto Fifty or Sixty Thouſand more have periſhed, and to this day
very many ſtill are deſtroy'd. Now all theſe Slaughters have been
committed within the ſpace of Fourteen years incluſively, poſſibly
in this Province of <hi>Nicaraqua</hi> there remains Four or Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men, who are put to Death by ordinary and perſonal Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,

there was no firſt or ſecond Attempt, but all were
expoſed to ſlaughter: The year enſuing thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who
ſtyle themſelves Chriſtians) came thither to rob, kill and ſlay,
though they pretend they undertook this Voyage to people the
Countrey. From this year to the preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> 1542. the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
Violence and Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came to the higheſt
degree of extremity: for they had ſhook hands with and bid adieu
to all fear of God and the King, unmindful of themſelves in this
ſad and deplorable condition, for the Deſtructions, Cruelties,
Butcheries, Devaſtations, the Demoliſhing of Cities, Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they perpetrated in ſo many and ſuch ample
Kingdoms, are ſuch and ſo great, and ſtrike the minds of Men
with ſo great horror, that all we have related before are inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
comparatively to thoſe which have been acted from the year
1518 to 1542, and to this very month of <hi>September</hi> that we now
live to ſee the moſt heavy, grievous and deteſtable things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that the Rule we laid down before as a Maxim might be
indiſputably verified, to wit, that from the beginning they ran
headlong from bad to worſe, and were overcome in their Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
acts and wickedneſs only by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus from the firſt entrance of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>New Spain,</hi>
which hapned on the 18th. day of <hi>April</hi> in the ſaid month of the
year 1518, to 1530, the ſpace of ten whole years, there was no
end or period put to the Deſtruction and Slaughters committed by
ther mercileſs hands of the Sanguinary and Blood-thirſty Spaniard
in the Continent, or ſpace of 450 Miles round about <hi>Mexico,</hi> and
the adjacent or neighbouring parts, which might contain four or
five ſpatious Kingdoms, that neither for magnitude or fertility
would give <hi>Spain</hi> her ſelf the pre-eminence. This intire Region
was more populous then <hi>Toledo, Sevil, Valedolid, Saragoza,</hi> and

Within theſe twelve years the Spaniards have deſtroyed in the

Women, Youth and Children above four Millions of people in
theſe their Acqueſts or Conqueſts (for under that word they mask
their Cruel Actions) or rather thoſe of the Turk himſelf, which
are reported of them, tending to the ruin of the Catholick Cauſe,
together with their Invaſions and Unjuſt Wars, contrary to and

               <p>There is no Tongue, Art, or Human knowledge can recite the
horrid Impieties, which theſe Capital Enemies to Government
and all Mankind have been guilty of at ſeveral times and in ſeveral

<hi>Indians</hi> to drudge for them in the carriage of their bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage;
and as ſoon as they came the Spaniards clapt them into the
Yards belonging to their Houſes and there incloſed them all. It

                  </q>

               <p>They alſo committed a very great Butchery in the City <hi>Tepeara.</hi>
which was larger and better ſtored with Houſes then the former;
and here they Maſſacred an incredible number with the point of
the Sword,</p>
               <p>Setting ſail from <hi>Cholula,</hi> they ſteer'd their courſe to <hi>Mexico,</hi>
whoſe King ſent his Nobles and Peers with abundance of Preſents
to meet them by the way, teſtifying by divers ſorts of Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
how grateful their arrival was and acceptable to him: but
when they came to a ſteep Hill, his brother went forward to
meet them accompanied with many Noblemen who brought them
many gifts in Gold, Silver, and Robes Embroidered with Gold
and at their entrance into the City, the King himſelf carried in a
golden Litter, together (with the whole Court) attended them to
the Palace prepared for their reception; and that very day as I
was informed by ſome perſons then and there preſent by a grand
piece of Treachery, they took the great King <hi>Motencuma,</hi> never
ſo much as dreaming of any ſuch ſurprize, and put him into the
cuſtody of eighty Soldiers, and afterward loaded his Legs with
irons; but all theſe things being paſſed over with a light pencil
of which much might be ſaid, one thing I will diſcover acted by
them, that may merit your obſervation. When the Captain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the Haven, to fight with a Spaniſh Officer, who made
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97577:19"/>
War againſt him, and left another with an hundred Soldiers, more
or leſs as a Guard to King <hi>Motencuma,</hi> it came into their heads,
that to act ſomewhat worth remembrance, that the dread of their
Cruelty might be more and more apprehended, and greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>In the interim all the Nobility and Commonalty of the City
thought of nothing elſe, but how to exhilarate the Spirit of their
Captive King, and ſolace him during his Confinement with variety
of diverſions and Recreations; and among the reſt this was one,
<hi>viz.</hi> Revellings and Dances which they celebrated in all Streets
and Highways, by night and they in their Idiom term <hi>Mirotes,</hi> as
the Iſlanders do <hi>Arcytos;</hi> to theſe Maſques and nocturnal Jigs they
uſually go with all their Riches, Coſtly Veſtments and Robes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with any thing that is pretious and glorious, being wholly
addicted to this humor, nor is there any greater token among them
then this of their extraordinary exultation and rejoycing. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in like manner, and Princes of the Blood Royal every one
according to his degree exerciſe theſe Maſques and Dances, in
ſome place adjoyning to the Houſe where their King and Lord is
detained Priſoner. Now there were not far from the Palace about
2000 Young Noblemen who were the iſſue of the greateſt Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the Kingdom, and indeed the flower of the whole Nobility
of King <hi>Motencuma,</hi> and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain went to viſit them with
ſome Soldiers, and ſent others to the reſt of the places in the City
where theſe Revellings were kept, under pretence only of being
ſpectators of the ſolemnity. Now the Captain had commanded,
that, at a certain hour appointed they ſhould fall upon theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
and he himſelf approaching the <hi>Indians</hi> very buſie at their
Dancing, ſaid, <hi>San Jago</hi> (that is St. <hi>James</hi> it ſeems that was
the Word) <hi>Let us ruſh in upon them,</hi> which was no ſooner heard,
but they all began with their naked Swords in hand to pierce their
tender and naked Bodies, and ſpil their generous and Noble
blood, till not one of them was left alive on the place, and the
reſt following his example in other parts, (to their inexpreſſible
ſtupefaction and grief) ſeized on all theſe Provinces. Nor will
the Inhabitants till the General conflagration ever diſcontinue the
Celebration of theſe Feſtivals, and the Lamentation and Singing
with certain kind of Rhythmes in their <hi>Arcytos,</hi> the doleful ditty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97577:20"/>
of the Calamity and Ruin of this Seminary of the antient No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the whole Kingdom, which was their frequent Pride and
Glory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> ſeeing this not to be exampled cruelty and iniquity
executed againſt ſuch a number of guiltleſs perſons, and alſo bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with incredible patience the unjuſt Impriſonment of their King,
from whom they had an abſolute Command not to take up Arms
againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the whole City was ſuddenly up in Arms
fell on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and wounded many of them, the reſt hardly
eſcaping; but they preſenting the point of a Sword to the Kings
Breaſt, threatned him with death unleſs he out of the Window
commanded them to deſiſt; but the <hi>Indians</hi> for the preſent diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Mandate, proceeded to the Election of a Generaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,
or Commander in Chief over all their Forces; and becauſe
that the Captain, who went to the Port returned Victor, and
brought away a far greater number of <hi>Spaniards</hi> then he took
along with him, there was a Ceſſation of Arms for three or four
days, till he re-entred the City, and then the <hi>Indians</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together and made up a great Army, fought ſo long and
ſo ſtrenuouſly, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſpairing of their ſafety, called
a Council of War and therein reſolv'd to retreat in the dead time
of night and ſo draw off their Forces from the City: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the knowledge of the <hi>Indians</hi> they deſtroyed a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Retreating on the Bridges made over their Lakes in this juſt
and Holy War, for the cauſes above-mentioned, deſerving the
approbation of every upright Judge. But afterward the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
having recruited and got together in a Body, they reſolved to take
the City and carried it at laſt, wherein moſt deteſtable Butcheries
were acted, a vaſt number of the people ſlain, and their Rulers
periſhed in the Flames.</p>
               <p>All theſe horrid Murders being commited in <hi>Mexico</hi> and other
Cities ten, fifteen and twenty miles diſtant. This ſame Tyranny
and Plague in the abſtract proceeded to infeſt and lay deſolate <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuco;</hi>
A Region abounding with Inhabitants even to admiration,
nor were the ſlaughters therein perpetrated leſs ſtupendious and
wonderful. In the ſame manner they utterly laid waſte the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Futepeca, Ipilcingonium</hi> and <hi>Columa,</hi> every one of them
being as large as the Kingdoms of <hi>Leon,</hi> and <hi>Caſtile.</hi> It would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97577:20"/>
be very difficult or rather impoſſible to relate the Cruelties and
Deſtruction there made and committed, and prove very nauſeous
and offenſive to the Reader.</p>
               <p>'Tis obſervable, that they entred upon theſe Dominions, and
laid waſte the <hi>Indian</hi> Territories, ſo populous, that it would
have rejoyced the hearts of all true Chriſtians to ſee their number
upon no other title or pretence, but only to enſlave them; for at
their firſt arrival they compel'd them to ſwear the Oath of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Fealty to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and if they did not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to it, they menaced them with death and Vaſſalage, and
they who did not forthwith appear to ſatisfie the unequitable
Mandates, and ſubmit to the will and pleaſure of ſuch unjuſt and
Cruel Men were declared Rebels, and accus'd of that Crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Lord the King; the blindneſs or ignorance of thoſe who
were ſet over the <hi>Indians</hi> as Rulers did ſo darken their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they did not apprehend that known and incontrovertible
Maxim in Law, <hi>That no Man can be called a Rebel, who is not firſt
proved to be a ſubject.</hi> I omit the injuries and prejudice they do
to the King himſelf, when they ſpoil and ravage his Kingdoms, and
as much as in them lies, diminiſh and impair all his Right and
Title to the <hi>Indies,</hi> nay in plain Engliſh invalidate and make it null

do for our Kings in thoſe Countries, by the injuſt and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
pretences aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This Tyrant upon the ſame pretext ſent two other Captains,
who exceeded him in impiety and cruelty, if poſſible to the moſt
flouriſhing and Fertil (in Fruits and Men) Kingdoms of <hi>Guatimala,</hi>
Situate toward the South, who had alſo received Orders to go to
the Kingdoms of <hi>Naco, Honderae,</hi> and <hi>Guaymura,</hi> verging upon

The one was ſent by Land the other by Sea, and both
well furniſhed with Horſe and Foot.</p>
               <p>This I declare for a Truth, that the outrages committed by theſe
two, particularly by him that went to <hi>Guatimala</hi> (for the other
not long after his departure died a violent Death) would afford
matter ſufficient for an entire Volume, and when completed be

with burthens of Preſents and Gifts: and as ſoon as he approacht
them, ſent his Captians with a party of Soldiers to depopulate
their Land, who committed great ſpoils and made cruel ſlaughters
among them; and in particular a Seditious and Rebellious Officer
who with three hundred Soldiers entred a Neighbouring Country
to <hi>Guatimala,</hi> and there firing the Cities and Murdering all the
Inhabitants, violently deprived them of all their Goods, which
he did deſignedly, for the ſpace of an hundred and twenty miles;

find the Countrey laid waſt, and ſo be deſtroyed by the <hi>Indians</hi>
in revenge for the dammage they had received by him and his
Forces which hapned accordingly: for the Chief Commander
whoſe order the aboveſaid Captain had diſobey'd and ſo became a
Rebel to him, was there ſlain. But many other bloody Tyrants
ſucceeded him, who from the year 1524 to 1535. did unpeople
and make a Deſert of the Provinces of <hi>Naco</hi> and <hi>Hondurae</hi> (as well
as other places) which were lookt upon as the Paradiſe of delights,
and better peopled then other Regions; inſomuch that within the
Term of theſe eleven years there fell in thoſe Countries above
two Millions of Men, and now there are hardly remaining Two
Thouſand, who dayly dye by the ſeverity of their Slavery.</p>
               <p>But to return to that great Tyrant, who outdid the former in

but withal ſtrictly and expreſly prohibiting and forbidding them, to
inform the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of their Flight, or the Places of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.
And behold a great many of the <hi>Indians</hi> addreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to them, earneſtly requeſting, they would admit them as
Subjects, being very willing and ready to ſerve them: The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
replyed that he would not entertain them in ſuch a Capacity,
but inſtead of ſo doing would put every individual Perſon to
Death, if they would not diſcover the Receptacles of their Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Governours. The <hi>Indians</hi> made anſwer that they were
wholly ignorant of the matter, yet that they themſelves, their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97577:22"/>
Wives and Children ſhould ſerve them; that they were at home,
they might come to them and put them to Death, or deal with
them as they pleas'd. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> O wonderful! went to
the Towns and Villages, and deſtroy'd with their Lances theſe
poor Men, their Wives and Children, intent upon their Labour,
and as they thought themſelves, ſecure and free from danger.
Another large Village they made deſolate in the ſpace of two hours,
ſparing neither Age, nor Sex, putting all to the Sword, without
Mercy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving that this Barbarous and Hard-hearted
People would not be pacified with Humility, large Gifts, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled
Patience, but that they were butcher'd without any
Cauſe, upon ſerious Conſultation took up a Reſolution of getting
together in a Body, and fighting for their Lives and Liberty; for
they conceiv'd it was far better, (ſince Death to them was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Evil) with Sword in Hand to be kill'd by taking Revenge
of the Enemy, then be deſtroy'd by them without ſatisfaction.
But when they grew ſenſible of their want of Arms, Nakedneſs
and Debility, and that they were altogether incapable of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Horſes, ſo as to prevail againſt ſuch a furious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
recollecting themſelves, they contriv'd this Stratagem, to
dig Ditches and Holes in the High-way into which the Horſes might
fall in their paſſage, and fixing therein purpoſely ſharp and burnt
Poſts, and covering them with looſe Earth, ſo that they could not
be diſcern'd by their Riders, they might be transfixed gored by
them. The Horſes fell twice or thrice into thoſe holes, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took this Courſe to prevent them for the
future; and made this a Law, that as many of the <hi>Indians</hi> of
what Age or Sex ſoever as were taken, ſhould be caſt into theſe
Ditches that they had made. Nay they threw into them Women
with Child, and as many Aged Men as they laid hold of, till they
were all fill'd up with Carkaſſes. It was a ſight deſerving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration,
to behold Women and Children gauncht or run
through with theſe Poſts, ſome were taken off by Spears and
Swords, and the remainder expos'd to hungry Dogs, kept ſhort of
Food for that purpoſe, to be devour'd by them and torn in pieces.
They burnt a Potent Nobleman in a very great Fire, ſaying, <hi>That
he was the more Honour'd by this kind of Death.</hi> All which But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
continued Seven Years, from 1524, to 1531. I leave
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97577:22"/>
the Reader to judge how many might be Maſſacred during that
time.</p>
               <p>Among the Innumerable, Flagitious Acts done by this Tyrant
and his Co-partners (for they were as Barbarous as their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal)
in this Kingdom, this alſo occurs worthy of an Aſteriſm in
the Margin. In the Province of <hi>Cuzcatan</hi> in which S. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s
City is ſeated, which Country with the Neighbouring Sea-Coaſts
extends in Length Forty or Fifty Miles, as alſo in the very City
of <hi>Cuzcatan,</hi> the Metropolis of the whole Province, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with great Applauſe: For about Twenty or Thirty
Thouſand <hi>Indians</hi> brought with them Hens and other neceſſary
Proviſions, expecting his coming. He, accepting their Gifts,
commanded every ſingle <hi>Spaniara</hi> to make choice of as many of
theſe People, as he had a mind to, that during their ſtay there,
they might uſe them as Servants, and forced to undergo the moſt
ſervile Offices they ſhould impoſe on them. Every one cull'd out
a Hundred, or Fifty, according as he thought convenient for his
peculiar ſervice, and theſe wretched <hi>Indians</hi> did ſerve the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
with their utmoſt ſtrength and endeavour; ſo that there could be
nothing wanting in them but Adoration. In the mean time this
Captain requird a great Sum of Gold from their Lords (for that
was the Load-ſtone attracted him thither) who anſwered, they
were content to deliver him up all the Gold they had in poſſeſſion;
and in order thereunto, the <hi>Indians</hi> gathered together a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Spears gilded with <hi>Orichalcum,</hi> (which had the appearance
of Gold, and in truth ſome Gold in them intermixt) and they
were prefented to him. The Captain ordered them to be toucht,
and when he found them to be <hi>Orichalcum</hi> or mixt Metal, he ſpake
to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as followeth. Let that Nation that is without
Gold be accurſed to the Pit of Hell. Let every Man detain thoſe
Servants he Elected, let them be clapt in Irons, and ſtigmatiz'd
with the Brand of Slavery,. which was accordingly done; for they
were all burnt, who did not eſcape with the King's Mark. I my
ſelf ſaw the Impreſſion made on the Son of the Chiefeſt Perſon in
the City. Thoſe that eſcap'd, with other <hi>Indians,</hi> engaged the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> by Force of Arms, but with ſuch ill ſucceſs, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of them loſt their Lives in the Attempt. After this they
return'd to <hi>Guatimala,</hi> where they built a City, which God in
his juſt Judgments with Three Deluges, the Firſt of Water, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97577:23"/>
Second of Earth, the Third of Stones, as big as half a ſcore
Oxen, all concurring at one and the ſame time, laid Level with
its own Aſhes. Now all being ſlain who were capable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arms againſt them, the reſt were enſlav'd, paying ſo much <hi>per</hi>
Head for Men and Women as a Ranſom; for they uſe no other
ſervitude here, and then they were ſent into <hi>Pecuſium</hi> to be ſold,
by which means together with their ſlaughters committed upon
the Inhabitants, they deſtroy'd and made a Deſert of this Kingdom,
which in Breadth as well as Length contains One Hundred Miles;
and with his Aſſociates and Brethren in Iniquity, Four Millions at
leaſt in Fifteen or Sixteen Years, that is, from 1524, to 1540
were murdered, and dayly continues deſtroying the ſmall reſidue
of that People with his Cruelties and Brutiſhneſs.</p>
               <p>It was the uſual Cuſtom of this Tyrant, when he made War
with any City or Province, to take along with him as many of
thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> he had ſubjugated as he could, that they might fight
with their Country-men; and when he had in his Army Twenty,
or ſometimes Thirty Thouſand of them, and could not afford them
ſuſtenance, he permitted them to feed on the Fleſh of other <hi>Indians</hi>
taken Priſoners in War; and ſo kept a Shambles of Man's Fleſh
in his Army, ſuffered Children to be kill'd and roaſted before his
Face. They butcher'd the Men for their Feet and Hands only;
for theſe Members were accounted by them Dainties, moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Food.</p>
               <p>He was the Death of many by the intolerable Labour of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
Ships by Land, cauſing them to Tranſport thoſe Veſſels with
Anchors of a vaſt weight from the <hi>Septentrional</hi> to the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
Sea, which are One Hundred and Thirty Miles diſtant; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
abundance of great Guns of the largeſt ſort, which they carried
on their bare, naked ſhoulders, ſo that oppreſt with many great
and ponderous Burthens, (I ſay no more than what I ſaw) they
dyed by the way: He ſeparated and divided Families, forcing
Married Men from their Wives, and Maids from their Parents,
which he beſtow'd upon his Marriners and Soldiers, to gratifie their
burning Luſt. All his Ships he freighted with <hi>Indians,</hi> where
Hunger and Thirſt diſcharg'd them of their Servitude and his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
by a welcome Death. He had two Companies of Soldiers
who hackt and tore them in pieces, like Thunder from Heaven
ſpeedily. O how many Parents has he robb'd of their Children,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97577:23"/>
how many Wives of their Husbands, and Children of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents?
How many Adulteries, Rapes, and what Libidinous Acts
hath he been guilty of? How many hath he enſlav'd and oppreſt
with inſufferable Anguiſh and unſpeakable Calamities? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tears, Sighs and Groans hath he occaſion'd? To how many
has he bin the Author of Deſolation, during their Peregrination in
this, and of Damnation in the World to come, not only to <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
whoſe Number is numberleſs, but even to <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by whoſe help and aſſiſtance he committed ſuch deteſtable
Butcheries and flagitious Crimes? I ſupplicate Almighty God,
that he would pleaſe to have Mercy on his Soul, and require no

this World.</p>

               <p>AFter the perpetration of all the Cruelties rehearſed in <hi>New

and which was deplorable, Eight Hundred <hi>Indians,</hi> that had Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

a Mule, or Camel. Well, He was made Governour of the City
of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and all <hi>New Spain,</hi> and with him many other Tyrants
had the Office of Auditors confer'd upon them: Now they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made ſuch a progreſs toward the Deſolation of this Region,
that if the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> had not vigorouſly oppoſed them, and that

Companion of this Governour employed Eight Thouſand <hi>Indians</hi>
in Erecting a Wall to incloſe his Garden, but they all dyed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Supplies, nor Wages from him, to ſupport themſelves,
at whoſe Death he was not in the leaſt concern'd.</p>
               <p>After the firſt Captain before ſpoken of had abſolutely profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated

very conſiderable, who gratefully requited him with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
becauſe Fame had nois'd it abroad, that he was a moſt
Opulent Prince in Gold and Silver; and to the end he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
from, and purge him of his Gold, he was cruciated with
Torments after this manner; his Body was extended, Hands
bound to a Poſt, and his Feet put into a pair of Stocks, they all
the while applying buring Coals to his Feet at a tormenting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
where a Boy attended, who by little and little ſprinkled
them with Oyl that his Fleſh might roaſt the better: Before him
there ſtood a Wicked Fellow, preſenting a Bow to his Breaſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with a Mortal Arrow, (if let fly) behind him, another with Dogs
held in with Chains, which he threatned to let looſe at him, which
if done, he had bin torn to pieces in a moment; and with theſe
kind of Torments they racked him to extort a Confeſſion, where
his Treaſures lay; till a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Monk came and deliver'd him
from his Torments, but not from Death, for he departed this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Life not long after: And this was the ſevere Fate of many
<hi>Cacics</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Lords, who dyed with the ſame Torments
which they were expos'd to by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in order to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing
of their Gold and Silver to themſelves.</p>
               <p>At this very time, A certain Viſiter of Purſes rather than Souls
hapned to be here preſent, who (finding ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Idols which
were hid; for they were no better inſtructed in the Knowledge of
the true God by reaſon of the Wicked Documents and Dealings of
the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> detain'd Grandees as Slaves, till they had deliver'd
him all their Idols, for he phancied they were made of Gold or
Silver, but his Expectation being fruſtrated, he chaſtiſed them
with no leſs Cruelty than Injuſtice; and that he might not depart
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97577:24"/>
bubbled out of all his hopes, conſtrain'd them to redeem their
Idols with Money, that ſo they might, according to their Cuſtom,
Adore them. Theſe are the Fruits of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Artifices and
Juggling Tricks among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and thus they promoted the
Honour and Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>This Tyrant from <hi>Mechuacam</hi> arrives at <hi>Xaliſco,</hi> a Country
abounding with People very fruitful, and the Glory of the <hi>Indians</hi>
in this reſpect, that it had ſome Towns Seven Miles long; and
among other Barbariſms equal to what you have read, which they
acted here, this is not to be forgotten, that Women big with
Child, were burthen'd with the Luggage of Wicked Chriſtians,
and being unable to go out their uſual time, through extremity
of Toil and Hunger, were neceſſitated to bring them forth in the
High-wayes, which was the Death of many Infants.</p>
               <p>At a certain time a profligate Chriſtian attempted to devirgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

               <p>In this Kingdom of <hi>Xaliſco</hi> (according to report) they burnt
Eight Hundred Towns to Aſhes, and for this Reaſon the <hi>Indians</hi>
growing deſperate, beholding the dayly deſtruction of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders

the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſlew ſeveral of them juſtly and deſervedly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
fled to the inſenſible Rocks and Mountains (yet more
tender and kind than the ſtony-hearted Enemy) for Sanctuary;
where they were miſerably Maſſacred by thoſe Tyrants who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and there are now few, or none of the Inhabitants to be

the <hi>Indians</hi> is moſt Juſt, as well by the Law of Nature, as the

               <head>Of the Kingdom of JUCATAN.</head>
               <p>AN Impious Wretch by his Fabulous Stories and Relations
to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was made Praefect of the Kingdom of
<hi>Jucatan,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1526; And the other Tyrants
to this very day have taken the ſame indirect Meaſures to obtain
Offices, and ſcrew or wheedle themſelves into publick Charges or
Employments, for by this Praetext, and Authority, they had the
greater opportunity to commit Theft and Rapine. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was very well peopled, and both for Temperature of Air,
and the Plenty of Food and Fruits, in which reſpect it is more
Fertile than <hi>Mexico,</hi> but chiefly for Hony and Wax, it exceeds
all the <hi>Indian</hi> Countries that hath hitherto bin diſcover'd. It is
Three Hundred Miles in Compaſs. The Inhabitants of this place
do much excel all other <hi>Indians,</hi> either in Politie or Prudence, or
in leading a Regular Life and Morality, truly deſerving to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Knowledge of the true God. Here the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
might have Erected many fair Cities, and liv'd as it were in a
Garden of Delights, if they had not, through Covetouſneſs, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
and the weight of Enormous Crimes rendred themſelves
unworthy of ſo great a Benefit. This Tyrant, with Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men began to make War with theſe Innocent People, living
peaceably at home, and doing injury to none, which was the
ruine of a great Number of them: Now becauſe this Region
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97577:25"/>
affords no Gold; and if it did the Inhabitants would ſoon have
wrought away their lives by hard working in the Mines, that ſo
he might accumulate Gold by their bodies and Souls, for which
Chriſt was Crucified: For the generality he made ſlaves of thoſe
whoſe lives he ſpared, and ſent away ſuch Ships as were driven
thither by the Wind of report, loaden with them, exchanging
them for Wine, Oyl, Vinegar, Salt Pork, Garments, Pack
Horſes and other Commodities, which he thought moſt neceſſary
and fit for his uſe. He propoſed to them the choice of Fifty Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
and ſhe that was the faireſt or beſt complexioned he bartered
for a ſmall Cask of Wine, Oyl, Vinegar or ſome inconſiderable
quantity of ſalt Pork, the ſame exchange he proffered of Two or
Three Hundred well-diſpoſed Yound Boys, and one of them who
had the Mind or preſence of a Princes Son, was given up to them
for a Cheeſe, and One Hundred more for a Horſe. Thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his flagitious courſes from 1526 to 1533, incluſively, till
there was news brought of the Wealth and Opulence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Peruſia,</hi> whither the <hi>Spaniards</hi> marcht, and ſo for ſome time
there was a Ceſſation of this Tyranny; but in few days after they
returned and acted enormous Crimes, robbed and impriſoned
them and committed higher offences againſt the God of Heaven;
nor have they yet done, ſo that now theſe Three Hundred Miles of
Land ſo populous (as I ſaid before) lies now uncultivated and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
deſerted.</p>
               <p>No Solifidian can believe the particular Narrations of their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm,
and Cruelty in thoſe Countreys. I will only relate two
or three Stories which are freſh in my memory. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
uſed to trace the ſteps of <hi>Indians,</hi> both Men and Women
with curſt Currs, furious Dogs; an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman that was
ſick hapned to be in the way in ſight, who perceiving that ſhe was
not able to avoid being torn in pieces by the Dogs, takes a Cord
that ſhe had and hangs her ſelf upon a Beam, tying her Child
(which ſhe unfortunately had with her) to her foot; and no
ſooner had ſhe done, yet the Dogs were at her, tearing the
Child; but a Prieſt coming that way Baptiz'd it before quite
dead.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left this Kingdom, one of them invited
the Son of ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Governour of a City or Province, to go
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97577:26"/>
along with him, who told him he would not leave or deſert his
Native Countrey, whereupon he threatned to cut off his ears, if
he refus'd to follow him: But the Youth perſiſting reſolutely,
that he would continue in the place of his Nativity, he drawing
his Sword cut off each Ear, notwithſtanding which he perſever'd
in his firſt opinion, and then as if he had only pincht him, ſmiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut off his Noſe and Lips.</p>
               <p>This Rogue did laſciviouſly boaſt before a Prieſt, and as if he
had merited the greateſt applauſe, commended himſelf to the
very Heavens, ſaying, <q>He had made it his chief Trade or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to impregnate <hi>Indian</hi> Women, that when they were ſold
afterward, he might gain the more Money by them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this Kingdom or (I'm certain) in ſome Province of New
<hi>Spain,</hi> A <hi>Spaniard</hi> Hunting and intent on his game, phancyed
that his Beagles wanted food; and to ſupply their hunger ſnatcht
a young little Babe from the Mothers breaſt, cutting off his Arms
and Legs, caſt a part of them to every Dog, which they having
devour'd, he threw the remainder of the Body to them. Thus
it is plainly manifeſt how they value theſe poor Creatures, created
after the image of God, to caſt them to their Canibal-Curs. But
that which follows is (if poſſible) a ſin of a deeper dye.</p>
               <p>I pretermit their unparallel'd Impieties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and only cloſe all
with this one Story that follows. Thoſe haughty obdurate and
execrable Tyrants, who departed from this Countrey to Fiſh for
Riches in <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and four Monks of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
with Father <hi>James</hi> who Travelled thither alſo to keep the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
in Peace, and attract or mildly perſwade by their Preaching
the remnant of Inhabitants, that had outlived a ſepteniſial Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to embrace the knowledge of Chriſt. I conceive theſe are
the perſons who in the year 1534, Travelling by <hi>Mexico</hi> were
ſollicited by ſeveral Meſſengers from the <hi>Indians,</hi> to come into
their Countrey, and inform them in the knowledge of one God,
the true God, and Lord of the whole World: to this end they
appointed Aſſemblies and Councils to examine and underſtand
what Men they were, who called themſelves Fathers and Friers,
what they intended and what difference there was between them
and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whom they had been ſo moleſted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented:
but they received them at length upon this condition
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97577:26"/>
that they ſhould be admitted alone, without any <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which
the Fathers promiſed; for they had permiſſion, nay an expreſs
Mandate from the Preſident of New <hi>Spain</hi> to make that promiſe,
and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould not do them the leaſt detriment or
injury. Then they began, to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and
to explicate and declare the pious intention of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
of all which they had notice by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for ſeven years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they had no King nor no other but him, who oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them with ſo much Tyranny. The Prieſts continued there
but forty days, but behold they bring forth all their Idols to be
committed to the flames; and then their Children which they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
as the apple of the Eye, that they might be inſtructed. They
alſo erected Temples and Houſes for them and they were deſired
to come to other Provinces and Preach the Goſpel, and introduce
them into the knowledge of God, and the Great (as they ſtilled
him) King of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> And the Prieſts perſwaſions wrought ſo
effectually on them, that they condeſcended to that which was
never done in <hi>India</hi> before (for whatſoever thoſe Tyrants who
waſted and conſumed theſe large Kingdoms and Provinces, did
miſrepreſent and falſifie, was only done to bring an odium and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
upon the <hi>Indians).</hi> For Twelve or Fifteen Princes of ſpatious
and well-peopled Regions aſſembled, every one diſtinct and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the reſt, with his own ſubjects, and by their unanimous
conſent upon Council and Advice, of their own accord ſubmitted
themſelves to the Government of the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Kings and accepted

and ſerve them as ſubjects to their Lawful Liege Lord.</p>
               <p>In Witneſs whereof I have in my cuſtody, a certain Inſtrument
Signed and Atteſted by the aforeſaid Religioſo's.</p>
               <p>Thus to the great joy and hope of theſe Prieſts reducing them
to the knowledge of Chriſt they were received by the Inhabitants
of this Kingdom, that ſurviv'd the hear and rage of the Spaniſh
Cruelties: but behold eighteen Horſe and Twelve Footmen by
another way crept in among them, bringing with them many
Idols, which were of great weight, and taken out of other Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by Force. The Commander in chief of theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
one of the Dynaſta's or Rulers of that Province which they
entred into, to appear before him, and commanded him to take
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97577:27"/>
theſe Idols with him, diſtribute them through his Countrey and
exchange every ſingle Idol for an <hi>Indian</hi> Man or Woman, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he would make War againſt him. The aboveſaid Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to it by fear did ſo accordingly with a command, that his
Subjects ſhould adore Worſhip and Honour them, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
ſend Indians Male and Female into ſervitude. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
People delivered up their Children, and by this means
there was an end made of this Sacrilegious Merchandize, and thus
the <hi>Cacic</hi> ſatisfied the greedy deſires of the (I dare not ſay Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian)
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> One of theſe Sacrilegious Robbers was <hi>John
Garcia</hi> by name, who being very ſick and at the point of death,
had ſeveral Idols hid under his Bed, and calling his <hi>Indians</hi> that
waited on him, as a Nurſe, commanded her not to part with thoſe
Idols at a ſmall rate for they were of the better ſort, and that ſhe
ſhould not diſpoſe of them without one <hi>Indian,</hi> for each Idol by
way of Barter. Thus by this his private and Nuncupative laſt
Will and Teſtament diſtracted with theſe carking cares, he gave
up the Ghoſt: And who is it that will not fear his being tormented
in the darkeſt and loweſt Hell? Let us now conſider what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in Religion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made, and what examples of
Chriſtianiſm they gave, at their firſt arrival in <hi>America,</hi> how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
they honoured God, and what expence of ſweat and toil
they were at to promote his Worſhip and Adoration among theſe
Infidels. Let it be alſo taken into ſerious conſideration, whoſe ſin
is the greater, either <hi>Joroboam</hi>'s, who made all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, and
cauſed two Golden Claves to be erected, or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who
traffick and Trade in Idols like <hi>Judas,</hi> who was the occaſion of
ſuch great ſcandals. Theſe are the good Deeds of the Spaniſh
<hi>Dons,</hi> who often, nay very often to feed their Avarice, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
Gold have ſold and ſtill do ſell, denied and ſtill do deny
Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> now finding the Promiſes of the Religious, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould not enter into this Countrey, null and void; nay
that the Spaniards brought Idols from other places to be put off
there; when as they had delivered up their own to the Prieſts to
be burnt, that there might be one only Worſhip of the true God
eſtabliſhed among them; they were highly incenſed againſt theſe
Friers, and addreſſed themſelves to them in theſe Words following.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97577:27"/>
Why have you deceived us, binding your promiſes with falſe
proteſtations, that the Spaniards ſhould not be admitted to come
hither? And why have you burnt our Gods, when others are
brought from other Regions by the Spaniards? Are the Gods of
other Provinces more ſacred than ours? The Friers as well as
they could (though they had little to return in anſwer) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by ſoft Language to appeaſe them; and went to theſe
Thirty Spaniards, declaring the evil actions they were guilty of,
humbly ſupplicating them to withdraw themſelves from that place.
Which they would by no means condeſcend to, and what is moſt
flagitious and wicked perſwaded the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
by thoſe Prieſts; Which being made known to them,
Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> reſolved to be the death of theſe Monks, but having
notice thereof by ſome courteous <hi>Indians,</hi> they ſtole away from
thence by night, and fled; but after their departure the truth of
the matter and the Spaniſh Malice being underſtood; they ſent
ſeveral Meſſengers who followed them fifty Miles diſtant beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in the name of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to return and begging pardon
for that ignorant miſtake.</p>
               <p>The Preiſts relying on their words, returned, and were careſſ'd
like Angels ſent from Heaven; and continued with them, (from
whom they received a Thouſand kindneſſes) four or five months.
But when the Spaniards perſiſted in their reſolution not to quit the
place, although the Vice-Roy did uſe all endeavours and fair
means to recall them, they were Proclaim'd Traitors, guilty of
High Treaſon; and becauſe they continued ſtill exerciſing Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and perpetrating nefandous Crimes, the Prieſts were ſenſible
they would ſtudy revenge, though it might be ſome conſiderable
time before they put it in execution, fearing that it might fall upon
their own heads, and ſince they could not exerciſe the function of
their Miniſtry ſecurely and undiſturbed by reaſon of the continual
Incurſions and Aſſaults made by the Spaniards, they conſulted
about their departure, and did leave this Kingdom accordingly
which remain'd deſtitute of all Chriſtian Doctrin and theſe poor
Souls are at this day involv'd in the obſcurity of their former Miſery
and Ignorance, they being deprived by theſe accurſed Spaniards,
of all hopes of remedy, and the irrigation of Divine knowledge,
juſt like young withering Plants for want of Water: For in that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97577:28"/>
very juncture of time, when theſe Religioſo's took leave, they
embraced the Doctrine of our Faith with the greateſt Fervency
and Eagerneſs imaginable.</p>

               <p>THE Province of St. <hi>Martha</hi> was rich in the Neighbouring
Golden Mines, and a fruitful Soil, nay the People were
very expert and induſtrious in thoſe Mine-works: Upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
or Temptation it was, that from the Year 1540, to 1542,
abundance of Tyrants ſailed thither, laying waſte the whole
Country by their Depredations, ſlaughtering the Inhabitants at a
prodigious and bloody rate; and robbing them of all their Gold,
who dayly fled to their Ships for Refuge, moving ſometime to one
place, and ſometime to another. And thus theſe Provinces were
laid waſte, the greateſt Outrages being committed on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
which laſted till the Year 1523, whither the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
then came to ſeat themſelves, and fix their intended Habitation.
And becauſe it is a plentiful Region and Opulent withal; it was
ſubjected to ſeveral Rulers, who like Infernal Fiends contended
who ſhould obtain the Palm, by out-ſtaining the Sword of his
Predeceſſor in Innocent Blood; inſomuch, that from the Year 1529
to this very day, they have waſted and ſpoiled as much good ground
as extended Five Hundred Miles, and unpeopled the Countrey.</p>
               <p>If I deſign'd to enumerate all the Impieties, Butcheries, Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Iniquities, Violences, Deſtructions and other the Piacula
and black Enormities committed and perpetrated by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in this Province, againſt God, the King, and theſe harmleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
I might compile a Voluminous Hiſtory, and that ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
if God permit my Glaſs to run longer, in his good time.
It may ſuffice for the preſent to relate ſome paſſages written in a
Letter to our King and Lord by a Reverend Biſhop of theſe
Provinces, Dated the 20th of <hi>May. An. Dom.</hi> 1541. wherein
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97577:28"/>
among other matters he thus words it. <q>I muſt acquaint your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majeſty, that the only way to ſuccour and ſupport this
tottering Region is to free it from the Power of a Father in
Law, and marry it to a Husband who will treat her as ſhe ought
to be, and lovingly entertain her, and that muſt be done
with all poſſible Expedition too, if not, I am certain that ſhe
will ſuddenly decay and come to nothing by the covetous and
fordid Deportment of the Governours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a little after
he writes thus, By this Means your Majeſty will plainly know
and underſtand how to depoſe the Prefects or Governours of
of thoſe Regions from their Office if they deſerve it, that ſo
they may be alleviated and eas'd of ſuch Burthens; which if
not perform'd, in my Opinion, the Body Politick will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
its Health. And this I will make appear to your Majeſty
that they are not Chriſtians, but Devils; not Servants of God
and the King, but Traitors to the King and Laws, who are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
in thoſe Regions. And in reality nothing can be more
obſtructive to the preſervation of peace, and the Converſion
of thoſe that live peaceably, then Inhumane and Barbarous
Uſage, which they, who lead a quiet and peaceable Life, too
frequently undergo, and this is ſo faſtidious and nauſeous to
them, that there can be nothing in the World ſo odious and
deteſtable among them, as the Name of a Chriſtian: For they
term the Chriſtians in their Language <hi>Yares,</hi> that is, Devils;
and in truth not without reaſon; for the Actions of thoſe that
reſide in theſe Regions, are not ſuch as ſpeak them to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
or Men, gifted with Reaſon, but abſolute Devils; hence
it is, that the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving theſe Actions committed by
the Heads as well as Members, who are void of all Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Humanity, do judge the Chriſtian Laws to be of the
ſame ſtrain and temper, and that their God and King are the
Authors of ſuch Enormities: Now to endeavour to work upon
them a contrary perſwaſion is to no purpoſe; for this would
afford them a greater Latitude and Liberty to deride Jeſus Chriſt
and his Laws. Now the <hi>Indians</hi> who protect and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by force of Arms, think it more eligible, and far better to
dye once, than ſuffer ſeveral and many Deaths under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Power. This I know experimentally, Moſt Invincible <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97577:29"/>
And he adds farther, Your Majeſty is more Powerful in Subjects
and Servants, who frequent theſe Kingdoms, then you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
Nor is there one Soldier among them all, who does not
publickly and openly profeſs, if he robs, ſteals, ſpoils, kills,
burns His Majeſties Subjects, 'tis to purchaſe Gold: He will not
ſay that he therein does your Majeſty great Service, for they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
they do it to obtain their own Share and Dividend. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Moſt Invincible <hi>Caeſar,</hi> it would be a very prudential Act
for Your Majeſty to teſtifie by a rigid Correction and ſevere Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

and call them Country <hi>Indians,</hi> or Inhabitants, who by a dreadful

and utterly deſtroy'd; as appears by the Epiſtle of the praemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Biſhop, who only gives us a ſlight Account or Eſſay of their
Perſecutions and Sufferings. The <hi>Indians</hi> of this Country uſe to

like Brutes through the uncouth wayes in their Journeys over the
Mountains, if they happen to faint through Weakneſs, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry

and force them to go on without Reſpiration, or Time to

I ſay they burſt out into theſe Expreſſions, I am abſolutely tir'd,

A Nameleſs Pirate in the Year 1510, accompanied with a
parcel of Sixty or Seventy, arriv'd at <hi>Trinity-Iſland,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<hi>Sicile,</hi> both in Amplitude and Fertility, and is contiguous to
the Continent on that ſide where it toucheth upon <hi>Paria,</hi> whoſe
Inhabitants, according to their Quality, are more addicted to
Probity and Vertue, than the reſt of the <hi>Indians;</hi> who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
publiſhed an Edict, that all the Inhabitants ſhould come and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
with them. The <hi>Indian</hi> Lords and Subjects gave them a
Debonair and Brotherly Reception, ſerving them with wonderful
Alacrity, furniſhing them with dayly Proviſions in ſo plentiful a
manner, that they might have ſufficed a more numerous Company;
For it is the Mode among <hi>Indians</hi> of this New World, to ſupply
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> very bountifully with all manner of Neceſſaries. A
ſhort time after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> built a ſtately Houſe, which was an
Appartment for the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they might accompliſh their
praemeditated Deſigns, which was thus effected. When they were
to thatch it, and had rais'd it two Mens height, they inclos'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them there, to expedite the Work, as they pretended,
but in truth that they who were within, might not ſee thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
thus part of them ſurrounded the Houſe with Sword in Hand
that no one ſhould ſtir out, and part of them entred it, and bound
the <hi>Indians,</hi> menacing them with Death, if they offered to move
a Foot; and if any one endeavoured to eſcape, he was preſently
hackt in pieces; but ſome of them partly wounded, and partly
unwounded getting away, with others who went not into the
Houſe, about One Hundred or Two Hundred, betook themſelves
to another Houſe with Bows and Arrows; and when they were all
there, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſecur'd the Doors, throwing in Fire at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, and ſo they all periſhed. From hence they ſet Sail to
the Iſland of St. <hi>John</hi> with near upon One Hundred and Eighty
Slaves, whom they had bound, where they ſold one half of them,
and thence to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> where they diſpos'd of the reſt. Now
when I taxed this Captain with Wickedneſs and Treachery in the
very Iſle of St. <hi>John,</hi> he diſmiſt me with this Anſwer; <hi>Forbear
good Sir.</hi> I had this in commiſſion from thoſe who ſent me hither,
that I ſhould ſurprize them by the ſpetious pretenſe of Peace,
whom I could not ſieze by open Force; and in truth this ſame
Captain told me with his own Mouth, that in <hi>Trinity-Iſle</hi> alone, he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97577:30"/>
had met with a Father and Mother in Civil uſage, which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
to his greater Confuſion and the aggravation of his Sins.
The Monks of our Order of St. <hi>Dominic</hi> on a certain time held a
Conſult about ſending one of their Fraternity into this Iſland,
that by their Preaching they might inſtruct them in the Chriſtian
Faith, and teach them the way to be ſav'd, of which they were
wholly Ignorant. And to this end they ſent thither a Religious
and Licentiate in Theolgie, (or Doctor in Divinity, as we term
it among us) a Man Famous for his Vertue and Holineſs with a
<hi>Laic</hi> his Aſſociate, to viſit the Country, converſe with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and find out the moſt convenient places for the Erection
of Monaſteries. As ſoon as they were arriv'd according to cuſtom,
they were entertain'd like Coeleſtial Meſſengers, with great Aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ection,
Joy and Reſpect, as well as they could, for they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of their Tongue, and ſo made uſe of ſigns, for the preſent.
It hapned that after the departure of that Veſſel that
brought theſe Religious Men, another came into the Port, whoſe
Crew according to their Helliſh Cuſtom, fraudulently, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the Religious brought away a Prince of that Province as
Captive, who was call'd <hi>Alſonſus,</hi> (for they are ambitious of a
Chriſtian Name,) and forthwith deſire without farther Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he would Baptize him: But the ſaid Lord <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was
deceitfully overperſwaded to go on board of them with his Wife
and about Seventeen more, pretending that they would give him a
Collation; which the Prince and they did, for he was confident,
that the Religious would by no means ſuffer him to be abus'd, for
he had no ſo much Confidence in the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but as ſoon as they
were upon Deck, the perfidious Rogues, ſet Sail for <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi>
where they were ſold as Slaves. The whole Country being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
diſcompos'd, and underſtanding that their Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
were violently carried away, addreſſed themſelves to theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſo's,
who were in great danger of loſing their Lives: But
they being made to underſtand this unjuſt Action, were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
afflicted, and 'tis probable would have ſuffered Death, rather
than permit the <hi>Indians</hi> to be ſo injuriouſly dealt with, which might
prove an Obſtruction to their receiving of, and believing in God's
Word. Yet the <hi>Indians</hi> were ſedated by the promiſes of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
for they told them, they would ſend Letters by the firſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97577:31"/>
Ship that was bound for <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> whereby they would procure
the Reſtitution and Return of their Lord and his Retinue. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God to ſend a Ship thither forthwith, to the greater confirming
of the Governours Damnation, where in the Letters they ſent to the
Religious of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> Letters containing repeated Exclamations
and Proteſtations, and proteſt againſt ſuch Actions, but thoſe that
received them denyed them Juſtice, for that they were partakers
of that Prey, made of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> ſo injuſtly and impiouſly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated.
But when the Religious, who had engag'd to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
that their Lord <hi>Alphonſus</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd within Four
Moneths, and found that neither in Four, nor Eight Moneths he
was return'd, they prepar'd themſelves for Death, and to deliver
up their Life to Chriſt, to whom they had offer'd it before their
departure from <hi>Spain:</hi> Thus the Innocent <hi>Indians</hi> were revenged
on the Innocent Prieſts; for they were of Opinion, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
had a hand in the Plot, partly, becauſe they found their
Promiſes that their Lord ſhould return within Four Moneths, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
and partly becauſe the Inhabitants make no difference
between a Religious Frier and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rogue. At another time
it fell out likewiſe, through the Rampant Tyranny and Cruel
Deeds of evil-minded Chriſtians, that the <hi>Indians</hi> put to Death two
<hi>Dominican</hi> Friers, of which I am a faithful Witneſs, eſcaping my
ſelf, not without a very great Miracle, which Tranſaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
ſilently to paſs over, leſt I ſhould terrifie the Reader with the
Horror of the Fact.</p>
               <p>In theſe Provinces, there was a City ſeated on the Bay of <hi>Codera,</hi>
whoſe Lord was call'd <hi>Higueroto,</hi> a Name, either proper to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or common to the Rulers of that Place. A <hi>Cacic</hi> of ſuch
ſignal Clemency, and his Subjects of ſuch noted Vertue, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> who came thither, were extraordinary welcom, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with Proviſions, enjoying Peace and Comfort, and no Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wanting: But a perfidious Wretch got many of them on
board, and ſold them to the Iſlanders of St. <hi>John.</hi> At the ſame
time I landed upon that Iſland, where I obtained a ſight of this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and heard the Relation of his Actions. He utterly deſtroy'd
that Land, which the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took very unkindly at
his Hands, who frequently playd the Pirate, and rob'd on that
ſhore, deteſting it as a wicked thing, becauſe they had loſt that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97577:31"/>
place, where they uſe to be treated with as great Hoſpitality and
Freedom, as if they had been under their own Roof: Nay they
tranſported from this place, among them, to the Iſles of <hi>Hiſpanio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
and St. <hi>John</hi> Two Millions of Men and upward, and made the
Coaſt a Deſert.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certainly true, that they never ſhip off a Veſſel freigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Indians,</hi> but they pay a third part as Tribute to the Sea,
beſides thoſe who are ſlaughter'd, when found in their own Houſes.
Now the Soarce and Original of all this is the ends they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to themſelves. For there is a neceſſity of taking with them a
great number of <hi>Indians,</hi> that they may gain a great ſum of Mony by
their Sale, now the Ships are very ſlenderly furniſhed with Proviſions
and Water in ſmall Quantity, to ſatisfie few, leſt the Tyrants, who
are term'd Owners or Proprietors of Ships ſhould be at too great
expence in Victualling their Veſſels, nay they ſcarce carry Food
enough with them to maintain the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that manage the Veſſel,
which is the reaſon ſo many <hi>Indians</hi> dye with Hunger and Thirſt,
and of neceſſity they muſt be thrown over-board: Nay one of
them told me this for a Truth, that there being ſuch a Multitude
of Men thus deſtroy'd, a Ship may ſail from the Iſle of <hi>Lucaya</hi> to
<hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which is a Voyage of Twenty Leagues and upward,
without Chart or Compaſs, by the ſole Direction on Obſervation
of dead fluctuating Carkaſſes.</p>
               <p>But afterward, when arriv'd, and driven up into the Iſle whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are brought to be ſold, there is no Perſon that is in ſome
ſmall meaſure compaſſionate, but would be extreamly mov'd and
diſcompos'd at the ſight; <hi>viz.</hi> to ſpie old Men and Women, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Naked Children half ſtarv'd. Then they ſeparate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
from Children, Wives from their Husbands, about Ten or
Twenty in a Company, and caſt lots for them, that the Deteſtable
Owners of the Ships may have their ſhare; who prepare Two or
Three Ships, and equip them as a Fleet of Pirates, going aſhore

Damm'd, why do you beſtow him upon me; muſt I, think you,

uſage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> towards <hi>Indians</hi> in their Pearl-Fiſhing;

Heaven daring <hi>Deſperado</hi> can admit of no compariſon with theſe,
although the extracting or digging for Gold is one of the ſharpeſe
ſubterranean Drudgeries, they plunge them down four or five ells

thereof to ſupport nature. Their Lodging or Bed is the Earth
confined to a pair of Stocks, for fear they ſhould run away: And

conſider withall, that it is impoſſible for the ſtrongeſt conſtitution

dye through the extream rigor of the Cold, ſpitting Blood
which is occaſioned by the too great compreſſion of the Breaſt,
procreated by a continued holding breath under Water, for by
too much cold a profluvium of blood follows. Their hair naturally

the Spaniſh Dominions, with its Government and abſolute Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to ſome <hi>German</hi> Merchants, with power to make certain
Capitulations and Conventions, who came into this Kingdom with
Three Hundred Men, and there found a benign mild and peaceable
people, as they were throughout the <hi>Indies</hi> till injured by the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> Theſe more cruel then the reſt beyond compariſon,
behav'd themſelves more inhumanely then rapacious Tygres
Wolves and Lyons, for they had the juriſdiction of this Kingdom,
and therefore poſſeſſing it with the greater freedom from controul;
lay in wait and were the more vigilant with greater care and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
to underſtand the practical part of heaping up Wealth, and
robbing the Inhabitants of their Gold and Silver, ſurpaſſing all
their Predeceſſors in thoſe indirect ways, rejecting wholly both
the fear of their God and King, nay forgetting that they were
born men with reaſonable Faculties.</p>
               <p>Theſe incarnate Devils laid waſte and deſolate Four Hundred
miles of moſt Fertile Land, containing vaſt and wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
moſt ſpatious and large Valleys ſurrounded with Hills,
forty Miles in length, and many Towns richly abounding in Gold
and Silver. They deſtroy'd ſo many and ſuch conſiderable Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that there is not one ſupernumerary witneſs left to relate the
Story, unleſs perchance ſome that lurkt in the Caverns and Womb
of the Earth to evade death by their inhumane Swords embrew'd
in Innocent <hi>Indian</hi> blood, eſcaped. I judge that they by new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97577:33"/>
and unuſual Torments ruinated four or five Millions of Souls
and ſent them all to Hell. I will give a taſte of two or three of
their Tranſactions, that hereby you may gueſs at the reſt.</p>
               <p>They made the ſupream Lord of the Province a Slave, to
ſqueeze his Gold from him, racking him to extort his confeſſion
who eſcaping fled into the Mountains, their common Sanctuary,
and his Subjects lying abſconded in the Thickets of the Woods,
were ſtir'd up to Sedition and Tumult or Mutiny. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
follow and deſtroy many of them, but thoſe that were taken alive
and in their power were all publickly ſold for Slaves by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Crier.</p>
               <p>They were in all Provinces they came into entertained and
welcomed by the <hi>Indians</hi> with Songs, Dances and Rich Preſents
but Rewarded very ungratefully with bloodſhed and Slaughter.
The German Captain and Tyrant cauſed ſeveral of them to be
clapt into a Thatcht Houſe, and there cut in pieces; but ſome of
them to avoid falling by their bloody and mercileſs Swords,
climb'd up to the beams and Rafters of the Houſe, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
hearing it (O cruel Brute?) commanded Fire to be
put to it and burnt them all alive, leaving the Region deſert and
deſolate.</p>
               <p>They alſo came to another ſtately Province, bordering on St.
<hi>Martha;</hi> whoſe inhabitants did them many egregious and notable
ſervices, beſtowing on them innumerable quantities of Gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many other gifts, but when they were upon departure, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
of their Civil Treating and Deportment the German Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
commanded that all the Indians, with their Wives and
Children if poſſible, ſhould be taken into Cuſtody: incloſed in
ſome large capacious place, and that there it ſhould be ſignified
unto them, whoſoever deſired to be ſet at Liberty ſhould redeem
himſelf at the Will and Pleaſure (as to price;) of the unjuſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
or at a certain rate impoſed upon himſelf, his wife and
every Childs head; and to expedite the buſineſs prohibited the
adminiſtration or allowance of any food to them, till the Gold
required for Redemption was paid down to the utmoſt grain.
Several of them ſent home to diſcharge the demanded price of their
Redemption, and procur'd their Freedom, as well as they could
by one means or other, that ſo they might return to their Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97577:34"/>
and profeſſion, but not long after he ſent other Rogues and
Robbers among them to re-enſlave thoſe that were Redeemed.</p>
               <p>To the ſame Gaol they are brought a ſecond time, being inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
or rather conſtrained to a ſpeedy Redemption by hunger
and thirſt; Thus many of them were twice or thrice taken,
captiv'd and Redeemed; but ſome who were not capable of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiting
ſuch a ſum, periſhed there. Farthermore this Tyrant
was big with an itching deſire after the diſcovery of the <hi>Peruſian</hi>
Mines, which he did accompliſh. Nay ſhould I enumerate the
particular Cruelties, Slaughters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> committed by him though
my diſcourſe would not in the leaſt be contrarint to the Truth,
yet it would not be beleived and only ſtupifie and amaze the
Reader.</p>
               <p>This courſe the other Tyrants took who ſet ſail from <hi>Venecuela</hi>
and St. <hi>Martha</hi> (with the ſame Reſolution of detecting the
<hi>Peruſian</hi> Golden, Conſecrated Houſes as them they eſteemed) who
found the fruitful Region ſo deſolate, deſerted, and waſted by
Fire and Sword, that thoſe Cruel Tyrants themſelves were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with wonder and aſtoniſhment at the traces and ruins of ſuch
prodigious Devaſtations.</p>
               <p>All theſe things and many more were prov'd by Witneſſes in
the <hi>Indian</hi> Exchequer, and the Records of their Teſtimony were
entred in that Court, though theſe execrable Tyrants burnt many
of them that there might be little or nothing prov'd as a cauſe of
thoſe great Devaſtations and Evils perpetrated by them. For the
Miniſter of Juſtice who have hitherto lived in <hi>India,</hi> through their
obſcure and damnable blindneſs, were not much ſollicitous about
the puniſhment of the Crimes and Butcheries which have been and
are ſtill committed by theſe Tyrants, only they may ſay poſſibly
becauſe ſuch a one, and ſuch a one hath wickedly and barbarouſly
dealt with the <hi>Indians,</hi> that is the reaſon ſo great a ſumm of
Crowns in Money is diminiſhed already or retrenched from His
Majeſties Annual Revenue, and this general and confuſed proof is
ſufficient (as they worthily conceive) to purge or repreſs ſuch
great and hainous Crimes. And though they are but few, are not
verified as they ought to be, nor do they attribute and lay upon
them that ſtreſs and weight as they ought to do, for if they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Duty to God and the King; it could not be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97577:34"/>
as it may be, that theſe <hi>German</hi> Tyrants have cheated and rob'd
the King of Three Millions of Gold and upward; and thus theſe
Enemies to God and the King began to depopulate theſe Regions
and deſtroy them, cheating his Majeſty of Two Millions of Gold
<hi>per Annum,</hi> nor can it be expected, that the Detriment done to
his Majeſty can poſſibly be retriev'd, as long as the Sun and Moon
endures, unleſs God by a Miracle ſhould raiſe as many Thouſands
from Death to Life, as have bin deſtroy'd. And theſe are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Dammages the King ſuffers. It would be alſo a Work wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the inquiry into, to conſider how many curſed Sacriledges and
Indignities God himſelf hath been affronted with to the diſhonour
of his Name. And what Recompence can be made for the loſs of
ſo many Souls as are now tormented in Hell by the Cruelty and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
of theſe Brutiſh <hi>German</hi> Tyrants. But I will conclude
all their Impiety and Barbariſme with one Example, <hi>viz.</hi> That
from the time they entred upon this Country to this very day, that
is, Seventeen Years, they have remitted many Ships fraighted
with <hi>Indians</hi> to be ſold as Slaves to the Iſles of St. <hi>Martha, Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,
Jamaica,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> ſelling a Million of Perſons at the
leaſt, I ſpeak modeſtly, and ſtill do expoſe to Sale to this very Year
of our Lord 1542, the King's Council in this Iſland ſeeing and
knowing it, yet what they find to be manifeſt and apparent they
connive at, permit and countenance, and wink at the horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
and Devaſtations innumerable which are committed on the
Coaſts of this Continent, extending Four Hundred Miles in
Length, and continues ſtill together with <hi>Venecuela</hi> and St. <hi>Martha</hi>
under their Juriſdiction, which they might eaſily have remedied
and timely prevented.</p>

               <head>Of the Provinces of FLORIDA.</head>
               <p>THree Tyrants at ſeveral times made their entrance into theſe
Provinces ſince the Year 1510, or 1511, to act thoſe
Crimes which others, and two of theſe Three made it their ſole
buſineſs to do in other Regions, to the end, that they might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
themſelves to higher Dignities and Promotions than they
could deſerve, by the Effuſion of Blood and Deſtruction of theſe
People; but at length they all were cut off by a violent Death,
and the Houſes which they formerly built and erected with the
cement of Humane Blood, (which I can ſufficiently teſtifie of
theſe three) periſhed with them, and their memory rotten, and
as abſolutely waſhed away from off the Face of the Earth, as if
they had never had a being. Theſe Men deſerted theſe Regions,
leaving them in great diſtraction and confuſion, nor were they
branded with leſs notes of Infamy, by the certain Slaughters they
perpetrated, though they were but few in number than the reſt.
For the Juſt God cut them off before they did much Mischief,
and reſerv'd the Caſtigation and Revenge of thoſe Evils which I
know, and was an Eye-Witneſs of, to this very Time and Place.
As to the Fourth Tyrant, who lately, that is, in the Year 1538,
came hither well-furniſhed with Men and Ammunition, we have
received no account theſe Three Years laſt paſt; but we are very
confident, that he, at his firſt Arrival, acted like a bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
even to extaſie and madneſs, if he be ſtill alive with his
Followers, and did injure, deſtroy, and conſume a vaſt Number
of Men (for he was branded with infamous Cruelty above all thoſe
who with their Aſſiſtants committed Crimes and Enormities of
the firſt Magnitude in theſe Kingdoms and Provinces) I conceive,
God hath puniſhed him with the ſame Violent Death, as he did
other Tyrants: But becauſe my Pen is wearied with relating ſuch
Execrable and Sanguinary Deeds (not of Men but Beaſts) I will
trouble my ſelf no longer with the diſmal and fatal Conſequences
thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:97577:35"/>
Theſe People were found by them to be Wiſe, Grave, and
well diſpos'd, though their uſual Butcheries and Cruelties in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
them like Brutes, with heavy Burthens, did rack their
minds with great Terror and Anguiſh. At their Entry into a
certain Village, they were welcomed with great Joy and Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
repleniſhed them with Victuals, till they were all ſatisfied,
yielding up to them above Six Hundred Men to carry their Bag
and Baggage, and like Grooms to look after their Horſes: The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> departing thence, a Captain related to the Superiour Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
returned thither to rob this (no ways diffident or miſtruſtful)
People, and pierced their King through with a Lance, of which
Wound he dyed upon the Spot, and committed ſeveral other
Cruelties into the bargain. In another Neighbouring Town,
whoſe Inhabitants as they thought, were more vigilant and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
having had the News of their horrid Acts and Deeds, they
barbarouſly murdered them all with their Lances and Swords, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
all, Young and Old, Great and Small, Lords and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
without exception.</p>
               <p>The Chief Tyrant cauſed many <hi>Indians</hi> (above Two Hundred
as 'tis noiſed abroad) whom he ſummon'd to appear before him
out of another Town, or elſe, who came voluntarily to pay their
Reſpects to him, to have their Noſes and Lips to the very Beard,
cut off; and thus in this grievous and wretched Condition, the
Blood guſhing out of their Wounds, return'd them back, to give
an Infallible Teſtimony of the Works and Miracles wrought by
theſe Preachers and Miniſters baptized in the Catholick Faith.</p>
               <p>Now let all Men judge what Affection and love they bear to
Chriſtianity; to what purpoſe, or upon what account they believe
there is a God, whom they preach and boaſt of to be Good and
Juſt, and that his Law which they profeſs (and indeed only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs)
to be pure and immaculate. The Miſchiefs acted by theſe
profligate Wretches and Sons of Perdition were of the deepeſt die.
At laſt this Captain devoted to Perdition dyed impenitent, nor do
we in the leaſt queſtion, but that he is overwhelmed and buried in
Darkneſs Infernal, unleſs God according to his Infinite Mercy and

Yet beyond all Controverſie, they did, and ſtill do go

               </p>
               <p>After I had committed to Writing what I have prementioned,
it was told me for a great Truth, that they had laid waſte in thoſe
Countreys great Kingdoms and Provinces, dealing Cruelly and

greater Opportunity and Convenience to be more Infamous and
Rigid to them, then others, they being very remote from <hi>Spain,</hi>

But among the other Numerous Wicked Acts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this is one that may be read in the <hi>Indian</hi> Courts. One of the
Governours commanded his Soldiers to go to a certain Village,
and if they denyed them Proviſions, to put all the Inhabitants to the

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97577:36"/>
they would not yield to them above Five Thouſand Men
as Enemies, fearing rather to be ſeen, then guilty of Illiberality,
were cut off by the Sword. Alſo a certain number of Men living
in Peace and Tranquillity proffered their ſervices to him; who,
as it fell out, were call'd before the Governour, but deferring their
appearance a little longer than ordinary, that he might infix their
minds with a remark of horrible Tyranny, he commanded, they
ſhould be deliver'd up, as Priſoners to their Mortal <hi>Indian</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who beg'd with loud Clamours and a Deluge of Tears, that
they might be diſpatcht out of this World by their own Hands,
rather than given up as a prey to the Enemy; yet being reſolute,
they would not depart out of the Houſe wherein they were, ſo
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hackt them in pieces Limb by Limb, who exclaim'd

and wholly ignorant of the goodneſs of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Bilbo-Blades,
the Mortal Dartings of their Lances, and the Strength of their
Horſe, whoſe Uſe and Service was to him altogether unknown,
and never ſo much as heard of before, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
ſufficiently weapon'd to rob the Devils themſelves of Gold, if they
had any, came to the place where they then were; ſaying, Where
are theſe <hi>Spaniards?</hi> Let them appear, I will not ſtir a foot from
hence till they give me ſatisfaction for my Subjects whom they
have ſlain, my Towns they have reduc'd to Aſhes, and my Riches

Slaughter of his Men, and ſeize on the Perſon of the King Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who was carried in a Chair or Sedan on Mens Shoulders.
There was a Treaty had about his Redemption, the King engaged
to lay down Four Millions of Crowns, as the purchaſe of his
Freedom, but Fifteen were paid down upon the Nail: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to ſet him at Liberty, but contrary to all Faith and Truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their common Cuſtom (for they always violated their
promiſes with the <hi>Indians)</hi> they falſly impoſed this upon him,
that his People were got together in a Body by his Command;
but the King made anſwer, That throughout his Dominions, not
ſo much as a Leaf upon a Tree durſt move without his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Pleaſure, and if any were aſſembled together, they muſt
of neceſſity believe that it was done without his Order, he being
a Captive, it being in their power to deprive him of his Life, if
any ſuch thing ſhould be ordered by him: Notwithſtanding which,
they entred into a Conſultation to have him burnt alive, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while after the Sentence was agreed upon; but the Captain at
the intreaty of ſome Perſons commanded him firſt to be ſtrangled,
and afterward thrown into the fire. The King underſtanding the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Death paſt upon him, ſaid; Why do you burn me? What
Fact have I committed deſerving Death? Did you not promiſe to
ſet me free for a Sum of Gold. And did I not give you a far lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

ſend me to your King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thus uſing many words to
the fame purpoſe, tending to the Confuſion and Deteſtation of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Injuſtice, he was burnt to Death. And here let us take
into ſerious Conſideration the Right and Title they had to make
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97577:38"/>
this War, the Captivity, Sentence, and Execution of this Prince,
and the Conſcience wherewith theſe Tyrants have poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of vaſt Treaſures, which they have ſurreptitiouſly and
fraudulently taken away from this King, and a great many more
of the Rulers of theſe Kingdoms. But as to the great number
of their Enormities committed by thoſe who ſtile themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in order to the Extirpation of this People, I will here repeat
ſome of them, which in the very beginning were ſeen by a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan,</hi>
confirm'd by his own Letters, and ſigned with his Hand
and Seal, ſending ſome of them to the <hi>Peruſian</hi> Provinces, and
others to the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> A Copy whereof I have in my
Cuſtody, Signed with his Hand, as I ſaid before; the Contents
whereof follow.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I Frier <hi>Marcus de Xlicia,</hi> of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order, and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the whole Fraternity reſiding in the <hi>Peruſian</hi> Provinces,
one of the firſt among the Religious, who arriv'd with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in theſe parts. I declare with incontrovertible and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Teſtimony, thoſe Tranſactions, which I ſaw with my
own Eyes, and particularly ſuch as relate to the uſage of the
Inhabitants of this Region. In the firſt place I was an Eye-Witneſs,
and am certainly aſſur'd, that theſe <hi>Peruſians</hi> are a
People, who tranſcend all other <hi>Indians</hi> in Meekneſs, Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Love to <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and I have ſeen the <hi>Indians</hi> beſtow
very liberally on them Gold, Silver, and Jewels, being very
ſerviceable to them many other wayes. Nor did the <hi>Indians</hi>
ever betake themſelves to their Arms in an Hoſtile manner, till
by infinite Injuries and Cruelties they were compell'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
For on the contrary, they gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> an amicable
and honourable Reception in all their Towns, and furniſhed
them with Proviſions, and as many Male and Female Servants
as they required.</p>
                  <p>I can alſo farther teſtifie, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> without the
leaſt provocation on their part, as ſoon as they entred upon
theſe Territories, did burn at the Stake their moſt Potent <hi>Cacic
Ataliba,</hi> Prince of the whole Country, after they had extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from him above Two Millions of Gold, and poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of his Province, without the leaſt Oppoſition; and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilimaca,</hi>
his Captain General, who with other Rulers came
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97577:38"/>
peaceably into them, follow'd him by the ſame fiery Tryal and
Death. As alſo ſome few days after, the Ruler of the Province
of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> who was burnt, without any Cauſe given, or
Crime laid to his Charge. They likewiſe put <hi>Schapera,</hi> Prince
of the <hi>Canaries</hi> to the ſame Death, and in like manner, burnt
the Feet of <hi>Alvidis,</hi> the greateſt of all the <hi>Quitonian</hi> Lords,
and rackt him with other Torments to Extract from him a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of <hi>Ataliba</hi>'s Treaſure, whereof as appear'd after, he
was totally ignorant. Thus they treated <hi>Cocopaganga,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of all the Provinces of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> who being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the Intreaties of <hi>Sebaſtian Bernalcarus,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
Captain, went peaceably to pay them a Viſit; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not give them as much Gold as they demanded,
they burnt him with many other <hi>Cacics</hi> and Chief Perſons of
Quality. And as I underſtand, did it with this evil Intention,
that they might not leave one ſurviving Lord or Peer in the
whole Countrey.</p>
                  <p>I alſo affirm that I ſaw with theſe Eyes of mine the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
for no other reaſon, but only to gratifie their bloody minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
cut off the Hands, Noſes, and Ears, both of <hi>Indians</hi> and
<hi>Indianeſſes,</hi> and that in ſo many places and parts, that it would
be too prolix and tedious to relate them. Nay, I have ſeen
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> let looſe their Dogs upon the <hi>Indians</hi> to bair and
tear them in pieces, and ſuch a Number of Villages burnt by
them, as cannot well be diſcover'd: Farther this is a certain
Truth, that they ſnatched Babes from the Mothers Embraces,
and taking hold of their Arms threw them away as far as they
would from them: (a pretty kind of barr-toſſing Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.)
They committed many other Cruelties, which ſtrook
me with Terror at the very ſight of them, and would take up
too much time in the Relation.</p>
                  <p>I likewiſe aver, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gathered together as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Indians</hi> as fill'd Three Houſes, to which, for no cauſe, (or
a very inconſiderable one) they ſet fire, and burnt every one
of them: But a Presbyter, <hi>Ocana</hi> by Name, chanced to ſnatch
a little Boy out of the Fire, which being obſerv'd by a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
he tore him out of his Arms, and threw him into the midſt
of the Flames, where he was with the reſt, ſoon burnt to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97577:39"/>
Aſhes, which <hi>Spaniard</hi> the ſame day he committed that Fact,
returning to his Quarters, dyed ſuddenly by the way, and I
adviſed them not to give him Chriſtian Burial.</p>
                  <p>Farthermore I ſaw them ſend to ſeveral <hi>Cacics</hi> and Principal
<hi>Indians,</hi> promiſing them a protecting Paſſeport to travel
peaceably and ſecurely to them, who, no ſooner came, but
they were burnt; Two of them before my Face, one at <hi>Andonia,</hi>
and the other at <hi>Tnmbala,</hi> nor could I with all my perſwaſions
and preaching to them prevail ſo far as to ſave them from the
Fire. And this I do maintain according to God and my own
Conſcience, as far as I could poſſibly learn, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Peruſia</hi> never promoted or raiſed any Commotion or
Rebellion, though as it is manifeſt to all Men, they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with Evil Dealings and Cruel Torments: And they, not
without Cauſe, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> breaking their Faith and Word,
betraying the Truth, and Tyrannically contrary to all Law and
Juſtice, deſtroying them and the whole Country, inflicting on
them great Injuries and Loſſes, were more ready to prepare
themſelves for Death, than ſtill to fall at once into ſuch great
and irrecoverable Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>Nay I do declare, according to Information from the <hi>Indians</hi>
themſelves, that there are to this day far greater Quantities
of Gold kept hid and concealed than ever were yet detected
or brought to light, which by means of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Injuſtice
and Cruelty, they would not then, nor ever will diſcover ſo
long as they are ſo barbarouſly treated, but will rather choſe
to dye with the Herd. Whereat the Lord God is highly offended
and the King hath very ill Offices done him, for he is hereby
defrauded of this Region, which was ſufficiently able to furniſh
all <hi>Caſtile</hi> with Neceſſaries, the Recovery whereof can never
be expected without great difficulty and vaſt expenſes.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus far I have acquainted you with the very words of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<hi>Franciſcan,</hi> ratified by the Biſhop of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who teſtifieth
that the ſrid Ftier <hi>Marc</hi> did affirm and maintain what is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>Here is to be obſerv'd what this ſaid Frier was an Eye-Witneſs
of; for he travelled up in this Countrey Fifty or a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Miles, for the ſpace of Nine or Ten Years, when as yet,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97577:39"/>
few <hi>Spaniards</hi> had got footing there, but afterward, at the noiſe
of Gold to be had there in great plenty, Four or Five Thouſand
came thither, who ſpread themſelves through thoſe Kingdoms and
Provinces the ſpace of Five or Six Hundred Miles, which they
made wholly deſolate, committing the ſame, or greater Cruelties
than are before recited; for in reality they deſtroyed from that
time to theſe very days, above an Hundred Thouſand poor Souls
more than he gives an Account of, and with leſs fear of God and
the King, nay, with leſs Mercy have they deſtroyed the greateſt
part of Mankind in theſe Kingdoms, above Four Millions ſuffering
by violent Death.</p>
               <p>A few days after they darted to Death with Arrows made of
Reeds a Puiſſant Queen, the Wife of a Potentate, who ſtill ſways the
Imperial Scepter of that Kingdom, whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to take, which inſtigated him to raiſe a Rebellion, and he ſtill
continues a Rebel. They ſeized the Queen his Conſort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Law and Equity murdered her, as is ſaid before, who
was then, as reported, big with Child, only for this Reaſon, that
they might and freſh Affliction and Grief to her Husband.</p>

               <p>MANY Tyrants there were, who ſet Sail from <hi>Venecuela,</hi>
St. <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> haſtening to the Conqueſt
of <hi>Peruſia, Anno Dom.</hi> 1539. and they accompanied with many
more going farther from this Region, endeavoured to penetrate
into the Heart of this Countrey, where they found about Three
Hundred Miles from <hi>Carthagena</hi> and St. <hi>Martha,</hi> many admirable
Provinces and moſt fruitful Land, furniſhed with an even-tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or meek-ſpirited People, as they are in other parts of <hi>India;</hi>
very rich in Gold and thoſe ſorts of precious Stones known by the
name of Emralds: To which Province they gave the Name of

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97577:40"/>
in theſe Regions, was born in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to theſe parts; now they that ſpoiled theſe Provinces with
their rapine being wicked, cruel, infamous Butchers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in the eſſuſion of Humane Hood, having practically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
the piacular and grand Enormities perpetrated among
the <hi>Indians;</hi> and upon this account their Diabolical Actions are ſo
great, ſo many in number, and repreſented ſo grievouſly horrid
by circumſtantial aggravations, that they exceed all the villanies
committed by others, nay by themſelves in other Regions, I will
only ſelect and cull out a few out of ſo great a number, which have
been tranſacted by them within theſe three years, for my preſent
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>A certain Governour, becauſe he that went to commit depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
and ſpoils in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> would not admit
him, as a Companion in his Robberies and Cruelties, ſet up an
Inquiſition, and produced proofs confirmed by great evidence,
whereby he palpably lays open, and proves the Slaughters and
Homicides he committed, and perſiſts in to this very day, which
were read in the <hi>Indian</hi> Courts of Judicature, and are there now
Recorded.</p>
               <p>In this Inquiſition the Witneſſes depoſe, that when all theſe
Kingdoms enjoy'd Peace and Tranquillity, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſerv'd the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and got their living by conſtant day-labour in Tilling
and Manuring the Ground, bringing them much Gold, and many
Gems, particularly Emeralds, and what other Commodities they
could, and poſſeſſed, their Cities and Dominions being divided
among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to procure which is the chiefeſt of their
care and pains; and theſe are the proper meaſures they take to
obtain their propoſed ends, to wit, heaping and treaſuring up of
Gold and Riches.</p>
               <p>Now when all the <hi>Indians</hi> were under their accuſtomed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
A certain Tyrant, and Chief Commander, took the King
and Lord of the whole Country, and detain'd him Captive for ſix
or ſeven moneths, demanding of him, without any reaſon, ſtore
of Gold and Emeralds. The ſaid King, whoſe name was <hi>Bogota,</hi>
through fear, promiſed him a Houſe of Gold, hoping, in time,
to eſcape out of his clutches, who thus plagu'd him, and ſent
ſome <hi>Indians</hi> for Gold, who frequently, and at ſeveral times,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97577:40"/>
brought him a great quantity of Gold, and many Jewels; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King did not, according to promiſe, beſtow upon him
an Appartment made of pure Gold, he muſt therefore forfeit his
Life. The Tyrant commanded him to be brought to Tryal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
himſelf, and ſo they cite and ſummon to a Tryal the greateſt
King in the whole Region; and the Tyrant pronounced this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that unleſs he did perform his Golden Promiſe he ſhould
be expoſed to ſevere Torments. They rackt him, poured boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soap into his Bowels, chain'd his Legs to one poſt, and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Neck to another, two men holding his Hands, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the ſcorching heat of the Fire to his Feet; the Tyrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
often caſting his Eye upon him, and threatning him with death,
if he did not give him the promiſed Gold; and thus with theſe
kind of horrid torments, the ſaid Lord was deſtroy'd; which
while they were doing, God being willing to manifeſt how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
theſe Cruelties are to His Divine Majeſty, the whole City,
that was the Stage on which they were acted, was conſumed by
Fire; and the reſt of the Captains following his example, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
all the Lords of that Region by Fire and Faggot.</p>
               <p>Once it fell out, that many <hi>Indians</hi> addreſſed themſelves to the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> with all Humility and Simplicity, as they uſe to do,
who thinking themſelves ſafe and ſecure, behold the Captain comes
into the City, where they were to do their work, and commands
all theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> ſleeping and taking their reſt, after Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wearied with the heavy drudgery of the day, to be ſlain by
the Sword: And this ſtratagem he put in practice, to make a
greater impreſſion of fear on all the minds of the Inhabitants; and
another time a certain Captain commanded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
upon Oath, how many <hi>Cacics</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> every individual
perſon had in his Family at home, who were preſently lead to a
publick place, and loſt their Heads; ſo there periſht, that bout,
four or five hundred Men. The Witneſſes depoſe this of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Tyrant, that by beating, cutting off the Hands and Noſes
of many Women as well as Men, and deſtroying ſeveral perſons
in great numbers, he exerciſed horrid Cruelties.</p>
               <p>Then one of the Captains ſent this bloody Tyrant into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Bogota,</hi> to inquire who ſucceeded that Prince there,
whom he ſo barbarouſly and inhumanely Murder'd, who travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:97577:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97577:42"/>
many miles in this Country, took as many <hi>Indians</hi> as he could
get, ſome of which, becauſe they did not tell him who was Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
of this Deceaſed Prince, had their Hands cut off, and others
were expoſed to hunger-ſtarv'd Currs, to be devour'd by them,
and thus many of them periſhed miſerably.</p>
               <p>Another time about the fourth Watch, early in the morning he
fell upon ſeveral <hi>Cacics,</hi> Noblemen and other <hi>Indians,</hi> who lookt
upon themſelves to be ſafe enough, (for they had their faith and
ſecurity given, that none of them ſhould receive any damage or
injury) relying upon this, they left the Mountains their lurking
places, without any ſuſpition or fear, and returned to their Cities,
but he ſeized on them all, and commanding them to extend their
hands on the ground, cut them off with his own Sword, ſaying,
that he puniſhed them after this manner, becauſe they would not
inform him what Lord it was, that ſucceeded in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of one of theſe Provinces, perceiving that four
or five of their Governours were ſent to the other World in a
fiery Vehicle or Chariot, being terrified therewith, took to the
Mountains for Sanctuary, there being four or five thouſand in
number, as appears by good Evidence; and the aforeſaid Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſends a Tyrant, more cruel than any of the reſt after them.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſcend the Mountain by force (for the <hi>Indians</hi> were
naked and unarm'd) Proclaiming <hi>Peace,</hi> if they would deſiſt and
lay down their Arms, which the <hi>Indians</hi> no ſooner heard, but
quitted their Childiſh Weapons; and this was no ſooner done but
this Sanguinary <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſent ſome to poſſeſs themſelves of the
Fortifications, and they being ſecur'd, to attaque the <hi>Indians.</hi>
Thus they, like Wolves and Lyons, did ruſh upon this flock of
Sheep, and were ſo tired with ſlaughter, that they were forced to
deſiſt for a while and take breath, which done, the Captain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them to fall to it again at the ſame bloody rate, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
all that ſurvived the Butchery, from the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
which was of a prodigious height; and that was perform'd
accordingly. And the Witneſſes farther declare upon Oath, that
they ſaw the bodies of about ſeven hundred <hi>Indians</hi> falling from
the Mount at one time, like a Cloud obſcuring the Air, who were
all broken to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:97577:42"/>
This very Tyrant came once to the City <hi>Cota,</hi> where he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
abundance of Men, together with fifteen or twenty Cacics
of the higheſt rank and quality, whom he caſt to the Dogs to be
torn Limb-meal in pieces, and cut off the Hands of ſeveral Men
and Women, which being run through with a pole, were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be view'd and gaz'd upon by the <hi>Indians,</hi> where you might
ſee at once ſeventy pair of hands, transfixed with Poles; nor is
it to be forgotten, that he cut off the Noſes of many Women and
Children.</p>
               <p>The Witneſſes farther depoſe, that the Cruelties and great
Slaughters committed in the aforeſaid new Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi>
by this Captain, and other Tyrants, the Deſtroyers of Mankind,
who accompany him, and have power ſtill given them by him to
exerciſe the ſame, are ſuch and ſo hainous, that if his Majeſty
does not opportunely apply ſome remedy, for the redreſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of ſuch miſchieſs for the future, (ſince the <hi>Indians</hi> are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſlaughtered to accumulate and enrich themſelves with Gold,
which the Inhabitants have been ſo rob'd of, that they are now
grown bare, for what they had, they have diſpoſed to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
already) this Kingdom will ſoon decay and be made deſolate,
and conſequently the Land being deſtitute of <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſhould
manure it, will lye fallow and incultivated.</p>
               <p>And here is to be noted, how peſtilential and inhumane the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of theſe Tyrants hath been, and how violently exerciſed,
when as in two or three years ſpace, they were all ſlain, and the
Country wholly deſolate and deſerted, as thoſe that have been
Eye-witneſſes can teſtifie; they having acted like Mercileſs Men,
not having the fear of God and the King before their Eyes, but
by the inſtigation of the Devil; ſo that it may well be ſaid and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
not one Perſon will be left alive, unleſs his Majeſty does
retard, and put a ſtop to the full career of their Cruelties, which
I am very apt to believe, for I have ſeen with theſe very eyes of
mine, many Kingdom laid waſte and depopulated in a ſmall time.
There are other ſtately Provinces on the Confines of the New
Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> as <hi>Popayan</hi> and <hi>Cali,</hi> together with three
or four more above five hundred miles in length, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
in the ſame manner, as they have done other places, and
laid them abſolutely waſte by the prementioned Slaughters, who
were very Populous, and the Soil very Fruitful. They who came
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97577:43"/>
among us from thoſe Regions report, that nothing can be
more deplorable or worthy of pity and commiſeration, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſuch large and great Cities totally ruinated, and intombed in
their own Aſhes, and that in a City adorn'd with 1000 or
2000 Fabricks, there are hardly now to be ſeen 50 ſtanding, the
reſt being utterly demoliſhed, or conſum'd and levelled to the
ground by Fire and in ſome parts Regions of 100 miles length, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſpacious Cities) are found abſolutely deſtroyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
by Fire.</p>
               <p>Finally many great Tyrants who came out of the <hi>Peruſian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
by the <hi>Quuonians</hi> Travelled to the ſaid new Kingdom of
<hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Popayan,</hi> and by <hi>Carthagena</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rabae,</hi> they
directed their courſe to <hi>Caliſium,</hi> and ſeveral other Tyrants of
<hi>Carthagena</hi> aſſault <hi>Quito,</hi> who joyn'd themſelves in an intire
Body and wholly depopulated and laid waſte that Region for the
ſpace of 600 miles and upward, with the loſs of a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of poor Souls; nor as yet do they treat the ſmall remnant of ſo.
great and innocent a people with more humanity then formerly.</p>
               <p>I deſire therefore that the Readers who have or ſhall peruſe theſe
paſſages, would pleaſe ſeriouſly to conſider whether or no, ſuch
Barbarous, Cruel and Inhumane Acts as theſe do not tranſcend and
exceed all the impiety and tyranny, which can enter into the
thoughts or imagination of Man, and whether theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
not the name of Devils. For which of theſe two things is
more eligible or deſirable whether the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be delivered
up to the Devils themſelves to be tormented or the <hi>Spaniards?</hi>
That is ſtill a queſtion.</p>
               <p>Nor can I here omit one piece of Villany, (whether it ought to
be poſtpon'd or come behind the cruelty of Brute Animals, that I
leave to deciſion). The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who are converſant among the
<hi>Indians</hi> bred up curſt Curs, who are ſo well inſtructed and taught
that they at firſt ſight, fly upon the Inhabitants tearing them limb
by limb, and ſo preſently devour them. Now let all perſons whether
Chriſtians or not conſider, if ever ſuch a thing as this reacht the ears
of any Man, they carry theſe Dogs with them as Companions
where ever they go, and kill the fettered <hi>Indians</hi> in multitudes like
Hogs for their Food; thus ſharing with them in the Butchery. Nay
they frequently call one to the other, ſaying, lend me the fourth
part of one of your Slaves to feed my Dogs, and when I kill one, I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97577:43"/>
will repay you, as if they had only borrowed a quarter of a Hog
or Sheep. Others, when they go a Hunting early in the morning,
upon their return, if you ask them what ſport had you to day at
the Game? They will anſwer, enough, enough, for my Dogs
have killed and worried 15 or 20 <hi>Indian</hi> Vaſſals. Now all theſe
things are plainly prov'd upon thoſe Inquiſitions and Examinations
made by one Tyrant againſt another. What I beſeech you, can
be more horrid or barbarous?</p>
               <p>But I will deſiſt from Writing any longer at this time, till ſome
Meſſenger brings an account of greater and blacker Impieties (if
greater can be committed) or elſe till we come to behold them
again, as we have done for the ſpace of forty two years with our
own Eyes. I will only make this ſmall addition to what I have ſaid
that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> from the beginning of their firſt entrance upon
<hi>America</hi> to this preſent day, were no more ſollicitous of promoting
the Preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt to theſe Nations, then if they
had been Dogs or Beaſts, but which is worſt of all, they expreſly
prohibited their addreſſes to the Religious, laying many heavy
Impoſitions upon them, dayly afflicting and perſecuting them,
that they might not have ſo much time and leaſure at their own
diſpoſal, as to attend their Preaching and Divine Service; for they
lookt upon that to be an impediment to their getting Gold, and
raking up riches which their Avarice ſtimulated them ſo bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
to proſecute. Nor do they underſtand any more of a God,
whether he be made of Wood, Braſs or Clay, then they did above
an hundred years ago, New <hi>Spain</hi> only exempted, which is a ſmall
part of <hi>America,</hi> and was viſited and inſtructed by the Religious.
Thus they did formerly and ſtill do periſh without true Faith, or
the knowledge and benefit of our Religious Sacraments.</p>
               <p>I Frier <hi>Bartholomeas de las Caſas</hi> or <hi>Caſaus</hi> of the Order of St.
<hi>Dominick,</hi> who through they mercy of God am Arriv'd at the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Court, Cordially wiſhing the expulſion of Hell or theſe Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Acts out of the <hi>Indies;</hi> fearing leaſt thoſe Souls redeemed by
the pretious Blood of Chriſt, ſhould periſh eternally, but heartily
deſiring that they may acknowledge their Creator and be ſaved; as

and their Neighbours: I have at length upon the requeſt of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97577:44"/>
ſome Perſons of great Quality in this Court, who are ſervently
zealous of the Houour of God, and moved with pitty at the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Afflictions of their Neighbours (though I long ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it within my ſelf, and reſolved to accompliſh it, but could
not, being diſtracted with the avocations of multiplicity of conſtant
Buſineſs and Employment, have leiſure to effect it) I ſay I have at
length finiſhed this Treatiſe and Summary at <hi>Valencia, Deceinb.</hi> 8.
<hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1542, when they were arrived at the Height, and
utmoſt Degree of executing Violences, Oppreſſions, Tyranny,
Deſolations, Torments, and Calamities in all the aforeſaid Regions,
Inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (though they are more Cruel in ſome
places than other) yet <hi>Mexico</hi> with its Confines were more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
treated than the reſt of the Provinces.</p>
               <p>And indeed no Man durſt openly and publickly do any injury
to the Inhabitants; for there ſome Juſtice, (which is no where
elſe in <hi>India)</hi> though very little is done and practiſed; yet they are
grievouſly oppreſt with intolerable Taxes. But I do really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and am fully perſwaded that our Sovereign Lord <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth, Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> our Lord and Prince, who
begins to be ſenſible of the Wickedneſs and Treacheries, which
have been, and ſtill are committed againſt this Miſerable Nation,
and diſtreſſed Countries contrary to the Will and Pleaſure of God,
as well as His Majeſties that he will in time, (for hitherto the
Truth hath been concealed and kept from his Knowledge, with as
great Craft, as Fraud and Malice) totally extirpate and root up all
theſe Evils and Miſchiefs, and apply ſuch proper Medicines an may
purge the Morbifick and peccant Humours in the Body Politick of
this New World, committed to his Care and Government as a
Lover and Promoter of Peace and Tranquillity. God preſerve and
bleſs him with Renown and a happy Life in his Imperial State, and
proſper him in all his Attempts, that he may remedy the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Chriſtian Church, and Crown him at laſt with Eternal
Felicity, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After I had publiſhed this Treatiſe, certain Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
enacted by his Majeſty then at <hi>Baraclona</hi> in the Month of
<hi>December, An. Dom.</hi> 1542, promulgated and publiſhed the Year
enſuing in the City of <hi>Madera,</hi> whereby it is provided, (as the
preſent Neceſſities requir'd) that a period be put to ſuch great
Enomrities and Sins, as were committed againſt God and our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97577:44"/>
Neighbours, and tended to the utter Ruine and Perdition of this
New World. Theſe Laws were publiſhed by his Majeſties Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſeveral Perſons of higheſt Authority, Councellors, Learned,
and Conſcientious Men, being aſſembled together for that purpoſe,
and many Debates made at <hi>Valedolid</hi> about this weighty Affair, at
lenght by the unanimous Conſent and Advice of all thoſe who had
committed their Opinions to Writing, they were made publick
who traced more cloſely therein the Laws of Chriſt and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and were judged Perſons pure, free from and innocent of that
ſtain and blemiſh of depriving the <hi>Indians</hi> of their Treaſures by
Theft and Rapine, which Riches had contaminated and fullied the
Hands, but much more the Souls of thoſe who were enſlav'd by
thoſe heaps of Wealth and Covetouſneſs, now this obſtinate and
hot purſuit after Wealth was the Original of all thoſe Evils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without the leaſt Remorſe or Check of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Theſe Laws being thus promulgated, the <hi>Courtiers</hi> who promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
theſe Tyrants, took care that ſeveral Copies ſhould be tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
(though they were extremely afflicted to ſee, that there was no
farther hopes or means to promote the former Depredations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions
by the Tyranny aforeſaid) and ſent them to ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi>
Provinces. They, who took upon them the Trouble and Care of
Extirpating, and Oppreſſing by different ways of Cruelty, as they
never obſerved by Method or. Order, but behav'd themſelves moſt
inordinately and irregularly, having peruſed theſe Diplomata or
Conſtitutions, before the new made Judges, appointed to put them
in Execution, could Arrive or be Landed, they by the aſſiſtance of
thoſe (as 'tis credibly rumour'd, nor is it repugnant to truth) who
hitherto favour'd their Criminal and Violent Actions, knowing
well that theſe Laws and Proclamations muſt neceſſarily take effect,
began to grow mutinous, and rebel, and when the Judges were
Landed, who were to Execute theſe <hi>Mandates,</hi> laying aſide all
manner of Love and Fear of God, were ſo audacious as to contemn
and ſet at nought all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>verence and Obedience due to their
King, and ſo became Traytors, demeaning themſelves like Blood-Thirſty
Tyrants, coſtitute and void of all Humanity.</p>
               <p>More particularly this appear'd in the <hi>Peruſian</hi> Kingdoms,
where <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1542, they acted ſuch Horrid and Stuendous
Enormities, that the like were never known or heard in <hi>America,</hi>
or throughout the whole World before that time. Nor were they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97577:45"/>
only practiſed upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were moſtly deſtroy'd, but
upon themſelves alſo, God permitting them by his juſt Judgment
to be their own Executioners, and ſheath their Swords in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Bowels. In like manner the other parts of this New World
being moved by the Example of theſe Rebels, refuſed to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to thoſe Laws. The reſt pretending to petition his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
turn Rebellious themſelves; for they would not voluntarily
reſign thoſe Eſtates, Goods and Chattels they have already uſurped,
nor willingly manumit thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> who were doomed to be
their Slaves, during Life; and where they reſtrain'd the Murdering
Sword from doing Execution, they oppreſt them gradually with
perſonal Vaſſalage, injuſt and intolerable Burthens; which his
Majeſty could not poſſibly hitherto avert or hinder, becauſe they are
all univerſally, as well thoſe of high, as low degrees; ſome more,
ſome leſs, ſome publickly and openly, others clancularly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
ſo naturally addicted to Rob, Thieve and Steal; and thus
under pretext of ſerving the King, they diſhonour God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
his Imperial Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Here the Author having finiſhed the matter of Fact in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Hiſtory, for Confirmation of what he has here written,
quotes a tedious and imperfect Epiſtle (as he ſtyles it) beginning
and ending abruptly and anonymous withal, contanining the Cruelties
committed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the ſame in effect as our Author has
prementioned, now in regard that I judge ſuch reiterated Cruelties
and repeated Barbariſms are Offenſive to the Reader, he having
ſailed already too long, and too far in an Ocean of Innocent <hi>Indian</hi>
Blood: I have omitted all but Two or Three Stories not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of by the Author. One of the Tyrants, (who followed the
ſteps of <hi>John Ampudia,</hi> a notorious Villain) gave way to a great
Slaughter of Sheep the chief Food and Support of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
as well as <hi>Indians,</hi> permitting them to kill Two or Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at a time, only for their Brains, Fat, or Suet, whoſe Fleſh
was then altogether uſeleſs, and not fit to be eaten; but many
<hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Friends and Confederates followed them,
deſiring they might have the hearts to feed upon, whereupon they
butchered a great many of them, for this only Reaſon, becauſe
they would not eat the other parts of the Body. Two of their
gang in the Province of <hi>Peru</hi> kild Twenty Five Sheep, who were
ſold among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for Twenty Five Crowns, merely to get
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97577:45"/>
the Fat and Brains out of them: Thus by the frequent and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Slaughter of their Sheep above a Hundred Thouſand Head of
Cattel were deſtroy'd. And upon this Account the Region was
reduced to great penury and want, and at length periſhed with
Hunger. Nay the Province of <hi>Quito,</hi> which abounded with
Corn beyond Expreſſion, by ſuch proceedings as theſe, was brought
to that Extremity that a Sextarie or ſmall Meaſure of Wheat was
ſold for Ten Crowns, and a Sheep at as dear a rate.</p>
               <p>This Captain taking leave of <hi>Quito</hi> was followed by a poor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianeſs</hi>
with loud Cries and Clamours, begging and beſeeching him
not to carry away her Husband; for ſhe had the charge of Three
Children, and could not poſſibly ſupply them with Victuals, but
they muſt inevitably dye with hunger, and though the <hi>Captain</hi>
repulſed her with an angry brow at the firſt; yet ſhe approacht him
a ſecond time with repeated Cries, ſaying, that her Children muſt
periſh for want of Food; but finding the Captain inexorable and
altogether unmov'd with her Complaints, and her Husband not
reſtor'd, through a piquant neceſſity wedded to deſpair; ſhe cut
off the Heads of her Children with ſharp Stones, and ſo diſpatcht
them into the other World.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeded farther to another City, and ſent ſome
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that very Night, to take the <hi>Indians</hi> of the City of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilicui,</hi>
who next day brought with them above a Hundred Perſons;
ſome of which (whom he lookt upon to be able to carry burthens)
he reſerved for his own and his Soldiers ſervice, and others were
chain'd, and periſhed in their Fetters: But the little Infants he gave
to the <hi>Cacic</hi> of <hi>Tulilicui,</hi> aboveſaid to be eaten up and devoured,
whoſe skins are ſtuft with Aſhes &amp; hang up in his Houſe to be ſeen
at this very day. And in the cloſe of this Letter he ſhuts up all
with theſe words, 'tis here very remarkable and never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
that this Tyrant (being not ignorant of the Miſchiefs and
Enormities executed by him) boaſtingly ſaid of himſelf, <hi>They who
ſhall travel in theſe Countreys Fifty years hence, and hear the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
of me, will have cauſe to ſay &amp; declare, that never ſuch a Tyrant
as I am marched through theſe Regions, and committed the like Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now not to quit the Stage without one Comical Scene or Action
whereon ſuch Cruelties have been lively perſonated, give me leave
to acquaint you with a Comical piece of Grammatical Learning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97577:46"/>
in a Reverend Religioſo of theſe parts, ſent thither to convert the
<hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Pagans, which the Author mentions among his Reaſons
and Replications, and all thoſe I paſs by as immaterial to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
many of them being repeated in the Narrative before.</p>
               <p>The weight and burthen of initiating the <hi>Indians</hi> into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith lay ſolely on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at firſt; and therefore <hi>Joannes
Colmenero</hi> in <hi>Sancta Martha,</hi> a Fantaſtic, Ignorant, and Foppiſh
Fellow, was under Examination before us (and he had one of the
moſt ſpatious Cities committed to his Charge as well as the Care
and Cure of the Souls of the Inhabitants) whether he underſtood
how to fortifie himſelf with the ſign of the Croſs againſt the Wicked
and Impious, and being interrogated what he taught, and how he
inſtructed the <hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe Souls were inſtruſted to his Care and
Conduct; he return'd this Anſwer, <hi>That if he damn'd them to the
Devils and Furies of Holl, it was ſufficient to retrieve them, if he
pronounced theſe Words,</hi> Per Signin Sanctin Cruces. A Fellow fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be a Hogherd than a Shepherd of Souls.</p>
               <p>This Deep, Bloody <hi>American</hi> Tragedy is now concluded, and
my Pen choakt up with <hi>Indian</hi> Blood and Gore: I have no more
to ſay, but pronounce the Epilogue made by the Author, and leave
the Reader to judge whether it deſerves a Plaudite.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt ſet Sail to <hi>America,</hi> not for the Honour of
God, or as Perſons moved and incited thereunto by fervent Zeal
to the True Faith, nor to promote the Salvation of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
nor to ſerve the King, as they falſely boaſt and pretend to
do, but in truth, only ſtimulated and goaded on by inſatiable Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
and Ambition, that they might for ever Domineer, Command,
and Tyrannize over the <hi>Weſt-Indians,</hi> whoſe Kingdoms they hoped
to divide and diſtribute among themſelves. Which to deal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
is no more nor leſs intentionally, than by all theſe indirect
wayes to diſappoint and expel the Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> out of thoſe
Dominions and Territories, that they themſelves having Uſurped
the Supreme and Regal Empire, might firſt challenge it as their
Right, and men poſſeſs and enjoy it.</p>
