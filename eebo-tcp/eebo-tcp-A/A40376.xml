            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <label>I.</label>There ſhall henceforth be between the King and His Succeſſors Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> and his Kingdoms on one part, and the Lords the States General of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces of the low Countries, and their States and

            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <label>II.</label>
Moreover, there ſhall be between His Majeſty and his Succeſſors Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and his Kingdoms, and the ſaid Lords States General and their States and Lands apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, a ſtraight Alliance and faithfull Confederation, to maintain and preſerve mutually one another in the tranquillity, peace, Amity and Neutrality by Sea and Land, and in the poſſeſſion of all the Rights, Franchiſes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, which they enjoy or have right to enjoy, whether they are acquired to them, or may be acquired by them, by the Treaties of Peace, Amity and Neutrality, that have been formerly made, and that may be hereafter made joyntly and by a common Concert of the other Kings, Republicks, Princes and Towns, yet all within the extent of <hi>Europe</hi> only.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <label>III.</label>
And ſo they promiſe and oblige themſelves to warrant to one another not only all the Treaties, which His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and the ſaid Lords the States General have already made with other Kings, Republicks, Princes and States, which are to be exhibited from both ſides before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Ratifications; but alſo all thoſe, they may hereafter make joyntly and with common endeavours; and to defend, aſſiſt and keep one another reciprocally in the poſſeſſion of the Lands and places, that belong at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that hereafter ſhall belong as well to His Majeſty and his Succeſſors Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as to the ſaid Lords the States General, by the ſaid Treaties, or within which the ſaid States General have their Garriſons, in what part of <hi>Europe</hi> ſoever the ſaid Lands, Towns and places be ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

            <p n="4">
               <label>IV.</label>
The reciprocal Obligation of mutual aſſiſtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is alſo underſtood for the preſerving and maintaining His ſaid Majeſty, and the Lords States General, their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Subjects, in all their Rights, Poſſeſſions, Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Liberties, as well of Navigation, as of Trade and Fiſhing, and others whatſoever, by ſea and by Land, which ſhall be found to appertain unto them by common Right, or to be acquired by Treaties made or to be made in the manner abovementioned, towards and againſt all Kings, Princes, Republicks or other Soveraign States, in this ſort, that if to the prejudice of the ſaid tranquility, peace, amity and neutrality, preſent or future, His Majeſty or the ſaid Lords the States General, come to be hereafter attackt, or in any other way whatſoever troubled in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of the States, Lands, Towns, Places, Rights, Immunities and Liberties of Trade, Navigation, Fiſhing, or others whatſoever, which His Majeſty or the ſaid Lords the States General do at the preſent enjoy or ſhall have Right to enjoy, either by Common Right, or by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties already made or that may be made, as above, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the ſaid Lords the States General, being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of it and required one of the other, ſhall joyntly do what poſſibly they can, to make the trouble and hoſtility ceaſe, and to repair the wrongs or injuries, that may have been done to either of the Allies.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <label>V.</label>
And in caſe the ſaid attacking or trouble be followed by an open rupture, He of the two Allies, that ſhall not be attackt, ſhall be obliged to break, four moneths after the firſt requiring made by him, who ſhall be in a rupture already:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45120:4"/>
during which time He ſhall uſe all endeavours by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors or other Miniſters to mediate an equitable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between the Aſſaylant or Diſturber, and the Aſſailed or troubled; and yet notwithſtanding ſhall give, during the ſaid time, a puiſſant ſuccour to his Ally, ſuch as ſhall be agreed upon by ſeparate Articles between His Majeſty and the ſaid Lords the States General, which, though no mention be made of them in the preſent Treaty, ſhall be kept and obſerved, as if they were there inſerted or written; it remaining notwithſtanding, after the ſaid time of four moneths expired, at the choice of him of the Allies, that ſhall be in rupture, to continue to enjoy of the fruit of the ſame ſuccours, in caſe the conjuncture of the time and the conſtitntion of his affairs might make him to prefer the effect thereof before the open rupture of his Ally.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <label>VI.</label>
The reciprocal Warranties being in this manner eſtabliſhed and promiſed, when one of the Allies ſhall be attackt or troubled, if the State of the united Provinces ſhould come ſo to be, and ſhould find themſelves obliged to enter into open War, His Majeſty ſhall likewiſe be obliged to break with the Aggreſſour or Troubler, and to employ all his power and all his forces, when it ſhall be judged fit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Common Enemy to an honeſt ſafe and equitable Accommodation with <hi>France</hi> and the ſaid united Provinces.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <label>VII.</label>
And in this caſe, the Forces of His Moſt-Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and of the ſaid Lords the States General, ſhall act joyntly or ſeparately according to what ſhall be then more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly agreed upon between His ſaid Majeſty, and the ſaid Lords the States General, who are to adviſe and reſolve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about the moſt proper means to diſcommode the common Enemy, by way of diverſion or otherwiſe, to the

            <p n="8">
               <label>VIII.</label>
The like to what is contained in the two immediately preceding Articles, ſhall be done by the ſaid Lords the States, in caſe <hi>France</hi> be attackt or troubled in the manner above mentioned.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <label>IX.</label>
When once open War ſhall be found with the two Allyes, according to the preſent Treaty, there may not afterwards, by either of the two Allyes, be made any ſuſpenſion of arms with Him, that ſhall have been declared and owned a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, but joyntly and with common conſent.</p>
            <p n="10">

But if it fall out, that a negotiation be entred upon, for the treating of peace or truce of ſome years, the ſame ſhall not be begun by one of the Allyes without the participation of the other, and without procuring for him and at the ſame time, when for himſelf, the power and ſecurity required and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſend his Miniſters to the place of the ſaid Treaty; and without giving ſucceſſively from time to time a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that ſhall paſs in the ſaid negotiation, and neither one nor the other ſhall paſs to the concluſion of the ſaid peace or truce, without comprehending his Ally and making him to be reſtored, if he ſo deſire it, into the poſſeſſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Lands and Places, and enjoyments of the Rights and Immunities, which he held and enjoyed before the War; and without ſtipulating from the common Enemy for the Ally the ſame immunities, exemptions and other prerogatives, as for himſelf, unleſſe the Allyes agree about it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

It ſhall be permitted to Him of the Allyes, that ſhall be attackt, to Leavy all ſorts of Soldiers and Marriners, within the State of the other Alley, yet ſo that it be done in due form, and that it may be done without a conſiderable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of him, in whoſe State the ſaid Leavies ſhall be made.</p>
