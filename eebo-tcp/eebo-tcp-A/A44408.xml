            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may appeare a ſtrange and preſumptuous inſolence in a private perſon of almoſt no name nor knowledge, to engage himſelfe as it were the champion of the publicke Fame, wounded and delacerated by this Declaration (if his it be) of Prince <hi>Ruperts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But ſince no man of more eminence has undertaken the quarrell, though my modeſty deterr'd me, as that of the Prince of Poets <hi>Virgil,</hi> when he was to write his AEneiads:</p>

            <p>Yet my reaſon aſſur'd me it was a dire and dreadfull inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that ſuch a malicious aſperſion ſhould be intruded on the beſt ornament of the High Court of Parliament, (it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence) and ſo reſolv'd, as the Poet ſpeaks of one;</p>

            <p>Briefly then to his preamble, I ſhall only note in it the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent acrimony and unjuſt malice of his ſpirit, that dares ſo manifeſtly and falſly charge the time with odious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible

untruths againſt His ſacred Majeſty, when ſurely no time has ever been more carefull to preſerve His Majeſties honor, no perſons more diligent in ſearching out the Authors of ſcandalous Pamphlets againſt His Majeſty, nor puniſhing them when found, then the High Court of Parliament. Witneſſe their exemplary juſtice on <hi>Walker</hi> the Ironmonger, and their ſerious endeavours to have found out the writer as well as the Printer of that calumnious Pamphlet, intituled <hi>King</hi> James <hi>His Iudgement;</hi> becauſe there were ſome clauſes in it that might be interpreted reflective on the honour of His Majeſty, which Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſurely more afflicts in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to fixe thoſe ſuppos'd aſperſions on His credit, then ever His people here have done, who have been alwayes ready to defend it: Nor could he have ever had occaſion, to ſay <hi>the King is only guilty of being too good to be our King.</hi> Surely His Subjects duty had according to it's quality anſwered His Royall goodneſſe, had not ſuch perverſe, though more crafty Malignants then Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> is, by their ſiniſter Councels infaſcinated as it were the Royall and gracious diſpoſition of His Maieſty, and alienated him from hearkning to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of that ſupreme Councell, which hath alwayes beene the glory and ſafety of his royall Progenitors, the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the high Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Next, for his particular challenging the right Honourable the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> of deluding the City with an untruth, concerning the battell at Edge-hill, and caſting aſperſions of inhumanity and deſire of plunder on the Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and his Troopers; for the laſt, <hi>Ex factis tuis iudicabo te, O prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps:</hi> Could there be a greater or more Iuculent expreſſion of deſire to plunder, then was at that battell demonſtrated in the ſaid Prince and his Troopers; when forgetfull of their owne and their companions ſafety, in the heat and fury of the fight they fell to pillaging the Waggons, where ſurely ſome boyes and women, left there, not to guard the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, but to be ſecured by their guards, were barbarouſly murdered. For the other clauſe of the victory, it was not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62535:3"/>
onely teſtified by my Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> but juſtified by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and the whole Army: Nay Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> himſelfe convinceth himſelfe of untruth in that buſineſſe, when hee ſaith ironically, (<hi>For that they ſlew as many of ours as we did of theirs, is as true as that they beat us at Sherburn Caſtle, &amp;c.</hi>) That we beat them at Sherburne Caſtle is apparent, why elſe did the Marqueſſe quit it, but that he was vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? It muſt needs be granted then by his owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that wee were victorious over them at Keinton alſo. And ſurely though the Prince in threatning language ſeems to upbraid my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> of faint-heartedneſſe, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman (bating the reverence he beares the Princes blood, as he is the Kings Nephew) dares let him underſtand, even in the way of perſonall encounter, that a reall Engliſh Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron as much deteſts to utter untruths, as any titular German Prince whatſoever.</p>
            <p>For his extenuating the guilt of himſelfe and Souldiers, concerning inhumanity to women and children, though we may in a charitable modeſty beleeve more hath been impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prince himſelfe then he hath committed, yet we can no way acquit his Souldiers, whoſe rapacity and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme no Tartars have ever equalled: and if when any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is won, or victory in a battell, the glory of it is onely devolved on the Generall, as it is; the Souldiers valour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no theame for Fame to diſcourſe on: it is in my opinion a kind of juſtice, that the ſouldiers infamy as well as honour ſhould be caſt on the Generall. So that our Pamphlets may be excuſed, for ſaying Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> perpetrated ſuch and ſuch villanies, they by that intended his Souldiers did them. Which queſtionleſſe was no falſhood, as their divers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in Leiceſter-ſhire may ſufficiently teſtifie. And I much admire the Prince ſhould ſo much forget the Nobility of his extract, as to ſtrive to acquit his men of plundring; an untruth ſo manifeſt, that impudence it ſelfe would bluſh to patronize it; witneſſe their demeanour at <hi>Alisbury, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington, Ockingham:</hi> nay, <hi>Oxford</hi> it ſelfe, which with all

            <p>But were there no groſſer errours (I am loth even impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to give the Prince the Lye in the moſt modeſt phraſe) included in that Declaration, theſe were pardonable: <hi>Homineſque Deoſque invadet,</hi> (like the Gyants that waged warre with Heaven) nothing eſcapes its malice; It taxes our party for impriſoning thoſe for Delinquents, who ſtand loyall to their Prince. Who ſhall be judge of their loyalty, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> or the Parliament? Surely that which is the originall of our Lawes, the fountaine of our municipall conſtitutions (the Parliament) is better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe Lawes and Conſtitutions then any ſtranger, though it were <hi>Lycurgus</hi> himſelfe; and therefore, can fullier cenſure and define when thoſe Lawes and Conſtitutions are violated.</p>
            <p>For the Earles, Judges, Lords, Biſhops, Knights, and the like, that he ſayes ſtuffe the priſons in <hi>London,</hi> are they not open Delinquents or principall Abettors of this Kingdomes miſerable diſtractions? Wilde Beaſts, that it were very fit ſhould be chain'd up, leſt they ſhould deſtroy us, and yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer they no more or ſtricter impriſonment here, then thoſe whom they have as priſoners doe there; witneſſe Captaine <hi>Wingates</hi> inthralment and others.</p>

            <p>For the looſeneſſe and incivility which the Prince would excuſe in himſelfe and ſouldiers, with the generality and community of ſuch vices in all great armies, it is the onely thing in his Declaration that may ſeeme to challenge the priviledge of being admitted for a truth; were it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately attainted by the ſucceeding falſhood, <hi>viz. His wiſh that there were no more Papiſts in the Parliaments Army then in theirs.</hi> I ſhall now have occoſion to overcome the Prince at his owne weapons, and dare him to name one Papiſt of quality or truſt, nay, one ſouldier of that ſect in all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Army. In theirs, Serjeant Major <hi>Aſhton</hi> is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, beſides my Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> who (not in the Army is a member of it) is a notorious Papiſt, ſo are divers of his Commanders.

For his gracious Majeſty, none ever durſt be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyally impious, to deny him to be the true and beſt defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Proteſtant Faith, and therefore Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> teſtimony of it to us, who already believe it, is unneceſſary and uſeleſſe: And for the trophees the Prince boaſts of his owne ſufferings for the Proteſtant Cauſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> what honours hee refuſed, and what cloſe impriſonment hee was threatned if hee would not change his Religion, in Gods

            <p>For the exerciſe of his valour againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebells, I believe every man may joyne with him in his wiſhes; but whereas he maliciouſly ſayes, he <hi>fights to defend the King, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Lawes of a Kingdome, againſt Subjects who are up in armes againſt their Lord and Soveraigne;</hi> paralelling the Cauſe of this Kingdome with that of <hi>Ireland;</hi> there hee ſhewed all thoſe former aſperſions to be but Molehils to this Mountaine of calumny.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are Papiſts, and have beene ever on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions rebellious, tooke up armes, as the ſequele hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, to re-inveſt their owne nation with the Sovcraignty of that Kingdome; we are Proteſtants, his Majeſties moſt faithfull Subjects, the Parliament here, not taking up armes for any other end, then to ſecure their owne lives, and the Subjects Liberties, the knowne Lawes of the Kingdome, nay, to preſerve the King himſelfe, and reſcue him from thoſe ſeditious and malignant Councellors, who have inthrall'd, as it were, both his body and mind. And ſo much in anſwer to Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Declaration, wherein, if I have not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vindicated the credit of the Cauſe from his calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I ſubmit to cenſure, and hope to meet an indulgent remiſſion for my error.</p>
