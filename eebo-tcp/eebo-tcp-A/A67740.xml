            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But before I come to examine your Paper in its several Paragraphs, I must shew you how unfarely you deal with this honest Gentleman; either you were one of the Society, or not; if you were, and the matter were true, you are a Traytor, a <hi>Iudas,</hi> acting against the Laws and Rules of human Society, <hi>Odi <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>o that he needs no further vindication; and his works shall praise him in the Gates, and so fully be-speak his worth, that every English man is now obliged in his quarrel, and upon that account I take my self concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without his knowledg, and must give this publick scandal the lye, as publickly; without which, I could neither satisfie my self, or answer the duty I owe to the Rules of friendship, nor be just to the honour of the Captains worth and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, being a frequenter of that Society, where I had the injoyment of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and ingenious Gentlemen, and no such trumpery could take place there.</p>
            <p>But for your reflections upon Rivers making navigable; who will controvert the great advantage they are in all places to Trade and Commerce, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good? Is this a crime for a man to demonstrate? saving your <hi>ridicule</hi> which belongs to your self, of making the Streets of <hi>London</hi> navigable, and for lodging of Ships upon an Hill, what will be your reward to impose impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? But what the Captain proposed for harbouring a considerable number of Ships in safety, is no <hi>Chymera,</hi> as your folly remarks; for it has been demonstrated to many persons of honour, and that with a fair and plausible reception; and for his Register, which your inventions kick about with so much slight, I must say, <hi>Ars nullum habet inimicum preter ignorantem,</hi> you speak evil of the things you know not, or your ill nature envies, and would blast what you cannot imitate; but for these things let <hi>Englands Improvement</hi> speak for it self, there the profits and advantages of a Register will appear, with the advancement of Trade, by Lombard-Houses and Common Stores, which are all made practicable in forreign parts, and now by the hazard of his life in long travels, the sweat of his brows and vast expence, is brought by him home, and made publick for general good; and is this the reward? But 'tis no marvel, <hi>Quid cum amaraco sui,</hi> what must Swine do with such Pearls? This Dialogue-maker, I perceive, is for no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he has been train'd up for <hi>French</hi> Government, to bring Popery into Church, and slavery upon the Nation, and to that purpose he introduces a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged discourse with the Captain's, to frustrate the happiness of a free people; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I see, poor Scribler! how his <hi>Hypocondrias</hi> are distended, and like to burst with envy, when he beheld the grandure and gravity of the Lord Mayors install<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the great Character of <hi>Englands</hi> freedom not to be paralell'd in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of any Prince in the World; this adds to the glory of the Crown, that our King commands the hearts and hands of free-born Subjects, flourishing under his gracious protection, with a stable government, that preserves the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and majesty of the King, and the happy liberties of his people. Here I might end, having said enough for the Captains vindication, if I said no more, but that he is by a forgery imposed upon: But meeting with some things in his Paper, I cannot but animadvert: first, where he Queries, <hi>What Game have the great ones now to play?</hi> He might have answered himself, they have enough to do. Your <hi>Romish</hi> Emissaries have cut out work with a witness, here's Plot upon Plot, and all to murther the King, to subvert Government in Church and State, and by the mighty Power of God all discovered; and because the Popish party had received so great a soil, the Protestant party must now be made Plotters, that under that colour you might murder the King, and give the blow in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade; but no weapon formed against God can prosper: and if his providence had not embowelled your cursed designs, as you say, the City ere this might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29740:2"/>
have been on fire at one end, and cutting of Throats all over.</p>
            <p>The next Question he begs, is an enforced reflection upon the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a fine device to create jealousies amongst Protestants: you have played that trick too often to have it thrive; we better understand the common interest, than to divide, <hi>divide &amp; impera,</hi> we know the danger of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision; and since the quarrel is plainly betwixt Protestant and Papist, and that all must endure the fiery tryal, they will neither turn, nor burn, but jointly oppose all your insinuations; I hope Mr. <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Plot has convinced the World so, that we shall not hear any more invectives against the dissenting party, for all are Protestants. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is the best of Governments, so I hope it will never want charity for any that agree in the same fundamentals; the same Gospel is owned by all, and by that rule, all are to be governed, which says, <hi>Let your moderation be seen before all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord is at hand:</hi> and if any man be otherwise minded, <hi>viz.</hi> as to Discipline, or other matters not so essential, God shall reveal it; let there be therefore no animosities, no differences amongst them, for they are Brethren.</p>
            <p>As for what you would suggest, as the saying of the Captains, in the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> men, you beg the question, that you may take the occasion to discover yourself of what foot-mark you are, and that the mark of the Beast is plainly in your forehead; <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> I see by this foot the dimensions of your mind, It is not your kindness or reverence you bear to the Church of <hi>England</hi> or honoured Clergy, but to sweeten our apprehensions, and mollifie our fears, and to assure us that Popery is not such a bug-bear, but that all the Lands taken away from those Idolatrous, Lascivious Drones, will keep firm as they are; and reinforceth his argument and perswasions, that as they were first sold by Act of Parliament, it was again corrobarated in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign; a necessary policy to keep all quiet till they had played up their Game to a sure point: But the great assurance this Gentleman gives it, is from infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it self, in these words, <hi>To which, consent of his Holiness was given;</hi> and this he counts security strong enough: Then, Sir, you are a simple Papist, and your Pope a Jugler; for the Canons of your Church denies a power to be in any Pope himself, to divest the Church of any of its possessions. Where are your whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles now, Sir? Carry your trifles to your Children nurst up in an implicit faith, we will trust in God, and use our lawful endeavours against Popes and Plotters, and enjoy our Lands too, no thanks to your Pope, whom you stile his Holiness, which never any Protestant so seriously did: A fair evidence of your principles!</p>
            <p>The next thing he disputes with himself, and would father it upon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is about the Subject of a Pamphlet, called, <hi>A Word without Doors:</hi> which I have heard the Captain aver he never saw it, nor I neither; therefore to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or disapprove, belongs not to my present occasion; but if any thing be in it, <hi>Contra Bonos mores,</hi> or savors of irreligion or disloyalty, I commit him with this Popish disputant to the Sword of the Magistrate. As for your Sophistries, and what absurdities are in them, take the shame to your self, for they are all of your own making. Interest, I perceive, can never Lye; Popery must come in, if your foul hand or crazy brain can help it. Are not you a brave fellow to come in Print; that can censure Parliaments, and charge them with injustice and folly too; you do not like them, we may all see; they are too hearty against Popery, and too zealous to maintain the Protestant Religion to posterity. Is this a crime? As for the Bill, that was, is not now in being; for that Parliament is Dissolved, and another since chosen, and Prorogued for a considerable time; therefore you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, <hi>de lana caprina,</hi> you set up an Image, and fall down before it; go on with your Idolatry, we will trust God for Religion, and next humbly submit all to the wisdom and care of our gracious King, and his great Council in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>To how little purpose do you revive the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> Case, in which you are a little too sawcy; 'twas done, <hi>perenni Parliamento,</hi> The supream Court of the Nation, and by them he was judged guilty of High-Treason, and you must not say he suffered without Law, though his crimes were not within one, or any of

the Articles of the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d;</hi> yet if you consult the same Statute, you will find the Parliament judg of Treasons not there named; The words of the Act are these:</p>
            <q>And because many other like cases of Treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time; it is accorded, that if any other case, supposed Treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any Iustices, the Iustices shall tarry without going to judgment of the Treason, till the Cause be shewed and declared before the King and his Parliament, whether it ought to be judged Treason or other Felony.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> the Articles are yet alive, and the recited clause shews the Parliament not so mistaken, for they are Judges of what is Treason: I never heard that Act was repented of by any Parliament, though the same Parliament provided that it should not be brought into pres<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent; not that they would be understood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judg themselves as unjust; but in reference to inferior Courts, and how far that clause reached him, or whether it did not imply that it was in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Parliament so to adjudg, I submit to better judgments than yours or mine, for I dare not presume to determine. <hi>Qua supra nos nihil ad nos.</hi> In your last Paragraph you would give a fresh assault upon the late Parliament, charging them with the greatest injustice, and that from the Act <hi>Tricessimo Quinto</hi> of the Queen, as if it were denied to the D. liberty of other Subjects, to declare and make his submission; and implies, that he was never convicted; if all were well in that case, what mean the bleating of the Sheep, and the lowing of the Oxen? why were such proposals offered by his Majesty for securing the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion against a Popish successor? and all those great labours in Parliament, and their Votes, declaring what you would now question? Pray let me ask you, When was there the least appearance of the D's. inclinations to declare his submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> If you make not that appear, What do you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for? not to satisfie the World that there was or is any such intention, but to asperse the great Council of the Kingdom? and certainly if the design had lain there, the concern of succession to Three Kingdoms would have brought it into Act after so many fair opportunities, and especially when the Parliament ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rived at so high a pitch, caused by the care for the Protestant Religion, and those dreadful apprehensions of those horrid Plots discovered against his Majesties Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred person. I assure you <hi>Sir,</hi> if ever such an offer had appeared; it would have been cherished with the greatest indulgence; but this is too much to argue upon a <hi>non Entity,</hi> for that Bill is gone, and you need not question but when the Parliament meets, and ever take that debate in hand, the D. will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing offered but what is just, with relation to establishing the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the preservation of his Most Sacred Majesty's person, and the Liberties of all true English men. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> upon examination of your ill-bestowed pains, I think you ought to ask God forgiveness in the first place, for breaking his commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy Neighbour;</hi> next, to answer to His Majesty for breach of his Law in Libelling; and upon your Knees to crave pardon of the D. for your pitiful management of his Cause; and for my part, I shall throw you in my forgiveness for the trouble you gave me; and as to the Captains concerns, he is to thank you for the opportunities you have given, to make his deserts more publick, and <hi>Englands Improvements</hi> more honoured.</p>
