            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that the itching fingers of gain laid hold vpon it, and had like to haue sent it into the world lame, and dismembred. Some that picke vp the crums of such feasts, had scrapt togither many percels of this Rushian commoditie, so that their heads being gotten vvith child of a Bastard, there was no remedy but they must be deliuered in <hi>Paules Church-yard.</hi> But I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the truth from the mouths of diuers gentlemen that vvent in the Iourney, and hauing som good notes bestovved vpon me in vvriting, vvrought them into this body, because neither thou shouldst be abused with false reports, nor the Voyage receiue slaunder. I have done this vvithout consent either of Sir Tho. himselfe, or of those gentlemen my friends that deliuered it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: So that if I offend, it is Error <hi>Amoris</hi> to my Countrey, not <hi>Amor erroris</hi> to do any man wronge.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11404:5"/>All things therefore being ripe for his departure, sir <hi>Tho.</hi> accompanied with sir <hi>Thomas Challenor,</hi> and S. <hi>William Wray</hi> knights, diuers Gent. and his own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, repaired to the Court vppon the tenth of Iune 1604. then lying at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where (by the right Hon. the Earle of <hi>Salsbury</hi>) he was brought to his Maiesties presence: who in very gracious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage demaunded of sir <hi>Thomas</hi> the length of the voyage, the time of his returne, the nature of the Climate, with some other questions touching the countrey: vnto all which sir <hi>Thomas</hi> aunswered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. But the king wondring that the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there would be so long, (for Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> said it would be full xv. moneths, by reason of the winters cruelty, whose Frosts were so extream, that the seas were not at those times Nauigable) pleasantly said, <hi>It seemes then that</hi> Sir Thomas <hi>goes from the Sun:</hi> vpon which the right Hon. the Earle of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> standing by replyed, <hi>He must needes go from the Sunne departing from his resplendant Ma.</hi> At which the king smiled, giuing sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his hand to kisse, and bestowing the like grace vpon all the Gentlem. that were for the voyage.</p>
            <p>The next day S. <hi>Thomas</hi> with some of his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, tooke his leaue of the Prince: and then being fully furnished with his <hi>Commission,</hi> and all other instructions from the Ea. of <hi>Salsbury</hi> at <hi>White-hall,</hi> the day following, being the 12. of Iune, about ten a clocke, the wind sitting fayr, all the ships fel down to <hi>Graues-end,</hi> whether S.

merchants, &amp;c. staying there til next morning. Then after conference with the Gent. Mer. and mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters of ships about his departure: sir <hi>Thomas</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all his followers about him, thus spake.</p>
            <q>GEntlemen, and the rest who haue resolued to acom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany and attend me in this Ambassage from his Excellent Maiesty to the Emperor of Rushia, &amp;c. I haue conferred with the Merchants, maisters of ships &amp; others, vpon the stay or speed of our voyage, finding the wind fauorable, all our company as I think heere, &amp; no importune busines to stay vs, haue resolued to go on boord this present night, and so deliuer our selues as alvvaies into the protection of the Almighty: so now to his mercie in the mercilesse Seas, where vvee shall (especiallie the vnexperienced, vvherof I presume to haue manie) meet with a number of crosses the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betvveen Land and Sea as of tvvo contrary ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So that being of a contrary nature, I must giue you my knowledge herein, and the rather considering you are of seuerall prefermentes vnto mee, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently vnknown to one another. I desire you like chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and fellovv Brethren to loue and delight each in other, and expresse your loues in helping and cherishing in time of distresse, sicknes, or distemperature: so as if God please to laie some sick &amp; others health: the strong to helpe the vveak, as fearing daily hee may fall into the like need. As often as it shall please God to send vs vveather that we may visite one another, I shall be glad to see you aboord my Shippe, vvhere happily you may be entertained vvith something your selues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb facs="tcp:11404:6"/>
and I vvill easily affoord. I shall take it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your loues, your dayly (if daily might be your visitations) as he that shall esteeme you the best ghesse that I can long expect. For the preseruation of your owne healths, beware of drinking: for your profit, of Gaming: for your ease, of quarrelling: and for Gods glory of swearing. All which, oft-times Sea-company makes men subiect vnto. Surely there is no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against these, as dayly, according to the Ship-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, to serue God: presuming I haue none in my com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany otherwise minded or brought vppe. Thus armed, let vs in his name, who in his secret wisdome hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained vs to this voyage, begin vvith honest and iust minds that our successe may be prosperous, and our end glorious: protesting, I shall be best serued when God is most honoured, desiring nothing of any, but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits my place, and his duty. Thus in the name of God let vs goe on Boord.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Ambas.</hi> led the way himselfe, going aborde the <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> Admyrall, after him al his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: hauing euerie man aboord, himselfe with some others went againe on shore, there taking lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rest, for the time was spent in very speciall busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses with the Merchants, whoe stayed still about two in the morne. Then after a warning peece shot, and some little stay for the long boate, which vvas not come downe, wee hoysted our sayles vvith the rest of the ships (in number foure) and hauinge a gallant gale, we easily sternd the tide, hauing taken leaue of the small rudder, and novv trusting to the hopefull helme (which God be thanked vvell gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:11404:6"/>
vs, hauing for two daies and one night a good gale and faire: But the 15. daye of Iune, beyonde <hi>Nevvcastle,</hi> that night the winde seased, so as wee must bend our course Easterlie. In the night, wee left behind vs one of our ships, named the <hi>Minion,</hi> which with a side wind could not holde course with vs. Whereupon our Mayster came to the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador to know his pleasure, whether he would staye or no, alledging withal, it was their custom to prick forwardest, and with euerie winde to make the best aduantage of their ships: But the Ambassador com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded him to tacke about, and stay til the <hi>Minion</hi> were come vp, which hee obeyed: And surelye the Ambas: herin shewed his great care and loue to the Gent. with the rest: for me thinketh it a great com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort on the Sea, to behold neighbor-ships, yea (and if occasion should require) it would proue wisdom and good discretion, when either the vvant of one ship, or that one ship might vnhappily for his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, be diuersly lost or cast away, as is too often found to be true.</p>
            <p>But for Sea accidentes, it is not my purpose to make perticular relation, beeing neither pertinent to my course, nor to any a matter of much validity: but as if our Ambas. were againe in the <hi>Tovver of London,</hi> as he is in the ship: now tost, then becaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: in feare and hope within one moment, wher sometime God <hi>Neptune</hi> like a Prince, will haue his subiects know his force, and feele his rigor: where vvhen Fogges and mists appeare (like stratagems and pollicies) to make men imprisoned tremble,
<pb facs="tcp:11404:7"/>
man then can see that he otherwise cannot see, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in present deliuerance, deliuerance and helpe in| present daunger. For ordinary policies are like <hi>Mount Lybanus</hi> fogges, then most palpable, when least discerned: but as God brought him out with much honor and praise, onely by the benefit of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, clothed in Innocency, so shall I by the help of God, deliuer our selues safely at our Port and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, by the gaining of time out-running miserie: for the Sea is a miserable commonwealth to liue in, (If without much patience) where mens eies must euer be open to al dangers: and this is there a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation against all dangers, where men rest most in vnquietnes and stand safest, when the winde like <hi>Hu-an-cry,</hi> driues them forward for feare of worsse weather, but to them that loue the Sea, I wish helth, and my selfe euer to stande well on dry ground: to behold one of the 3. gallant spectacles in the world, <hi>A Ship vnder sayle,</hi> loming (as they tearme it) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede like a Lyon pawing with his forfeet, heauing and setting, like a <hi>Musco Beare</hi> bayted with excellent English dogs. But the comming on boord of some Gent. and others to my L. ship, (we being becal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) invites me to turne my best wit to bid them welcome. Who are so honourably intertained by the Ambas. as hauing of his perticular frends much, of his owne more, of the company of marchaunts most, and very bountifuly of either, inough for any; did therewith feast them were invited at <hi>Graues-end,</hi> to be welcome about <hi>Shotland</hi>; It shal be honor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the Ambas. and comfort inough to his
<pb facs="tcp:11404:7"/>
folowers, that they neuer came, but they found him like a good hous-keeper at home, and like a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sir, command them the best cheare.

            <p>The 22. of <hi>Iuly</hi> beeing come within a mile of <hi>Tharch-angell,</hi> we ankerd, whether came at 11. of the clocke in the night, a Gentleman (Captain of 500. gunners, named <hi>Maxim Vrin:</hi> a man of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, and of indifferent stature and presence,) aboard the Ambassadors shippe, being mette with two Gentlemen and others, he was brought into his Lordships Cabin, where after rehearsing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Princes Title (which is euer their cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,) he declared to the Ambassador, that his L. and Maister and the young Prince, had sent him, to knowe of his Maiesties health of <hi>Englande,</hi> the Q. and Princes, which the Ambassador answeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: then demaunded of his owne, and the Gent.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador, somewhat woondering what
<pb facs="tcp:11404:9"/>
this Gent. should be (considering former Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Entertainment) presently was by him resolued with this, prosecuting his former speeche: That whereas the Emperor vnderstanding of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors comming, to shewe his great loue to his <hi>Maiesty</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the desire of peace and Amity, (as with his deere and louing Sister <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of happy memory late Queene of <hi>England</hi>) contrary to any custome of his Maiesties heeretofore, who neuer tooke knowledge thereafter, had sent him to bee his <hi>Prestaue,</hi> to prouide the Ambassadours house, and victuals, and to garde him from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of a strange nation: desiring that his seruice therein might expresse his thankefulnes to his <hi>Ma.</hi> for so great an honour, and likewise be pleasing to the Ambassador. Both which to deserue, he would endeuor the best lay in his power.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador (though somewhat be-woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or gratiously preuented) verye kindely and thankfully accepted of this truly honourable fauor: saying, It behooued two such great Princes to vse the best meanes for Amity and friendship. So the <hi>Prestaue</hi> banquetted as befitting his place, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed that night, but yet before he went, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde, the Ambassadors Shippe, the Agent <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iohn Mericke,</hi> diuers Marchants, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men to see his Lordship, as to welcome him to that Port of his desire: who after some houres discourse, priuately betwixt the <hi>Ambassador</hi> and the Agent, tasting of his wine and Beere, with halfe a score good peeces they were sent away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11404:9"/>Truely herein, the extraordinary beginning was hope of a prosperous conclusion: for this was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor neuer manifested to any heretofore, who after their arriuall at the Castle, staide and that very vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) till a poste were dispatched, from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or Gouernor of the Towne to the <hi>Musco,</hi> (which is 1000. Myles,) and his return with the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> further pleasure for his direction and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>The 23. of <hi>Iuly</hi> the <hi>Prestaue,</hi> the English Agent, Marchants and other, being come to bring the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> with honor into his lodging, he withall the Gent. before him, and his Liueries before them, two and two together, accompanied as is aforesaid, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the Castle: in the road whereof, then beeing many <hi>English, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a mighty peale, (or rather many peales of Ordinance.) Thus the <hi>Ambassador</hi> came safely to his first lodging in <hi>Rushia.</hi> The <hi>Prestaue</hi> takinge a solemne leaue, went to see the Prouisions which were laide in before, to be good, as also to prouide necessarie lodginges, for diuers which were to bee lodged abroad, and others not as yet Landed, for it was 4. daies before all our Ships came vp.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Ambassador</hi> laie some fourteen dayes, or lesse, where in the meane time, there was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a particular note of the names of all the <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors</hi> traine, fyrst of the Kings Gentlemen, (which name not onely the Emperor, but the <hi>Great Turke, Persian &amp; Moroco Princes</hi> do highly account of) as indeed soothing their own greatnes therwith, and
<pb facs="tcp:11404:10"/>
we who were his seruants, and highly graced by kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Princely hande of our royall K. meeting herein with any others, trauailing in the same kind: as also by our particular births, not beeing lesse (so vnexpectedly required of vs) did vnder-goe the name, as which we could not vvithout dishonor to the Ambassador, and disaduantage to our <hi>Being</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, it being giuen by an Emperor, who should be in that kingdome so great as not to allow it, though he would (which none could) disproue? Secondly, of the Ambassadors Gent, and thirdly, of al the rest that attended, which forthwith was deliuered to the <hi>Prestaue,</hi> and sent vp by him to the Emperor: the reasons hereof are, as may be gathered, to esteeme the state and honor of the Ambassador thereafter: also, to prouide accordingly for houses, horses, and other prouisions, and perhappes to learne thereby what names of great houses are amonge the kinges Gent.: as particularly now they did inquire after. Here, it pleased the English agent M. <hi>Iohn Mericke,</hi> (truely a wise, honest and kinde Gent.) to inuite all the Gentlemen to their house to dinner: whether he would haue vvillingly invited the Ambas. if hee might haue presumed thereupon, and of the fitnes, considering that as yet letters were not secondarilie come from the <hi>Emperor,</hi> for the gent. farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: whereby he woulde happily haue made a question there of; as also for the <hi>Ambass.</hi> greatnes, (the towne then so ouercharged with many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) it could not be performed according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect ambassadors are vsed with there, nor perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:11404:10"/>
would it be well agreeing to their more priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, who hold it greatest glory for greatest men, rather to be reported of, then seene, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But we were very bountifully feasted and as kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hartily welcome, as an honest mind (rather indeed with vertue then formality) might expresse, the <hi>Ambassadour</hi> hauing many daintye dishes, sent home to his owne house. Now the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Ships safely arriued, and all the <hi>Ambas.</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers landed some daies before: it came forthwith into the care and loue of the <hi>Ambas.</hi> (being by the Agent well informed of diuers vices, customes, and Obseruations, fit either to be followed or auoyded) who was euer desirous to keepe an honorable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to himselfe, and an honest name in his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, as in his going vp to the Court, so, euer after also to ingraue within their memories, their happy deliuerance from the Sea, before his departing the <hi>Arch-angel,</hi> very honorably thus to aduise &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell them.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Prestaue Maxim Vrin</hi> hauing a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Emperor, accordingly prouided fiue Loddies, two with Cherdecks and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.

A graue, honest, and peaceable gentleman, a happines to any <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> and as necessarie in this Countrey
<pb facs="tcp:11404:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as may be, the contrary whereof other <hi>Ambassadors</hi> and the laste that honourable and renowned Gen. <hi>Sir Richard Lea,</hi> found his greatest crosse, for pride, opinion, and selfe will, is inherent to any <hi>Russe</hi> put in place of honor.</p>
            <p>This Gentle. being come within a quarter of a Myle, sent to the <hi>Ambas.</hi> to giue him notice, that the Emperor had sent him as his <hi>Prestaue,</hi> and hee desired to see his Lordship, as well to know of him concerning his health, his vsage, and his prouision, as to let him vnderstand the <hi>Emperors</hi> especial fauor towards him, in sending him presently vpon Newes of his arriual, with a larger commission, and that at all <hi>Yames</hi> and Townes of quality, he had deliuered letters for his receyuing of horses and prouission of diet, and what he would desire. So two of the K. Gen. fetched him on boord the <hi>Ambassadors Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonicke,</hi> where he was honouraly entertayned, and indeede he was a kind Gentleman, as who knowes this Countrey people might easily acknowledge, whence after halfe an houres drinking and eating he departed: presently after his departing, the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi> sent sixe of his Liueries, and his <hi>Enterpreter</hi> or <hi>Tolmatch</hi> to his boat, with a banquet, which he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindly and thankefully accepted: so we passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on our Iourney, which was as pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, wheather you consider the admirable straight pine, tall Cedar, or fyrre woods; <hi>Alablaster</hi> Rockes, or the pleasantnes of walkes, in sweet Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and fair pastures, than which, for 1000. vers cannot be more welcom in the whole world, which
<pb facs="tcp:11404:12"/>
we fully Towed and sayled in the <hi>Dvvina, Soocana,</hi> and <hi>Vollagda.</hi> I must leaue many faire townes, and great Presents, where we lay and rested, because it will bee rather an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> than a receiued truth: and I desire to escape those smal rubbes, that others may the easier fall vppon them, being safely come within fiue vers of <hi>Vollagda,</hi> the sixt of Septem. and vnwilling to forsake so pleasant a passage, we the 7. day, acompanied with many Du. and Gentlemen, and for the Am: a faire horse from the great Bish. there. As for the Kings Gent. and some others, we rode to a very fair and large house prouided for the <hi>Ambas.</hi> where they lefte him, not as then willing to take or taste of his goodnes (as the <hi>Russe</hi> termes it) partly, it is to be supposed for that the many are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in sodain accidents of one resolution, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that it was to be thought, the <hi>Ambas.</hi> was not so well prouided for them, as afterwards being set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led he would be. In this great towne we easily found the <hi>Emperors</hi> commaund, for our better dyet, and liberty to ride, was withall willingnes performed, where the <hi>Ambassador</hi> first, (as in euere place after) was more gratiously entertained.</p>
            <p>The 12. of Septem. the <hi>Ambas.</hi> accompanyed with diuers Gentlemen, tooke his trauell by Land, himselfe riding in his owne Coatch, with a spare horse led by at his pleasure, with 150. horses, with the carriages. So by easie Iourneyes, wee passed a pleasant and faire trauell, as is or can be for so many vers, in the whole world, without any rainy daies, or foule vvaies, resting euery Sabaoth day, as the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11404:13"/>
had by water before done, not indeed missinge two Sermons at any time, no (hardlye at the Sea though our Preacher were the sickest man.) Such was his care and zeale, and truely he was an honest quiet man, and a sufficient Scholler, named Maister <hi>Samuell Sotheby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we passed from <hi>Yam,</hi> to <hi>Yam,</hi> vppon excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Post-horses, till we came thorogh many well scituated, and pleasant townes, vnto the Cittie of <hi>Yerri-slaue,</hi> which we came vnto, the 19. of Sept. where we were receiued with a multitude of people. After we had rowed in a very great Barge, ouer the famous Riuer of <hi>Volga,</hi> (wherevnto adioyning this citty on a hill is scittuated) a rich and pleasant Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty where the <hi>Ambassador</hi> was lodged in the house of <hi>Gregory Euannovvich Micolin,</hi> late <hi>Ambassador,</hi> to her Maiesty of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might be fitting for me to speake somewhat of this famous Riuer, as is I thinke for length, and bredth, any (one) excepted in the world, but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent writers, as in the worthy labors of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Richard Hacklyute,</hi> haue made particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, as it induseth me, to leaue the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Riuer and towne, to those that haue largely and painfuly wrote of such things: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to M. <hi>Doct. Fletchers</hi> true relation, sometime Ambas. to this Emperor. The 21. of September, we went from <hi>Yeri-slaue</hi> being well accompanied from the Citty, passing through <hi>Shepetscoy,</hi> (where wee lay) and dwels an English gentleman named <hi>Georg Garland,</hi> sometime seruant to that Noble but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate

            <p>The next day we came to <hi>Rostoue,</hi> an ancient, but a great ruinous town, wherof is one of their <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollitanes</hi> named. Here in a faire house the <hi>Ambassa.</hi> lay 2. daies: in which time the <hi>Emperors Mate.</hi> wrote to our <hi>Prestaue,</hi> that the <hi>Ambas.</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen should haue ambling horses from the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steries,</hi> and that we should take as easie Iourneyes as we pleased: with commaund, to giue content to euery ones desire. And certainly, had not the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> as then bin taking a Prograce to the <hi>Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Troiets,</hi> (which foure times a yeare for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous causes he doth) we had receiued more especiall fauors. Yet he that hath but trauailed to know what <hi>Monasteries</hi> are, and how prouided of al things, may easily esteeme it, a great ease, and especiall honour to haue there horses. The 25. day we came to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri-slaue,</hi> a long decayed towne, where in a rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants house, new builded, the <hi>Ambas.</hi> lodged. Here (in regarde of the Emperors and Princes being at <hi>Troytes,</hi> which was but of our easie trauell two daies iourny) we lodged 3. daies, &amp; then departed throgh <hi>Doobna</hi> to <hi>Troites,</hi> that fair and rich Monastery, so to <hi>Bratte-sheene,</hi> and <hi>Rostouekin,</hi> 5. vers from the great city of <hi>Musco:</hi> where in a Churchmans house, the <hi>Ambass.</hi> that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:11404:14"/>This night the Agent hauing bin with the chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor came to visit his Lordshipp, and let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the next morning about nine of clocke, he should be honourably brought into the <hi>Musco,</hi> whereupon euerie man prepared accordingly.</p>
            <p>The next morow, being the 4. of October, the <hi>Prestaue</hi> came and declared to his Lordsh. it was the <hi>Emperors</hi> pleasure, he should come into the <hi>Mosco</hi> that forenoone: presently after came M. <hi>I.

Then we did ride, till we came within a little mile of the many 1000. of Noblemen and Gentl. on both sides the way, attended on horseback to receiue his Lordsh. Where the Ambassador alighted from his Coatch, and mounted on his footcloth horse, and so rode on with his trumpets sounding. A quarter of a mile farther, met him a proper and gallant gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman a foote of the <hi>Emperors</hi> stable, who with cap in hand, declared to the <hi>Ambassador,</hi> that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the young Prince, and the maister of the horse, had so far fauored him, as to send him a Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, very gorgeously trapped with gold, Pearle, and pretious stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and particularly, a great chaine of plated gold about his necke, to ride vpon.

likewise were very richly adorned, then for all his followers: which ceremony or state performed, &amp; all being horssed, he departed, wee riding orderlye forward, till we were met by three great Noblmen, seuered from the rest of the multitude, and the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Tolmache</hi> or interpreter with them. Of which state the Ambassador it may seeme, had for-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (it being in this Countrey a custome vsed) but with more or lesse Noblemen, as is the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors fauour and grace.</p>
            <p>Likewise vnderstanding of the strange Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of first allighting from their horses, (as who ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath read sir <hi>Ierome Bowes</hi> his formality and ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruance hereof, or sir <hi>Richard Leaes</hi> painefull stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the priority herein) may thinke the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors command is very strait therunto, and as they thinke much honour is loste to dismount first: but they being within speach, thus began that Oration they could neuer well conclude: Which was, That from their Lorde and Maister the mighty Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Rushia,</hi> &amp;c. they had a message to deliuer his lordship. The Ambassador then thinking they would be tedious and troublesome with their vsuall Ceremonies; preuented their farther speeche with this (to them a <hi>Spell</hi>) <hi>That it vvas vnfitting for sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iects to hold discourse in that kinde of complement, of tvvo such mighty and renowmed Potentates on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe.</hi> They hereby not only put by their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious saddle-sitting, but out of their paper instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the state thereof ashamed (as was proude <hi>Artexius,</hi> stepping aside in the daungerous fight
<pb facs="tcp:11404:15"/>
with <hi>Zealmene</hi>) they allighted sodainly, as men fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they were halfe vnhorsed, and the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor presently after them, comming very courteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly all three, saluting the <hi>Ambass.</hi> and the kings gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, taking them by the hands. Thus like a schol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler, too olde to learne by rote (the Duke named <hi>K. Volladamur Evanywich Mavvsolskoy</hi>) with his Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before him, declared his message, which was, that he with the other twoe Noblemen, were sente from the <hi>Great Lord, Emperor and great Duke Borys Phedorvvich, selfe-upholder, great L. Emperor, and great Duke of all Rushia, Volademer, Moskoe and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogorode, king of Casan and Astracan, Lord of Vobs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koe, great Duke of Smolenskoe, Tuer, Huder, Vghory, Perme, Viatsky, Bolgory, &amp;c.

King of all Syberia and the North coasts. Commander of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of Iversky, Grysinsky, and Emperor of Kabardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsky, of Chirkasky, and of the vvhol countrie of Gars<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>key, and of many other countries and Kingdomes lord and Emp.</hi> to know of his Ma. health of England, the Qu. and Princes. The second, being a capt. of gun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners (the <hi>Emperors</hi> guard) named <hi>Kazarine Davy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovvich Beaheetchoue,</hi> pronouncing the Emp. and princes tytle, said he was sent from them to knowe his Lordsh. health and vsage, with the kings Gent. The third, was one of the Secretaries, named <hi>Pheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Boulteene,</hi> obseruing the former order, did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer what he had in command from the Emp. prince
<pb facs="tcp:11404:15"/>
and Empresse, to informe the Ambassador of their much fauor towards him and the kings Gent, in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiding for his honorable intertain and ease, a fayre large house to lodge in: Also, that they three were sent from the Emp. Prince, and Empresse, to be his <hi>Prestaues,</hi> to supply the <hi>Emperors</hi> goodnes toward him, to prouide his necessaries, and deliuer anye sute it pleased the Ambassadour to make to the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour. To all which the <hi>Ambassador</hi> very wiselie gaue answere (as they made report vnto the Emp.)</p>
            <p>So we all presently mounted again, the <hi>Prestaues</hi> on either hand of the Amb. his horse and footcloth being led by his Page, som small distance, his cotch behind that, and some 6000. Gallants after behind all: who at the Ambas. riding thorough the guard, that was made for him, very courteously bowed him selfe. Thus was he followed by thousands, and with in the three vvalles of the Citty, many hundreds of yong Noblemen, Gentlemen, and rich merchants well mounted, begirt the wayes of euery side: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers on foote also, euen to the gate of the house where the Ambassador was to be lodged, which was some two myles. Whether being come, hee was brought into his bed-chamber by the Noblemen his <hi>Prestaues,</hi> where with many thanks for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable paines; they vvere dismist, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their further affayres. The next morn cam three other <hi>Prestaues</hi> with the former, to knovve of his Lordships health, and hovv he hadde rested the night past: vvithall, that if his Lordshippe wanted any thing, they all, or any one of them, were as
<pb facs="tcp:11404:16"/>
commaunded, so ready to obey therein. These, with the Enterpreter and six Gent. were most within the walles, lodged in a house ouer the gate, besides wee had fifty Gunners to attend, and gard vs in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad.</p>
            <p>The 8. of Octob. being the 4. day after our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Musco,</hi> the <hi>Prestaues</hi> came to his Lordship to let him vnderstand, they heard he should goe vp the next day: wherefore they desired his speech and <hi>Ambassage</hi> to the <hi>Emperour</hi>: and the rather, that the Enterpreter might (as they pretended) translate it. To this purpose, very earnestly at seueral times they made demaund. The <hi>Ambassador</hi> answered, that he was sent from a mighty <hi>Prince,</hi> to be his <hi>Ambassa.</hi> to their Emperor, hauing with no small danger passed the Sea, and a second water trauaile, with a long land Iourney, and stil was comforted, with hope to see his <hi>Maiesties</hi> cleere eyes, that for a welcome was the tidings thereof vnto him? Especially, to haue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within so short a space as he might not lesse do then ackcowledging the <hi>Emperors</hi> great fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: and being sent to their maister, he dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, not onely a dishonor to him, but a weaknes in them, to require that at his hands, (which besides that he would never do) he could not, being to speak that in the deliuery was according as it pleased god, to giue him time, occasion, memorie, and courage, being to come before a strange and mighty Prince, where what he said, was to be interpreted as pleased their <hi>Tolmatch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, peremtorely, and finally was his aunswere.
<pb facs="tcp:11404:16"/>
Yet, whensoeuer he did go, as he was both willing and ready at all houres, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So, after banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting departed away rather discontented, then satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Surely it is a custome (not so wise as auncient) for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fal out into bad language, if they canot haue their willes, which to many would be, as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a demaund, as it were folly in the <hi>Ambassador</hi> to graunt: Especially, if men knew how vndiscreete a man they woulde thinke him to be, woulde please their humors herein. For it is but a Stratigem they vse to vndermine withal, that they may report the magnanimity or pusillanimity of the Ambas. vnto the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 10. of October, his <hi>Prestaues</hi> brought word as from the Lord <hi>Chaunsellor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that he thought, (for they wil neuer tell any thing to come for certainty) his Lordsh. should go before the <hi>Emperor</hi> the next morrow, therfore prayed him to prouide: also, that he should haue the Em. horses to ride on, &amp; of his guard to helpe carry vp his present, of which they had (after dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus we rode a shorte vers beheld with thousand of eies: on each side the streets standing the <hi>Emperors</hi> guarde with peeces in their hands well apparrelled, to the number of two thousand by esteeme, many messengers posting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Court and our <hi>Prestaues.</hi> Thus with much state, softly riding, tell wee came vnto the vtmost gate of the court, (hauing passed thorogh the great Castle before) there his Lordsh. dismounted. Then met him a great Duke (named <hi>Knase Andriay Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towich Soomederoue</hi>) with certain Ge. to bring him vp. So in order as we rode, we assended the staires and a stone gallery. where on each side stood many Nobles, and Courtiers, in faire coates of <hi>Persian</hi> stuffe, veluet, Damaske &amp;c. At the entry to the great chamb. two Councellors incountred the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassa.</hi> to conduct him thorogh that roome, rounde about which sat many graue and richly apparrelled personages. Then we entred the Presents, whether being come, and making obeysance, we staide to hear, but not vnderstand, a very gallant Nobleman, named <hi>Peter Bas-man,</hi> deliuer the <hi>Emperors</hi> title: Then the particular of the Presentes, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies: which performed, the <hi>Ambassa.</hi> hauing liberty, deliuered so much of his <hi>Ambassage,</hi> as the time and occasion then affoorded: After which the <hi>Emperor</hi> arising from his throne, deman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> health, the <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Queenes:</hi> then of the <hi>Ambassadours</hi> and the <hi>Kinges</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Ambassador</hi> hauing taken the <hi>Kings</hi> Letter of his Gentleman <hi>Vsher,</hi> went vp after his obeysance to deliuer it, which the Lord <hi>Chansellor</hi> would haue intercepted.

Then did he call for the <hi>Kings</hi> Gentlemen, to kisse his hande, and the <hi>Princes,</hi> which they after obeysance made, did accordingly. Afterwards, his <hi>Maiest.</hi> invited his Lordsh. the <hi>K.</hi> Gent. and the rest to dine with him, as likewise M. <hi>I.

In the midst of this hall might seeme to stand a great Piller, round about which, a great heigth stood won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfull great peeces of plate, very curiously wroght with all manner of Beastes, Fishes and fowles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some other ordinarye peeces of seruiceable plate.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:11404:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>Being thus set (some quarter of an houre as it were, feeding our eyes with that fayre Piller of plate) we beheld the <hi>Emperors</hi> table serued by two hund.

            <p>Then the <hi>Emperor</hi> sent from his table by his noble seruitors, to my lord and the kings Gent. 30. dishes of meate, and to each a loafe of extraordinary fine bread. Then followed a great number of straunge and rare dishes, some in Siluer, but most of massie gold: with boiled, baked and rosted, being piled vp on one another by halfe dozens. To make you a perticular relation, I should do the entertainment wrong, consisting almost of innumerable dishes: Also, I should ouercharge my memory, as then I did mine eyes and stomache, little delighting the Reader, because <hi>Garlicke and Onions,</hi> must besauce many of my words, as then it did the most parte of their dishes.</p>
            <p>For our drinkes, they consisted of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kindes of <hi>Meandes,</hi> besides all sortes of Wine, and Beere. I assure you I had rather drinke to you a daily health in them, then make you long after their pleasantnesse, considering the colde and sower voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age you must vndertake, before you tast of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and sweetnesse.</p>

But at one time (striking his hand aduisedly on his breast) <hi>Oh, saide he, my deere Sister Queen Elizab.</hi> whom I loued as mine own hart, expressing this his great affection almost in a weeping passion. The <hi>Ambassador</hi> receiuing the cup from his Princelye hand, returned againe to his owne place, where all of vs standing, drank the same helth out of the same cup, being of fayre Christall, as the <hi>Emperor</hi> had commanded, the wine (as farre as my iudgement gaue leaue) being Alligant.</p>
            <p>Thus passing some foure houres in banquetting, and refreshing our selues too plentifully, all being taken away, we did arise. The <hi>Ambassador</hi> and the kings gentlemen beeing called by name to receyue from his Emperiall handes, a cup (or rather as they call it a <hi>Yendover</hi>) of excellent redde <hi>Meande,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour among them neuer obserued before, which cups for they wer great and the <hi>Meand</hi> very strong, we often sipped at, but without hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After Easter weeke was passed, the <hi>Prestaue</hi> came to desire that the <hi>Ambas.</hi> would appoint some to go and make choise of boates which then lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Riuer, that they might be fitted for his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. which accordinglie verie carefullie was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Gouernor of the towne hauing a Letter from the <hi>Emperor</hi> to giue the <hi>Ambassa.</hi> ful content, as indeed without detraction we had, to the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

To that end he demanded poste horses and convoy accordinglye: which demand, though yet for the suddainnes and heauines did somewhat distract their heads, haue sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome easie resolutions but to sleeping: yet after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring an houres liberty, and therin consulting with the Bish. and Gent. of the towne, it was effected. So then his Lordsh. requested M. <hi>Edw. Cherry</hi> (thogh he was best to be commanded) as being vsed to ride poast, hauing the language, knowing the factions

This may giue satisfaction to anye vnderstanding both of his feares and gelousies: his great loue, and much care. Another saying of the Emperour was this, and then let any iudg what I haue writ, &amp; why. It was a vsuall speech with the Emp. vpon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: to say he was the Lord and father of his sonne, yet withall, That he was not only his seruant, but his very slaue. And thus he proued it That hee might command him, and that he begat him. For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that all his actions were onely for his seruice though not commaunded by him, yet in his owne nature and affection vrged therunto. For his chiefe good he was his addopted Prince, and that he knew it was his duty, he remembred euer more he was his father as his Soueraigne able, and as his father ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged. For the third that he was his Slaue, he woulde alleage for him in many kindes, he knewe that hee had done that, could not but from a Tyrant, bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his vassals, and the greater was his subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heerein, that he was forced to commit that no Potentate could exact (<hi>I say neither by law nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whereupon <hi>Bodan Belskey</hi> left the Courte.

the dead body was openly showne three daies, to the eyes of all men.

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an old ouer-worne law buried long in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes was now againe freshly reuiued, and that was, That the child of a sixt wife was not to inherit.
