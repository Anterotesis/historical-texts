            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Refaces in Generall are like thoſe bills of notice that players poſt up, which give large promiſes of ſatisfaction, thereby to attract the more Mlutitude and mony; And the Credulous buyers of books, who think to gaine wit by parting with their Coyne, are as much deceived as thoſe that go to the Theater with hopes to become great Politicians by ſeeing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of a Periwigd plot, or expect to learne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment from a Comoedians Demarche. And they uſually fall to the Stationers taſke as being the Perſon moſt concern'd; to whom I would gladly have left it now, if my deſigne had been to give praiſes to the book, and not to gaine Pardon for my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that ſpend their time in brewing of Books are compar'd by Seneca to petty Painters that buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Coppying out Originalls; and this halfe verſe of Horace is throwne at them.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And great loades of Cenſures they undergoe that meddle in this kind, how deſervingly I will not now queſtion, But certainely the cry againſt them would be leſſe if 'twere conſidered that theſe reproaches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb facs="tcp:56652:7"/>
many who are not look't upon by the world as Tranſlators, and who are ſo farre from being capable to judge others that they are guilty themſelves. With what confidence might I affirme this great truth that very few of thoſe that would be thought the fathers of that which they do but uſher into the world, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? And hardly have they ſo much right to any whole Page, as they pretend to have to the whole volume. What are for the moſt part the Productions now a dayes, but Tranſlations, and the riches of our Anceſtors? We ſpeak through their mouths, and ſcarce have wee a good thought which we are not their deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for: Everyone. Pilfers and thinks it no injury to take from them that have to ſpare; ſome prey upon the ſenſe, and by cloathing it in the Country dreſſe, make it paſſe for a native; Others content themſelves with petty Larcins, and will confeſſe that they borrow their beſt expreſſions, if you'l grant the invention to be theirs; But the greater number are thoſe that do not onely filch here and there, but take it as they find it, word for word, and onely alter the Title and inſtead of Virgill and Cicero put—and—Nor are they content with the ſpoiles of one Ancient, but pick up and down, feaſting their Readers palate with a ſallad of many ſimples, which doth no more better the Peruſer, then compound meates doth the ſtomack, when they fill is with a confuſion of corrupt humors; Thus do they make many Authors meet in the ſame ſheet now they are dead, which living had divers ages to part them. If what is taken out of Ariſtotle, Plato, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, and ſome others, were deducted from the works of ſome that paſſe for ſmart Compoſers, and Dictators amongſt us, I doubt the remaines would be little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a babell of words. Such as theſe in learning
<pb facs="tcp:56652:7"/>
are like our Quakers in religion, thoſe Concordance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; that are ſtufft with ſcraps of Scripture. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the riches the Preſſe preſents us withall now a dayes, were dug out of the Antients mines, and there's nothing new.</p>
            <p>The Arabes have a Proverb which ſayes, That we merit little, if we cannot do as much as the ſpider that ſpinnes her web out of her owne bowells, without being beholding to any either for matter or forme.</p>
            <p>My intention is not to raiſe my owne merits by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and diſpraiſing other men; for I acquieſce in the Proverbe, and confeſſe I have deſerved nothing, I would onely perſwade the world that Tranſlators merit little, and thoſe we have ſpoake of, Plagiaries, leſſe. The one convicts himſelfe by his Confeſſion in the front of his worke. The other adds diſingenuity and falſe-hood to his fellony.</p>
            <p>But however we may ſpeak much ill of Tranſlators; certainly Tranſlations deſerve better from us, for (although it may be granted that) 'tis no ſmall diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to render all Authors, without, in ſome ſort, doing them injury, (for every Language hath its Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etyes and advantages, and that which is wit in one Tongue will not be ſo in all) yet who is there I wonder that had not rather want one of his Eyes then both? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot be ſo happy as to have every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of an Author, muſt we therefore looſe him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together? 'Twas the great Cardinall Richelieu's Care to have books in all ſciences tranſlated to render them more Communicable.</p>
            <p>But, as 'tis uſuall for thoſe that come to beg pardon for an offence to aggravate and add to it by their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, ſo I doubt my Exceedings may gaine me a ſeverer ſentence then perhaps was intended me. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb facs="tcp:56652:8"/>
I might have ſpoke much leſſe, and yet have ſaid enough, concerning this tranſlation: but having now this Opportunity which I ſhall not often give my ſelfe, I was the willinger to ſay ſomething in generall.</p>
            <p>'Tis likely this Verſion will bring but few of thoſe advantages to the world that I conceive accrew to it from many other Tranſlations; yet, why ſhould not wit be made communicable as well as knowledge ſince they are both ingredients of a perfect man. Wit I dare Promiſe you plentifully in theſe eſſayes, cloathed by the Author, in ſmooth and ſignificant expreſſions, and ſuch high and unthought-of raptures you'l meet with, that I believe you'l confeſſe he may with ſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance paſſe for a French <hi>Cleveland,</hi> and indeed if our Author were not ignorant of this tongue I ſhould think he endeavourd to imitate that great ſatyriſt, for like <hi>Pliny's</hi> fiſh he carries teeth in his tongue.</p>
            <p>Theſe letters were the Recreations of his youth, as they have been here to fore mine, at thoſe hours that I ſtudied the French, &amp; as they taught me French I learnt them Engliſh; with what ſucceſſe, others muſt judge. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe there are ſome Conceptions which I underſtand not, although I endeavourd to do it from others. Such, as neere as I could I engliſhed verbatim, and ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the words that they might import as much in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as in French. Thoſe that can judge of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall will I believe grant, that 'tis almoſt as hard a Book, to tranſlate well, as any in proſe that is extant in that Language.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW 'tis, that Winter hath tyed the Earth's Codpiece point, &amp; hath made the ſubſtance Impotent; nay, and the very ſoul, although Incorporeal, is not ſecure againſt his Tyranny. Mine is ſo ſhrunk into its ſelfe, That in what par ſoever I touch my ſelfe to day, I want above four fingers of reaching the place I am at. I feele without being ſenſible, And a ſword might have let out my life at a thouſand doors, and never once knocked at that of Paine. In fine, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Paralytick, yet (to make a wound of a ſmall hurt.) God hath given but one balme for our ſore, and the Phyſician that brings it too, is to viſit ſix other houſes, before he comes to us; this lazy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones I ſpeak of, is the Sunne. Do but ſee what little Journeyes he goes, he ſets out but at Eight,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56652:11"/>
and goes to his Inn at four. I believe he is of my mind, and thinks it too cold weather to riſe early; But pray God; it may be lazineſſe onely that ſtayes him, and not ſpight; for, me thinks, what ever the reaſon is, he hath looked upon us this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months Aſcuint; for my part I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why it ſhould be, unleſſe he, ſeeing the Earth ſo hardned by the froſt dares not Mount too high, for feare of hurting his Beams in precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating them. Thus are we farr from being reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the ſeaſon for the injury he doth us. In vaine the fire puts himſelfe into a heat and Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler againſt him, his rage (after having ſent forth a great many ſparks of Anger) ends; in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to devour himſelfe the faſter; 'Twere to little purpoſe to take up a ſhield, Winter is a ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month's death fallen upon one whole ſide of the Globe, which we cannot eſcape, 'Tis a ſhort old-age of things animated, 'Tis a being that hath no action, which never comes neer us (be we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtout) but he makes us quake, our porous, delicate, and fine ſlender bodyes, ſhrink up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hard, and haſten to cloſe their paſſages to baricadoe a million of inviſible dores, &amp; to cover them with little Mountaines: he is moved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and bluſhing gives this for Excuſe, that his ſhiverings are ſallies that he purpoſely makes to beat off the Enemy from his out-works. Finally 'tis a Miracle that we reſiſt the deſtiny of all living creatures. This Tyrant is not Content to ſilence our birds, to ſtrip our trees, to cut <hi>Ceres</hi>'s locks, nay and her Eares to boot, and to have left our Grand-mother ſtark naked &amp; bare; but, that we might not fly by water to a more temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,

he hath encloſed them with Diamant walls; and leaſt the rivers by their Motion ſhould have cauſed ſome heat to helpe us, he hath made them faſt to their beds. But he exceeds all this, for, to affright us, by the very Image of prodigies which he invents for our deſtruction, he makes us miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Ice for a Hardned light, a Petrified day, a ſolid nothing, or ſome horrible Monſter whoſe body is nothing but an eye. The Seine at firſt, affrighted at the teares of Heaven was troubled, and fearing ſome more ſad diſaſter would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen her inhabitants, ſtopt her courſe, and kept her ſelfe in a readineſſe, upon occaſion to aſſiſt us. Mankind, being likewiſe terrified, at the Prodigies of this horrible ſeaſon, gather from it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages proportionable to their feares; If it ſnow, they preſently imagine the Milky way is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that the heavens foame for madneſſe at the loſſe of it, And that the earth, out of care to her Children, for feare becomes gray. They fancy likewiſe the univerſe to be a great Tart that this Monſter (Winter) ſtrowes Sugar upon, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to devoure it, that the ſnow is the foame of the plants that dye mad, and conclude that the cold winds, are the laſt ſighs of languiſhing Nature. I my ſelfe, that uſe to interpret all things for the beſt, and that in another ſeaſon ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my ſelfe, that the ſnow was the vegetative Milk that the Planets ſuckled the Plants withall, or the Crumbs that, after Grace, falls from God Almighty's table, am now carried away with the torrent of Examples. If it hail, I cry out, what Puniſhments are reſerved for us ſinners, ſince the Innocent heavens piſſe Gravell: would

I deſcribe thoſe frozen winds, ſo great, that they overwhelm Towers and Caſtles, and yet ſo ſmall that they are inviſible, I cannot imagine what to call them, unleſſe, the Bluſtrings of ſome divells broke looſe, which having binne benum'd under ground, run about to catch themſelves a heat. Every thing that is like winter puts me into a fright, I cannot endure a looking glaſſe becauſe of its reſemblance with Ice, I ſhun Phyſitians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are called ſnowie or gray Doctors, and I can convict the Cold of many Murders; for, in moſt of the howſes in <hi>Paris</hi> where I have ſeen Gelly, there hath been a dying Perſon. In troth Sir, I doe not believe that Saint Iohn's tide will perfectly cure me of my Chriſtmas diſtempers; when I think, that I muſt ſtill ſee in the Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments great panes of Glaſſe, which is nothing elſe but Icecles hardned in the fire. Yeas? This cruell wretch hath put me into ſo ill a humour, that the Auguſt ſunne will hardly purge me from Januaryes fleame. The leaſt heat will make me ſay that winter is nature's cold fit, and Summer her feavour: for judge you if I complaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe, and whether all theſe frozen fellowes (notwithſtanding the liberality of the ſeaſon that gives them as many pearls as noſe-Drops) will not take me for a <hi>Hercules</hi> that purſues this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter their enemy. What rigors doth he not every where Exerciſe? Under the Conduit you'l ſee the frozen tankard-bearer, compell his heart by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to reſtore the life to his fingers ends, wch this Murderer hath taken away. The ſtreet walkers make more noiſe upon the ſtones then ordinary, becauſe they have chilblaines at their heels, the

Revenging ſchool Boy with a ſnow-ball in his hand, watches for his Companion at ſome corner, to dround his face in a peece of river. To conclude the Froſt is ſo great, that every thing is taken, to our very cloaks, at ten at night the ſhivering ſharke makes muſique with his teeth under a Penthouſe, and comforts himſelfe with the ſight of the firſt man that paſſes by, which he miſtakes to be his taylor bringing him a ſuite, when it ſhall pleaſe winter that hardhearted offendor to goe to Confeſſion, here you have the examination of his conſcience, one ſinne onely excepted; for that is a Particular he ſhall never be abſolved of, judge your ſelfe if it be not unpardonable; he juſt now benum'd my fingers to perſwade you that I was but a cold friend, ſince I tremble, now there's an occaſion to declare my ſelf,</p>

               <p>WEepe no more; Faire weather is returned: The ſunne is reconciled to mankind, and his heat hath made winter find his leggs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num'd as they were; he hath lent him onely ſtrength enough to run away, and thoſe long nights, that ſeemed to goe but a ſtep in an hour (for being in the darke they durſt not run) are as farre from us, as the firſt that layed Adam to ſleep. The aire not long ſince ſo condenſ'd by the froſt, that there was not room enough for the birds, ſeems now to be but a great Imaginary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56652:13"/>
ſpace, where ſhrill Muſitians (hardly ſupported by our thoughts) appeare in the skye like little worlds, ballanced by their proper Centre: there were no colds in the Country whence they came, for here they chatter ſweetly. Lord! what a noiſe they make, doubtleſſe they are at law for thoſe lands, Winter at his death, made them heires of. This jealous old Tyrant not content to have rung all creatures, had fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen the very rivers that they might not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo much as their Images; and Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly turned the quickſilver of thoſe running looking glaſſes towards them, which had ſo continued if the Spring at his returne had not rectified them. The Beaſts now ſee themſelves ſwim as they, runne along, the Linnet and the Chaffinch re-produce themſelves without looſing their Unity, they revive without dying, and wonder that ſo cold a neaſt in a Moment can hatch little ones as big as themſelves. In fine, we are of opinion the earth is in a good humour; we need now only make much of her favour: in troth by Winter's aſſiſtance ſhe was become ſo hard hearted towards us, being vext to ſee her ſelfe plunder'd this Autumn, that, had not the heavens wept two Months in her boſome, ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have binne mollified: but God be thanked, ſhe hath forgot all our thefts, all her Care now is to deviſe ſome new fruits: ſhe cloaths her ſelfe with ſhort graſſe to be the more eaſie for our feet, ſhe ſends nothing to our tables that doth not overflow with her milk. If ſhe preſent us with Catterpillars, 'tis in the forme of wild Silke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes, and thoſe great Beetles, which are little
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56652:13"/>
birds, ſhowes ſhee hath been ſo carefull, as to invent even play-things for our Children: ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires her owne riches, and can hardly perſwade her ſelfe to be the Mother of all ſhe brings forth. But a fortnight gone with Child ſhe miſcarries of a thouſand inſects, and being not willing alone to enjoy ſo much of pleaſure, ſhe brings forth haſty births, and rough-caſt Children, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of her bounty. Would one not think that by making the Branches of our Forreſts ſo thick with leaves, ſhe had in a frolick carried (to make us ſport) a whole field to the tops of our trees: but knowing that Exceſſive joyes are prejudicable, in this ſeaſon ſhe makes beans to Bloſſome that the feare of becoming fools may a little allay it. This is the only ill preſage that ſhe hath not drove from off the hemiſphere. Nature brings forth in al places, and her Children as they are borne, play in their cradles. Conſider the Zephyrus, which dares hardly breathe in fear, how ſhe playes and courts the Corne. One would think the graſſe the haire of the Earth; and this wind a combe that is carefull to untangle it. I think the very Sunne woes this ſeaſon, for I have obſerved that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he retires, he ſtill keeps cloſe to her. Thoſe inſolent Northern winds that braved us in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this god of tranquillity (ſurprized at his coming) unites himſelfe to his rayes, to obtaine his pardon by their careſſes, and thoſe that are greater offenders, hide themſelves in his atomes, and are quiet, for feare of being diſcovered: all things that are not hurtfull, enjoy a free life, nay our very ſoul wanders beyond their Confines, to ſhow ſhe is not under reſtraint. I think na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56652:14"/>
at a wedding, we ſee nothing but dances, feaſts, and balls; and he that ſhould ſeek a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, would not have the contentment to find one, unleſſe thoſe that ariſes amongſt the flowers contending for beauty, where 'tis poſſible you may ſee a bloudy Pink newly come from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, fall with wearineſſe; there a roſebud, ſweld by the ill ſucceſſe of his antagoniſt blowes for joy; there the Lillies, that colloſſe amongſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that curded Giant, proud to ſee his images triumph in the Lowre, raiſes himſelfe above his fellowes, looks down upon them, and makes the Violet proſtrate her ſelfe at his feet; which being jealous and angry, that ſhe cannot riſe to the ſame heighth doubles her ſweetneſſe, that our noſes may give her that precedency which our eyes denies her; there a bunch of time humbles it ſelf before the Tulip, becauſe ſhe beares a Chalice; in another place, the earth vext that the Trees carry the bloſſomes, and flowers, ſhe hath crowned them withall, ſo high and remote from her refuſes to give them any fruits till they have return'd him his flowers. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe for all theſe little diſputes and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, I do not finde the Spring leaſt pleaſant and agreeable. The jolly country-lad ſwears by godſnigs hee'l outſtrip his neighbours at the Maypole, The vine yard-keeper leaning on his bill ſmiles to ſee his vine weep.

               <p>WHat would you not ſay of the Sun, if he had ſpoyled your own fleſh, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him for having onely viſited your meat, he hath made a great pot of the whole earth and hath kindled fuell under it to make it boyle, he hath diſpoſed the Winds round about as Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to keep it from going out, yet when he lights your Kitchin fire, you take it in dudgion, he warmes the waters, he diſtils and rectifies them, leſt their crudities ſhould hurt you, and yet when he drinks your health you ſcold at him. For my part, I know not henceforward what poſture this poor god can put himſelf into, to pleaſe us: he ſends the Birds to give us good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, with their Muſick, he hath warm'd our bathes, and doth not invite us to them till he hath firſt plunged himſelf in, to ſee if there be any danger. What could he adde to all theſe honours, unleſſe to eat at our table? And judge you what he ſeeks when he is never neerer our houſes then at noon. After all this, Sir, do you complain that he dryes up the humours of our Rivers? alas, were it not for this attraction what would have become of us? The floods, the Lakes and the fountains have ſucked up all the water that made the earth fertile: and we are angry that to the hazard of giving the middle region the dropſie, hee undertakes to draine 'um, and walks the clouds thoſe great watring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots over us, with which he quenches the thirſt of our fields at a ſeaſon, in which he is ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56652:15"/>
much taken with our beauties, that he endevours to ſee us naked. I cannot imagine if hee did not attract a great quantity of warer to cool his raies, how he could kiſſe us without burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us: but whatſoever we pretend, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes water enough to ſpare, for when the Canicular by his heat, leaves us but preciſely enough for our neceſſities, hath he not taken care the Dogs ſhould run mad, for feare they ſhould drinke any from us? You likewiſe thunder againſt him for that he hath (you ſay) rob'd us of our very ſhadowes. He takes them from us, I grant you, but 'tis becauſe he ſees they take delight hourly to fright us: ſee how he climbs to the top of our Horizon to lay them at our feet, and to drive them underground from whence they came. Nevertheleſſe how much ſoever he hates them, and as neer as they are to their end, if we interpoſe he gives them their life: therefore theſe daughters of the night run about us to be protected from the armes of the Sun, well knowing that he'le rather leave the victory ungotten, then reſolve to kill them through our bodies. 'Tis not but that he is on fire for us all the year, and he ſhews it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſting neither night nor day, but in ſummer. Nevertheleſſe, his paſſion is quite another thing, he flames, he runs, and ſeems to deſcend from his circle, and indeavouring to hang about our neckes he goes ſo neer us, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the light eſſence of this god, the one halfe of mankind ſweat &amp; drop with carrying him: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe we are troubled when hee leaves us, the Night ſympathizing likewiſe with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion

becomes cleare &amp; hot; becauſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſodainely to return, the Sun left at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture upon the horizon part of his retinue. The month of May indeed makes the fruits ſprout &amp; knits them and makes them grow; but he leaves them a mortall ſharpneſſe that would choake us, if June did not ſweeten them. Some perhaps will object that by his exceſſive heat he makes aſhes of our hearbes, and afterwards poures upon them ſtormes of raine. But doe you not think he hath great reaſon (ſeeing us ſo tan'd) to buck us, and admit that he were ſo hot as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us, 'twould at leaſt be a bleſſed ſigne of our peace with God, ſince formerly with his people he ſent fire from heaven only on purified Victims. Beſides, if he intended to burn us, he would not ſend the Dew to cool and refreſh us, that bleſſed dew that makes us believe, by his infinite drops of light, that the torch of the world is in the duſt in our fields, that a million of little heavens, are fallen upon the earth, or that it is the ſoul of the Univerſe, that knowing not what honour to render to his father, goes out to meet &amp; receive him on the tops of odoriferous flowers. The Country-fellow he thinks they are ſilver-lice, falne from the Sun's head which he combs in the morning; another while, he believes he ſweat of the Aire corrupted by heat, hath bred theſe glittering wormes; or takes it for the ſpittle that falls from the planets mouths as they ſleep: To conclude, let it be what it will, it imports not. Were they amorous tears, her grief becomes her too well to afflict us: beſides, this is a time that Nature puts all her treaſures
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56652:16"/>
into our powers, The Sun in perſon waites on the beds of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and every Eare of Corne ſeems a bakehouſe of brittle and milky loaves which he hath taken the paines to bake. If any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines that his too long ſtay with us makes our leaves and fruits yellow, let them know, that this Monarque of the ſtarres does it to make our Climate the garden of the Heſperides, by giving golden leaves to the trees as well as golden fruits: notwithſtanding all this, 'tis to little purpoſe for him to heate himſelfe in his zodiak with the Lyon, he cannot ſtay four and twenty houres with the Virgin, but hee'l be inamoured, hee'l every day grow colder, and at laſt how ever he leaves the title of virgin to the poor maide, hee'l come out of her bed ſo enervated and weakned that ſix Months will hardly recover him of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. Oh how fearfull am I to ſee ſummer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe becauſe I apprehend his decreaſe! tis he that ſets at liberty the water, wood, metals, hearbs, and ſtones, that the froſt had made priſoners, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiſes the coldneſſe amongſt them and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles and mediates betwixt them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Priſoners, he conducts peaceably each to his owne home.

               <p>ME thinks now, I could with a great deal of pleaſure rail upon Autumn, if I feard not to incenſe the Thunder. He is not content to kill us, but is unſatisfied if he employ not 3 different executioners for one Death, and kill us at once, by the Eyes, the Eares, and the Touch, that is, by Lightning, Thunder, and the Bolt; the Lightning is kindled, to extinguiſh our ſight by too much light, and precipitating our lids on the apples of our Eyes, it paſſes us from two little nights, no bigger then a penny, into one as big as the Univerſe. The Aire, by its continuall agitation, inflames his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes. In what part ſoever we turne our ſight, a bloody Cloud ſeems to have drawn between us and the light, a darke gray Curtaine lin'd with red taffety. The Thunder, begotten in the Cloud burſts the belly of his mother, and the Cloud in hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is delivered with ſo much noiſe, that the moſt ſavage rocks are ſplit at the Cries of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. It ſhall not, though, be ſaid that this ſurlie ſeaſon ſpeaks to me ſuch high words that I dare not anſwer him; this inſolent, to whoſe ſinnes there onely wanted this to impute to the Creator the crimes of nature, but if the injuſtice of 100 thouſand Claps of thunder, were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Inſcrutable wiſdome of God, it followes not for all this that the thundring ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is the ſeaſon deſtinated to puniſh offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhould be more pleaſant, then the reſt, elſe you muſt conclude, that the ſweeteſt time of a Criminalls life, is that of his Execution. I think
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56652:17"/>
that from this fatal Meteor, we may come to the wine, ſince that is a liquid Thunder, a potable wrath, a death that kills drunkards with health. 'Tis he, the tyrant that is the Cauſe, the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rationale Animal</hi> given by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> of man, is falſe, at leaſt for them that drink too much. What think you, may one not ſay of a Taverne that 'tis a place where folly is ſold by the bottle? and I doubt the vapors are aſcended as high as the ſun, which may be the reaſon he goes to bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes ſo early. Some <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of our age have ſwallowed ſo much of it, that it made the Earth turne round under them, and if ſhe doth really move, I think they are reelings that drunkenneſs cauſes her to make. For my part, I am ſo great a hater of this poiſon, that although Aquavitae be the ſtronger venome of the two, yet I pardon him becauſe ſhe is a witneſſe to me that ſhe hath made him give up his ſpirit. Thus we are in this ſeaſon condemned to dye with thirſt; &amp; ſince our drink is poyſoned, let us ſee if the food wch ſhe ſpreads on the Earth as on a table, is leſſe dangerous then her drink. Alas for one fruit that Adam Eate, 100 thouſand perſons dyed that were not yet born, and Nature forces the Tree to begin the Execution of his owne Criminall children, he throwes them againſt the ground with their heads formoſt, the wind ſhakes and the Sun precipitates them. After this, Sir, you'l pardon me I hope, if I diſaprove that it ſhould be ſaid, here is good harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe fruit; how can he be ſo that hath hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? and if we conſider likewiſe how the ſtones fly at them, have we not cauſe to doubt of their innocence? doe you not ſee alſo that the trees in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56652:17"/>
producing their fruits are carefull to encompaſſe them with leaves to hide them; as if they wanted impudence to ſhow their ſhamefull or Privy parts; But conſider alſo, how this horrible ſeaſon uſes the trees at her farewel, ſhe lades them with wormes, ſpiders, and caterpillars; and although ſhe leaves them bald, yet ſhe fills their heads with vermine, call you theſe gifts of a good Mother to her Children? and doth ſhe deſe ve we ſhould thank her when ſhe hath taken away from us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all our ſuſtenance? But her malice extends yet further, for ſhe attempts to poiſon thoſe, that are not dead with hunger, I ſpeak nothing but what ile prove. Is it not true, that of all the things which are neceſſary for our uſe, none of them are remained pure but the aire: this ſtep-Mother hath choakt it with contagion. See you not how ſhe carries the plague a long with her, this diſeaſe without a taile, at whoſe taile death hangs, in moſt of the Cityes of the kingdome, how ſhe over throwes the Oeconomy of the Univerſe, the Society of men, covering with Purples miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretches on a dunghill; &amp; judge you if the fire ſhe hath kindled againſt us be vehement, when one cole of it is ſufficient to conſume a man.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sir are the Treaſures and Benefits of this adorable ſeaſon, by which you thought to have found the ſecret of the Cornucopia. To ſay truth, doth ſhee not rather deſerve Satyrs than Elogies? and ought we not almoſt to hate the other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe they are in her Company, and do follow, and go before her? For my part, I do not doubt but one day this wicked one, wil corrupt all her Companions: And indeed we already ſee that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56652:18"/>
after his example, they have their particular waies of maiming us, and for the miſeries they bring upon us, Winter makes us implore St. <hi>John,</hi> the ſpring St. <hi>Mathurin,</hi> the Summer St. <hi>Hubert,</hi> and Autumne St. <hi>Poch,</hi> for my part I know not what hinders me from procuring my own death, for vexation that I cannot live but under their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but chiefly for that this accurſed Autumne goes over my head every year to make me mad, She indeavours I think to engage her Siſters in her crimes. For to conclude Sir, big with thunders as we ſee him; would ſhe not perſwade us to believe, that they altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a monſter that barks with the feet, ſhe for her part is a ravenous Harpuy that carries Ice in her mouth and fire in her taile; who ſaves her ſelf from an embracement, by a deluge, and at fourſcore dayes old is ſo paſſionately in love with Winter, for killing us, that ſhe dies in his imbraces; but that which ſeemes to me moſt of all ſtrange, is, that I have not all this while taxt him with his greateſt crime; I mean the bloud that for many yeares he hath covered the face of <hi>Europe</hi> withall. I ought to have done it to puniſh him for that having been prodigall of his fruits to every body elſe, he has not as yet given me one, that can ſay to you after my death I am,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> Stand, ſtand! My head is the point of a River, I am under, at the very fadome without ſwimming, and yet I fetch my breath at eaſe, you may well judge that 'tis of <hi>Arcueil</hi> that I write you. The water here led in triumph marches in files by a regiment of ſtones; they have rear'd a hundred Portalls to receive her; and the King thinking that ſhe was weary with comming on foot ſo farre, cauſed her to be uſher'd leſt ſhe ſhould fall. Theſe extreame honours hath made her ſo proud, that ſhe would not goe to <hi>Paris,</hi> if they did not carry her thither; Having got cold with lying ſo long upon the ground, ſhe hath raiſed her ſelf a higher bed, and 'tis held by tradition that this Aquaeduct ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo fair and ſtately to her, that ſhe came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her ſelfe to walke for recreation: in the mean time ſhe's ſhut in with foure walls. Is it perhaps that ſhe hath been convicted of having
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56652:19"/>
formerly been in the Sea's company, in ſome ſhipwrack? It muſt be ſo, for here Juſtice is ſo ſevere, that the very Fountains are made to walke up right and ſtrait, and the aire of the Citty is ſo contagious, that ſhe cannot come neer it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out getting the Stone. Notwithſtanding theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles ſhe hath ſuch an itch to ſee it, that ſhe rubbs her ſelfe for halfe a mile together againſt the Rocks, ſhe thinks long till ſhe counterfeits <hi>Hippocrene</hi> among the Muſes of the Univerſity. She cannot hold her water, for longing to ſee how from the mountaines of <hi>Rongy</hi> in the aire, ſhe piſſes to the ſuburbs of St. <hi>Germain;</hi> ſhe receives order from his Highneſſe Royall of what viſits ſhe is to make: And for all the private threats that ſhe murmurs out by the way: how formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever ſhe appeares, <hi>Luxembourgh</hi> hath no ſooner ſpied her, but with one look only ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes her on every ſide. Could Love indeed joyn <hi>Arcueil</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> by a ſtronger bond then that of life? This Reptile is a bit for the Kings mouth: 'Tis a great ſword that makes the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers put on their belt, 'tis an immortall Snake, that ſhrinkes into her skin, ſtill as ſhe comes out on't: 'tis an Artificiall impoſtume that cannot be broake without indangering <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>'s life, 'tis a Pye whoſe ſauce has life: 'tis a Bone whoſe marrow walks; 'tis a liquid Serpent whoſe tail goes before his head: In fine, I think ſhe is reſolved to do nothing here but things that are impoſſible to be believed: She goes ſtrait becauſe ſhee's arched and bent: She corrupts not although ſhe be in the grave; ſhee's alive under ground: She goes on the top of thoſe valleys
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56652:19"/>
whoſe doores are open; ſhe hits her way in the darke, and runs withall her force without falling.

               <p>A Miracle, a Miracle! I am at the bottom of the water and yet cannot find drink; I have a whole River upon my head, and yet I have not loſt my footing: In fine, I find my ſelf in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where fountaines flye, and where Rivers are ſo dainty that they go over bridges for fear of wetting themſelves: 'Tis no Hyperbole, for if you conſider the great Arches upon which ſhe marches in triumph, you would think that ſhee's got upon Scaffolds to ſee the further, and take notice in what places in <hi>Paris</hi> ſhe's moſt needfull; they are like ſo many Bowes from which ſhe lets flye a thouſand ſilver liquid ſhafts againſt thirſt. But Now, ſhe was bare brich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ground; And at preſent there ſhe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56652:20"/>
walkes upon ſtately Galleries, ſhe carries her head even as high as the Mountains; And do not believe that her ſtature is the worſe becauſe ſhe is vaulted; I know not whether our Citizens take this Arch for the Arck of the Covenant, But I am ſure were it not for hir, they'd be all faine to make their laſt. She in favour of them enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon Natures ſtrength, ſhe doth things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them, and runns two leagues together with dead leggs, that ſhe cannot ſtirre; to ſee her ſpurt up as ſhe doth, one would think that after a long conteſt with the Globe of the earth that lay heavy upon her, finding her ſelfe eaſed of a ſuddain, ſhe cannot contain her ſelfe and continues in the aire whether ſhe will or no, by the ſwing that ſhe gave; But what's the reaſon that at <hi>Rongy</hi> where ſhee's onely troubled with a little gravell in her reines, ſhe Urines but by drops, and that in <hi>Arcueil,</hi> where ſhe is troubled with the ſtone, ſhe piſſes over mountaines. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this is nothing, ſhe doth otherguiſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cls; ſhe continually glides out of her skin, yet can never get quite out of it; &amp; more learn'd then the Doctors of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s profeſſion, ſhe cures with a look only, every day at <hi>Paris</hi> above four hundred thouſand thirſts. She growes cold with running, ſhe buries her ſelfe alive, in a Tombe that ſhe may live the longer; Is it not her beauty that obliges her to hide her ſelfe from the ſunne for fear of being ſtolen away; or that having found her ſelfe courted in the Country, ſhee's grown ſo proud, that ſhe will not goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe be carried. I know that ſhe cannot be taxed of having too much vent, running as ſhe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56652:20"/>
doth in a ſtone pitcher (where ſo much as a ray of light cannot get in) yet I queſtion her wiſdom, in going over the tops of doors that are open: But perhaps I blame her wrongfully, for I ſpeak of this piece of Architecture, without underſtanding truly what it is, 'tis perhaps a petrified Cloud, a great Bone whoſe Marrow runs, a ſolid rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, that piſſes water in <hi>Arcucil</hi> to powre it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Citty, A paſte for Fiſhes that hath too much ſauce, a Nayade in lead that hath the fluxe, An Apothecary that gives the Univerſity gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: In fine, the mother-Nurſe of a whole Citty, the Cocks being the teates that ſhe gives us ſuck by: ſince then ſo long an Impriſonment hath ſo diſguiſed her that we cannot know her, let us goe a little neerer, and view her as ſhe comes out of her mothers belly; good gods! how ſweet ſhe is, how freſh a complexion, and how ſmooth a face ſhe hath: I hear her pratling with the gravell, and ſeemes by her pretty liſping deſirous to learn the language of the Country: look neerer do you not ſee heroft ſtreacht at her whole length in this marble Baſon; ſhe repoſes, and yet ſwells under the drops of her ſource, as if ſhe indevoured to ſuck her Nurce's breaſt as ſhe ſleeps: you'l not find in her ſo much as one fiſh; for the pretty little one is too young yet to have Children; 'tis not however for want of knowledge, for with her birth ſhe receaved a naturall light of good and evill; and to make it appeare to you, none never comes neere her, but ſhe preſently ſhewes them plainly their deformities, or their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. At her Age however, becauſe her features are yet ſhapeleſſe, 'tis hard to diſcernwhether it be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56652:21"/>
not a light of four foot ſquare, or an eye of the earth that weeps. No 'tis not, I am deceived, ſhe is too lively to reſemble things that are dead 'Tis doubtleſſe the Queen of the fountaines of this Country, and her royall mind may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by her extraordinary liberality. For ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receives a viſit from any Ladies but ſhe makes them a preſent of their picture; and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſhe hath received from heaven the gift of miracles: 'tis not a thing that I invent to make out her Panegy ricke; come neer to her ſide, and you'l ſee, that, like that ſacred fountaine which deified them that bathed, ſhe makes bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubſtance, plunges them into the water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wetting them, and ſhewes us men that live with her without the uſe of reſpiration: and yet theſe are things ſhe doth when ſhe ſleeps; &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath ſhe reſted ſo long as while you may goe four ſteps, but ſhe quits her Inne, and ſtayes not till ſhe hath received a favourable look from <hi>Paris:</hi> her firſt viſit is to <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> ſhee's no ſooner arrived there, but ſhe caſts her ſelf at his Highneſſe Royal's feet, and ſeems by her mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring to ask of him in the River's Language what houſes ſhe muſt go to. Shee's come hither in ſuch haſte, that ſhee's all of a water, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not had the time to light by the way, ſhe is forced to piſſe in the Baſon before every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at the Palace of <hi>Orleans.</hi> In the mean time, 'tis to little purpoſe that ſhe quarrels with our ſpouts, and ſheds torrents of teares to move us to pitty her toyl. Ingratitude is ſo prodigiouſly great now a dayes, that the thirſty ones make mouths at her, aboundance of Rogues pumpe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56652:21"/>
her; and every one is glad to ſee her bepiſſe her ſelf. One cries that ſhe is very unmannerly to make ſuch haſte to come and lodge with the Citizens to piſſe in their mouths: others, That ſhe had need walke with ſo much ſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to come and make nothing but fair water at <hi>Paris:</hi> others, That her impudence is very great to ſtretch out her necke at ſuch a length, only to ſpit in our faces: ſome others ſay, That ſhe is very ſick, that ſhe cannot hold her water: In fine, not ſo much as thoſe that ſeem to kiſſe her but grind their teeth at her. For my part, I waſh my hands, for I have many examples before my eyes, of the puniſhments of Drunkards that ſlight her. Nature her ſelfe, that is Mother of this faire Nymph, it ſeems, fearing that any thing ſhould be wanting in the ſtate of her reception, gave mankind Palaces to receive her in: but this fair one doth not abuſe the honours that are done her; contrarywayes hardly is ſhe got to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> but finding her ſelfe at the extreamity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her too long Journey, and foreſeeing her end drawes neer, ſhe runs to St. <hi>Coſme,</hi> St. <hi>Benoiſt</hi> and St. <hi>Severin,</hi> to obtaine their Benediction. This is all I can ſay in praiſe of that ſtately Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and of her Hoſpital.

               <p>LYing on my belly upon the green banck of a river, and my back ſtrecht, under the branches of a Willow that views himſelfe in it, I ſee the hiſtory of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> renued in the trees, a hundred poplars tumble a hundred other poplars into the ſtream, and theſe Aquatiques were ſo frighted at the fall, that they tremble ſtill every day for feare of a wind that touches them not. I imagine, that night having made all things black, the Sun plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in the river to waſh them. But what ſhall I ſay of this liquid Glaſſe, this little world turn'd topſie-turvy, that places the Oakes under the moſſe, and the heavens lower then the Oaks? Are they not of thoſe virgins formerly Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſ'd into Trees, that ſtill finding their Chaſtity violated by the kiſſes of <hi>Apollo,</hi> deſperatly caſt themſelves into the floud with their head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; Or is it not <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe, who, offended that they durſt keep the aire from him, hath thus hanged them by the feet. Now the fiſh walke in the woods, and whole forreſts in the midſt of the water without wetting themſelves: there's an old Elme amongſt the reſt, would make you laugh, which doth almoſt loll on the other ſide, to the end that his Image taking the ſame poſture, he might make of his body and his ſhaddow an Angle for the fiſh: the river is not ingratefull to the willowes for their viſites; ſhe hath made the univerſe bor'd through tranſparent, leſt the down of her head, ſhould foule their branches;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56652:22"/>
and not content to have made cryſtall with mud, ſhe hath vaulted the heavens &amp; the Planets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, that it might not be ſaid, that thoſe that viſited her, were deprived of the light which they forſook for her. Now we may look downe on the heavens, and by her the light may brag, that as weak as ſhe is at four in the morning, he has the power to precipitate the heavens into the Deep: Butadmire the power that the lower region of the ſoul exerciſes upon the higher. After having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that all theſe wonders are but deluſions of the ſenſe, I cannot for all hinder my ſight, from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Imaginary Firmament for a great Laque, on which the Earth floates. The Nightingale who from the top of a bough ſees himſelfe in it, believes he's fallen into the river; he is on the top of an Oake and yet is afraid of being drowned, but after having freed himſelfe by his eyes and his feet, from feare; his picture then ſeeming a Rivall, come to combate, he chatters, and warbles, and that other Nightingale to his thinking, ſilently does the ſame, and coſen the Soul with ſo many Charms, that one would fancy he ſung purpoſely to be heard by our eyes, I think he by motion chatters and ſends no ſound at all to the ear, that he may at the ſame time anſwer his enemy, and that he may not infringe the lawes of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he inhabites, whoſe people are dumb: the Pearch, the Trout, and the Goldenie, that ſee him, know not whether it be a fiſh cloathed with feathers, or a bird deveſted of his body; they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about him, and look on him as a Monſter; and the Pike, the Tyrant of Rivers, jealous to ſee a ſtranger in his Throne, ſeeks him; when he hath

found him, touches him and yet cannot feel him, runs after him when he's upon him, and wonders that he hath ſo often paſſed by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing him any hurt. I my ſelfe remaine ſo much amazed that I am forc't to quit this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I beſeech you ſuſpend his Condemnation, ſince 'tis difficult to judge of a ſhaddow: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my Enthuſiaſms ſhould have the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be very cleer, yet 'tis not impoſſible that the light of this may be dull, having been taken in the ſhade. Beſides, what more can I add to the deſcription of this illuminated Image, unleſſe that it is a viſible Nothing, a ſpirituall Camelion, a darkneſſe that the night kills, a debate betwixt our reaſon and our Eyes, a privation of light, that the light produces: In ſine, that 'tis a ſlave that is no more wanting of maſter then the end of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of,</p>

His colour, and forme, makes me think of a Lizard turn'd upſide downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which ſtings the heavens at the ſame time he bites the Earth; If there be among trees as among men diverſity of trades, ſeeing this ladder with awles inſtead of leaves makes me believe heis the Trees ſhoo-maker. I hardly dare bring my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination neer his prickly niedles for fear of being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56652:23"/>
provok't to ſay too much; of 10 thouſand lances he makes but one, without joyning them: one would think it a ſhaft that the univerſe in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on darts at heaven, or a great naile with which nature faſtens the empire of the living to that of the dead: this Obelisk, this Dragon-tree, whoſe taile is at his head, ſeems to me a more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Piramid then that of <hi>Mauſolus:</hi> for inſtead of carrying the dead Corps, as they did, into that; this is carried to the buriall of the dead. But I prophane the Adventure of young <hi>Cypariſſus</hi> the beloved of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to make him act the perſons of thoſe monuments, unworthy and below him. This poore Metamorphoſis ſtill remembers the Sun, he burſts his Sepulchre, and riſing, whets himſelfe, that he may pierce the heavens, and the ſooner arive at his beloved: he would have bin there before this, but that the earth his Mother holds him by the foot. <hi>Phobus,</hi> to make him grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, makes him one of his vegetals, to whom all the ſeaſons beare reſpect: the heats of the ſummer dare not hurt him, he being their Maſter's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the winter froſts feare him as a thing the moſt fatal in the world, ſo that were it not for Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heads of Conquerours or Lovers, he is no more obliged to uncoife, than the Laurell or the Myrtle at the yeare's farewell. The Antients who knowing this Tree to be the ſoul of the <hi>Parks</hi> brought it to the funeralls, to awe death with the feare of loſing her houſehold-ſtuffe. This is all I can ſay to you of the body &amp; branches of this tree.

Thus I force the <hi>Cypreſſe,</hi> that fatal tree, that delights it ſelf onely in ſhady groves, to repreſent fire; for 'tis but reaſonable, that he ſhould be once a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of good, and that by him I may daily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when I ſee him, that furniſhing me with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Letter, he was the cauſe that I had the honour, ending, to write my ſelf,</p>

the honour of a defeat, where our lives are to be the ſpoiles; ſhe is ſometimes ſo bold, to daube the Azure of the firmament with her foame, and to carry us ſo high amongſt the ſtarres, that <hi>Jaſon</hi> may perhaps think, that 'tis the Ship <hi>Argo</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a ſecond voyage: then darting of us to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſand of her bed we rebound to the light in ſo quick an inſtant, that there is none of us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves when our ſhip is got up again, that ſhe hath paſt through the whole maſſe of the world, and is got on the Sea at th' other ſide: alaſs where are we!

But whatever be the falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this hundred-headed-monſter, permit me to ſpeak of your divine Haire like a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Glorious fruit of the eſſence of the moſt beautifull viſible Beeing! intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reflection of the radicall fire of nature! I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Sun, the moſt perfect! I am not ſo brutiſh as to miſtake for my Queen, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him that my Anceſtors acknowledged for their god. <hi>Athens</hi> bemoaned the fall of her Crown, in the ruine of <hi>Apollo's</hi> temp's. <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſed to command the world, when ſhe denyed incenſe to the light: and <hi>Bizantium</hi> firſt began to inſlave mankind, when ſhe tooke for her Arms thoſe of the Sun's Siſter: As long as <hi>Perſia</hi> did homage to this univerſall ſpirit, for the rayes that ſhe held from him, 4 thouſand yeares could not make old the vigor of her Monarchy; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to ſee his Images broken, he took ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in <hi>Pequin</hi> from the abuſes of <hi>Babylon.</hi> At preſent, the Sun's unwilling to warme other lands then that of <hi>China;</hi> and I fear one day hee'l fix himſelf on their Hemiſphere, if he can, &amp; not coming to us, give them the four ſeaſons. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, Madam, <hi>France,</hi> by the power that your face gives her, is as able as was <hi>Joſhua,</hi> to chain him up, your triumphs like to the victories of this Hero's;

are too glorious to be hid in darkneſs; hee'l ſooner breake his promiſe with mankind then not ſo place himſelfe, as he may alwayes at eaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the worke, of his works the moſt perfect: ſee how by his love the laſt Summer he warmed the Signes with a heat ſo long and vehement, that he had almoſt burnt the one halfe of his houſes; and without conſulting the Almanacke, we could never diſtinguiſh the Winter from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn by reaſon of his gentleneſſe, becauſe that beng impatient to ſee you he could not reſolve to continue his voyage ſo farre as the Tropick. Do not think that this diſcourſe is an Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole; if heretofore <hi>Clymene</hi>'s beauty made him come down from heaven, the beauty of <hi>M.</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable enough to make him goe out of his way. The equality of your ages, the conformity of your bodies, the reſemblance perhaps of your humours, may well kindle in him that noble fire; but if you are daughter of the Sun, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Alexis,</hi> I am to blame to ſay your father is in love with you: he loves you indeed and the paſſion that diſquiets him, is the flame which made him lament the miſfortune of his <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and his Siſters, not that which made him ſhed teares at the deceaſe of his <hi>Daphne.</hi> This fire that he burnes with, for you, is that with which he formerly burned the whole world, not that flame with which he himſelf was burnt; he dayly beholds you with tenderneſs &amp; tremblings, which brings to his memory the dyſaſter of his Eldeſt Sonne; he ſees none on earth but you in which he knowes himſelfe; if he viewes you wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Behold, ſayes he, the generous confidence,

with which I came to encounter the Serpent <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon;</hi> if he hears you diſcourſing of ſome delicate matters, Thus, ſaith he, I ſpeak upon <hi>Parnaſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

In fine, this good father knowes not, in what manner to expreſſe that joy which tranſports him, when he imagines that he begot you: He is young, as you; you are fair, like him; his temperature and yours is all of fire; he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes life and death to mankind, and your eyes do the ſame things as his; you have red hair like him. I was juſt here in my letter, adorable <hi>M.</hi> when a cenſorious perſon, contrary to reaſon, ſnatch'd away my pen, and told me, That I had undertaken amiſſe in my Panegyrick, to extoll a young perſon for beauty, becauſe ſhe was red-hair'd. I not knowing how more ſenſibly to puniſh this proud thing, then by ſilence, took another pen, and went on thus.</p>
               <p>A brave head, covered with red hair, is nothing elſe, but the Sun in the midſt of his rayes; or the Sun himſelf is onely a great eye, under a red Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig; yet all the world ſpeaks ill of it, becauſe few have the honour to be ſo. And among a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ladies, you ſhall hardly find one, becauſe they being ſent from heaven to command, it's neceſſary, there ſhould be more ſubjects then Soveraigns. Do we not ſee, that all things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are more or leſſe noble, according as they are more or leſſe red; amongſt the Elements, he that contains the moſt eſſence, and the leaſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubſtance, is the Fire, becauſe of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; Gold hath received of his dye, the honour to reign over the Mettalls; and of all the Planers, the Sun is moſt conſiderable, onely becauſe he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56652:27"/>
is moſt red; the hairy Comets that flie up and down the skies, at the death of Heroes, are they not the red muſtachoes of the gods, that they pluck off for griefe? <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fires, that make ſeamen foretell the end of a ſtorm, can they be any thing elſe, then the red hairs of <hi>Juno,</hi> which ſhe, in token of love, ſends to <hi>Neptune?</hi> In fine, had it not been for the deſire men had, to poſſeſſe the fleece of a red ſheep, the glory of thirty demy-gods would be in the cradle of thoſe things, that never were born. And (a ſhip being yet but a reaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention) <hi>Americus</hi> would not have told us, that the world hath 4 parts. <hi>Apollo, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> the faireſt divinityes of the Pantheon, are crimſon red; and <hi>Jupiter</hi> is brown but by accident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſmoak of his thunder, which hath blackt him. But if the examples of Mythologie do not ſatisfie the obſtinate, let them conſult Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> whoſe ſtrength hung at his locks, did he not receive his miraculous energy from the redneſſe of his hair? Did not the deſtinies make the conſervation of the Empire of <hi>Athens</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon one red hair of <hi>Niſus?</hi> And God, would he not have ſent the light of Faith to the Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if he could have found amongſt them but one red? One would not doubt of the excellency of thoſe perſons, if one conſidered, that all men that were not made by men, and for whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming God himſelf choſe and kneaded the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, were red. <hi>Adam,</hi> that was created by Gods own hand, ought to be the moſt accompliſht of men, he was red. And all perfect Philoſophy ought to teach us, that Nature, which inclines to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56652:27"/>
the moſt perfection, alwaies endeavours in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a man, to make a red one, juſt as ſhe aſpires to make Gold, by making of Mercury, but that ſhe ſeldom hits upon it. An Archer is not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unskilfull, who letting thirty arrowes flie, but five or ſix hits the mark. As the beſt ballanced Conſtitution is that, which is between flegmatick and melancholly, one muſt needs be very happy, to hit exactly an indiviſible point. The flaxen and the black are beſides it, that is to ſay, the fickle and the obſtinate; between both is the medium, where wiſdom, in favour of red men, hath lodged vertue, ſo their fleſh is much more delicate, their blood more pure, their ſpirits more clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſequently, their intellect more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, becauſe of the perfect mixture of the 4 qualities. This is the reaſon, why red men become not ſo ſoon grey, as thoſe that are black, as if Nature were angry and unwilling to deſtroy that, which ſhe took a pleaſure in making. In troth, I ſeldom ſee a flaxen head of hair, but I think of a diſtaff ill periwig'd. But I grant, that fair women, when they are young, are pleaſing; but as ſoon as their cheeks begin to grow woolly, would one not think, that their fleſh divides it ſelf into little threads, to make them a beard. I ſpeak not of black beards, for 'tis well known, if the devill weare any, it cannot be but very dark. Since then we muſt all become ſlaves to beauty, is it not far better to be deprived of our freedom by golden chains, then by hempen cords, or iron fetters? For my part, all that I deſire, O my fair <hi>M.</hi> is, that walking of my liberty up and down thoſe golden Labyrinths, that ſerve you for hair,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56652:28"/>
I may ſoon loſe it, and all that I wiſh for is when I have once loſt it, never to Recover it againe, would you but promiſe memy life ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed my ſervitude, and that you would not be angry that till death I ſtyle my ſelf.</p>

my part I believe that 'tis quite loſt in your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: without doubt you have quite forgotten it. But in troth, doth there yet remaine in your Memory any darke Idea of this inchanted Palace, from which you have baniſht your ſelfe? Ah I ſee there doth not, I muſt ſend you a drauft of it in my Letter. Harken to it then, this is it; for 'tis a Picture that ſpeakes. Oh! at the doore of the houſe you meet a ſtarre with five acceſſes or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; the Oakes that compoſe it makes one, with extaſie, admire the exceſſive height of their tops, raiſing ones eyes from the Root to the Culmen; then precipitating them down againe. One doubts whether the earth beares them, and whether or no they carry not the Earth at their roots: you would think that their proud heads are forced to bend under the weight of the Heavenly globes, which burthen they with groaning ſupport; their armes, ſtrecht toward heaven, embracing it, ſeemes to beg of the ſtarrs their Influences altogether pure, and to receive them before they have at all loſt of their innocence: In the bead of the elements, there on every ſide the flowers, having had no other Gardener but nature vent a ſharp breath that quickens and ſatisfies the ſmell. The ſweet innocence of a Roſe on the Eglantine, and the glorious Azure of a violet under the ſweet briars, leaving us not the liberty of choice, makes us judge that they are both one fairer then the other. The ſpring there compoſes all the ſeaſons, there no venomous plant buds, but her birth ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes her ſafety, there the brooks Relate their travells to the pibbles, there a thouſand feather'd voyces makes the forreſt Ring with the muſick of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56652:29"/>
their ſongs, and the ſprightfull aſſembling of theſe Melodious throats is ſo generall, that every leafe in the wood ſeemes to have taken the ſhape and the tongue of a Nighringale, ſometimes you ſhall heare'em merrily tickle a Conſort, another while thay'le drag, and make their Muſick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; by and by thaile paſſionate an elegie by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſobbs; and then againe ſoften the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their voyces, more tenderly to excite Pitty, and at laſt raiſe their harmony; and what with their Crotchtts and Warbling, ſend forth their lives and their voyces together. Echo is ſo delighted with it, that ſhe ſeemes to repeat their aires onely that ſhe may learne them; and the Rivolets jealous of their Muſique, as they fly away grumble, much troubled that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not equall them. On the ſide of the Caſtle two walkes diſcover themſelves whoſe continued green frames an Emeraud too big for the fight: the confuſed Mixture of colours that the Spring faſtens to a million of flowers ſcatters the changes of one another; and their tincture is ſo pure that one may well judge that they get ſo cloſe one to another, onely to eſcape the amorous kiſſes of the wind that courts them. One would now take this meddow for a very Calme ſea; but when the leaſt <hi>Zephyrus</hi> comes to wanton there, 'tis then a proud Ocean full of waves, whoſe face furrowed with frownes, threatens to ſwollow up thoſe little fooles: but becauſe this ſea diſcovers no ſhoare, the Eye as afrighted to have run ſo long without finding any coaſt, quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches the thought, and the thought being doubtfull too that that which is the end of his

In the midſt of this, ſo vaſt and yet ſo perfect Carpet, runnes in with ſilver bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and ſtreams a ruſtick fountaine, who fees the Pillowes of his head enameled with Jeſſemines, Orange trees, and Mirtles, and the little flowers that throng round about, would make one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they diſpute who ſhall view himſelfe in the ſtreame firſt, ſeeing her face ſo young and ſmooth as 'tis, which diſcovers not the leaſt wrinckle, tis eaſie to judge ſhe is yet in her mothers Breaſt, and thoſe great Circles with which ſhe binds and twines her ſelfe by reverting ſo often upon her ſelfe, witneſſe that, 'tis to her griefe and againſt her will, that ſhe finds her ſelfe obliged to go from her native home: but above all things I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire her modeſty, when I ſee her (as aſhamed to be courted ſo neere her mother) murmure and thruſt back the bold hand that touches her. The Traveller that comes hither to refreſh himſelfe hanging his head over the water, wonders 'tis broad day in his Horiſon when he ſees the funne in the Antipodes, and never hangs over the bank but hees affraied to fall into the firmament, I could be content to be carried with this fountain into the belly of that pool that devours it; but 'tis ſo vaſte and profound, that I doubt whether my Imagination could ſave it ſelf by ſwimming.

               <p>SInce I had the honour to ſee you, there is ſo ſtrange an adventure arriv'd me, that to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny credit to it, you muſt have much more faith then that Perſon, who, by the ſtrength of his, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Mountaines. To begin then my ſtory, you muſt know that yeſterday being on my bead weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with giving attention to that fooliſh book that you heretofore ſo commended, I went forth a walking to diſſipate the vaine and ridiculous Imaginations, which the dark gibbriſh Gallimatias of the Sciences had filld me withal: &amp; as I labour'd to free my thoughts from the memory of thoſe obſcure tales, being got farre into your little wood, after a quarter of an houres walke, as I thought, I perceived a broom ſtaffe that came and thruſt it ſelfe between my leggs, and made me, in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56652:30"/>
ſpight of my teeth beſtride him, and preſently I felt my ſelfe fly through the empty aire; and now without remembring the place where I was taken up, I find my ſelfe upon my feet in the midſt of a deſart, where I can find no Path. I returned upon my footſteps, but this ſolitude was a new world to me, I reſolv'd to diſcover further, but (not ſeeeing at all any obſtacle) t'was in vaine to ſtrive againſt the aire; my efforts made me onely find an Impoſſibility of getting forwards, at laſt much wearied I fall on my knees, and that which did further occaſion my wonderment, was, that in a moment noon was turn'd to mid-night, I ſaw the ſtarres ſhine in the firmament with a bleuiſh fire: the Moon was in her full, but much paler then ordinary, ſhe was thrice ecliſpt and thrice went below her Circle; the winds were Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the fountains were mute, the birds had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their Chatterings, the fiſhes thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves encompaſt in glaſſe, all Creatures had no more Motion then was neceſſary for them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their feare by. The horror of an aſtoniſhing ſilence, that govern'd in all places, made Nature ſeeme to be in ſuſpence of ſome terrible accident, my fear began to be as great as that which the face of the Horizon appeared troubled withall, when, by Moon-light I ſaw coming out of a vaſt Grot, a tall and venerable old man, cloathed in white, with a ſwarthy face, his Eye-browes thick and long, a wall and frightfull Eye, his beard throwne over his ſhoulder, on his head he had a hat of verveine, and about him a girdle of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearne woven in treſſes, upon his gowne neere his heart was faſtned a Bat halfe dead, and about his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56652:31"/>
neck he wore a collar ſet with ſeven ſeverall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones; each of which wore the Character of that Planet that govern'd them. Thus Myſtcally dreſt and carying in his left hand a triangular Vial full of dew, and with his right a ſappy Elder Rod, one end of which being well tipt with a mixture of all mettalls, the other ſerved as a Handle to a little Cenſer; he kiſt the flore of his Grot, and after having pulled off his ſhoes, he grumbling, brought out certaine words, from the bottome of his ſtomack, he went backward under an old Oake, foure foot from which he drew three Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles one within another, and the earth Obedient to the commands of this Nigromancer trembling put her ſelfe into thoſe figures which he intended to have made in her: he wrote in it the names of the Intelligences, as well of the age, as of the yeare, the ſeaſon of the months, of the weekes the dayes, and hours, in their different characters each in their proper place, and centre, every one of them with their particular Ceremonies. This finiſht, he put his glaſſe in the midſt of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, opened it, put the ſmall ſharpe end of his Rod between his teeth, lay downe with his face turn'd to the Eaſt, and fell a ſleepe. About the midſt of his ſleepe, I ſaw five fearne ſeeds fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the viall, which when he waked he took out and put one in each eare, another in his mouth the forth he put againe into the glaſſe, and the fifth he threw out of the Circles; but hardly was it out of his hand when I ſaw it encompaſſt by a Million of <hi>Male-ominous</hi> creatures, as well Inſects as others; he toucht with his rod an Owle, a Fox, and a Mouſe, which inſtantly came into the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56652:31"/>
Circles, making a frightfull noiſe; with a braſſe knife he ript open their ſtomacks, and took out their hearts, which he wrapt up in three Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, and ſwallowed them; he took away the liver, which he ſqueezed into a hexagonall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: This ended, he reiterated the ſuffumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he mixt the dew and the blood together in a baſon, dipt in it a glove of virgin-parchment, which he put on his right hand; and after four or five horrible houlings, he cloſed his eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Invocations.</p>
               <p>He did hardly ſtirr his lips, nevertheleſſe I heard in his throat a humming, as of many voices mixt together: He was raiſed from the ground about a palm, and ever now and then he would fix his eyes upon the nail of his left fore-finger; his face was much inflamed, and he more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted. After many gaſtfull contortions, groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he fell on his knees; but no ſooner had he pronounc'd three words of a certain prayer, but he became more ſtrong then a man, and without wagging, ſtood the monſtrous ſhock of a moſt horrible wind, that blowed againſt him, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſudden blaſts, and ſometimes like a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; this wind ſeem'd to endeavour, to make him go out of the Circles. After this, the three Circles went round under him, there followed a ſtorm of hail as red as blood, and this gave place to a fourth much more terrible; 'twas a torrent of fire, that cracked as it turned round, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelf into globes, each of which burſt in pieces, with great claps of thunder.</p>

This was the laſt; for a fair light, white and clear, diſſipated theſe ſad Meteors. In the very midſt appeared a young man, his right leg was on an Eagle, and the other on a Lynx, who gave to the Magitian three Vialls, full of I know not what liquor. The Magitian preſented him with three hairs, one pluck'd from his forehead, the other two from his temples. He was ſtruck on the ſhoulder with a little wand that this ſpirit held, and then every thing vaniſht. This was, when the Stars, grown pale by the arrivall of the Sun, joyn'd colour with the Heavens. I was juſt going to ſeek out my village, but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian having ſpied mee, drew neer to the place where I was; although he walk'd very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet he was got to me before I ſaw him wag; he laid ſo cold a hand upon mine, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num'd a great while after; he neither opened his eyes, nor his mouth: And in this deep ſilence, he led mee over ſome fields, under the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ruines of an old uninhabited Caſtle, where the Ages for this thouſand years, have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to carry the Chambers into the Cellars. As ſoon as we were got in, Boaſt thy ſelf, ſaid he, (turning himſelf to me) to have ſeen face to face the Sorcerer <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whoſe ſoul by <hi>Metem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſychoſis,</hi> heretofore inſpired the learned <hi>Zoroaſtres,</hi> King of the <hi>Bactrians:</hi> Since (almoſt an Age) Ivaniſh'd from amongſt men, I have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved my ſelf with <hi>Aurum Potabile</hi> in health, that no diſeaſe ever yet diſturb'd me. Every twenty years I ſwallow a quantity of that univerſall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which renewes my youth, &amp; reſtores to my body the forces it hath loſt.

the three Vialls that were preſented me by the King of the fiery Daemons. The firſt of them is full of it, the ſecond of powder of projection, and the third of oyle of bones: In fine, thou art much obliged to me, ſince I have made choice of thee, from amongſt all mortall men, to aſſiſt in theſe myſteries, which I celebrate but once in 20 years. 'Tis (by my Charms) in my Power at my pleaſure, to render a Country fruitful or barren, I ſtirr up warres by breeding diſſention among thoſe Genius's that governe Kings, I teach the ſhepherd the woolfs Pater-noſter, and to the Cunning men how to turne the ſieve; I ſend St. <hi>Hermes</hi> fire (Jack in a lanthorn) to the Marches and Rivers to drown travellers, I make the Fairies to dance by moon-light, I encourage the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to look under the Gallouſe for the foure of clubs. I ſend at midnight the ghoſts out of the Church-yard, wrapt in a ſheet, to demand of their heires the performance of thoſe vowes and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they made to them at their deaths; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſpirits to haunt the uninhabited Caſtles, and to ſtrangle thoſe that come to lodge there, till ſome reſolute fellow compells them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him the treaſure. I make thoſe, that I will inrich, find hidden wealth. I cauſe the thieves to burne Candles of dead mens greaſe, to lay the Hoaſts aſleep while they rob their houſes; I give the flying money, that returnes again to the pocket after 'tis ſpent; I give thoſe Annulets to foot-men that enable then to go 200 miles a day; 'tis I that inviſible tumble the diſhes and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles up and downe the houſe without breaking or ſpoiling them. I teach old women to Cure a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56652:33"/>
feavour, by words. I waken the Country fellow on St. Johns Eve to gather his Hearb faſting, and in ſilence. I teach the Witches to take the forme of woolves and eate children, and when any one hath cut off one of their legs (which proves to be a mans arme) I forſake them when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and leave them in the power of juſtice. I ſend to diſcontented perſons, a tall black man, who makes them promiſes of great riches and other felicities, if thay'le give themſelves to him. I blind them that take Contracts of him, and when they demand thirty yeares time I make them ſee the (3) before the (0) which I have place't after: 'tis I that ſtrangle thoſe that by conjuring raiſe me and give me nothing; I quietly quit thoſe that when they have called me up, give me a haire, an old ſhoe, or a ſtraw. I take away from dedicated Churches, the ſtones that have not been paid for. I, make the witches ſeeme to thoſe that are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſabat nothing but a troope of Cats of which Marcou (a Gib-cat) is Prince. I ſend all the Confederates to the offering, and give them the Goates taile (ſeated on a Joint-ſtool) to kiſſe. I treate them ſplendidly but give them no ſalt to their meat; and if any ſtranger ignorant in the Cuſtomes gives God thanks, I cauſe all things to vaniſh, and leave him 500 Miles from his owne home, in a deſart full of nettles and thornes. I ſend to old Letchers beds, Succubuſſes and to the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, Incubuſſes. I convay Hob-goblins in ſhape of a long piece of marble, to lye by thoſe that went to bed without making the ſigne of the Croſſe. I teach the Negromancers to deſtroy their Enemies, by waking a little image in waxe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56652:33"/>
which they throwing into the fire or pricking, the Originall is ſenſible of thoſe torments that they expoſe the Image to. I make Witches inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in thoſe parts where the Ram hath ſet his ſeale. I give a ſecret virtue to <hi>Nolite fieri,</hi> when tis ſaid backwards, that it hinders the butter from coming. I teach husbandmen to lay under the grounds of that ſheepfold which he hath a mind to deſtroy, a lock of Haire, or a Toade, with three curſes, that deſtroyes all the ſheep that paſſe over 'it. I teach the ſhepherds, to tye a bridegroomes point the marriage day, when the Prieſt ſayes <hi>Conjungo vos;</hi> I give that mony that is found by the leaves of an old Oake. I lend magitians a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar that keepes them for undertaking any thing without leave from Robin-goodfellow. I teach how to breake the Charmes of a perſon bewitcht, To kneade the triangular Cake of Saint Woolfe, and to give it in alms to the firſt poor body. I cure ſick Perſons of the Hob-thruſh, by giving them a blow with a forke Juſt between the two eyes. I make the witches ſenſible of the blowes that are given them with an Elder-ſtick. I let looſe the Hob-goblin at the advents of Chriſtmas; and command him to rowle a barrell, or draw a chaine along the ſtreets, that he may wring off their necks that look out at the window. I teach the Compoſition of the Charm's ſeales, Taliſmans, Spells, of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique looking glaſſes, and of the inchanted figures. I teach them to find the Miſſeltoe of the new yeare, the wandring hearbs, the Gamahely and the Magnetique plaſter. I ſend the Goblins the ſhod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mule, the ſpirits, the Hob-goblins the haggs, the night bats, the ſcrags, the breake-neckes, the

               <p>TEll me true, did not my laſt letter fright you? ſay what you will, I believe the great black man made ſome diſorder in you, if not in your ſoul, at leaſt wiſe in ſome of your ſenſes. This you got by having formerly frighted me with ſpirits, they have had their revenge, and I have malitiouſly avenged my ſelfe for thoſe importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities you have perfecuted me withall, to make me acknowledge the truths of Magique. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I am ſorry for the feavour, that I am told this horrible Picture hath brought upon you; but to wipe away my fault, I will rub it out, and upon the ſame cloth ſhow you the deceitfulneſs of his Colours, of his ſtroaks, and ſhaddowes. Conſider then a little, (Although ſo many
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56652:34"/>
witches have been burnt in all parts, convinced of having made a compact with the divell, ſo many poore wretches upon the Pile have confeſs'd to have been at ſabat, nay although ſome at their examination, having confeſs'd to the Judges, that they had eaten at their feaſts children, which ſince their death have been found alive &amp; in health, who being queſtioned concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, know not what was ask'd them, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing of it: Yet one is not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all things, that a man ſaies, becauſe a man can ſay all things: For I grant, although a ſpirit, by a particular permiſſion from God, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon the earth, and implore the benefit of any ones prayers, muſt it therefore be believed, that ſpirits and intelligences (if there be any ſuch) are ſo fooliſh, as to oblige themſelves to appear in every corner, at the pleaſure of an ignorant brain-ſick Clown, according as his melancholly humour ſhall be more or leſſe ſtrong, in his ill-timber'd head; or come to the lure of a ridiculous ſhepheard, like a Hawke to the fiſt of a Faulconer; and to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pritious humour of ſuch a raſcall, dance the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachin or the Antick? No, I do not believe there's any Witches, although many learned perſonages are of another opinion; and I contradict no mans authority, if that authority be not back't by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or if it comes not from God; God, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ought to be believed what he ſaies, becauſe he ſaies it. Nor doth the name of <hi>Arioſto,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though more learned then I, or that of <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> perſwade me, if my judgment be not convinc'd by reaſon, of what they ſay. Reaſon onely is my Queen, to whom I willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56652:35"/>
Beſides, I know by experience, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimeſt wits have err'd the groſlieſt, their fall being the greater, in that they are higher then others. In fine, our fore-fathers have err'd formerly, &amp; their children are ſubject to miſtakes at preſent, and ſo wil ours one day. Let us not then embrace an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe a great many hold it, or becauſe it is the fancy of a great Philoſopher; but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee more probability it ſhould be ſo, than otherwiſe. For my part, I laugh at thoſe Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, that have no ſtronger arguments to prove what they ſay, then to alledge, that 'tis a Maxim, as if their Maxims were more certain, than their other propoſitions. However, I'le believe them, if they ſhew me a Philoſophy, whoſe principles can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be queſtioned or doubted of, in which all the world agrees; or that hath been revealed to us from above; otherwiſe, I laugh at them. For 'tis eaſie to prove all things, when one adjuſts the principles to the opinions, and not opinions to principles. Beſides, although it were juſt to reſt ſatisfied with thoſe great mens opinions; and though I ſhould be forc'd to allow, that the firſt Philoſophers have eſtabliſhed theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I would make them in their turn acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that thoſe Antients, no more than we, have not alwaies written what they have believed. The Law and Religion of their Country, hath often obliged them, to accommodate their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to the politick intent and neceſſity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ought not to believe a man in any thing, but what is humane, that is, poſſible and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To conclude, I admit not that there are any witches, unleſſe ſome body will prove it: If any one can by ſtronger and more enforcing reaſons
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56652:35"/>
then my, own demonſtrate it to me, you need not doubt, but I'le ſay to him, Sir, you are welcome to me, you are he that I wiſhed for; I renounce my own opinions, and embrace yours. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what advantage would the wiſe man have over the fool, if he thinks what the fool thinks? It ought to ſatisfie the vulgar, that a wiſe head ſeems to acquieſce the opinions of the greater number, without manacling his own reaſon, that they may not have a torrent to reſiſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, a Philoſopher ought to judge the vulgar, and not judge like the vulgar. However, I am not ſo unreaſonable, now that I have freed my ſelf from the tyranny of Authority, as to eſtabliſh my own without proofs. You'l there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſe to permit me, to acquaint you with the motives I have had, to doubt of ſo many wonderfull effects, which are related of ſpirits; I fancy, that I have obſerved many very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, to free me from theſe Chimeraes. Firſt then, I never yet heard any ſtory of witches, but I have ſtill obſerved, that it was ſaid to have been acted above a hundred miles from the place, where 'twas told me; this diſtance made me ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that they had a mind to render it impoſſible for the curious, to inform themſelves of the truth. Add to this, that theſe men in the ſhape of Cats, found in the midſt of a field, without witneſſes, (the teſtimony of one perſon onely, ought to be ſuſpected in things miraculous) near a Village, (it was the eaſier to cozen the clowns); 'Twas a poor old woman, (neceſſity might make her lye, to get mony) ſhe was old, (age weakens reaſon, and makes one talk too much); ſhe hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56652:36"/>
invented this tale, to entertain her neighbours withall; age decaies the ſight, ſhe took a Hare for a Cat; age makes one fearfull, ſhe thought ſhe had ſeen fifty for one. For 'tis much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that any one of theſe may happen, which are every day ſeen, then a ſupernaturall accident, without reaſon or example. But pray let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the witches that are taken.</p>
               <p>You'l find, that 'tis a very dull country fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that hath not the wit to diſintangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from off the ſnares that they intrap him in, whoſe underſtanding is ſo ſtupified with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the danger, that he is not in a capacity to juſtifie himſelf, and dares not give any perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent anſwer, for fear, leaſt the preoccupated ſhould conclude, that 'tis the devill that ſpeaks in him. Now if he ſaith nothing, every one agrees, that he is convinced in his conſcience, and preſently he is thrown into the fire. But is the devill ſuch a fool? he that at another time could turn him to a Cat, can he not now give him the form of a Fly, that he may eſcape? No, witches (ſay they) loſe their power, when they are in the hands of juſtice. O! in good faith, that was well thought on; Mr. <hi>John Guillot</hi> then, (whoſe father ſtole the ſons eſtate) purchaſed by means of 20000 Crowns, (which his Judge's place coſt him) the power to command the devills. The devills in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have a great reſpect for thieves. But theſe devills at leaſt-wiſe, ſhould have ſent this poor wretch (their humble ſervant) out of the way, when they knew the Juſtice was in ſearch after him; for 'tis not the way to encourage any body to ſerve him, thus to abandon his Creatures;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56652:36"/>
for thoſe that are but ſpirits hee'l make great ſtrides. I have likewiſe obſerved that all theſe pretended Magitians, are ſo many beggars like the <hi>Diogeneſes.</hi> O heavens, is it then probable that a man would expoſe himſelfe (upon the hopes to continue poor, hated, and famiſhed) to eternall fire, and to the continuall feares of being boiled in all places of Judicature? Satan would certainly give to ſuch a one not the leaves of an Oake, but good weighty money, to purchaſe him Offices that would protect him from the Juſtice. But you'l find that the divells of our age are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſimple, and have not the wit to contrive ſo many ſleights. That loutardly ſhepheard now in your Priſon, that is to be boyled the next Vigil upon what convictions do you condemne him? He was catchtperhaps ſaying the woolfs Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Noſter: for Gods ſake, let him repeate it and you'l find nothing in it but great fooleries, and leſſe hurt in it, then there is in a dead divell, for which none are condemned: beſides this, ſay they, he hath bewitched whole flocks, he did it either by certaine words, or by the hidden ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſome naturall poyſons; by words, I do not believe, that the four and twenty letters of the Alphabet hatch the occult Malignity of ſo quick a venom, nor that opening of the mouths, ſhutting the teeth, clapping the tongue to the pallate in what manner ſoever, hath the power to infect the ſheep, or cure them: for if you reply, that 'tis by reaſon of the Compact, I have not yet read in Chronology, the time in which the Divell agreed with mankind, that when they pronounced certaine words (which were to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56652:37"/>
be ſpecified in the Contract) he would kill; at others, heal; and at ſome others, that he would come and converſe with us, I'le grant, although he had paſſed ſuch a contract with any Particular, yet that particular perſon would not have had the generall conſent, thereby to oblige all men to that agreement; nevertheleſſe at ſome words that a Lout ſhall unawares pronounce, hee'l pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fly unto him (to affright him) and not give the leaſt viſit to ſome powerfull, depraved, eminent, and ſpirituall Perſon that gives himſelfe to him withall his heart, and one that by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will be the occaſion of the loſſe of a hundred thouſand ſouls. You'l allow perhaps, That magicall words have no manner of power, but that under ſuch barbarous words they cover the malignant vertue of ſimples, with which all inchaunters poyſon Cattell; well then, why do you not let them ſuffer under the name of impoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and not of witches. They confeſſe (ſay you) that they have been at ſabat, &amp; that they have ſent Divells into the bodyes of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have proved Demoniacques. As to the ſabat-voyages, this is my beliefe; they noint themſelves with ſome ſomniferous oyles, and as while they wake they eaſily fancy to be carried aftride upon a broome through the chimmy, into a Hall, where is feaſting, dancing, and where they kiſſe the Goate's brich. The imagination being ſtrongly toucht with theſe apparitions, repreſents to them in their ſleep the ſame things, as a broom between their legs, a field that they fly over, a goate, a feaſt, and ladyes, and therefore when they wake they think that they have ſeen that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56652:37"/>
which they onely dreamt. Concerning poſſeſſion of bodies, I'le give you likewiſe my opinion, with the ſame freeneſſe. I find in the firſt place that for one man, there are a thouſand women. Is the Divell ſo great a Leacher to ſeek with ſo much ardor to couple whith women? No no, but I eaſily gueſſe the reaſon, A woman hath a more fickle braine then a man, and conſequently more ready to adventure in a Comedy of this nature; ſhe is in hopes, that by ſpeaking a little Latin, making a few faces, and by putting her ſelfe into ſome certaine poſtures, thay'le believe her far beyond the ſtrength and power of a baſhfull girle; beſides, ſhe thinks herſelfe ſo ſtrong by her weakeneſſe, that the Impoſture being diſcovered, thay'le attribute her Extravagances to ſome ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation of the Matrix, or at the worſt, thay'le pardon the weakeneſſe of her ſex. You'l anſwer, it may be, that we muſt not conclude that none are really poſſeſſ't, becauſe there are ſome that are counterfiets and Cheates. But if that be your Gordian-knot, I'le quickly be his <hi>Alexander:</hi> let us then examine (without careing whether or no we oppugne the opinion of the vulgar) if there have formerly been Demoniacques and if there are any now adayes. That there have been ſome heretofore I do not doubt, becauſe the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſſures us, that a Chaldean by Magicall Art, ſent a divell unto the Cadaver of the Prophet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and made it ſpeake; that <hi>David</hi> with his Harpe conjured that which <hi>Saul</hi> was poſſeſſ't withall; and that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt drove the divells out of the Bodyes of certaine Jewes and ſent them into the ſwine. But we are obliged
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56652:38"/>
to believe that the divells Empire ceaſed, when our Saviour came into the World. That Oracles were ſtifled under the cradle of the Meſſias, &amp; that Satan loſt his ſpeech in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the drie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the three kings ſtarr; having without doubt given him the Pip. Therefore, I laugh at all energumeuus's in our dayes, and will deride them till the Church commands me to believe them, for to Imagine that the Penitent of <hi>Goffridy,</hi> the Nun of <hi>Loudun,</hi> or the Maid at <hi>Eureux,</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht, becauſe they tumble, ſhow trickes, and make faces. Jack Pudding, ſcare-crow, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barin, would a done'em; why they cannot ſo much as ſpeak Latine: Lucifer hath but little care of his divells, not to ſend them to ſchool; ſome will anſwer pertinently enough, when the Exorciſt declaims a prayer out of the Breviary, of which (in a manner) they gale the ſenſe by their often going over the ſame thing: but at other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you'l ſee them counterfit madneſſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a perpetuall diſtraction in the braine when they preach to them. Nevertheleſſe I have catcht ſome very attentive, who watch for the verſe in their howers that they may give an anſwer to the purpoſe, (like thoſe that wil ſing at veſpers &amp; know them not) waking at the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> &amp;c. that they may gargle it in their throats, and ſpew it out. That which I likewiſe find very pleaſant, is, the contempts they entangle themſelves in, when they muſt obey or not obey. The Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator commanded one to kiſſe the ground, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he pronounced the ſacred name of God; this devill of obedience did it very devoutly: but when another time he came to command him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56652:38"/>
the ſame thing, in other tearms, (for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him by the Co-eternall Son of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Beeing); this Novice of a devill, that was no Theologian, was at a ſtand, bluſht, and began to rail, till the Exorciſt having appeaſed him in more ordinary words, he began again to reaſon. I obſerve further, that as the Prieſt raiſed his voice, the devill encreaſed his rage, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at words of very little weight, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſpoke then ſomewhat louder. And contrarily, he ſwallowed, glib as oyl, exorciſms that made me tremble, becauſe he being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weary of bawling, he pronounced them with a low voice. But it was a great deal worſe not long after, when an Abbot took them to task; they were not us'd to his ſtyle, which was the reaſon, that thoſe that would anſwer, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd ſo contrarily, and againſt ſenſe, that the poor devills (in whoſe forehead there was ſtill ſome ſhame left) were lamentably out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and all that day after, it was impoſſible to get a word from them.</p>
               <p>They ſaid, a good while indeed, that they found there were ſome unbelievers preſent, and for that reaſon they would do nothing mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, for fear of converting them. But this pretence appeared to me very groſſe; for if it had been true, to what purpoſe did they give them notice of it; they ought rather contrarily to have hid themſelves in thoſe bodies, to harden us in our incredulity, and not do things, which were capable to diſabuſe us. You'l anſwer, That God compels them to it, to manifeſt the faith. Well, but I am not convinced, nor obliged to believe,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56652:39"/>
that 'tis the devill that ſhowes all theſe tricks, ſince a man can naturally do them: To turn one's face behind one, I have ſeen it done by Gipſies; to leap, who doth not do it, except the Paralyticks? to ſwear you meet with too many; to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Characters upon the skin, either waters or ſome ſort of ſtones, colours our fleſh without a prodigy. If the devills are conſtrained (as you ſay) to do miracles to illu ninate us, let them do convincing ones: let them take the ſteeple of our Ladies Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> (where there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unbelievers) and without breaking, make it dance a Spaniſh Saraband in St. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s field, we ſhall then be convinced. I have taken notice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the Devill, (who is ſaid to have been ſo great a reviler) in the midſt of their mad fits, never induces them to rail one at another; to the contrary, they have for one another a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and are not likely to behave themſelves otherwiſe, becauſe the firſt that takes offence, diſcovers the whole myſterie. Why, is not your proceſs (my reverend Father) inſtructed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentiall crimes, which the devill accuſes you of? The devill (ſay you) is the father of lies; why then did you cauſe the other day a Magitian to be burnt, who was onely accuſed by the devill? for, I ſay with you, that the devill is the father of lyes. Confeſſe, confeſſe, moſt Reverend, that the divell ſayes true, or falſe, according as 'tis advantagious to your crafty paternity. But (God help us) I ſee this devill ſtart, when they throw ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water upon him: Is it then a thing ſo holy that he cannot without horor indure it; that's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon truly that makes me wonder, how he durſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56652:39"/>
enter into a humane Body, that God hath made after his own Image, capable of the moſt Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique viſion, acknowledged his Child, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in Baptiſme; marked with the Holy Oyles; The temple of the holy Ghoſt, and the tabernacle of the holy Sacrament; how had he the impudence to go into ſuch a place, that he muſt needs more reverence, then water, over which hath onely been repeated ſome prayers. But we ſhall have a good iſſue of our buſineſſe. I ſee the Demoniach is very much diſturbed at the ſight of a Croſſe that is brought before him? O Maſter Exorciſt, how good are you, do you not know that there is no place in nature where there are not croſſes, ſince that every where and in all ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there is length and breadth; and that croſſe is nothing elſe but a length, conſidered with a breadth. If you grant it not, that croſſe you hold is not a croſſe becauſe 'tis Ebony, the other is not ſo becauſe 'tis ſilver; but both of them are croſſes becauſe upon a length, a breadth goes travers. If then this Energumenus, hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lengths and breadthes that are ſo many Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about her, what need is there to bring her any others? and yet you ſee this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for having toucht it with her lips perforce, pretends to be interdicted, and is ſilent. Take, take a good handfull of rods and whip her me ſmartly; for I paſſe my word, that if it were commanded that all the Energumenuſ's that could not be cured by a hundred ſtripes a day, ſhould be throwne into the water) not one would be drowned. 'Tis not as (I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that I doubt of the Creators power over
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56652:40"/>
the Creatures: but unleſſe I am Convinced by the Authority of the Church, which we ought blindly to obey, I'le call all theſe great Magical effects; the fools Gazetts, or the Credo of thoſe that have too much faith.</p>

'Tis likewiſe an Evident marque of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſteeme he hath of them, that he hath choſe them to beare us, being not willing to truſt us in our youth, to our ſelves, but nature likewiſe hath taught us by the diſtribution of her riches, that ſhe would advance the younger to the prejudice of the firſt-born, giving him beauty, every lineament of which is an Army that at its pleaſure overthrowes Thrones, raviſhes Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demes, and drags into captivity the haughty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the earth: And if like us they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to Murthers; if it be horor to them to weare by their ſides that which makes us deteſt an Executioner; 'tis becauſe, t'were a ſhame, that thoſe which give us life ſhould carry that about them, which takes it away; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe 'tis much more honeſt to ſweate at the Conſtruction, then at the Deſtruction of ones kind. In point of face then we are not to compare: and in good faith, generally in all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the earth, they exceed us; and if haire make the principall diſtinction between the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and the reaſonable, men are (at leaſtwiſe in the ſtomack, the cheeks, and the chin) more beaſts then women; nevertheleſſe in ſpight of all theſe dumb, but convincing predications of God and of Nature, had it not been for you, this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſexe was truckling under ours; you, that are feeble and ready to fall from this life, have raiſed

up many thouſand Ladyes that had no ſupporter. Let them bragg (after this) that they brought you to light, although their delivery had been more painfull than was that of <hi>Hercules</hi> his Mother; yet they are ſtill much your debtors, who not content to have brought them forth all at once, have made then triumph in their births. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man indeed carried you, nine Months, but you have carried them all above the heads of their Enemies for twenty ages. They had fought, they had conquered, for other twenty; and you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this four Months onely have decreed them the Triumph: yes, Sir every period of your book is a victorious Chariot, where they more proudly triumph then ever the <hi>Scipios,</hi> or the <hi>Caeſars</hi> did in <hi>Rome:</hi> you have made a Country of <hi>Amazons</hi> of all the Earth, and have brought us to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taffe: In fine, one may ſay that before you, all women were but pawnes, which now you have made Queens; In the meane while, we ſee that you betray Us, that you turne your back to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and fly to the other ſexe; but how can we puniſh you for this offence, how can we reſolve to defame a perſon that hath got our Mothers and Siſters of his ſide: beſides we cannot accuſe you of Cowardice, you that have taken the weakeſt ſide; or taxe your Pen with ſelfe intereſt, having begun the praiſes of Ladyes at an age that renders you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of receiving any favours from them. Confeſſe however after having made them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; and having Triumphed in their Triumph, that their ſexe would never have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querous without the helpe of ours. That which (in truth) makes me wonder, is, that you have

You Sir, my deareſt friend, whoſe judgment is too good to excite me to any cruell action, tell me, Have I not been ſufficiently abuſed already by the tongue, and the hands of this Coward, not to provoke his ſword too? for although it troubles me to be called fool, yet 'twould much more vex me, if a ſcandall ſhould be raiſed that I was dead: if I were ſhut up in my grave, he might at his pleaſure and in ſafety ſpeak ill of my Courage; had I not better then ſtay in the world, that I may be alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to chaſtize him, when his temerity ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me.

I'le conſult all the wiſe men for this threeſcore or fourſcore years, and if I and he hath done well, I'le then endeavour to live as many more, and repent, to expiate my cowardlineſſe. You'le think perhaps this proceeding (in a man of courage as I am) very ſtrange; but to ſpeak my mind freely to you, Sir, I finde, that life is ſo fine a thing, that I had rather content my ſelf with this that I enjoy, then hazard for a better, and get a worſe. This ſame Monſieur <hi>le Mat amore</hi> would, it may be, dye, that he might be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of his pain: But I that am more ſtout, endeavour to live a great while, that I may run the hazard of being a long time, in a capacity to die. Doth he think to advance his credit, by declaring that he is weary, and deſires to return to darkneſſe, his firſt lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? What, is he afraid of the Sun? poor fool, if he knew what a ſcurvy thing it is to be deceaſed, he would not make ſo much haſte. 'Tis not bravely done in a man to hazard his life, before he is thirty years old, becauſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that that he knowes not; but if after that age he ventures it, I'le maintain he's mad, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving known it, to venture it. For my part, I like day-light well, and love not to ſleep under ground, becauſe one cannot ſee there. Let him not be puft up, though, at this refuſall; for I'de have him know, that I have two or three killing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thruſts, beſides other ſleights; and I will not fight
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56652:44"/>
for fear of diſcovering them. There are a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other reaſons, that make me abhor Duells; Yeas, I ſhould go into the field, and the Sythe would perhaps diſpatch me for t'other world among the graſſe: alaſſe, my creditors wiſh no better, that they may accuſe me of banquerout. But doth he think, if he had taken away my life, that he had done with me? To the contrary, I ſhould by it become more terrible, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in a fortnight after, he could not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, without being frighted. Nevertheleſſe, if he aſpires to the honour of deſtroying me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I am in good health, I permit him to brag in all places, that he was my hang-man; for if he had killed me, the honour would not be great, a few Spaniſh figgs would do as much. He fancies perhaps, that Nature hath us'd me very ill, in denying me courage; but let him learn, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot do us a greater ſhreud turn, then to employ it againſt Fate; and that the leaſt Flea alive, is better then the great <hi>Alexander</hi> dead. And in fine, that I find my ſelf unworthy to oblige the bleſſed Torches, to weep upon my Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chons. The truth is, I love to be told, that I have all the qualities of a good wit, except that of a happy memory, which I cannot away with, for ſome reaſons.</p>
               <p>Another thing forbids me fighting too; I have writ my Epitaph, which hath much wit &amp; ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it, provided I live a hundred years: but if I ſhould hazard my ſelfe, and die ſooner, the jeaſt would be loſt. Add to all this, that above all things I abhor ſickneſſe, and there is nothing more contrary to health then death. Is't not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56652:45"/>
better then, to encourage ones ſelf to become a coward, then to be the occaſion of ſo many dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters? ſo (ſtrong in our weakneſſe) none can ſee us tremble or look pale, but for fear of having too much courage. And to thee, comfortable Cowardice, I vow to rear an Altar, and promiſe to ſerve thee with ſo devout a worſhip, that (to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from this very day) I dedicate this Epiſtle to the faint-hearted, the ſtouteſt of all your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for fear (if I had ſent it to ſome brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) he might have thought, that I was a man that would ſerve him, becauſe of the four ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy words, that one is obliged to put at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of every Letter.

               <p>I Know, that ſo ignoble a Soul as yours, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not naturally abſtain from detracting, nor is it an abſtinence that I would condemn you to. The onely courteſie that I ask of you, is, that you would tear me ſo ſoftly, that I may ſeem not to feel you. By this you may know, that I have good intelligence. I thank God, that he hath given me a ſoul ſo reaſonable, that I do not believe the world in every thing, becauſe the world can ſay all things; otherwiſe, I ſhould have applyed to your diſeaſe of the ſplene, a more powerfull and ſolid Antidote, than this of diſcourſe: Not that I ever expected any very civill actions from thoſe, that have loſt their humanity;

One would have wondred in truth, that in ſo vaſt a body, your little wit did not loſe it ſelf. Nor was it very long lived, for I have heard ſome years ſince, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leave this life, but that your miraculous death will make you be canonized: Yeas, take leave of the Sun when you pleaſe, you are ſure of a line in our Letanies, when the Conſiſtory ſhall hear that you are dead, without loſing your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. However, comfort yourſelf, you'l not hold out the leſſe for that; the Deer, and the Ravens, whoſe wits are proportionable to yours, live four hundred years. And if the want of brains be the occaſion of long life, without doubt you are he, that muſt write Mankinds Epitaph. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, 'tis by reaſon of the brutiſh inſtinct of your nature, that you make choice of gold and pretious ſtones, to defile with your venom. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me then, (although you pretend to exempt your ſelfe from the power, that God hath given men over beaſts) to command you, to ſpew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething more foul then my name, and to remember, (for I believe, beaſts of your nature have ſome kind of remembrance) that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor gave a tongue to thoſe of your ſpecies, onely to ſwallow, and not to ſpeak.

               <p>BY the affection I bore you (notwithſtanding your undeſert) I have made you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being my Enemy; if the Philiſtines heretofore had not died by the hands of <hi>Samſon,</hi> we ſhould not have known now, that there had been any Philiſtines; they were beholding to their death for their life; and if they had lived ten yeares later, they would have died thirty ages ſooner; thus you, in ſpight of me, reape the ſame glory; by your baſeneſſe having compelled me to puniſh you. I know I ſhall be told, that by killing of a Pigmy I ſhall not add to my fate the ſubſtance of a glorious Epitaph. But to look unintereſſed upon the reverſe of the Paradoxe, That <hi>Marius,</hi> that in three Combats made a grave for three Nations was not eſteemed a Coward for killing the frogs in that marſh, wherein he caſt himſelfe; and <hi>Socrates</hi> by killing the lice that bit him in Priſon, did not loſe the honour of being the prime man in the univerſe; No, no, little dwarfe, (do not think your ſelfe any other) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to humble this nothing of yours; and believe as an article of faith, (if you be ſtill as little as you was on your birth day) that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens permits it, to hinder ſmall Evill from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming great: In fine, you are no man, what (a divel) are you then? you are perhaps a Mommy, that ſome ſpirit has ſtolen from the Phyſitian's Colledge, to fright the world withall: nor is this very improbable; ſince the Eyes are the Mirrors

After this, I do not at all wonder, that you ſay, you are not yet known: four foot of dirt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed keeps you from being ſeen; you are ſo finely buried under the dunghill, that (if you did not want a potſhard to ſcrape you) you would be a compleat <hi>Job.</hi> In troth, you give the lye bravely to thoſe Philoſophers, that ſleight the Creation; if any of them be now to be found, I wiſh they may meet with you, for after they have ſeen you, they'l eaſily believe, that Man may have been made of dirt. They'l preach you, and make uſe of your own ſelf, to draw you from that ſad Atheiſm you groan under. You know, that I do not ſpeak by rote, and that I am not him alone, that hath heard you pray to God, to give you ſo much grace, as not to believe in him. Why how now, impious wretch! God dares not ſhut a door againſt you, when you fly from a beating, but it is preſently by you broken down; and yet you begin to believe in him again, onely that you may have ſome body to ſwear by, when your dice do not give a favourable anſwer to your avarice. I grant, that yours is not a fortune that can bear a loſſe patiently, for you are as beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and hardly would the whole earth be enough to ſatisfie you, that is, it hath made you affront ſuch a world of people.

But ſome body would upbraid me, and ſay, that I torment too much a perſon, that ſaies, he hath ſo great an eſteem for me.

Alas, ask all the world what you are, and you ſhall ſee, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body doth not ſay, that you have nothing in you of a man, but the reſemblance of a Baboon.

actions, and that being uncapable of producing Gentlemen according to the fleſh, you will at leaſt create them according to the ſpirit. The Romanticke Authors that you are acquainted withall, do oftentimes give Empires to thoſe that perhaps before enjoyed not two Acres of ground, and your talent is ſo like theirs that it gives you the ſame Priviledges. 'Tis well enough known, that all thoſe great Authors do not ſpeak better then you, becauſe you ſay the very ſame as they do, and that every moment you vomit out <hi>Caſſander</hi> and <hi>Polexander,</hi> ſo undiſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and as you took them in, that one would think one ſaw in your Mouth the very paper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the words: the Criticks mutter, that the great noiſe that you make in the world, is no ſigne of a great wit; that Empty veſſells ſound more then full ones, and that perhaps by reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity of your empty braine your mouth (like to a Grot) makes an ill diſtinguiſht Eccho of all the ſounds that ſtrikes it. But you muſt comfort your ſelfe for all this; for that man that can hinder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy from biting vertue, is yet unborn: for I grant, as they ſay, that you are no great wit, you are nevertheleſſe a great man; what, you are able by your very ſhaddow to black a whole tennis court; none heares your ſtature ſpoken of but believe that one is a telling a ſtory of a Cedar or a Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree; and others that know you more particularly provethat you have nothing of man but the voice, aſſuring us that they have learnt by tradition that you are an Oake tranſplanted from the forreſt of <hi>Doone:</hi> 'tis not by my advice that they give this teſtimony, for I have told them a hundred times

And becauſe that one humane ſoul being not large enough to animate from one end to the other ſo vaſte a Coloſſe; nature was forced to leave the upper region, deſart.

               <p>THe Doctors (better then I) will one day eaſe you of the life of this perſon, let them but alone, their ſtroaks none can put by. You'l anſwer me without doubt, That he hath already above a dozen times, paſſed by the time of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Parque forgot him, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gon ſo far beyond him, ſhe is now loath and laſie to come back ſo far and fetch him. No, no, Sir, be in good hope, till he hath lived nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, the age of <hi>Methuſalem.</hi> But ſpeak to him continually, and that ſcoldingly, roar, play the devill, thunder in the houſe, let every thing be croſſe to him, and take ſome courſe to make him aweary of his life: Why, <hi>Artephius</hi> and the Sybill <hi>Cumea,</hi> lived nothing in reſpect of him. He was brought forth before Death was born, and that's the reaſon death dares not ſtrike him, for ſhe's afraid to kill her father; and if this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration did not hinder her, ſhe ſees him ſo weak with age, that he would not be able to go into th'other world. Beſides too, I think another thing may be the reaſon, which is, that death, who ſees him do no action of life, takes him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thtr for a ſtatue, then a living creature, and thinks it belongs rather to time or fortune, to overthrow him, then to him. After this, Sir, I much wonder, that you ſhould ſay, that he, (being ready to cloſe the circle of his daies) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arived at that point where he firſt ſet forth,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56652:53"/>
he's becomming a child again. Ah, Sir, you jeaſt, and for my part, I cannot ſo much as believe, that he ever was one: What, he a Boy? No, no, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, or <hi>Moſes</hi> was out in his Calculation of the worlds creation. Though, if it be permitted us to name every thing ſo, that can hardly die, the functions of a child I grant you; for he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be more ignorant then a plant, that knowes not how to die, that which every thing that hath life, underſtands without a Maſter. Oh, had he been but known by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that Philoſopher would not have defined Man a rational Animal. Thoſe of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his ſect, which demonſtrate, that the Beaſts have the uſe of reaſon, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this: Ah! if it were but true that he were a beaſt. But alas, in the order of animated beings, he is a little more then a Hartichoke, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhort of an Oyſter: inſomuch that, but that you think he hath no feeling, I ſhould believe him to be that which they call the Senſitive plant. Confeſſe then, that you are to blame, to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his life; he hath not yet lived, he hath onely ſlept, have patience at leaſt, till he hath taken a nap. Hath no body told him, are you ſure, that death and ſleep are brothers? He ſpeaks perhaps a ſcrupule, (being tender conſcience'd) having enjoyed me, to have any thing to do with t'other. Infer not hence, that I would by this prove, that the perſon of whom we ſpeak is a fooliſh man; not at all, he is nothing leſſe then a man: For however he may have been baptized like us, that's a priviledge the pariſh-Bells enjoy as well as he. I could ſpeak of his life, till I end my own, to allay your griefs; but ſleep begins to

That which troubles me, (for you know, that I am a revenger of wrongs, and am very much enclined to diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice) is, to ſee him attribute to his wicked Imagination, the good ſervices done him by his Memory, and that he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the father of a thouſand high fancies, which at moſt he hath been but a midwife to, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. This, Sir, let us brag, that we write better then he, whilſt he writes juſt as we do; and laugh, to ſee him at this age have a writing-Maſter by him, ſince by it he doth us no other miſchief, then to render our works more legible. We ought contrariwiſe receive with reſpect, thoſe wiſe and morall advertiſments, by which he endeavours to reclaim the extravagances of our youth; yea certainly, we ought to give more faith to them, and make no more doubt of them, then of the Evangeliſts; for all the world knowes, they are not things that he hath deviſed. In troth, to have ſuch a friend, is to maintain a

Preſſe at an eaſie rate. For my part, I imagine, (for all his great Manuſcripts) that if after his death, they make an Inventorie of his Study of Books, that is, of thoſe that proceeded from his own brain, all his works together, (taking away that which is not his) will make a Library of white paper. He aſſumes the ſpoils of the dead, and he believes to have invented that which he remembers. But 'tis but an ill proof, of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extraction of his thoughts, to derive their antiquity but from a man that is ſtill alive: But by this he concludes for the Metempſychoſis, and ſhews, that if he ſhould make uſe of what <hi>Socrates</hi> was the Author of, he ſhould not rob him, he himſelfe having formerly been the ſame <hi>Socrates</hi> that invented them: And then, hath he not memory enough to be rich with that onely? why he hath one ſo vaſt, that he remembers that which was ſaid, thirty Ages before he was in the world: Obtain of him for me, (I that am a little more ſenſible then the dead) a permiſſion to date my thoughts, that my poſterity may not remain doubtfull. There was heretofore a goddeſſe, <hi>Eccho,</hi> this without doubt muſt be the god; for, like her, he never ſaies any thing, but what others have ſaid before him, and repeats it ſo verbatim, that tranſcribing the other day one of my Letters, (he cal'd it compoſing) he had the moſt ado in the world, to ſubſcribe, Your ſervant, <hi>Beaulieu,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the end of it there was,</p>

               <p>AFter having put in a heat againſt us, this man, that is nothing but flegme, do we not fear, that one of theſe daies they will accuſe us of burning the River? This water-wit murmurs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, like the fountains, yet no body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what he ſaies. Ah! Sir, what a ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident this man makes me foreſee at the end of the world, which is, that if he dies not, till his memory have an end, the reſurrection trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets will never be ſilent, this onely faculty in him leaves room for no other; and he is ſo great a perſecutor of common ſenſe, that he makes me ſuſpect, that the univerſall judgment was promiſed, that ſuch as he might have ſome, who had none in particular. And to ſpeak ingenuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, who ever ſends him out of this world, will be much to blame, to diſpatch him without reaſon. Nevertheleſſe he ſpeaks as much as all Authors, for they all ſeem to have ſpoken but for him: He never opens his mouth, but we find a theft in it, and he is ſo accuſtomed to thieving, that when he holds his tongue, 'tis that he may ſteal from thoſe that are dumb. For all this, ours is but a falſe valour, and we unjuſtly ſhare the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the combat, to oppoſe our underſtandings that have three faculties, to his, that hath but one. Therefore it is, that he hath a great vacuum in his head, he ought to be pardoned, ſince it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Nature to fill it with a third part of a reaſonable ſoul: But to make amends for that,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56652:55"/>
he never lets it ſleep, he ſtill employes it in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing. And thoſe great Philoſophers, who by profeſſing poverty, thought to have freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from contribution, pay him every day (the very pooreſt amongſt them) a tax of ten Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and this wretched wit-ſtealer lets not one eſcape, but impoſes on them according to the extent of their income: 'Tis to little purpoſe that they hide themſelves, he'l make them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe, and ſpeak Engliſh: Nay, ſometimes they muſt be content to ſee their whole Eſtate confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, when they have not wherewithall to pay the tax. He exerciſes theſe rapines in ſafety, for <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> being under other Princes, he ſhall not be queſtioned in <hi>England</hi> for the robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he hath done them. I believe he thinks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Heathens are our enemies, that what he plunders them of, is lawfull prize. This, Sir, is the reaſon, that in every page of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, we ſee the Cameter of the living and of the dead; after this, you need not doubt, but that (if at the reſurrection, every one takes that which belongs to him) the ſharing of his writings, wil be the laſt difference among men. After he hath been five of ſix daies in our companies, rifling us, more laden with points of wit, then a Porcupine, he goes and ſticks them in his Epigrams and Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, like Pins into a Cuſhamet: Yet for all this, he boaſts, that there is nothing in his Writings, that doth not as juſtly belong to him, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Ink which he paid for; that the twenty four Letters of the Alphabet are as much his, as ours, and conſequently, the diſpoſition of them: And that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> being dead; he may lawfully
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56652:55"/>
ſeize upon his books, ſince his lands, which are immoveables, are not now without Maſters. But beſides all this, when we find ſometimes the cloak upon his ſhoulders, he adopts it his own, and proteſts, that he never lodged in his memory any fancy but his own; but that may well enough be, his writings being the Hoſpitall where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives mine. Now if you ſhould ask me the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of this man, I would anſwer you, That he is an Eccho, that hath purged himſelf of a ſhort breath, and that would have been dumb, if I had never ſpoke. I for my part am an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate father, that lament the loſſe of my children. 'Tis true, he is very generous of his wealth, for 'tis more mine then his own; and 'tis true too, that if they were on fire, I ſhould, in throwing water on them, ſave nothing but mine own. Therefore I retract all that I have reproch'd him with: And indeed, of what fault can I accuſe an innocent, that hath done nothing? and although he hath err'd, he hath done it but after me. I no longer accuſe him then, we are two good friends; and I have alwaies been ſo concern'd for him, that he never yet was imployed in any thing, but that I did it to his hand; his works were my onely thoughts, and when I was a ſtudying, I thought of what he was to write. Reſt aſſured then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that all that I before ſeemed to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with, was, onely to perſwade him, to ſpare his ridiculous compariſons of our fathers, for that is not the way to arrive to what he aſpires, to be an incomparable Author, ſeeing that 'tis a ſigne, his Bias is ſtrong to theeving, to filch for raggs, and to have no better flowers of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

then ſome even as's, ſo that's, or ſuch like. How now, is not the thunder in the middle regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aire, far enough from his reach? nor the torrents of <hi>Thrace</hi> rapid enough, to hinder his diverting them into this Kingdom by force, to marry them to his compariſons?

If the earth had never known other points, then the pricks of Thiſtles, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſo form'd him, that he would not have diſlik'd them; for between you and I, when he ſeems to be ſenſible, that a point pricks him, I cannot but believe, that he doth it to perſwade us, that he is not inſenſible: But whether he be ſo or no, I'de let him alone, if he did not erect

Trophies to ſtupidity, &amp; ſupport them by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. How? this good Gentleman would have one write nothing, but what one hath made, as if we now ſpoke French, onely becauſe hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſpoke Latine; or were not reaſonable till we are moulded. We are then much obliged to Nature, for not making him the firſt man; for without doubt he would never have ſpoke, if he had heard braying firſt. 'Tis true, to make his conceits underſtood, he makes uſe of a kind of Idiotiſme, that makes the world wonder, how the twenty four Letters of the Alphabet can meet in ſo many faſhions, and ſay nothing. After this, you'l ask me, what judgment I make of this man, that ſaying nothing, ſpeaks continually? Alas, Sir, none at all, unleſſe it be, that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe muſt needs be well rooted in him, that 'tis not yet cured, although he hath fluxed at the mouth above fifteen years. But concerning his infirmity, 'tis believed as a miracle of this holy man, that he had no wit till he was brain-ſick; that had ſhe not troubled the oeconomy of his temperature, he was cut out for a great fool; and that nothing can blot out his name which he hath plaiſter'd on the front of memory, ſince <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>Larchet</hi> could not do it. Thoſe that jeer him, add, that he lives by dying, becauſe that the Neapolitan drogme, which hath coſt him dear, and raiſed him to preferment in the number of Authors, he ſells every day to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. But let them ſay what they will, he'l ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye with hunger; for, provided his chair be not defective, I am very confident, he'l rub out well enough till death; if he had as well ſecured

or at leaſt wiſe ſhe would hold their tongues between her fingers and make uſe of them as they of do the Lazeres ſnappers; faith, ſince we are gone thus farre, we had as good finiſh his picture. I fancy then (for we can but fancy thoſe beaſts that are not ſhowed for mony) that if his conceipts are moulded in his head he muſt needs have a very flat one, that his eyes are of the biggeſt ſize, if nature hath made them of the ſame length that he hath made the craze in his head. They add to his deſcription that the Parque above 10 yeares ſince wrung his neck, but could not ſtrangle him; and ſome dayes ſince, one of his friends aſſured me that having conſidered his bent armes petrified upon his haunches, he took his Body for a Gibber where the divell had hung a Soul; and perſwaded himſelfe that it might very well be that heaven animating this cadaverous and rotten Inſect, to puniſh him for the ſinnes he was to commit, would before hand throw his ſoul to the dunghill: well Sir, you may pleaſe to exhort him from me, not to be incenſed at theſe fancies, by which I endeavour to divert his thoughts from the cruell paines that torment him; I do it not to augment his afflictions, but 'tis not eaſie to gaine his beliefe to all preſſing troubles: Beſides (having taken a draft of his ill built face,) Is it not manifeſt to every one that ſince the Phyſitians have been ſo long employed in the cure of his Carcaſſe, he muſt needs be very hollow; and who knowes, but that God puniſhes him for the hatred he bears to thoſe that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts and conceptions; ſince we ſee his diſeaſe is become incurable, by having differr'd too
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56652:60"/>
long the putting himſelfe into the hands of one that is learned. I am perſwaded that this is alſo the reaſon that this enraged Cerberus throws his venom upon every body: for I was told that one ſhowing him a Sonnet, which he told him (being ill inform'd) was mine, he caſt ſuch an Eye upon him, as obliged him to put it up againe without reading it. But theſe Caprices do not ſeeme ſtrange to me: for how could he look other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then aſquint upon this compoſition, that looks no otherwiſe on the heavens? he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with three ſcourges, remains onely upon the earth to be a continuall object to men of Gods vengance; he, whoſe calumnie and rage hath dar'd to throw his foame upon the purple of a Prince of the Church, and endeavours to caſt the ſhame upon the face of a Heros, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily under the auſpices of <hi>Lewis</hi> governes the firſt kingdome of Chriſtendome. In fine, all that is noble Auguſt, great and ſacred, doth ſo incenſe this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that like a Turky-Cook in his anger as well as in his deformity, he cannot endure a Red Hat though France under it ſecure from her Enemies enjoyes a glorious &amp; happy quiet. You may now eaſily judg that his ſcorn concerns me as nothing, and that 'twould have been a kind of a Miracle, if my Sonnet that paſſeth for ſmooth and full of ſalt, had reliſhed with a Perſon ſo pepper'd: but I perceive I am a little too ſaucy to entertaine you with ſo abject a ſubject; To conclude, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to reſt ſatisfied without that pleaſant Comedy that you would entertaine your ſe'fe withall in ſhowing him my Letter, or elſe learne firſt <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Language, that you may conſter the

               <p>I Wonder, that ſuch a log as you, (who by your habit ſeems to be become but a great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal) ſhould not yet bluſh, and become red, with the fire that burns you within. Think at leaſt, when your bad Angel makes you rebell againſt me, that my arme is not far from my head, and that till now, your own weakneſſe, and my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, hath ſecured you; although you are a very contemptible thing, yet I'le free my ſelf of you, if you become troubleſom. Give me not occaſion then to remember, that you are in the world; and if you will live above a day, call to minde often, that I have forbid you to make me the object of your ſlanders; my name fills a period but ill, the thickneſſe of your ſquare waſte would cloſe it a great deal better. You act <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when from your Pedagogiſt-Tribunall, you ſee your little Monarchy tremble under your wooden Scepter. But take heed, that a Tyrant raiſes not up a <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> for although you are the ſpace of four hours upon the head of Emperours, your Domination is not ſo ſtrongly eſtabliſhed, but that the ſound of a Bell deſtroyes it twice a day. 'Tis ſaid, you boaſt, that you expoſe in all places your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and your ſalvation. I believe this of your
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56652:63"/>
piety. But to hazard your life for it, I know you want courage, and that you would not ſtake it againſt the Monarchy of the world. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and plot my ruine, but they are bitts that you cut out for others. You would gladly, from the ſhore in ſafety, behold a ſhip wrack at Sea; and I the whilſt am condemned to the Piſtoll, by a Puritanicall pedant; a Pedant <hi>in ſacris,</hi> who ought for an example, if the image of a Piſtoll had taken place in his thoughts, to be exorciſed. Barbarous Schoolmaſter! what cauſe have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, to wiſh me this ill? You run over all the crimes perhaps, which you are guilty of, and then you think of accuſing me of that impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which your own memory taxes you withall. But know, that I know a thing which you know not, and that thing is god, and that one of the ſtrongeſt arguments (after thoſe of faith) that hath convinced me of his true exiſtence, is, the conſideration, that were it not for a ſummary and ſoveraign goodneſſe, that reignes in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, thus wicked and weak as you are, you could not have lived ſo long unpuniſhed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have learnt, that ſome little works, though much above yours, hath cauſed in your timerous courage, this paſſion that you thunder againſt me: But in truth, Sir, I am ready to quarrell with my own imagination, that ſhe hath made my Satyr bite harder then yours, although yours be the fruit, that the beſt wits of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have ſweat for. You ought to be offended at Nature, and not me, that cannot help it, for could I imagine, that to have wit was to injure you? You know beſides, that I was not in the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56652:63"/>
belly of that Mare that conceived you, to diſpoſe to humanity thoſe organs, and the complexion that concurred to the making you a Horſe. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not however, that theſe truths that I preach to you, ſhould reflect upon the body of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, (that glorious mother of Sciences) of which, if you are any member, it is the ſhamefull one. There is nothing in you, that is not very deformed, your very ſoul is black, it being in mourning for the death of your conſcience, and your habit, as its giblets, keeps the ſame colour. I confeſſe 'tis true, that a miſerable Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack, as you are, cannot obſcure the merit of the learned men of your profeſſion; and howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ridiculous vain-glory perſwades you, that you are the ableſt Regent of the Univerſity, I proteſt to you, (my good friend) that if you are the greateſt man in the Muſes Academy, you are beholden for it onely, to the greatneſſe of your members, and that you are the greateſt perſonage of your Colledge, by the ſame right, that St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> is the greateſt Saint in our Ladies Church; 'tis not but that, if fortune and juſtice were agreed, you would very well deſerve to be the chief of four hundred Aſſes, that are taught at your Colledge; yea, certainly you deſerve it, and I know, that the Maſter of the high function, whom whipping better becomes then you, nor none to whom it more juſtly belongs; and of that great number, I know thoſe that would give ten pound to flea you; and if you'l believe me, take them at their words, for ten pounds is more, then the skin of a horn'd beaſt can be worth. From all theſe, and from all the other

things that I writ to you t'other day, you may conclude, (little Doctor) that the Deſtinies command you by a Letter, that you content your ſelf to ſhipwrack the wits of the youths of <hi>Paris,</hi> againſt the ſeats of your School; and not think to domineer and play the Regent over him, that doth acknowledge the Empire neither of <hi>Monet</hi> nor <hi>The ſaurus.</hi> In the mean time, you gore me with ſharp horns, and reſuſcitating in your memory the thoughts of your cruelty, you compoſe of it a Romance, of which you make me the <hi>Heros:</hi> Thoſe that will excuſe you, lay the fault on Nature, that brought you forth in a Countrie, where beaſtialitie is the firſt patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and of a race, that the ſeven deadly ſins hath compoſed the hiſtorie of.

               <head>29. Againſt Lent.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu may canonize Lent as long as you pleaſe. For my part 'tis a holy-day, that my devotion will never celebrate; I look upon it as a great gaſh, in the body of the year, through which Death introduces himſelf; or as a great Caniball, that lives upon mans fleſh, whilſt we eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but roots: The cruell Tyrant is ſo affraid of failing to deſtroy us, that having learnt, we are to periſh by fire, the very firſt day of his reign he puts the world into aſhes, and afterwards by a deluge, to exterminate the embracements remainders, he brings a tyde of fiſh into our very Cities. The Turk, that told the Grand Signior, that upon a certain day of the year, all the Frenchmen became frantick; and that a certain powder being applyed to their forehead, made them come to themſelves again, was not of my opinion; for I'le maintain, that they are never wiſer then upon that day: And if they object their <hi>Maſcarades,</hi> I anſwer, That they diſguiſe themſelves, that Lent who looks after them may not find them; and indeed, he never carches? em, but the next morning a bed, when they have pluckt off their viſors. The Saints, who (being inſpired by God) are wiſer then we, diſguiſe themſelves likewiſe; but they unmask not till Eaſter day, when the enemy is gone. 'Tis not, that this Barbarian hath pitty on us, that makes him depart: No, no; but finding us ſo alter'd, that he himſelf doth not know us, he retires, thinking he hath miſtaken us for ſome
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56652:65"/>
others. You ſee already, that our armes loſe their fleſh, our cheeks fall, our chins grow ſharp, our eyes hollow, the paunch-belly that you know, begins to ſee his knees; human Nature looks hideouſly: To be brief, the very Saints in our Churches would fright us, if they did not hide themſelves. And after this doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Martyrs have eſcap'd the wrack, the furnace, and boyling oyle, when in ſix weeks we ſee ſo many perſons in good health, after they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed the fury of ſix and forty executioners, their preſence alone is terrible: And I fancy Shrovetide, (that great day of Metamorphoſis) a rich elder brother, that burſts his belly, whilſt the poor younger ones, dye hunger-ſtarv'd. 'Tis not, but that the law of Faſts is a well invented ſtratagem, to exterminate all the ſouls out of a Republick, that are like to come to the fire. But I think theſe fiſh-daies are to blame, to kill ſo many Calves in a ſeaſon, in which they permit them not to be eaten; and to permit <hi>March</hi> to blow ſuch bad winds from the quarter of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they make us eat but half what we would do. Why, Sir, there is not one Chriſtian, whoſe bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not a Sea of frogs, or a Kitchen-garden. I think upon the carcaſe of a man, that dies in Lent; one may ſee ſprout out beet roots, sker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, turnips, and carrets. But to hear our Preachers, you would think, that at this time we ought not to be fleſh. What, is it not enough, that this lean Tyrant ruines our bodies, would he corrupt our ſouls too? he hath ſo perverted our precepts, that we may now communicate to women our temptations to the fleſh, without
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56652:65"/>
offending them, or god almighty. Are not theſe crimes, for which it ought to be expel'd out of well-govern'd Kingdoms? But 'tis not onely in our daies, that he rules with ſo much inſolence, for our Saviour died in the firſt year of his reigne. The whole machine of the world was like to have vaniſht, and the Sun, (who was not uſed to theſe long faſts) faild the ſame day, and loſt his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, &amp; would never have recovered his weakneſſe, if they had not preſently made an end of Lent. O thrice and four times happy is he, that dyes on a Shrove-tueſday, he is almoſt the onely man that can boaſt, that he lived a year without Lent. Yeas, Sir, if I were aſſured to abjure the hereſy every holy-Saturday, I would turn Huguenot every Aſh-wedneſday. Our reformed fathers may well pray to God, that the Pope may never happen to be my priſoner of war; for, although I am a Catholick good enough, yet I would not ſet him at liberty, till he had for his ranſom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored all the fleſh-daies, he hath taken from us: I would oblige him likewiſe, to degrade <hi>March</hi> from the number of the 12 months of the year, as being the <hi>Ganelon,</hi> that betraies us to a great deal of hardſhip. 'Tis to no purpoſe to ſay, that he is not altogether againſt us, ſince either with his head, or his heels, he alwaies dips in the dripping-pan; that he onely frees himſelf from the Megrim, by the Cramp; and, in fine, that Lent is his Gibbet, where every year he finds himſelf hung, either by the neck, or by the heels: He is the principall cauſe of the miſchiefs, that our enemies do us, becauſe 'tis he that lodges them, whilſt they perſecute us; and theſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56652:66"/>

One would take this Chick for a little Man without a beard, and thoſe that have caſt his horoſcope, have foretold, that he ſhall be one day a great Lord at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe that the firſt time he broke ſilence, was with the word <hi>Papa.</hi> I have ſtrictly charged him, to tax you with your ingratitude, and to conjure you to return to the neſt of your loving Hen; and although he doth it but in his tongue, be not harder hearted then St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom heretofore the ſame language

was ſufficient, to bring him to repentance. Leave then, O unconſtant Cock, to debauch your neighbours wives; return to the roof of her, that ſo long ſince gave you her heart; of her, whoſe embraces did ſo often prevent your deſires; and of her, in fine, who hath proteſted to me, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as you are) to oppreſſe you with her deareſt favours, if you ſhow but the leaſt ſhadow of repentance: But nothing moves you. Why, impudent Cock as you are, do you not ſee, that your beard bluſhes for ſhame, that inſtead of humbling your ſelf at her feer, and drailing your wings on the ground, you ſtand upon your points, and crow at her. You think perhaps, that this is not ſpoke like a Hen. But I underſtand likewiſe, that thoſe tunes that you ſend forth to her praiſe, are not Cock a doodle's. In truth, theſe are fine teſtimonies of gratitude, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the liberality of a perſon, that ſends you her firſt brood. Without doubt, when you were the other day to ſee her, you did not half conſider her. Look upon her now neerer hand, this little picture of your ſelf, he doth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble you, and indeed, ſhe made it by you; and I vow to you, it is the faireſtfruit of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that hath been gathered with her this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn. But hold, I am miſtaken, 'tis not a fruit, 'tis a Poulet; make this Poulet then as welcome, as ſhe hath made yours. If it were onely for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities ſake, you might ſhow it all over <hi>Paris,</hi> as the firſt Cock that ever was born without a ſhell; otherwiſe I'le diſavow all, and to excuſe the cackling of your Hen, I'le publiſh in

               <p>SInce I am condemned (but 'tis onely by the Phyſitian) from which I can more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale then from a Criminall decree, you'l allow me (as they do Malefactors who from the ladder preach to the people) I that am in the hands of the hangman, to give ſome admonition and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Youth: The feavour and the Poticary holds a punniard to my Breaſt, with ſo much rigour, that I hope they will not ſuffer my diſcourſe to be troubleſome to you. This graduate notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56652:68"/>
tells me, that t'will be nothing and at the ſame time proteſts to every body elſe, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape without a Miracle. Their preſages however, although fatall, do not at all ſtartle me; for I know well enough that the cunning of their trade obliges them to condemn all ſick perſons to death, to the end that if any one eſcapes his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very may be imputed to their powerfull reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and if he dyes, that every one may cry him up for an Able man, and ſay, that he knew well enough what would become of him. But admire a little, the Impudence of this hangman, the more I find the ill increaſe that his Phyſick is cauſe of, and the more I complaine of ſome new diſtemper, the more he rejoyces; and ſayes nothing, but, All the better. When I tell him that I am fallen into a ſwoonding Lethargy, that held me almoſt an hour, he anſwers 'Tis a good ſigne; When he ſees me in the Clawes of a bloody flux, that teares me in peeces, 'tis well, ſayes he, this is as good for you as letting Blood: When I grow ſad to feel an exceſſe of cold to take hold of all my extream parts, he laughs, and ſayes he knew it well enough, that his Phyſick would quench that extreame fire; nay ſometimes, when being almoſt dead, I have loſt my ſpeech, I heare him chide my friends that weep to ſee me in this ſad condition, Fools that you are (ſayes he) do you not ſee that 'tis his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that is at extremity, and is leaving of him? Thus this traitor rocks me, and in the meene time I am ſo well, that I am almoſt dead. I am not ignorant how much I was to blame to call my Enemies to my help; but, could I imagine that thoſe whoſe knowledge makes profeſſion to

cure, would employ it altogether to kill me; for alas, you may believe, that if this were not the firſt time that I fell into the ditch, I ſhould not now be in a condition to bemoan my ſelf. I for my part adviſe thoſe weak wraſtlers, that they may be revenged of thoſe that have thrown them, to turn Doctors, for I'le aſſure them, they'l ſend thoſe to the ground, that had laid them there. In truth I think, that to dream in ones ſleep, that one meets a Phyſitian, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put one into a feavour; to ſee their lean ſteeds (covered with a long hearſe-cloth) feebly ſupport their feeble Maſter; would one not think 'twere a Beere, that the Parque is got aſtride upon? and may we not take his riding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod for death's ſtandard, ſince ſhe brings along his Lieutenant? This is the reaſon without doubt, that Policy commanded them to mount Mules, and not Mares, leſt the race of Doctors becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more numerous, there would have been at laſt more executioners then patients. Oh! what pleaſure could I take, in anatomizing their Mules, thoſe poor Mules, that never felt ſpur, neither within, nor upon their fleſh, becauſe boots and ſpurrs are ſuperfluities, that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate wiſdom of the Faculty cannot diſgeſt.

In fine, all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are ſo cold, that I find but one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, and the people of the North; that is, thoſe of <hi>Norway</hi> have alwaies mules upon their heels, and theſe have alwaies their heeles upon their mules. They are ſo great enemies to heat, that they have no ſooner found out in a patient any luke-warmneſs, but, as if that body were a <hi>Veſſuvius,</hi> they are preſently a bleeding, and gliſtering, drowning this poor ſtomack in Sena, Caſſia, and Barly-water, and weakning life, to debilitate (ſay they) this heat, that takes nouriſhment as long as it meets with matter to work upon; inſomuch, that if the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hand of God makes them bound again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the world, they preſently impure it to the vertues of the refrigerative, with which they have benum'd this incendiary. They ſteal from us the heat and energy, that is in the blood. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bled too much, our ſouls flying from us, ſerve as a ſhittlecock, to their Chirurgeons <hi>Palletes.</hi> Well, Sir, what think you then, after this, are we not much to blame, to complain, that for a weeks ſickneſſe, they ask ten pound; is it not a cheap cure, where the life eſcapes? But confront a little, I beſeech you, the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that is between the Doctor's proceedings, and the proceſſe of a criminall. The Phyſicians having conſidered the Urine, queſtions the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient upon the ſtool, and condemns him; the Chirurgeon binds him, and the Apothecary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges his office behind: Thoſe very perſons that think they ſtand in need of them, do not

much eſteem them; no ſooner are they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chamber, but one lolls out ones tongue at the Phyſitian, one turns ones arſe to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, and holds up ones fiſt at the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis true, they revenge themſelves with a witneſſe, it alwaies coſts the jeaſter his life. I have obſerved, that all that is fatall in Hell, is comprehended in the number three; there is three Lakes, three Doggs, three Judges, three Parques, three Gerrons, three Hecates, three Gorgons, three Furies. The ſcourges God uſes to puniſh mankind, are likewiſe three, the Sword, Peſtilence, and Famine; the World, the Fleſh, and the Devill; Hail, Thunder, and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the Blooding, the Phyſick, and the Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. In fine, three ſorts of people are ſent into the world, purpoſely to martyrize man in this life; the Lawyer torments the purſe, the Phyſician the Body, and the Divine the ſoul. But theſe Maſters of the Mules brag on't too; for mine comming one day into my chamber, I onely ſaid, <hi>Quot,</hi> to him; this impudent homicide preſently apprehending, that I ask'd him the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his murders, laying hold of his great beard, anſwered me, <hi>

That which I concluded upon the brazen impudence of this perſon, was, That if the reſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion confeſſed leſſe, they notwithſtanding did as much: That this was contented onely with killing, and that his companions to murder added treachery. That if one would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56652:70"/>
write the Phyſitians travells, one could not count them, by the Epitaphs onely of one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: And, in fine, the Feavour aſſaults us, the Phyſitian kills us, and the Prieſt ſings. But 'twere nothing, for Madam <hi>Faculty</hi> to ſend our bodies to the grave, if ſhe did not attempt our ſouls too. The Chirurgion would run mad, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then not kill with his lint, all thoſe that are ſhipwrackt in his hands, and ſend them to ſleep with their fathers. Let us conclude then, Sir, that ſometimes they ſend death and his fyth, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a grain of <hi>Mandragon,</hi> otherwhile liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a Serringe, ſometimes upon the point of a Launcet, that ſometimes with a Julip, they make us die in <hi>October;</hi> and, in fine, they uſually cloath their poiſonings in ſo fine tearms, that not long ſince I thought, that mine had obtained for me of the King an Abbey, <hi>in commendum,</hi> when he told me, that he was a going to give me a Benefice for the belly. Oh! how glad I ſhould have been, if I could have found ſome way equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally to have beaten him, as the country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench did, who being asked by a Mountebank, whether ſhe had any Poulxe, (which in French ſignifies alſo Lice) ſhe anſwered him with boxes on the ears, and good ſcratches, that he was a fool, and that in all her life ſhe never had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lice nor Fleas. But their crimes are too great, to be puniſh'd onely by equivocation, let us ſummon them to appear before a Juſtice, in the name of the dead. Amongſt all mankind, they'l not find a Lawyer, thre's not a Judge, that cannot convince ſome of them of having killed his father; and amongſt all thoſe they have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56652:71"/>
that they have laid in the Church-yard, there is not a head, that doth not grind his teeth at them; ſhould they devour them, there were no fear, that the tears ſhed for their loſſe, would enlarge the Rivers. None weeps at the death of ſuch people, but thoſe that lament, that they lived ſo long. They are ſo beloved, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that concerns them is ſo, even their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry death, as if they were other Meſſias's, for they die for the good of Mankind.

               <p>THe Prophet lies, cowards do not die at your age; beſides, your life is not conſiderable enough, to be of thoſe, that the heavens takes care to mark the duration of. Thoſe of your ſcantling, may expect to die without a Comet, as well as a great many more that are like you, which Nature aſleep brings forth every day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice of. I have been told in many places, that you brag, that I had a deſigne to kill you. Alas my friend, do you think me ſo fooliſh, as to undertake an impoſſibility? Ha! pray tell me, to kill a man ſuddainly, that hath neither brain nor heart, in what place muſt I ſtrike him? I'le ne'r be ſeen, if your way of living impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by injuries, makes not the world believe; that you have undertaken to try, how long a man without a heart, can naturally ſubſiſt. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections were conſiderable enough, to oblige me to make you feel the wait of a cudgell. But the long continuance of your Anceſtors, whoſe antiquity you proclaim, will hold my hand. I find indeed ſome likelyhood, that it may be ſo, ſince a famous Genealogiſt made it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me, that all your titles of nobility were loſt in the Deluge; and that he proved to me, that you are as evidently a Gentleman, as the country-fellow did to King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, when he told him, That <hi>Noah</hi> had three ſons in the Ark, and that he was not certain, from which he was deſcended. But however, I ſhould have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56652:72"/>
gueſs'd, that you were of a good Houſe, for no body can deny, but yours is as new a one, as any there is in the Kingdom. If you'l believe me then, take a Coat of Arms, let the Heraulds be offended if they will; you ſhall give theſe: <hi>Vous porterez de gueules a deux felles, chargees de cloux ſans numbre; a la vilenie en caeur, &amp; un Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton Briſc ſur le chef.</hi> But as they give not Armes to a Peaſant, that one would make noble, till he hath rendred himſelf worthy of it, by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſome warlike act, I ſtay for you, where this lackey will conduct you, that according to the proweſſe of chivalry, that you ſhall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I may clap a pair of ſpurs on you. You need not fear to be the ſacrifice; for if fate waits for you any where, 'tis rather in the ſtable, than in the bed of honour, or upon the breach of a wall. And for my part, I that underſtand a little in Phyſiognomy, I engage you my word, that you are not deſtin'd to die in the field, unleſſe it be by a ſurfiet of graſſe. Conſult upon it, however, all the powers of your ſoul, that I may arm my ſelf quickly with a ſword, or that which they call in French a <hi>Baſton.</hi>

               <p>THat viſion of Quevedo which yeſterday we read together, left ſo many deep Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in me of the pleaſant things it repreſented, that the laſt night I dreamt I was in hell, but that hell ſeem'd to me very differing from ours; the variety made me believe, that they were the Eliſium fields; and indeed I had not gone farre but I ſaw the lake Avernus which I knew by the Greeks and the Romans deſcriptions of it, I ſaw <hi>Acheron,</hi> and the flood <hi>Lethe,</hi> the vigilant <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the Gorgons, the Furies, and the Parques, <hi>Ixion</hi> upon his wheele, <hi>Tityus</hi> devoured by a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many other things that are amply deſcribed in the Mythology. Having gone a little further, I met divers perſons cloathed in the Greek and the Roman faſhions, the one ſpeaking Greek, the others Latin; and I perceived others imployed in leading them to ſeverall apartments: they all ſeem'd very ſociable, which made me put my ſelfe into their Company. I remember I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted one; and, after many other diſcourſes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told him that I was a ſtranger, he anſwered me, that I then was come at a good time: for that day, the dead that have complained that they are ill aſſociated, are all to change their lodgings; and that, if I were curious, I might have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing it: he afterwards very courteouſly proffered me his hand; and I gave him mine. We go, continued he, into the Hall, where order is taken for the parting thoſe that have a mind to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56652:73"/>
leave me another, and lodging them with others, we ſhall have the Convenience to ſee at eaſe, without tyring our ſelves, how every one will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelfe to make his cauſe good. We walked together then to the place, where at laſt we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. My guide gave me a place juſt by him, and by good fortune it hapned to be ſo near the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Chaire, that we could heare plainly each parties difference. As they came out of their ancient habitations, I obſerved (if I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) not as one would think they ſhould have done, the kings with the Kings, &amp;c. but many times the king, with the ſhepheards, Philoſophers with peaſants, very beautifull perſons with very deformed ones, and old with young ones. But to begin, I perceived <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was very weary of his company which were a Company of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who by their continuall babble diſturbed his high ſpeculations. The Judge that governed there, told him, that eſteeming him a man of a great memory, ſince after fifteen hundred yeares, he could remember that he had been at the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> he was coupled with thoſe perſons that were not unprovided of it. Ho! if that be all the reaſon (ſaid he) why you lodge me with theſe tumblers, you may as well put me indifferently with any of the other dead; for there's hardly a deceaſed perſon here (if you'l believe their Epitaphe) that is not of happy Memory: ſince then they are not the onely perſons, with which I ſympathiſe for Gods ſake deliver me from the troubleſome prating of theſe Kings and Queens, whoſe Reigne laſteth but two or three houres, Theſe reaſons being heard, the Judge ſent him to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56652:73"/>
another place I know, but where I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Arieſto, Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Elian,</hi> &amp; many other natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, having had to do with Beaſts were coupled with the Moors, and the painter <hi>Zeuxis</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lodged with them, his picture of grapes which the birds came to peck having convinced him of preſumption. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> deſired no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to be ſet among the Lorrains, ſaying that he ſhould agree with them very well, becauſe he perfectly knew the nature of ſimples. But they conſidered better and ſent him to <hi>Pelias</hi> his daufters, charging him to teach them to know the virtue of hearbs better then they did when they would have made their father young againe. <hi>Raimond Lulus</hi> that ſwore he had made <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> was placed with certaine rich Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards that had done the like. <hi>Lucan</hi> that <hi>Nero</hi> put to death, jealous of his Poem of the Pharſalian warres, aſſociated himſelfe with ſome little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that dyed of the wormes. The Pimpes apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fell to <hi>Virgils</hi> ſhare for having debauched <hi>Dido,</hi> who (had it not been for him) had been a very diſcreet Lady. <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Acteon,</hi> Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls by chance, were lodg'd together, as perſons that their Eyes had rendred miſerable; they choſe a retireing place very obſcure, fearing (ſaid they) to ſee too much. I ſaw <hi>Orpheus</hi> lodged with the Ballat ſingers of <hi>Pont-neuf,</hi> becauſe they could allure beaſts. <hi>Aeſop</hi> and <hi>Apulaeus,</hi> kept houſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by reaſon of the conformity of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, for <hi>Aeſop</hi> of an Aſſe made a Man, making him ſpeake, and <hi>Apulaens</hi> of a man made an aſſe making him bray. <hi>Romulus</hi> ranckt himſelfe with the faulconers, becauſe he trained up birds to fly,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56652:74"/>
not a Partridge, but the Roman Empire. They talkt of putting Caeſar amongſt the Gameſters, I askt the reaſon, and was anſwered, Becauſe that with one caſt that he threw upon the Rubicon, he wonne the Empire of the world; nevertheleſſe they thought it more convenient to cruſh his pride, by putting him among the ſlaves that were heretofore thought to have ſpells to run with; you may, ſay'd the maſter of the Ceremonies to him, make triall once againe of your <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</hi> They lodg'd <hi>Brutus</hi> with thoſe that uſed to ride the Bears becauſe he was not afraid of ſpirits. <hi>Caſſius</hi> whoſe ill ſight had cauſed his death, among the great bellyed women whoſeſight is dangerous. <hi>Caligula</hi> would needs have had a more Magnificent apartement then <hi>Dacius,</hi> becauſe his adventures were incomparably more glorious: for, ſaid he, I <hi>Caligula,</hi> I made my horſe an Emperour, and <hi>Darins</hi> was made an Emperour by his horſe. <hi>Nero</hi> appeared next, whom they joyned with a company of fidlers, that he might perfect himſelfe: they would have coupled him with <hi>Timon</hi> man's enemy, but fearing leſt that nature one day might ſympathiſe with their wiſhes, and make but one Generall head of all mankind, there might be a diſpute betwixt them who ſhould cut it off. I ſaw king <hi>Numa</hi> preſent a petition that he might be permitted to dwell with a certaine famous Hydromancer who formerly had done Miracles by water, as being as capable as t'other, having made the fountaine <hi>Aegerie</hi> ſpeak, and rendred it ſo cleare-ſighted in ſtate-affaires, that whereas an other Ingeneere would have conducted that, he ſuffered himſelfe to be guided by it. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56652:74"/>
was put into a Mountebanks hands, who promiſed himſelf great gains, by ſhowing him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſuch a beaſt had not yet been ſeen. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus</hi> took it ill, to ſee himſelf coupled with the curers of incurable diſeaſes; but he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with reaſon, when they told him, that it was, becauſe he, like them, had couſened death. <hi>Jaſon</hi> was much out of countenance, to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a great Hall, among a company of Spaniſh Courtiers, becauſe he underſtood not their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; for he could not imagine what they meant, when he was told, that all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of thoſe young Knights, tended (as well as his) but to the golden Fleece. But conſider a little, what 'tis to apply ones ſelf to the reading of things fabulous, in an age, whoſe weakneſſes adds faith to all one knowes. I have read nothing in the fables of the Heathens, that did not confuſedly appear again in my fancy. Me-thoughts I ſaw <hi>Jupiter</hi> ranked with the fools, for that <hi>Momus</hi> had told, that he had been tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd: <hi>Jupiter</hi> being offended, ask'd, By trepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what the fool meant? That, anſwered <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> when <hi>Vulcans</hi> grace clove your brain, to make you bring forth <hi>Minerva.</hi> The old <hi>Saturn</hi> that underſtood no cunning, received without murmuring the company of a troop of Mowers, becauſe of the conformity of the Scepter. <hi>Phoebus</hi> was made to follow ſome experienced players at Battledore, with order not to leave them, till he had learnt, not to take his friends head any more for a mark. Me-thoughts I heard <hi>Svſiphus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to accoſt certain ſtone-hewers, that were there, to rid himſelf of his Rock to them;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56652:75"/>
I know not if he diſpoſed of it, becauſe curioſity made me turn my eye upon <hi>Thetis,</hi> who diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the choice of an aſſociate; they put her by a certain Hypocondriack, who thinking himſelf Brick, would not drink, for fear of ſpoiling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for as if ſhe formerly had feared the ſame thing, ſhe durſt not dip her ſon <hi>Achilles</hi> heel into the Sea, wholly to immortalize him. <hi>Hecate</hi> thruſt into the croud, to get to <hi>Garagantua</hi>'s mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; For, ſaid ſhe, if I have three faces, this hath one that is ſo big, that 'tis worth them all. 'Twas moved, that <hi>Io</hi> might be lodged with <hi>Poppea, Nero</hi>'s wife, for certain reaſons which I cannot call to mind: This Princeſſe was content, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, t'other would have a care how ſhe kickt, for ſhe was much afraid of 'em. <hi>Dedalus,</hi> the great artizan, made no reſiſtance, although they gave him for companions, Sergeants, Clarks, and Atturnies, and other men of the horn, becauſe he was told, that quills were the inſtruments of their miſchief, as well as of his; and that if they had not ſometimes plaid the Harpyers, they would not have been brought to the beggars Fiddle. <hi>Dalila, Samſon</hi>'s Miſtreſſe, was put amongſt the bald-pates; for fear if ſhe had been with any others, ſhe ſhould have ſerv'd them as ſhe did <hi>Samſon. Porcia</hi> was placed with thoſe, that had the green ſickneſſe, the Judges of hell ſuſpecting her to have it, ſince ſhe ſwallowed coals. <hi>Jocaſte</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> kept houſe together, becauſe they had both of them been mothers and wives to their ſons, and twice made big by the ſame child. I ſaw every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very buſie to accompany <hi>Artemiſe;</hi> ſome
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56652:75"/>
would joyne her again to her husband, becauſe of their ſo much extolled love; others would cartie her to the Hoſpitall of great bellied women: But ſhe quieted all their differences, lodging her ſelf on her own accord, with ſome laundreſſes that ſhe found there; upon condition, though, ſaid ſhe to them, that if I help you in your Bucks, the Aſhes ſhall be at my diſpoſall. <hi>Theſeus</hi> deſired to lodge with the Weavers, intending to teach them how to guide the thread. <hi>Perſeus, Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi>'s Brave, found himſelf well, with all the inſtitutors of Orders indifferently, becauſe they, like him, have all of them defended women. <hi>Nero,</hi> for whoſe place there was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, choſe at laſt of himſelf <hi>Eroſtrato</hi>'s apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that famous madman, that fir'd <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple; For I am, ſaid the Emperour, ſtrutting up and down, one that loves as well as he, to warm my ſelf at a good great fire. <hi>Juvenal, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Horace, Martial,</hi> and almoſt all the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatiſts and Satyrs, were ſent to the Manage, with the Academick riders, becauſe the one and the other have had the reputation of Prickers. They put likewiſe with theſe Poets, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pin-makers, Point-makers, Cutlers, and others, whoſe work is good for nothing, unleſſe it be ſharp. The Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> that volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily drowned himſelf in a barrell of Malmſie, went looking about for <hi>Diagenes,</hi> in hopes to get a room in his Tub; but he being not to be found, and they perceiving great <hi>Socrates,</hi> that was not yet coupled, Here's your buſineſſe, ſay they to him; for both you, and this Philoſopher, died by drinking, <hi>Socrates</hi> made a low bowe to his Judges,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56652:76"/>
and pointing, ſhewed them old <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> that ſtaid for a companion; order was given to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances Heros, to take him along with them, He is a perſon (ſaid the Harbinger that matcht them) from whom you'l have a great deal of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; he hath a heart of fleſh, you cannot tell him your adventures, (as amongſt you 'tis a thing inevitable) without drawing tears from him; for he is no leſſe tender of weeping, then your ſelves. <hi>Euridice</hi> took <hi>Achilles</hi> by the hand; Let's along, let's go, ſaid ſhe, for they cannot match us better, ſince both of us have our ſouls in our heels. I ſaw <hi>Curtius,</hi> that famous Roman, that caſt himſelf into the gulph to ſave <hi>Rome,</hi> placed with a certain brutiſh fellow, that loſt his life, in the protection of a debauched woman; I much wondred to ſee them couple perſons ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; but I was told, that both of them died for the Re-publick. Afterwards they made <hi>Icarus</hi> and <hi>Prometheus</hi> companions, the one and the other having been addicted to ſteal. <hi>Echo</hi> was lodged with our modern Authors, becauſe, like her, they ſay but what others have ſaid before 'em. The Triumvirate of <hi>Rome,</hi> with that of <hi>Hell,</hi> that is, <hi>Anthony, Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> with <hi>Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manth, Aeaques,</hi> and <hi>Minos;</hi> becauſe it was ſaid, that thoſe as well as theſe, had been Judges of Death. They were about to put <hi>Flamel,</hi> who pretended to have found the Stone, with thoſe that were dead of that diſeaſe; but he was much offended, and cried, That his was the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, and that there was an infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between the vertues of theſe two ſorts of Stones; for they, continued he, are not tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56652:76"/>
with theirs, till after it is made; but we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe are moſt troubled in the making it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we are never cut of ours. Theſe reaſons heard, they ſent him to finde out <hi>Joſhua,</hi> becauſe that ſome of them have bragg'd, that they had, as well as he, fix'd the Sun. Abundance of other Chymiſts followed this, with great reſpect, and received as Oracles the follies that he diſperſed, in which, theſe people thought, that the ſecret of the great work lay hid. They were divided, one half was put with Colliers, as men of the Furnace, and the other with thoſe, that have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven blowes to Princes. <hi>Hecube</hi> was placed with <hi>Cerberus,</hi> to augment the number of infernall Porters, ſhe bark't againſt the Officers for this affront; but at laſt they ſatisfied her, telling her, that ſhe was a three-headed monſter, as well as t'other, ſince ſhe had one as ſhe was a Bitch, as a Woman two, and that one and two made three. I remember, they put ſome by themſelves, amongſt which was <hi>Midas,</hi> becauſe he is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man in the world, that hath complained of being too rich. <hi>Phocion</hi> likewiſe was apart by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he being onely found, that had ever given mony to die; and <hi>Pigmalion</hi> alſo was alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe never none but he married a dumb woman. After this diſpoſall of things, by which every one had their proper place, the repreſentations of my Dream grew leſſe diſtinct, and I could onely perceive a general figure of things; as for example. I ſaw a whole body of Thieves, joyne company with the Fowlers now adaies, becauſe they ſhoot flying; our Writers of <hi>Romances</hi> with <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> becauſe, like him, in a moment, they do
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56652:77"/>
miraculous cures; the Hangmen with the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, becauſe they are paid for killing; a great company of Fencers deſired to be lodged with theſe of the faculty, becauſe the art of Fencing teaches them, as well as it doth the Phyſitians, the knowledge of the Quart and the Tierce: But they were put among the Shoo-makers, in regard the perfection of the Art conſiſts, in the well making of a Boot. Among the confuſed noiſe of a number of male-contents, I diſtinguiſhed the voice of <hi>Bouteville,</hi> who thunder'd, and was monſtrouſly enraged, that every one refuſed his company, but 'twas to no purpoſe; none durſt come neer him, for fear of being engaged in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells. This man carried ſolitude with him, and I think, he would have been fain to have made himſelf a Hermit, if he had not at laſt applyed himſelf to the great Grammarians, that invented Duels. A Mountebank that ſold his medecines, encreaſed the croud, by the number of fools that were got about him; many adviſed with him, and amongſt the reſt I ſaw <hi>Orpheus</hi> his wife, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of him a Cataplaſm, for the itch of the eyes. There was <hi>Priam</hi> likewiſe, that came for an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent for a burn; but the <hi>Saltinbanca</hi> had not enough, for the whole City of this poor Prince was all burnt. I ſaw there abundance of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers condemned to the fire, that they might ſee clear, into ſome buſineſſes too obſcure. As for the wiſe-men, they were put with the Architects, as perſons, that in all things ought to uſe Rule and Compaſſe. 'Twas impoſſible to get the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from the Furies, ſo fraid were they to want Torches. I much wondred to meet <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56652:77"/>
who expecting to be placed, in the meane time lay-upon ſome ſtones to reſt himſelf. I askt him if 'twould not be more for his eaſe to lye upon a bed: I ſhould fear, ſaid he, that the heat of the feathers would do me more hurt then the ſtones; In the mean while <hi>Agripina, Nero's</hi> Mother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to revenge her quarrell with <hi>Sencca</hi> who publiſht that ſhe had had four Children ſince her Marriage, ſhe appeared furious, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of her ſenſes, but <hi>Nero</hi> quieted her by theſe words; Madame, one muſt believe but halfe what a ſlaunderer ſaith. The Parques, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be with poore Country wenches that feed their husbands with their diſtaffes, when they were told that thoſe Country girles as well as they had ſpun mens lives. There came thither certaine Thraſhers, and becauſe they wanted flails, or ſcourges, they gave them <hi>Attila</hi> to make uſe of inſtead of others. The impudent perſons aſſociated themſelves with the keepers of Lions, that they might learne of them, never to change colour, I ſhould have ſeen a great deale more, if my Clock ſtriking Eleaven had not waked me and put me in mind that at all houres of the night, and day, I am, and will ever be untill my laſt ſleepe,</p>

               <p>'TIs true I am a Mazarin, 'tis neither fear nor hopes that makes me ſo ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, 'tis the pleaſure that I take in a truth, when I pronounce it. I love to make it known if not as much as I can, at leaſtwiſe as much as I dare; and I have ſuch an Antipathy to his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that to give them juſtly the lye, I could with a good heart come from t'other world. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture took ſo little care to make me a good Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, that ſhe gave me but one tongue, for my heart, and for my fortune; if I had been deſirous of the Applauſes of <hi>Paris,</hi> or pretended to the Reputation of being Eloquent, I ſhould have writ in favour of the <hi>ſlingers,</hi> becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Eaſie to perſwade the people, then that which is eaſie to believe: But as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too, that more ſhow a vulgar ſoul, then to be of the ſame opinion with the vulgar, I reſiſt as much as poſſible the rapidity of the torrent, that I may not be carried away with the ſtream: and, to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56652:78"/>
begin, I declare to you once more that I am a Mazarin. I am not however ſo unreaſonable, as not to declare to you the cauſe why I betook my ſelfe to your party: know then, that t'was becauſe I found it the Juſteſt, and becauſe 'tis true that nothing can acquit us of the obedience we owe to our lawfull Soveraign: for however the <hi>ſlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſtone us for it, I pretend to returne it them ſo ſmartly, that I'le drive them from all the Forts that their calumny hath reared againſt his Eminence. The firſt thing that in vaine the Poets of <hi>Pont neuf</hi> let fly (againſt the reputation of this great Perſon) was the alleadging that he was an Italian: To that I anſwer (not to theſe Heroes of blotted. Paper, but to reaſonable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that deſerve to be diſabuſed) that an honeſt man is neither a French man, a Dutch man, nor a Spaniard; he is a Coſmopolite a Citizen, of the world, and his Country is every where: but I grant that the Cardinall is a ſtranger; are we not the more obliged to him that he will leave his domeſtick Gods, to defend ours? Beſides if he were a naturall Sicilian (as they believe) he is not for all that a vaſſail of the King of Spain; for Hiſtory is witneſſe that our Lillies have more right to the ſoveraignity of that ſtate, then the Caſtles of Caſtile,</p>
               <p>But they are very ill in form'd of his Cradle; for although the family of the Mazarins was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally Sicilians, the Cardinal was born in Rome, and ſince he is Citizen of a neuter towne, he might conſequently engage himſelfe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that nation he pleaſed to make choice of: 'tis well known that the people of Rome, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56652:79"/>
the nobles and Cardinals do thus take upon them the particular protection of a king or Prince, or a Republique: there are ſome that hold for France, others for Spaine, and others for other Soveraignes, and his Eminence embracing the juſtneſſe of our Cauſe, hath followed the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Almighty, who alwayes eſpouſes the intereſt of the juſt. Certainly the happy ſucceſſes of our Armies, hath well enough ſhowed both the Excellency of his choice, and the juſtneſſe of our cauſe, and our kingdome ſwelling under his Adminiſtration hath witneſſed that for his ſake heaven hath undertaken our quarrel; and indeed almoſt all thoſe that deſired his departure, have ſince been found Penſioners to the Enemies of this Crowne; and the glorious actions of our great Cardinal, which multiply his rayes, hath plainly ſhowed that his luſtre dazeling and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eyes, they have imitated the woolvs in the Fable, that promiſed the ſheep not to meddle with them, if they would ſend away the dog from their ſheepe-fold.</p>
               <p>Well, theſe State-reformers (who cover their black deſigns with the Cloak of publique Benefit) have nothing elſe to ſay but that the Cardinal is an Italian, yeas. But what i'ſt they complaine of? he advances none but French, and thoſe whoſe greatneſſe cannot have any Eclipſe; he hath not made any Creature, and we ſee at Court thirty Italians, Perſons of quality of great families, ſome drawne hither by their neereneſſe of blood to him, others by his renoune, that have been heer idle this ten yeares, becauſe he thought them not fit for the Kings ſervice. In the meane time
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56652:79"/>
what wiſdome ſoever he makes uſe of, in the Conduct of the Government, it doth not pleaſe our Politique Citizens; they cry down his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. But 'tis no new thing for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to impute to the good fortune of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the ill offices of their own. In that envious humour that gnawes them, they'l com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that they have nothing to complaine of: becauſe his Eminence hath raiſed no Creatures they call him ungratefull; if he had advanced any, they would have accuſed him of ambition. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath carried our frontiers into <hi>Italy,</hi> he is a traitor to his owne country; and if he had not led our armies that way, there had then been a private underſtanding againſt us between him and his Country-men: what way ſoever the glory of this kingdome is advance't, his Eminence will alwayes be to blame, unleſſe his Enemies be let become great enough not to envy him any longer. Let the fire of Calumnie uſe his violence againſt him as long as he pleaſes his Reputation is a rock in the midſt of the billowes, that the waves waſhes inſtead of ſhaking; and that very ſtrength that makes it able to ſupport the burthen of an Empire, will not leave him when it concernes him to beare injuries. The ſecond Batterie that they rear againſt him, aſſaults his birth: What, are we obliged to inſtruct thoſe that are voluntarily ignorant? muſt we teach them that onely pretend not to know that the family of the Mazarins, whence came the Cardinals father, is not only one of the Moſt noble families, but likewiſe of the beſt allied in <hi>Italy;</hi> and that the Armes of his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Anceſtors are of the moſt ancient that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56652:80"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> hath preſerv'd the name of. The ignorance of fools would have a great priviledge, if we were obliged to hear patiently their contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to all the truths that they are unacquainted withall. The people of the Market, and of the place <hi>Maubert,</hi> will not agree to theſe truths, that are ſo manifeſt; but theſe people would not be of the rout, if they could be truly informed of things. Beſides, 'tis the cuſtom, where they find eminent vertues, above their reach, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves by ſlandering it. Although Cardinall <hi>Richelieu</hi> was well known, to come from one of the antienteſt Houſes in <hi>Poiton,</hi> that he was of kin to the Lords of greateſt quality in <hi>France,</hi> and that our very Princes took part with him, in the blood of their Anceſtors; his Nobility was notwithſtanding queſtion'd. Such tales as theſe are never wanting, in ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mouths, who ſeek to draw a pretence from every thing, to deny their obedience to thoſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that heaven hath placed over them.</p>
               <p>They proſecute him further, and accuſe him of protecting the Cardinalls Barbarins. Would it have been for the honour of <hi>France,</hi> to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed thoſe ſacred perſons, that implored our aid, the Nephews of a Pope too, that all the time he reigned, was a true friend to <hi>France?</hi> Other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have imputed this deniall, to a want of power to protect them; and this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of weakneſſe, would it not have been of great prejudice to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe Empire is as much maintained by reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as by force?</p>
               <p>When our calumniators felt themſelves too
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56652:80"/>
much preſſ'd in this place, they preſently ſhift arguments, and cry out, that he hath oppreſſed the people with great extortions. I know not, if this rabble hold intelligence with forraigne Kingdoms, that inform them more truly of the management of the Treaſury, then the Councill, the Eſpargne, and the Chamber of Accounts, are informed. But I know well, that the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> that accuſed him of Tranſportation, or ill management of ſo much monyes, after having made a ſtrict examination, and ſpent much time in it, the Negotiations of <hi>Cantarini,</hi> did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to him ſo much, as the appropriation of a Cardecu; and I believe, his enemies would not have forgot to charge him with <hi>Peculate,</hi> if he could have been convinced, rather then of falſe crimes, with which they have endeavoured to ſoil his reputation, for want of true ones. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is any impoſt laid upon the Kingdom now, that was not eſtabliſhed in the other reigne? Me-thinks, they are not exacted with ſo much rigour now, as was uſed then, although the Stock advanced by the Treaters, was conſumed in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s life-time, and that the ſame Warrs muſt be continued againſt as many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as before. Do they believe then, that five or ſix Armies are paid with the leaves of an Oak? that with it, new Levies are made, that Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from all places can be maintained, that we can make whole Provinces and Kingdoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from our enemies; and, in fine, that an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter of State can govern, to the hazard of all the Potentates of the world, without prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſums of mony, which are onely capable to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56652:81"/>
buy our peace. Yeas, Mr. <hi>Draper</hi> fancies, that 'tis with the government of a Monarchy, as with his Chamber-maid's wages, or his ſon <hi>Peter</hi>'s board.</p>
               <p>They add to their ridiculous ſtories, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes things have ſucceeded well, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of what he counſelled. I believe it, for he is Maſter of his own reaſon, and not of the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of fortune. How often do we ſee good ſucceſs authoriſe ill conduct? And I ſhould much more wonder, that, through the obſcurity of things to come, a man could with the eyes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, diſpoſe of hazardous events, and by his diligence, guide the ſteps of Fate.</p>
               <p>When theſe praters have been repulſed in this aſſault, they charge him with a Palace that he hath built at Rome: But let them know, that the leaſt Cardinall in the Court hath his Palace: Being a French Cardinall, the pomp of a Palace in <hi>Rome,</hi> is for the glory of <hi>France,</hi> as his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would be, in the opinion of the Italians, a ſhame to our Nation. Some of our Kings (I ſpeak of the moſt Auguſt) have furniſhed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls with very conſiderable ſums, to build their Palaces, upon condition, they would place our Lillies over the Portall. Yet in ſpight of all theſe ſpeciall reaſons, a poor little Mercer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up his ribbands, will not allow the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to build a houſe at his own charges.</p>
               <p>The ſcum murmurs beſides, that if <hi>France</hi> ſhould forſake him, he hath no retyring place. What, blind Sirs, becauſe he hath purchaſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies every where, by protecting you, is he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an hatefull and an abhominable perſon? and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56652:81"/>
do you judge him unworthy of pardon? His fault indeed is unpardonable, of having ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerved ungratefull perſons; and God, that gave him as an example of thoſe that expoſed themſelves for the people, hath permitted, that having comported himſelf as gallantly as <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, Pericles,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he ſhould meet with as wicked Citizens, as they did, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly condemned thoſe great perſonages.</p>
               <p>He is blamed likewiſe, that he refuſed peace; and my Laundreſſe ſwore to me, that <hi>Spain</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it on very honourable and advantageous tearms, for this Kingdom. I exhort thoſe that are wiſe, not to judge by outward appearances, and to remember, that the time when our <hi>plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries</hi> refuſed to conclude it, was, when the moſt violent fits of the <hi>Naples</hi> revolt, firſt began, and when fortune ſeemed to offer us the reſtitution of a Kingdom, that belongs to us. 'Twould have been contrary to the rules of human prudence; to neglect that conqueſt, that we were almoſt ſure of. Beſides, the Catholick King alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, that we ſhould abandon the intereſts of the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> 'twas not lawfull for us to ſigne to that Peace, (unleſſe we would have been thought the moſt perfidious of Nations) and not comprehend him in the Treaty, ſince he attempted onely upon our word and promiſe, to ſet the Crown upon his Families head.</p>
               <p>But this is the laſt and greateſt ſhock, by which they pretend to obſcure the brightneſſe of his glory. He is (ſay they) author of the Siege of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> I anſwer them in the firſt place, That it was his duty to give ſuch advice, the Queen Regent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56652:82"/>
having had notice of many plots, that were contriving againſt the perſon of the King: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the very common report is ſatisfied, that he was not the firſt, that gave his voice for this enterpriſe; and contrariwiſe, he hath been ever blamed, to have been too much inclined to clemency. Beſides, why muſt it needs be, that he alone gave order, for the carrying away of our young Prince. Thoſe that underſtand any thing, know, that he is not alone in the Councill; and that he doth but give his opinion like others. He is far then from being the onely author of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; he would not ſuffer things to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, that without doubt would have haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reduction of this City, becauſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to his nature a little too cruell. And if the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ask me, what thoſe things were; I'le make them underſtand, that with a great deal of juſtice, he might have puniſhed with death the priſoners of war, as traitors and rebells to their King. He could beſides, in one night, if he had pleaſed, by the intelligence that he had from within, have cauſed the Suburbs, that were but poorly guarded, to have been plunder'd and burnt, have drove thoſe that fled into the City to ſtarve it, or put them all to the ſword, after the example of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that made half the women of <hi>Paris</hi> widowes in one day; and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this blood, have abated the feavour of the Inhabitants. But inſtead of theſe acts of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he forbids the beating down of thoſe Mills, that were about the City, although he knew, that by their means, they continually received great quantity of corn. And although he had notice of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56652:82"/>
all the marches of their Souldiers, he often made the royal Troops ſteer another courſe, then that of our Convoyes, that they might not be obliged to famiſh, and beat us at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>He hath beſieged <hi>Paris</hi> then, but in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? like one that was afraid to take it, like a good father to his children: He was content to ſhow them the rods, and threatned them a great while, that they might have leaſure to repent. And to ſpeak freely, their diſeaſe being an effect of their debauches, it was the duty of a good Phyſitian, to make them obſerve a dyet. In truth, if I might diſpenſe with a little ſport, in a matter of this importance, I would ſay, that our King ſeeing ſo many Kings on Twelfth Eve, come by night into his Capitoll, he went out againſt them, and would adventure to conquer fifty thouſand Monarchs.</p>
               <p>Theſe, I think, are all the aſperſions, by which this raſcality have endeavoured, to render odious the perſon of his Eminence, without ever having had any one lawfull cauſe to complain of him: Nevertheleſſe they forbear not to cry down his moſt eminent vertues, to blame his adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prefer to him his Predeceſſor; but by what reaſon, I know not, if it be not perhaps, that Cardinall <hi>Mazarin</hi> ſends none out of the world privately, and without cauſe; becauſe he hath not a Court, fat with the blood of people; becauſe he takes not off the heads of Counts, Mareſchalls, and of Dukes and Peers of <hi>France;</hi> becauſe he keeps not the Prince from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of buſineſſes, becauſe he is not a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive man; infine, becauſe they ſee him ſo mild,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56652:83"/>
that the very attempters againſt him foreſee their pardon: this is the reaſon why theſe factious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, do not eſteem him a great Polititian. O! ſtupid vulgar! a Benigne Miniſter diſpleaſes thee, take heed the Misfortune of the Birds in the fable befalls you not, who having demanded a king was not content to be govern'd by the Dove that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> gave them, that ruled mildly; but ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tund him for an another, that he ſent them an Eagle that devour'd them all. The Cardinall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed was a great man, as well as his ſucceſſor, but having not the boldneſſe to decide betwixt the merit of theſe two eminent perſons, I'le be contented to put the world in mind that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall Richelieu had the honour to be Choſen by king Lewis the Thirteenth the moſt juſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Europe,</hi> to be his Miniſter, and Cardinall Mazarin, by the Cardinall Richelieu himſelfe, the greateſt head peece of that age.</p>
               <p>They are to blame likewiſe to alleage that we are under a government, where Armes, Letters, and Piety are contemned. I'le maintaine to the contrary, that they never were ſo well eſteem'd of. For Armes; witneſſe <hi>Monſieur Gaſtion,</hi> and <hi>de Ranthau,</hi> who by their Credit and counſell, were made Marſhalls of France; without ſpeaking of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, who by the Queens rewards, poſſeſſeſt he alone, more wealth then ſome Kings of <hi>Europ:</hi> for Piety, father <hi>Vincent</hi> ſhall anſwer; to whom ſhe hath committed the charge of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the conſciences, abilityes, and life, of thoſe that pretend to benefices: for Letters, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the wiſe choice ſhe hath made of one of the moſt judicious Philoſophers of our time, for to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56652:83"/>
inſtruct <hi>Monſieur</hi> the kings brother, witneſſe the learned <hi>Naude</hi> whom he honours with his Eſteeme, admitting him to his table, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents! In briefe witneſſe that great and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> built for the publique, to which by his meanes and care, all the learned of <hi>Europe</hi> contribute. What can we add more, Sirs? nothing, after this; unleſſe, that the Glory of this kingdome cannot riſe higher, ſince ſhe is in the hands of his Eminence. Do you not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at laſt that the People ſhould leave off vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the patience of their Prince, by the wrong they do to his Favorites; that they ſhould accept with thankfullneſſe the pardon that is offered them, which they are not worthy of? no Sir, they deſerve it not, for is't a fault pardonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt ones King, the lively image of God? to take armes againſt him that he hath given us to exerciſe over our Lives and fortunes, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Almighty power? I'ſt not to accuſe his divine majeſty of Error, to controle the will of the Maſter he hath choſen us? I know, it may be objected, that the particulars of a Republique are not out of the way of ſalvation. But 'tis very true, nevertheleſſe, that as God is but one, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the univerſe; and that as the government of the heavenly kingdome is Monarchicall, that on earth ought to be ſo likewiſe. The holy Scriptures witneſſe that God never appointed ſo much as one popular State, and ſome Rabbins aſſure us, that the ſinne of the Angels was, to have attempted to put themſelves under a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Do we not find that long before his coming, he gave <hi>David</hi> to be king over the people
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56652:84"/>
of Iſrael, and that ſince our Redemption, he hath ſent from heaven the holy Viall, with which he would have our kings ſacred. By a ſupernaturall Character to diſtinguiſh them from all thoſe that were to be born to obey them. The Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, that is the Image of the Triumphant, is govern'd Monarchically by the Popes, and we ſee that the very particular houſes muſt be govern'd by a kind of king too, that is, the father of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; 'Tis as the firſt ſpring in ſociety, that moves our actions to order, and 'tis the ſecret inſtinct that compells the whole world to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to kings. In vaine the people endeavour to extinguiſh that light in their ſouls, that guide them to ſubmiſſion, it is at laſt carried in ſpight of them by this firſt mover, and they are inforced to render their due obedience. But nevertheleſſe thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> have had the boldneſſe to lift up their hands againſt the Lord's Anointed, alleaging for a pretence, that 'tis not the King they aime at but his Favorite; as if, as a king is the image of God, a Favorite was not the image of the Prince. But 'tis not enough to ſay an image, he is his ſonne. When he ingenders according to the fleſh, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a Prince? when he ingenders according to his dignity, he begets a Favorite. As man, a ſucceſſor, as a king, a Creature; and if it be true that to Create is more noble then to Generate, becauſe Creation is Miraculous, we ought to adore a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, as he is the Miracle of a king: were it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then againſt his Eminence that they take up armes, do they think they are Chriſtians when they attempt againſt the life of a Prince of the Church; no Sir, they are Apoſtates, they offend
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56652:84"/>
the holy Ghoſt, that preſides at the promotion of all Cardinals, and you need not doubt but that hee I puniſh their ſacriledge with as much rigour, as he puniſh't the murther of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> whoſe death (however juſt) bled twenty yeares, through the throats of foure hundred thouſand French: But what can they promiſe themſelves by a rebellion that can never ſucceed? and if it ſhould ſo proſper as to overthrow Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, what advantage would they have by it? he that now poſſeſſes onely a Cloake would not then be maſter of it. They would be authors of a Lamentable deſolation, which their nephew's ſonnes would never ſee the end of: beſides t'were very ſtrange, if they ſhould think or perſwade themſelves that Chriſtendome could ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Eldeſt ſonne of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intereſſing her ſelfe for him? All the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches of Chriſtendome are they not concern'd for their conſervation of that king that can ſettle them againe in their Thrones, if their rebellious ſubjects ſhould one day throw them down? And ſuppoſe that this revolution could be brought about without a greater deſtruction then that which Holland yet bleeds for; I'le maintaine that a popular Government is the worſt ſcourge that God afflicts a State withall, when he would puniſh it. Is it not contrary to the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a Boatman or a Porter, ſhould have power to condemne the generall of an Army, and that the life of the greateſt perſon ſhould be at the diſpoſall of the meaneſt fool, that in all haſte will put him to death? But God be thanked we are farre enough off from ſuch a Confuſion.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56652:85"/>
Thoſe that name the Cardinall, without adding his Title, my Lord, already hide themſelves; and every one begins to believe, that'tis a hard matter to ſpeak like a raſcall, and not to be one. And if the whole Kingdome were in league againſt him, I ſhould be confident of his victory; for 'tis the fate of the Julies, to overcome the Gaules. I hope then, that we ſhall ſuddenly ſee a generall reconcilement in the minds of men, &amp; a perfect harmony, amongſt the divers members of the body of this State. Monſieur de <hi>Beaufort</hi> being animated but with French blood, 'tis not credible, but that blood will ſtay him, from dying his ſword in the breaſt of his mother; &amp; like little Rivers, after having ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time, reunite themſelves to the Ocean, whence they firſt came, I doe not doubt, but that this illuſtruous Blood, will incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate again ſuddainly with his ſpring-head, that is, the King; for the other Commanders, I cannot have ſo ill a thought of them, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they'l refuſe to follow the ſteps of ſo heroick an example; me-thinks, I ſee them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bow with reſpect, before the Image of the Prince. Reflecting what favour, the chief of their Families have received from precedent Kings, they are too juſt to be againſt it. That the fortune of another Family ſhould likewiſe, in his turn, have a favourable aſpect.</p>
               <p>Monſieur the <hi>Coadjutor</hi> knowes well, that the Duke of <hi>Rets</hi> his grand-father, was Favourit to <hi>Henry</hi> the third. Monſieur de <hi>Briſſac</hi> may have read, that his grandfather was raiſed to great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and dignities, by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur de <hi>Luynes</hi> hath ſeen his father have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56652:85"/>
power, over the heart and fortune of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth. And Monſieur de la <hi>Houdancourt</hi> yet remembers the time perhaps, that he was in favour under the ſame favourit of the King deceaſed. They have no cauſe then to complain, that my Lord, the Cardinall, ſhould now ſway; 'tis no more then their Anceſtors or themſelves at another time have done.</p>
               <p>But if all theſe conſiderations ſhould prove too weak, to bring them to their dutyes, they are noble; and the apprehenſion of appearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, for the benefits they have received from his Majeſty, will make them deſire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get theſe diſcontents, rather then to appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull. And the example of a thouſand trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that have returned injuries to the Court for her favours, will have no power over them, that know too well, that ingratitude is the vice of a raſcall, of which the Nobles are uncapable. It onely belongs to the Poets of the <hi>Pont-neuf,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Scarron,</hi> to vomit foam upon the purple of Kings and Cardinalls, and to lay out the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities, that he continually receives from the Court in paper, that he fills with Libels againſt him. After having brag'd, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a thouſand Francs of his Penſion from the Queen, he had the impudence to ſay, that if a thouſand more were not ſent him, 'twas not in his power to forbear another Satyre, that ſtrove with him to come to light; and conjured his friends to give ſpeedy notice of it, becauſe he could not poſſibly keep it any longer. Well, was ever ſuch an example of impudent ingratitude fees in any age? Ah! Sir, this was without doubt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56652:86"/>
the reaſon, that God (who foreſaw the number and the greatneſſe of his ſins) to puniſh him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, was fain to be twenty years before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with him, and by a continuall death cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtize thoſe crimes, that were not yet committed, but thoſe that he was to commit. Permit me a little, I beſeech you, to turn my diſcourſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to theſe Rebells. Seditious people! come and ſee an object worthy of Gods judgments, 'tis the monſtrous <hi>Scarron,</hi> that is given you for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the puniſhment, that the ungratefull, the traitors, and the ſlanderers of their Prince, are to ſuffer in Hell; conſider in him with what ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Heaven puniſhes calumny, ſedition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction? Come Burleſque writers, and ſee a compleat Hoſpitall, in the body of your <hi>Apollo;</hi> when you ſee the King's Evill that devours him, confeſſe, that he is not onely the Queens ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, (as he calls himſelf) but the Kings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; he dies every day in ſome member, and his tongue ſtaies till the laſt, that his howling may tell you the torments he endures. You ſee him, what I tell you is no ſtory; ſince I have been ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to you, he hath perhaps loſt his noſe, or his chin. Doth not ſuch a ſpectacle ſtir you up to repentance? Admire, ſtony-hearts, admire the ſecret judgment of the moſt High: Hearken with an ear of contrition. This ſpeaking Mummy, ſhe complains, that ſhe is not able to bear all the pains that ſhe endures. The very bleſſed ones, to puniſh his impieties, and his ſacriledges, teach Nature new infirmities, to confound him with. Already by their Miniſters, he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with the diſeaſe of St. <hi>Roch,</hi> of St. <hi>Fiacre,</hi>

of St. <hi>Clon,</hi> of St. <hi>Renne:</hi> And that we may, in a word, compriſe all the enemies that he hath in heaven, heaven it ſelf hath ordained, that he ſhould be ſick of the Saint. Admire then, admire, how great and profound are the ſecrets of the divine providence. She knew of the ingratitude of the Pariſians to their King, that was to break out in 1649. But not deſiring ſo many Victims, ſhe cauſed to be born forty years before, a man ungratefull enough, alone to expiate all the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, that a whole City had deſerved.

I foreſee that you do not: you know too well that that correſpondence and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety whoſe mutuall eſteeme knit our ſouls, is not a knot that Death can looſen; and the very inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſable hell where I am detained, is not farre enough to hinder my ſighs from reaching to you. I know, that you have been ſeen to ſhiver and tremble with anger againſt this Tyrant of the night, whoſe rigorous government I endure, and that the great <hi>Hercules,</hi> after having diſ-horned Bulls, torne Lions, ſtrangled Giants, and carried upon his ſhoulders the Machine of the world, that <hi>Atlas</hi> could not beare, is not a man to be affraid of the barking of a Dog, that keepes my Priſon Gate; 'tis a Monſter that hath but three heads, and <hi>Hydra</hi> that he overcame had ſeaven each of which grew to ſeaven more: Come then, O triumphant Protector of heaven! Come and take the laſt victory upon your Enemies; come into theſe dark Dens and take from death the Priviledge of Immortality; and at laſt reſolve to ſatisfie the ſuſpenſe that the terror of your arme holds nature in: you have ſpread your name enough over the Mountaines of the earth, and the ſtarres of the firmament; think of thoſe that languiſh in the Center of the world, oppreſſed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56652:87"/>
with the weight of the earth for having fought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your banner. Can you imagine, to what a miſerable condition the unfortunate <hi>Theſeus</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, now that his complaints makes his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ring againe in thoſe climates that the Sunne gives light to; he is in the moſt ſad and fataleſt quarter of the Eliſium fields, ſeated upon the trunck of a <hi>Lyprus;</hi> tore with Thunder, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whether he ſhould ſend you his Requeſt or his Epitaph; his eares affrighted and his Eyes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the croaking of Ravens, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall cryes of a cloud of Oſpreys; his head leaning on the black marble of a monument in the midſt of a frightfull Cymetire, environ'd with rivers of blood, where deadbodies float, whoſe ponderous motion is excited by the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſound of ſighs that the ſouls breathe out, that paſſe over her. This, O invincible <hi>Hero!</hi> is the fatall Imployment of thoſe yeares that I ought to ſpend more gloriouſly in your ſervice, but becauſe that no ſad Circumſtance ſhould be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my griefe I am tormented not onely by evill it ſelfe, but likewiſe by the Eternall fight of him. I'le tell you, that t'other day (excuſe me if I ſpeake in this manner in a place fill'd with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where blindneſſe raigns every where, and where every object weares a perpetuall black) t'other day then, whilſt the rigour of the moſt unfortunate aſpects that an accurſed Climate can be deadlily looked on: I perceived all affrighted, the horrible habitation of the Parques, who turn'd their eyes on mine. I was a long time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in conſidering theſe homicide mothers of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56652:88"/>
mankind, who had hung at their diſtaffs the haughty Arbitrer of peoples liberties, and wound as negligently the ſilk of a glorious Tyrant, as the thread of a ſimple ſhepheard. I conjured them by my tears, to ſpin out the thread of my life more quick, or elſe to break the woofe. And ſince the fear of death frighted me more, then death it ſelf, I deſired them to free me from a hundred thouſand torments, by one onely. But I read in their countenances, that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, not to grant my petition ſo ſoon. This frightfull company made me leave my abode; but alas, I fell into another more horrid, 'twas a vaſt floating Fen, in which being engaged, I found I was at the mercy of an hundred thouſand Vipers, that hath none, and who with their tongues bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with venom, having ſuckt on my cheeks the painfull degorgements of my heart, gave me in the room of it, the air of their hiſſings to breathe. There I ſaw thoſe famous offendors, whoſe crimes have condemned them to extream torments, bring themſelves forth again, by the fire that conſumed them, endure in the flames all the inſupportable torments of a froſt, and under the unmercifull Empire of a violent Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, have nothing left them of their being, but the power to ſuffer. I met <hi>Siſyphus</hi> at the top of a mountain, bewailing the loſſe of his ſtone, that was newly ſlipt from him. <hi>Tityus</hi> continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, to ſatisfie the inſatiable hunger of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that tore him. <hi>Ixion</hi> looſing at every turn of his wheel. The memory of the former <hi>Tantalus,</hi> devour'd by the very fruit, that he in vain
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56652:88"/>
endeavours to devour; &amp; the <hi>Danaides</hi> imployed, in continually powring into a tub full of holes, that they could not fill. There was there hard by, a very thick buſh, under which I diſcovered, through the fortifications of this vegetative La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, lean Envy, whoſe eyes were frightfully fix'd on the earth, the hands yellow and drie, the thighs quaking, and without fleſh, the ſtomack ſticking to the ſides, the breath contagious, the skin tan'd by the heat of the <hi>Acribilaria,</hi> who vomiting, was chewing a piece of a Toad half diſgeſted. Afterwards I had the converſation of the Furies, who were employed in ſuch rufull actions, that I leave them to imagination, leſt by the relating them, your deſigne of reſcuing me ſhould by their horrour be changed, with your courage. Behold, theſe are my misfortunes, O generous Prince, the relation that I have made to you, is not to call you to my ſuccour, for I ſhould ſtain the honour of great <hi>Alcides,</hi> if I ſhould think, that there were any need of words, to excite him to produce a vertuous action. And I am confident, that the time that he ſpends in the reading my Letter, will be all that ſhall ſtay him from taking this voyage, from which I may expect my liberty. But in the mean time, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the way to make an end of it; for how can I, that ſtand in need of the ſervice of all the world, dare to ſtyle my ſelf, O great <hi>Hercules,</hi>

                     <hi>Aenigma,</hi> upon Sleep.</head>
                  <p>I Was born nine hundred years before my ſiſter, and yet ſhe paſſeth for my elder; I think that her uglineſſe and deformity, is the cauſe of this errour: there is no body but hates her company and converſation; there comes not a word of good newes out of her mouth: And although ſhe hath more Altars on earth, than any of the other deities, ſhe receives no pleaſing ſacrifices, but the vows of the Deſpairers. But I that charm all thoſe that I come near, there paſſes not a day, but I ſee: that which breaths in the air, the ſea, &amp; the earth, fall at my feet. I find my cradle in the Suns tombe, and in my Coffin, the Sun finds his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. The perfecteſt and moſt amiable thing that man ever ſaw, was made the firſt day of my reign; Nature laid the foundation of my Throne, and makes my head in the higheſt place of a ſtately Palace, of which ſhe takes care, when I repoſe, to keep the door ſhut. And the workmanſhip of this Edifice, is elaborated with ſo much art, that no body ever yet knew the order and the ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of its Architecture. In fine, I make my abode in the centre of an unexplicable Labyrinth, where the reaſon of the wiſe and the fooliſh, of the learned and the idiot, wanders together. I have no Hoſte but my father; and although he be a great deal more rationall then I am, yet I make him go whither I pleaſe, and am his conductor. 'Tis to little purpoſe, in the mean time, that I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56652:90"/>
couſen him, a few howers doth ſo clearly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe him, that he reſolves (although in vain) to truſt no more to my falſities; for, in ſpight of him, I lay in irons the five ſlaves that ſerve him; as ſoon as they are tyred, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them, whether they will or no, to ſubmit themſelves to my caprichios; not but he endeavours to ſhun my re-encounter, but I watch him in places ſo black and dark, that he never failes of falling into my ſnares; he yields preſently to the character that my divinity, amaſes him with, inſomuch that he hath no eyes, but what are mine. Not but that I have many other powerfull adverſaries, the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt which, is the ſworn enemy to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who would long ſince have drove me out of the confines of his Kingdom, if the greateſt part of his ſubjects, had not, in my favour, revolted againſt him; and theſe revolters, that reaſon makes to riſe againſt their Tyrant, are the beſt govern'd, and the onely perſons that live under a perfect harmony: They protect my innocence, quiets thoſe diſturbances and clamours, that conſpire my ruine; introduce me by little and little into their Kingdome; and at laſt help me themſelves unawares, to become the Maſter of it. But I advance my victories a great deal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſhare with the god of day, the extent and the duration of his Empire; and if that half that I poſſeſſe be not the moſt glorious, 'tis at leaſt the moſt tranquil and quiet. I have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him beſides, that I intrench upon his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, when I pleaſe, and he cannot intrench upon mine. The Aſtre that gives light to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56652:90"/>
Univerſe, goes not down from our Horizon, till I yoak to my Chariot the one half of mankind. I ſtir up and maintain trouble among the people, to keep them at reſt. They muſt needs love me, for I uſe every one of them according to their humour; thoſe that are merily diſpoſed, I lead to Plaies, Balls, Feaſts, and other pleaſant diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments; the cholerick I lead to the wars, and plant them at the head of an Army, and make them break through thirty ſquadrons with their ſwords, gain victories, and take Kings priſoners; for thoſe that are melancholly, I ſink them into the darkeſt horrours of a frightful ſolitude, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them to the top of an hundred terrible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible Rocks, to make their abyſſe ſeem more deep to them. In fine, I give every body an occupation, according to his fancy; I inrich thoſe that are moſt miſerable, and ſometimes, in ſpight to fortune, I take pleaſure to precipitate hir fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourits, to the loweſt part of hir wheel; I raiſe likewiſe, when I pleaſe, a raſcall to a Throne, as heretofore I proſtituted a Roman Empreſſe to the embraces of a Cook. 'Tis I, that for fear the Lovers ſhould brag of their good fortunes, take care to cloſe their eyes, before they get to the bed-ſide. 'Tis by my art likewiſe, that they fly without feathers, that they go without ſtirring their feet: And, in fine, 'tis by me onely, that they die without loſing their life. I ſpend half the time, to repair the lean bodies, I give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the cheeks, and make the Roſes and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies bud in the face. I am two things together very unlike, the gods Truchman, and the fools

Interpreter. When I am ſeen neer hand, they know not who I am, and they do not begin to know me, till they have loſt ſight of me. The Eagle, that looks fixedly upon the Sun, winks at my preſence. I know not, if any amongſt my Anceſtours have been counted Lions; but in the fields, the Cock crowing makes me fly; and, to ſpeak freely, I my ſelf have much a do, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate what I am. Unleſſe you'l fancy, what a boy makes his Top do, when he whips it, I make all the world do ſo. Well, Sir, this is ſpeaking plain enough; and yet I dare lay a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that you have not found it out. But; in troth, I'le not expound it to you, unleſſe you command me; for then I'le ingenuouſly confeſſe to you, that the word you look after is, Sleep; and I cannot forbear, for I am, and will be all my life-time,</p>

My very Letters, full of ſubmiſſions and reſpects, for all the Art of the beſt inſtructed meſſengers cannot arrive: 'tis to no purpoſe that your praiſes that they publiſh makes them fly into all parts, they cannot meete with you; and I verily believe, that if by the Capricio of fortune or of fame (that often times take the charge of that which addreſſes it ſelf to you,) one of them ſhould fall from heaven down your Chimney,' twould be capable to make your Caſtle vaniſh.

Ah! Madam, the Sun whom you reſemble, to whom the order of the univerſe allowes no reſt, was pleaſed to ſtand ſtill in the heavens, to give light to a victory which little concern'd him.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56652:96"/>
let me know your intentions, that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times provide me a place amongſt the Quinze vingts; for I perceive, that I am by your courteſie predeſtinated to die blind: yeas blind, (for your ambition would not be ſatisfied, to have me one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Monoculus).</hi> Have you not made two Alim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks of my two eyes, through which you have found out the art, to diſtill my life, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it into clear water. In truth, I ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (if my death were any advantage to you, and if it were not the onely thing that I cannot obtain) that you exhauſted thoſe ſprings of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that are within me, onely that you might the more eaſily burn me; and I begin to believe ſome ſuch thing, ſince I perceived, that the more humidity my eyes draw from my heart, the more he burns. I cannot think, that my father did make my body of the ſame clay, that the firſt mans was compoſed of; but without doubt, he form'd it of a lime-ſtone, ſince the humidity of thoſe tears I ſhed, hath almoſt conſumed me. But can you believe it, Madam, in what manner it hath conſumed me?

               <p>I Have received your magnificent Bracelets, that ſeemed to me very proud, to wear your characters. You need not fear, after this, that a priſoner, held by the arms, and by the heart, can make an eſcape from you. I confeſſe, I ſhould have ſuſpected your preſent, becauſe that there alwaies goes hair and characters into the making up of charms. But you, having ſo many more noble waies of killing, 'tis not likely I ſhould ſuſpect you of witchcraft; beſides, I ſhould be to blame, to withdraw my ſelf from the ſecrets of your Magick, it being not poſſible for me to eſcape my Horoſcope, that is agreed with you of my ſad dyſaſter. Add to theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that 'twill be much more for her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if it comes by ſome ſupernaturall means, and if it be cauſed by a miracle. I believe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you think all this is jeaſting; well then, let us be ſerious, tell me, in your conſcience do you not think, that you have gained a heart at a cheap rate, ſince it coſt you but half a dozen blowes? By my faith, if you find any more at that price,

I would adviſe you to take them; for haires will ſooner grow again in the head, then hearts in the breaſts. But did you not cunningly chooſe, to make me a preſent of hair, to explain to me in Hierogliphick, the inſenſibility of your heart? No, I eſteem you more generous. But how ill ſoever you intend, I ſo confound in my joy eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that comes from you, that the hands that ſtrike me, or ſtroak me, are alike welcom, provided they be yours; and the Letter that I ſend to you, is a proof of it, ſince it is onely to give you thanks, for tying my arms, for drawing me by the hair, and by all this violence, for having made me,</p>

Let me know, I beſeech you, when that <hi>Aſtre</hi> (that was eclipſed onely for my ſake)
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56652:97"/>
will come and diſſipate the clouds of my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Have you not enough to exerciſe that conſtancy, to which you promiſed victory? Did you not ſwear to me, when you took your laſt journey, that all my faults were wiped out, that you would forget them for ever, but me never? O ſweet hopes! that are vaniſhed with the aire that framed them. Hardly had you ended theſe deceitfull words, ſhed ſome perfidious tears, and ſent forth artificiall ſighs, with which your mouth and your eyes belyed your heart; but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ſome cruelty, that yet lay hid in you, you doubled your kindneſſes, that you might eternize in my memory, the cruell remembrance of your favours, which I had loſt:</p>
               <p>But you went further, you fled from thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the ſight of me, would perhaps have been capable, to have moved your pitty; and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented your ſelfe from me in my ſufferings, as the Kings that abandon thoſe places, where cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalls are puniſhed, for fear of being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned for a pardon. But to what purpoſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precautions, Madam? you know too well the power of your wounds, to be afraid of their cure. The Phyſick that hath ſpoke of all mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, hath ſaid nothing of that which deſtroyes me, becauſe ſhe ſpoke of them, as being able to deal with them; but that which the love of you hath begot in me, is incurable; for how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to live, when one hath given away ones heart, which is the cauſe of life?

'Tis as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the ſplendour of the rayes of your beauty, to illuminate bodies, as 'tis naturall to mine to reflect towards you that light, which you beſtow upon me. And as it is in the power of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming looks, to kindle a diſpoſed matter; ſo is it in that of my heart, to be conſumed by it.

This unexpected foreſight is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the order, that compoſes the harmony of the Univerſe; and 'twas a neceſſity, known at the birth day of the creation of the world, that I ſhould ſee you, know you, and love you. But there being no cauſe, but tends to ſome end; the very time that we are to unite our ſelves, is now come. 'Twere in vain for you and I to attempt againſt our deſtinies. But admire the courſe of this predeſtination, 'twas a fiſhing that I met you; the lines that you (looking upon me) caſt, did they not declare to you my being taken? And although I had ſcap'd your lines, could I have ſaved my ſelf from the baits, hung at the lines of that fair Letter, that you did me the honour to ſend me, ſome daies after; every obliging word of which, was compoſed of divers characters, onely to charm me; and I received it with ſuch reſpects, as I would expreſſe, by ſaying, that I adored it, if I were capable of adoring any thing beſides your ſelf. At leaſtwiſe, I gave it many tender kiſſes; and laying my lips to your dear Letter, I fancyed, that I kiſſed your excellent wit, that framed it. My eyes took a pleaſure, in often paſſing over thoſe characters, that your pen had made; and grown inſolent by their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they attracted my whole ſoul to them, and by fixed looks, ſtuck there, to unite it ſelf with thoſe draughts of yours.
