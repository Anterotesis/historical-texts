         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And you Miſtris Elizabeth Iuxon, let me put you in mind, that as you beare the name of your vertuous mother, ſo you would be carefull to follow her god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſteps: be you diligent to heare Gods word preached, and to reade the ſame in priuate euery day; meditate that which you heare and reade, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to practiſe that which you learne, both in your generall and particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For theſe were the ſtops of your worthy mother.</p>
            <p>And you Miſtris Sarah Iuxon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo after whom you are named, to wit, after Sarah the wife of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Be diligent to reade the ſtory of

You are named after the bleſſed virgine Marie. As ſhe therefore conceiued Christ in her wombe, ſo do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him in your heart. As ſhe pondered the words of the ſh epheards in her heart, ſo do you meditate of the word of God day and night. Yea conſider what graces were in her, and labour for the ſame. Yea let me ſay vnto all you three pure virgins, beware you of the ſinnes of the times, take heed of following the vaine faſhions of the world, take heed of pride, take heed of whoredome and all manner of vncleanneſſe: haue a care with whom you conſort your ſelues:
<pb facs="tcp:16964:5"/>
marrie not without the conſent of your parents or gouernours, and be ſure that you marrie in the Lord. In a word, be carefull to reade and conſider the marks which were in your mother, and labour to find the like in your ſelues. And thus you ſhall leade a bleſſed life, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh a happie death, and at the laſt ſhall come to that heauenly kingdome, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your deare mother is gone before. Vnto the which heauenly kingdome, the Lord of his mercie bring vs all for Ieſus Christ his ſake, Amen.</p>

And in deed my deare Chriſtian brethren, ſin is iuſtly ſtyled by the name of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for there is no vanity to the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſin. For how vaine a practiſe it is for a little momentanie pleaſure, and for a modicum of tranſitory profit, that a man or woman ſhould ſet the glory of God, the merits of Chriſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16964:8"/>
the kingdome of heauen, and their owne ſaluation to ſale, I leaue it to your owne conſcience to iudge. But for mine owne part, I eſteeme wilfull and deſperate ſinners to be the moſt vaine and fooliſh people in the world. But concerning this kind of vanitie <hi>Iob</hi> doth not ſpeake in this place: for it is not meant that <hi>Iob</hi> had ſpent his moneths in the vanity of ſinne, as they do which ſpend their precious time in pricking &amp; pinning, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and pampering, in running to ſtage playes, in haunting of tauerns and alehouſes, in proſecuting of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſuites at law, and ſuch like: for <hi>Iob</hi> indeed was none of this curſed crew: but <hi>he was perfect and vpright, and one that feared God, and eſchued euill,</hi> as God himſelfe giues teſtimony of him in the firſt chap. of this booke, at the firſt verſe: yea this bleſſed <hi>Iob</hi> was ſuch a man, as that there was none like him in all reſpects in the whole

            <p>We muſt note therefore and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that the word <hi>vanity</hi> is taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Scripture for the vanity of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="3">3. The third thing which <hi>Iob</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in the night, was extremitie of paine in his bodie, expreſſed by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie grieuous and dolefull fits; for <hi>when he lay downe, he ſaid, when ſhall I ariſe, and the night be gone? and he was full,</hi> or as it is in the originall, <hi>he had his belly full of toſſings to and fro to the dawning of the day.</hi> And there is none which haue had experience of extremitie of ſickneſſe, but I hope they will eaſily acknowledge, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of paine is a ſore labour.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the clearing of the meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>Now before we come to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16964:10"/>
and inſtructions, one maine queſtion may be moued concerning the practiſe of <hi>Iob</hi> in complaining, whether he did well or ill in it? And to this I anſwer, that in many things <hi>Iob</hi> ſinned in the matter of complaint, as <hi>in curſing the day of his birth,</hi> Iob 3. and in deſiring for anguiſh to be <hi>cut off before his time,</hi> Iob 6. 9. and <hi>chuſing to be ſtrangled</hi> was like wiſe a great ſin in him, Iob 7. 15. But in theſe words in the text, I take it that <hi>Iob</hi> did not mainly ſinne, (howbeit I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him altogether from infirmitie,) but for his words vſed, they are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable; as for his ſecret affection, we haue nothing to do with it, we leaue it to God that knowes it.</p>
            <p>You will then demand, Is it lawfull therefore for ſuch as are in diſtreſſe to complaine?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that all complaint is not ſinfull. <hi>Dauid</hi> complained in the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Pſalme, that <hi>his ſoule was ſore</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:16964:10"/>
               <hi>troubled,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et he ſinned not. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah mourned like a doue in his ſicknes,</hi> Eſay 38. 14. and yet for that is not iuſtly to be reproued.</p>
            <p>But lawfull complaint in time of extremitie, muſt be ioyned with theſe limitations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it muſt not be with murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or repining againſt God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a patient ſubmitting to his bleſſed will: ſo that though we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our griefe, yet we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to endure it, in obedience to God; and we muſt learne of Chriſt, to ſay, <hi>If thou wilt that I ſhall drinke of this cup, thy will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, our complaint muſt not be to the weakning of our faith: we muſt ſo complaine, as that ſtill we hold faſt ſome ground of ioy. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ought to reioyce euermore; and we ſhould not mourne without hope, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our complaints muſt be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16964:11"/>
moderate; for there is but a time to mourne. We ought to find time, as wel for the declaring of Gods mercies which we haue receiued, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our griefes, or elſe we are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnthankfull.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the meaning. Now come we, by Gods permiſſion and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, to collect ſuch doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines and inſtructions as may make for our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moneths of vanitie.</hi> Where note we, that <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaking of his life, doth not terme his moneths, moneths of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, as though he had a leaſe of his life, but moneths of vanitle, as imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Mans life is very fraile and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Doctr.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>ſubiect to vaniſh away.</hi> And indeed there is nothing more fraile, &amp; more vncertaine. For this cauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compareth our liues to things that are very inconſtant: as ſometimes to graſſe, which in the morning flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth &amp; groweth, &amp; in the euening
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16964:11"/>
is cut downe and withereth, Pſal. 90. 5. 6. And ſometime to a vapour, which appeareth for a very little time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards vaniſheth away, Iam. 4. 14. Sometime to a weauers ſhuttle, which quickly paſſeth from one ſide of the webbe vnto the other. Sometime to ſmoke, which is driuen away and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed with euery wind or blaſt, Pſal. 102. 3. Sometime to a ſhadow which declineth, Pſal. 102. 11. And ſometime to vanity it ſelfe, as in my text.</p>
            <p>Gods Church and people haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken diligent notice of this frailty from time to time, and therefore haue made account of ſhort life. Hence it is that <hi>Abraham</hi> in his perfect health ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe duſt and aſhes, Geneſ. 18. 27. Hence it is that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, that his life is alwayes in his hand, Pſal. 119. 109. Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am readie to be deliuered, and the time of my departure is at hand,</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 6. Hence it is that the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16964:12"/>
Church ſaith, <hi>We haue here no abiding citie,</hi> Heb. 13. 14. And hence it is that ſo many faithfull Chriſtians do ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily remember their mortalitie &amp; their graue when they lye downe in their beds.</p>
            <p>And indeed very experience doth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> teach vs that mans life is fraile. For do we not ſee yong men die as well as old? Do we not ſee ſtrong men die as well as weake? Do we not ſee wiſe men die as well as fooliſh? Yea do we not ſee Phyſitians die as well as pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents? Yea there is none, rich or poore, high or low, noble or meane, which can promiſe himſelfe to liue for the ſpace of one poore houre.</p>
            <p>Againe, our liues muſt needs be <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> fraile and vncertaine, in reſpect of the manifold dangers whereunto they are continually ſubiect. For firſt, they <note place="margin">☜</note> are ſubiect to infinite diſeaſes, as to the peſtilence, to the burning feuer, to conſumptions, to the gout, to the

ſtone, to the dropſie, to the bloudie iſſue, and to innumerable other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are ſubiect to the ſtroke of Angels, to the layings in waite of enemies, yea to Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſtroke.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they are ſubiect to many ſodaine accidents. If they trauell by land, they are ſubiect to be taken by the eues and robbers, and to be left for dead. If they ride, they are ſubiect to fall from their horſes, and to breake their neckes. If they trauell on foote, they are ſubiect to take immoderate heate. If they eate, they are ſubiect to take ſurfet, though they eate neuer ſo little. If they faſt, they are ſubiect to grow into weakneſſe. If they ſit in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea but ſome poſſibly will obiect <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and ſay, Do we not ſee ſome men and women to liue long? Do not ſome in our age attaine ſeuentie yeares, ſome eightie yeares, ſome ninetie yeares, ſome an hundreth? and may not I hope to liue as long as they?</p>
            <p>I do not denie, but God is able to continue thee long vpon the earth, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> though thy life be neuer ſo fraile.

            <p>Yea but ſome, it may be, wil further obiect and ſay, I am ſtrong and luſty, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obiect.</hi>
               </note> I am yong, or in my beſt yeares, I find

And a threefold vſe we may make of this our frailtie; to wit, an vſe of Reproofe, an vſe of Inſtruction, and an vſe of Comfort. An vſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe. And it may reproue diuers. Firſt, ſuch as haue made a couenant <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>

was now growne very old, refuſed the kings offer. And thus many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <note place="margin">☞</note> which in time of health did too much affect riches and honours, and fineneſſe in apparell, afterwards in time of ſickneſſe come to ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all theſe. To this purpoſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaketh well in Eccleſ. 12. 4. that in old age, which is a laborious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of it ſelfe, <hi>the daughters of ſinging ſhall be abaſed:</hi> as implying, that though in health and youth, men or women ſtand too much affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the vanitie of earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, yet in affliction and old age they ſhall attaine the ſight of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of theſe things. So that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like vnto the clay wherewith the blind mans eyes were annointed in the Goſpell, and whereby he came to attaine his ſight, which before he wanted. Yea afflictions are like chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall ſpectacles, whereby Chriſtians are helped much in the diſcerning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16964:19"/>
and diſcouering of earthly vanity.</p>
            <p>And there be two reaſons for the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> euidencing or clearing of the truth of this point, to wit, <hi>That afflictions ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified are ſpeciall helpes to bring to ſight the vanity of earthly things.</hi> As firſt, becauſe men and women in afflictions finde by experience the helpleſneſſe of earthly things, they find that they may lie in paine and miſerie, yea that they may die, and be turned to duſt, for any thing which their riches or honours can helpe them: and therefore they may eaſily conclude, How vaine ô Lord do I now find theſe things, vpon the which formerly (foole that I was) I haue ſo doted, and ſet my mind? Behold now I ſee and ſay with the Preacher, as I find alſo by euident experience, <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in ſanctified afflictions <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> men and women come to the ſight <note place="margin">☜</note>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:16964:19"/>
of the excellency of true ſauing grace: now they can value one dram of faith aboue many talents of gold; now they had rather haue oyle in their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, then treaſure in their coffers. And the more that any one is brought to the ſight of the true worth of grace, the more they are brought withall to the ſight of earthly vanity. Do I ſee the price of heauen? Then I ſee the baſeneſſe of the earth. Do I ſee the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt my Lord? Then I ſee all other things to be droſſe, and count them to be dung.</p>
            <p>Yea but ſome, it may be, will be <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> too buſie to obiect, that afflictions are more like to driue vs from God then to bring vs vnto him, and that afflictions are dead helpes of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and cannot profit.</p>
            <p>Vnto whom I anſwer, that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſeparated from the working of Gods Spirit are indeed of no value;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16964:20"/>
which is the reaſon that though Turkes and Infidels haue afflictions as well as Chriſtians, yet they are no whit bettered by their afflictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed their afflictions are not ſanctified vnto them. And the like we may be bold to ſay of the written word of God. For the word it ſelfe ſeparated from the Spirit cannot worke. So that we put not this vertue of bringing to the ſight of earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the very afflictions the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, no more then we aſcribe the recouery of the blind mans ſight vnto the clay wherewith his eyes were annointed. But this we affirme, that afflictions ſanctified, that is, afflictions ioyned with the work of Gods Spirit are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to bring to the ſight of earthly vanity. Yea had it not bene for afflictions ſanctified, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now in heauen which had neuer come there. And had it not bene for afflictions, there be many prodigals
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16964:20"/>
in the world, which had not knowne (as they do know) what had belonged to the turning from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God. And therefore as I deſire that there may not too much be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to afflictions: ſo I would fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne men to take heede how they make too ſlight account of them, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering to what excellent purpoſes God hath ſanctified and appointed them; &amp; conſidering withall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of many ſound and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtians, which do ingenuouſly acknowledge that ſuch and ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions were eſpeciall meanes to bring them to God.</p>
            <p>But may not afflictions lawfully <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obiect.</hi>
               </note> be deſired and prayed for, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they may be meanes, if they be ſanctified, of much good vnto vs?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that as we are not <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to condition with God that he would neuer touch vs with any affliction,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16964:21"/>
but we muſt referre our ſelues vnto his will. So we are not to haſten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions <note place="margin">☜</note> vpon our ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe we know not what abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we haue to beare afflictions, or what grace we ſhall haue to make the right vſe of them. We may indeed pray that if afflictions be vpon vs they may be ſanctified vnto vs, and it is an holy and neceſſary prayer: but to pray that God would ſcourge vs, it is a preſumptuous requeſt, and doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour too much of ouerweening our owne ſtrength. And if any for their preſumptuous practiſe ſhall alledge the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> in Pſalme 6. 1. that he prayed, not to be corrected in Gods wrath, whereby he ſeemeth to be content that God ſhould ſcourge him, ſo that it were not in his furie: to this I anſwer, that ſuch know not of what ſpirit they are which thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16964:21"/>
I trow not. Secondly, <hi>Dauid</hi> doth not abſolutely pray for afflictions, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as granted, that God would afflict him, he prayeth that the Lord would not afflict him in his wrath and fury. Therefore we conclude, that though much good be wrought by afflictions, yet that afflictions are not to be prayed for, or to be haſtened.</p>

               </gap>e the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent power of God, who is able out of darkneſſe to bring light. For what is more vnlikely, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fleſh and bloud, to do good, then afflictions are? For by reaſon, when a man is ſicke, he is more fit to ſee the excellency of health then the vanity of it; and when he is poore, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16964:22"/>
ſee the happineſſe of riches, then to ſee their impotency. And therefore great and admirable is the worke of our good God in all things, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the ſanctification of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. We may iuſtly ſay with the Apoſtle, <q>
                  <bibl>Rom. 11 33.</bibl> O the depth of the riches both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God: how vnſearchable are his iudgements, and his wayes paſt finding out!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this conſideration of the vſefulneſſe of afflictions muſt be an <note place="margin">2. <hi>

But if we walk ſtubburnly againſt him, he will walke ſtubburnly againſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16964:22"/>
vs. Gods wrath is like to the thunder &amp; lightnings, which commonly hurt not ſoft and yeelding bodies becauſe they do not reſiſt, but they exerciſe their force vpon ſtout oakes and iron locks and barres, &amp;c. So God deales gently with ſuch as ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but if any reſiſt, he will ſurely cruſh them and make them tame. They ſhall be ſure to gaine nothing by obſtinacy againſt God, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their miſeries. Yea God will walke obſtinatly againſt his very elect if they reſiſt his proceedings, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Ionas:</hi> how did God perſecute <hi>Ionas</hi> with winde and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, yea how did he toſſe him into the ſeas, and plunged him into the hell of the whales belly, and neuer left him vntil he had brought him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to go to Nineue?

And therefore as thou art content to receiue many a bitter potion at the hand of a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in hope of health, ſo be content to drinke of the cup which God hath tempered, in hope that it ſhall worke for thy good.</p>
            <p>In the third place we muſt duly <note place="margin">3. <hi>

            <p>But if we haue bene ſcourged, and yet are neuer the better, we haue iuſt cauſe to be humbled, and to feare that our afflictions were neuer ſanctified vnto vs. <hi>The Lord hath ſmitten vs,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:16964:24"/>
And that Gods children may be viſited with grieuous paine, and with laborious ſickneſſe, it is further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by examples; as firſt by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart. For, how doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine in the ſixt Pſalme? That his bones were vexed, that he was weary of his groning, that his eye was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with griefe: and in Pſalme 39. 10. That he was conſumed by the blow of Gods hand: but eſpecially in Pſalme 38. Where he ſaith, That the arrowes of God did ſticke faſt in him, and his hand preſſed him ſore. That there was no ſoundneſſe in his fleſh, becauſe of Gods anger: and that there was no reſt in his bones, becauſe of his ſinne. That his wounds did ſtinke, and were corrupt; that he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and bowed downe greatly. That he went mourning all the day. That his loines were filled with a lothſome diſeaſe. That he was feeble and ſore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16964:24"/>
broken: that he roared for the very diſquietneſſe of his heart, &amp;c. And the like we ſee in the Church, <hi>Lamen.</hi> 1. 11. 12. where ſhe ſaith, <hi>Behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like vnto my ſorrow, which is done vnto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger: from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue hath he ſent fire into my bones, and it preuaileth againſt them.</hi> Yea, what paines did Chriſt himſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the Garden, when he ſweat water and bloud? and what torment vpon the Croſſe when he cried, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> I ſuppoſe, that at that time the paines of hell came about him, as it is ſaid alſo in Pſal. 18. 5. I ſuppoſe that then Chriſt deſcended into hell, when he felt the very fire of Gods wrath in his ſoule for our ſins, when the Lord withdrew the light of his countenance, and left him to the intollerable ſence and feeling of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16964:25"/>
indignation. Now if <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man ſo deare to God: if the Church, bought with ſo deare a price: yea, if Chriſt Jeſus the Sonne of God, were left to this extremitie of paines: then it followeth vndeniably, That Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And for the proofe of the ſecond clauſe of the Doctrine, to wit, that Gods children may be viſited with long and tedious ſickneſſes, as well as with extremity of paine: conſider we firſt the example of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who kept his bed, and was ſicke of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey for the ſpace of eight yeares, Acts 9. 33. Secondly, the example of the poore man, Iohn. 5. 5. who had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity for the ſpace of eight and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares, lying at the Poole of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the example of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

woman, Luke 8. 43. who had an infirmitie twelue yeares together, and had ſpent all her ſubſtance vpon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, and could not be healed of any. Yea, as Saint <hi>Marke</hi> is bold to ſay, She was neuer the better for her tampering ſo much with Phyſicke, but rather much the worſe, Mar. 5. 26.

               </gap>fe of this point, but I will abſtaine. Come we to the reaſons.</p>
            <p>And there be many cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth thus heauily and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly afflict his ſeruants.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that hereby he might correct <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16964:26"/>
things, ſome to diſcontentednes with their eſtate. And the Lord he layeth <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

And herein God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth like a skilfull Goldſmith; he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth his children into fierie afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not becauſe he meanes vtterly to caſt them away, but becauſe he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to take them out more pure, and purged from their droſſe of ſinne: yea he fineth them ſeuenfold, that yet they may be more pure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God doth heauily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his people, of purpoſe to weane <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> them from the vaine delights and pleaſures of the world. And in this the Lord deales like a nurſe; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointeth the teates of the world with bitterneſſe, to the end that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſucking them might deſire them no more. How came <hi>Iacob</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte and to forſake <hi>Labans</hi> family, but by the affliction which he found
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16964:26"/>
by the change of <hi>Labans</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Gen. 31. How came the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſonne to be weaned from the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſeruice, Luke 15. but by the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of hunger and want which he found in it? And laſtly, how come ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the deare children of God to be ſo farre mortified to the world, as that they <hi>deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> but by the bitterneſſe of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth thus ſcourge <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> his Church, and afflict his children, for the triall of his graces in them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in 1. Pet. 4. 12. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fierie triall, which is come vpon you to trie you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God afflicts his Church, partly for the triall of their patience, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will ſubmit themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as well in ſuffering as in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will: partly for the triall of ſaith, to ſee if they will beleeue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

ſence and feeling, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will ſay with <hi>Iob, Though the Lord kill me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Iob 13. 15. Yea the Lord afflicts for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of wiſedome, to ſee if his children will endeauour to make good vſe of their afflictions and of their croſſes. Thus God I ſay afflicts for triall.</p>
            <p>In the fourth and laſt place, God <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> ſorely afflicteth his Church in this world, that he might the highlier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance it in glorie in the world to come. For howſoeuer <hi>The affliction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Cor. 4. 17.</p>
            <p>Thus the holy Martyrs, as they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered moſt, ſo no doubt they are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified moſt. And thus many deare Saints of God, which haue endured a

               </gap>xcellent heauen of comfort hereafter: as they haue bene partakers of the ſuffering, ſo they are of the conſolation.</p>
            <p>But to come to the vſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note>: Is it ſo, that God doth ſorely afflict his deare children? Then this ſhould teach vs in the firſt place, not to iudge or cenſure thoſe which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as though they were greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then others. You know what Chriſt himſelfe ſaith in Luke 13. 2. <hi>Suppoſe ye, that thoſe Galileans were greater ſinners then all other Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you nay, &amp;c.</hi> And it was the ſinne of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends to iudge <hi>Iob</hi> an hypocrite, or a notorious offender, becauſe the hand of God was ſo heauy vpon him. Let vs therefore learne on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with Gods Church, Iam. 5. 11, <hi>To eſteeme them happie which ſuffer.</hi> Let vs hope, that afflictions layed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16964:28"/>
our brethren or ſiſters, are ſignes of Gods loue towards them, and not of his hatred. <hi>For whomſoeuer the Lord loues, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſonne whom he receiueth:</hi> as we reade Hebrews 12. 6. 7. And therefore leud and vncharitable is the practiſe of all ſuch which take vpon them to iudge and to cenſure many a ſound Chriſtian, by their very afflictions, to be hypocrites, to be diſſemblers, to be ſome way notoriouſly wicked: For elſe, ſay they, God would neuer thus haue puniſhed them. O moſt vniuſt and raſh cenſure! Doth not God ſcourge euery ſonne whom he receiueth? and ſhall we not through many tribulations enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? Therefore let God be true, and euery raſh iudger ſhall be proued a lyer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, are Gods owne deare children ſubiect to grieuous and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </note> afflictions? Therefore this may be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16964:28"/>
iuſt matter of terror to the wicked &amp; vngodly. For <hi>if iudgement begin at the houſe of God, what ſhall be the end of ſuch as obey not the Goſpell of God?</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Pet. 4. 17. If God correct his owne with ſtrokes, ſurely he will puniſh the wicked with ſcorpions. If he afflict <hi>Lazarus</hi> here with pouerrie and ſickneſſe, ſurely he will puniſh <hi>Diues</hi> hereafter with hell fire.</p>
            <p>Yea, if God ſpared not his Angels which ſinned, but caſt them downe into hell, and deliuered them into darkneſſe, to be reſerued to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then how ſhall the wicked thinke that the Lord will ſpare them, going on in their ſinfull courſes? Oh therefore let all the ſharp corrections layed vpon Gods children in this life, be ſo many warning peales to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſpeedily to repent, and to turne to God in time, leſt worſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeiſe vpon them then euer ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16964:29"/>

            <p>Thirdly, the conſideration of this truth, to wit, that Gods children are <note place="margin">3. <hi>

               </gap>ed to endure great trials. We muſt be prepared to endure loſſe of our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends, loſſe of good name, loſſe of our whole eſtate, loſſe of libertie, loſſe of health, extremitie of paines in the body, &amp; that for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yea we muſt be prepared for the firy triall; for what do we know, what God hath in ſtore for vs? Laſtly, we muſt be prepared to endure troubles of minde and vexations of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; we muſt be content to be brought to heauen by hell-gates. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we muſt not thinke it ſtrange if theſe things befall vnto vs. The like haue befallen vnto Gods owne ſons and daughters that are in the world, or haue bene. Let vs learne to get ſtrength now in the time of our peace;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16964:29"/>
we may haue more vſe of it hereafter then it may be we are aware of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſidering that Gods <note place="margin">4. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> elect are ſubiect to ſo great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let vs which enioy freedom from theſe torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting miſeries, be the more thankfull to God for our freedome. We might liue in ſickneſſe, in paine, in pouertie, in perſecution, in diſtreſſe of minde, and yet remaine the true children of God. Therefore what cauſe of thankfulneſſe haue we, with whom the Lord deales more mildly, and yet giues vs the ſame hope of glorie, which he hath giuen vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which ſuffer great trials? God deales with vs as he dealt with <hi>Henoch;</hi> he takes vs away, and we hardly ſee or feele death: whereas many others are carried as it were in a fierie cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot to the kingdome of heauen. Conſider this all ye which ſit vnder your owne vine and vnder your owne figtree, and be thankfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:16964:30"/>
Fiftly, conſidering that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">5. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> are ſubiect to ſo great afflictions; therefore this muſt teach vs to haue a fellowfeeling of the miſeries of others. We muſt not make ſmall reckning of their paines, as though they ailed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but we muſt compaſſionate them, and vſe all the meanes we can to comfort them, and to ſupport them, as we our ſelues deſire to be comforted and to be ſupported if we were in their eſtate. Be it therefore farre from vs to adde affliction to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or to increaſe the ſorrowes of ſuch whom God hath wounded: But let vs rather thinke with <hi>Iob,</hi> that he which is in affliction ought to be comforted of his friends. It is a cruell practiſe to lay on more weight vpon a poore beaſt, when he is ready to ſinke vnder that burthen which is vpon him already. So, much more it is a tyrannous fact to adde to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of them which are already hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to haue ſpoken concerning the third do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to wit, that Gods deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſubiect to painfull and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſickneſſes.</p>

And this truth the Saints haue acknowledged from time to time. If <hi>Sheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea but this might ſeeme to be an <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> hard ſaying, that God ſhould be the author of all afflictions. For ſuppoſe that a man be robbed of all that he hath, is God the cauſe of the robbery? or ſuppoſe a man be wrongfully ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is God the cauſe of the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?

            <p>Nothing leſſe.

            <p>But it may be obiected further, Do not many croſſes fall out by meere ill lucke? Doth not a mans experience tell him of many ill chances which haue befallen him?

            <p>Theſe indeed may ſeeme to be meere caſualties vnto vs, in reſpect <note place="margin">Anſwor.</note> of the ſuddenneſſe of them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee not alwayes the cauſes of them. But with God theſe things are certaine, and proceed from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16964:32"/>
according to that in Pro. 16. 35. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereof is from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we muſt not be like the very heathen, aſcribing that vnto chance and fortune, which we ſhould by right aſcribe to the prouidence of God.</p>
            <p>But to come to the vſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> Is it ſo, that all afflictions come by the prouidence of God? Then this muſt teach vs in the firſt place, not to murmure, but let vs ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> in Pſal. 39. 9. <hi>I was dumbe, and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou diddest it.</hi> If we conſider, we haue no cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to murmure againſt God. For firſt, he layeth not vpon any of vs the thouſandth part of that which we do deſerue. And ſecondly, he cauſeth thoſe afflictions which he doth lay vpon vs, to worke for our good: ſo that we haue more cauſe to giue him thankes, then in any ſort to murmure
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16964:33"/>
againſt him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſidering that all our afflictions are from God; therefore <note place="margin">2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </note> it muſt teach vs to feare God aboue all. Let vs not feare the diuell, nor ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, nor our profeſſed enemies. For none of theſe can hurt vs without God. But let vs feare that great God, who when he hath afflicted vs here, is able to caſt both ſoule and body into hell fire, Luke 12. 5. It is a miſerable thing, that we can feare a great man becauſe he is able to hurt vs, and that we cannot much more feare God which is able to damne vs. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes a great deale of infidelity in vs: this ſhewes that we do not beleeue the certaintie of Gods threatnings. We conſider God onely according to his mercie, and ſo make an idoll of him: but we feare him not for his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. We pretend that we loue God; but where is that awfull reſpect which we owe vnto him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:16964:33"/>
Thirdly, is it ſo, that all afflictions <note place="margin">3. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> are from God? Therefore this muſt teach vs, that whenſoeuer God doth afflict vs in any kind whatſoeuer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our good names, or in our goods, or in our friends by taking them away, or in our bodies, or ſuch like: it muſt teach vs I ſay, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi> And it is a bleſſed vſe of afflictions, to make them as our looking glaſſe, wherein we diſcerne and diſcouer ſome things amiſſe in our ſelues. Let vs therfore which taſte afflictions, find out our ſecret or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſinnes, and then let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to God, and humble our ſoules for them; let vs renew our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16964:34"/>
with God of new obedience. Yet let vs iuſtifie God in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt vs; and let vs ſay, Lord, it is thy great mercie that thou layeſt no greater puniſhment vpon me, yea it is thy mercie that I am not conſumed and brought to nothing. Let vs ſay with <hi>Daniel, To vs belongeth nothing but ſhame and confuſion;</hi> yea let vs ſay as the truth is, that hell fire and the ſecond death is due vnto vs. By this humiliation ioyned with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of newneſſe of life for time to come, we ſhall obtaine mercie and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes paſt, Prou. 28. 13. Secondly, we ſhall turne away Gods wrath and iudgements from vs for time to come, as Nineue did: and without this repentance, there is no poſſible eſcape fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods vengeance, but his hand will be ſtill ſtretched out againſt vs: he will breake vs with one breaking after another, vntill we be content to breake off our finnes. If
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16964:34"/>
we will make no end of ſinning, let vs neuer thinke that God will make an end of ouni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, is it ſo, that God is the <note place="margin">4. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> author of all afflictions? Therefore this muſt teach vs to flie vnto God for helpe in the time of diſtreſſe. We muſt ſay with the Church in Hoſ. 6. 1 <hi>The Lord hath torne, and he will heale; he hath ſmitten, and he will binde vs vp.</hi> We muſt not ſeeke to witches or wizzards for helpe, neither muſt we truſt in our Phyſitians as <hi>Aſa</hi> did, in 2. Chron. 16. 12; but we muſt ſeeke to the liuing God. I ſpeake not this, to the end we ſhould neglect the meanes, but that we ſhould not too much dote vpon the meanes, as it is the ſinne of too many. And I ſpeake it furthermore to this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we might be ſtirred vp the more feruently to ſeeke to God by prayer and humiliation in the time of our trouble. For it is too manifeſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16964:35"/>
how earneſt we are in ſeeking after the meanes, while in the meane time we neglect to ſeeke vnto God by prayer for his helpe. We are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rachel</hi> which cryeth (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a good woman) and ſaith vnto <hi>Iacob, Giue me children or elſe I die:</hi> not remembring that it was in God onely to giue children. And ſo we cry with feruency, Giue me this helpe or elſe I die, whereas it is the Lord one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is able to helpe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Do all afflictions <note place="margin">5. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> come by the prouidence of God? Then this may be matter of comfort &amp; conſolation vnto all Gods afflicted people: for certainly God will lay no other affliction vpon his Saints, but that which is for their good. God is our tender Father, and can we thinke that a tender father will giue any thing to his beloued child, but that which is good and whole ſome? God is our faithfull Phyſitian, and ſhall we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16964:35"/>
thinke that a faithfull Phyſitian will wittingly giue any thing to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, which may do har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and not good? God is our chiefe friend, and ſhall we thinke that our chiefe friend will ſeeke our bane? Be it farre from vs ſo to imagine. Yea be aſſured of this, thou afflicted in Sion, and toſſed with tempeſts; if God did not know and purpoſe to do thee good by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I dare be bold to ſay, he would neuer afflict thee. And therefore ſay with Chriſt, and that with comfort and willing ſubiection, <hi>The cup which my Father hath giuen me, ſhall I not drinke it?</hi> Ioh. 18. 11.

               <hi>heard, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning: Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe they were not.</hi> The like we ſee in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Eſay 38. 14. for in his ſickneſſe he chattered like a crane or a ſwallow; yea he mourned like a doue. The like we reade of the Church in affliction, Eſay 59. 11. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We roare like Beares, and mourne like doues.</hi> Yea what ſhall we ſpeake of <hi>Elias,</hi> who was euen wearie of his life, by reaſon of the idolatry and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the dayes of <hi>Ieſabel?</hi> 1. Kin. 19. 4. What ſhall we ſpeake of <hi>Naomie</hi> who named her ſelf <hi>Mara</hi> or bitter, in reſpect of her bitter afflictions? Ruth 1. 21. What ſhould we mention <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> who was exceedingly vexed and troubled, when he had no iuſt cauſe ſo to be? Ionas 4. 9. Yea my beloued, it befell euen to Chriſt himſelfe to be troubled, and to be ſenſible of his ſmart. For elſe why doth he pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe

and againe, that <hi>the bitter cup might paſſe from him?</hi> Or, why doth he crie, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Yea, the child of God may be ſo ſenſible of his afliction, and his croſſe may be ſo irkſome vnto him, as that he may fall thereby into diuers dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptations.</p>
            <p>He may come to thinke that God hath forſaken him, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 77. 7. 8. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for euer? will he be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable no more? Is his mercie cleane gone for euer? Doth his promiſe faile for euermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut vp his tender mercies? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the child of God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, may poſſibly be very impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and may vtter dangerous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as we ſee in the forenamed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ionas, I do well to be angrie.</hi> Yea, he may come to curſe the day of

            <p>Thirdly, the very elect may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be comfortleſſe in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to that in <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 11. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt, and not comforted!</hi> Yea, they may die mourning, their gray haires may go with mourning to the graue; as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And there be great reaſons why af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are thus irkſome to Gods children: as firſt, becauſe our nature is traile and weake, <hi>our ſtrength is not</hi>

            <p>If any ſhall obiect further, and ſay; <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obiect.</hi>
               </note> Do we not reade, that the Apoſtles reioyced, <hi>In that they were thought wothie to ſuffer rebuke for Chriſt?</hi> Acts 5. 41. And do we not heare of thoſe holy Martyrs in Hebr. 10. 34. who

               <hi>ſuffered with ioy the ſpoyling of their goods?</hi> Yea, do we not behold with our eyes, many Chriſtians which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this life with much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioy? Therefore it may ſeeme, that the end of Gods children is a ioyfull end.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is true that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yea I hope the moſt of Gods children depart with ioy. But this is not the condition of all. There be ſome that go weeping to heauen, as well as there be others which go tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing. There be ſome that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in fiery chariots with <hi>Elias,</hi> and as it were in a whirle-wind: when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are carried in a more mild man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or as it were in a horſelitter.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall obiect yet and ſay, Do <note place="margin">3. <hi>Obiect.</hi>
               </note> we not reade in Pſal. 37. <hi>Marke the vpright man, &amp; behold the iuſt: the end of that man is peace?</hi> Therefore how is it poſſible that the end of the child of God ſhould be vncomfortable?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:16964:41"/>
It is moſt true, that the end of <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Gods children is peace, but this peace is eſpecially obtained in the world to come; for ſo ſaith the Prophet: <hi>Peace ſhall come, and they ſhall reſt in their beds,</hi> Eſay 57. 2. Yea what ſaith our bleſſed Sauiour? <hi>In the world ye ſhall haue aſſliction, but be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I haue ouercome the world.</hi> Iohn 16. 33.</p>
            <p>But to come to the vſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> of this point: Is it ſo, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may be thus troubleſome and tedious to the very children of God? Then this muſt teach vs, not raſhly to cenſure all ſuch as in whom we diſcouer much weakeneſſe and ſignes of impatiency. For in ſo doing we might quickly come to condemne the generation of the righteous. Shall we iudge <hi>Iob</hi> to be an hypocrite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we heare him curſing the day of his birth? God forbid. Thereſore <hi>iudge not, that ye be not iudged. For with what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:16964:41"/>
               <hi>ye iudge, ye ſhall be iudged; and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you againe,</hi> Matth. 7. 2. In ſtead of iudging and cenſuring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in this caſe rather learne to iudge thy ſelfe: thinke thus with thy ſelfe, when thou ſeeſt ſignes of impatiencie in good people, firſt, that ſurely their pangs &amp; paines are exceeding great, for otherwiſe they would not thus complaine: and ſecondly ſuſpect thy ſelfe, that if thou were in their caſe, and didſt endure that which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, thou thy ſelfe wouldſt be farre more impatient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, is it ſo, that afflictions <note place="margin">2. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> may be thus tedious vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God? Therefore this muſt teach vs to be thankfull to God, when our brethren and ſiſters make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable end. How great cauſe had the ſriends and kindred of holy Martyrs to praiſe God, when they beheld with their eyes the ſtedfaſt faith, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16964:42"/>
courage, the maruellous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which appeared in thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uants of God. And ſo when we behold our friends vpon their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, iuſtifying God, condemning themſelues, laying hold of ſaluation by Chriſt, giuing good inſtruction vnto others, and commending their ſpirits into the hand of their Lord which hath bought them: ſurely, I lay, in this caſe we haue great and iuſt cauſe to glorifie God. And ſo much the rather are we bound to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this, becauſe it is not giuen to all the Saints to haue this comfort at the laſt: but ſome vpon their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained with Chriſt Ieſus to cry in the ſenſe of their paines, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, is it ſo, that afflictions may be thus tedious vnto Gods children? <note place="margin">3. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
               </note> Therefore this muſt teach all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to endeuour, and that betimes, to lay the foundation of a comfortable
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16964:42"/>
death; and for this end we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe rules.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt take away the ſting of death, which is ſinne. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which makes death terrible or troubleſome vnto Gods child, but ſinne: as for the pangs, many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue comfortably endured them, eſpecially being aſſured of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and alſo priuie to themſelues of a well ſpent life. But as for ſuch which would not be ruled, but would ſtill retaine a felfewill, their end hath bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vncomfortable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my deare brother and ſiſter, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art, let my counſell be auailable with thee; caſt away all thy tranſgreſſions whereby thou haſt tranſgreſſed. Spare not thy boſome ſins. For I ſay vnto thee, euery ſinne which thou keepeſt vnmortified, doth threaten to make thy death vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. Wherefore let vs euery day be leſſening the ſorrowes of death by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16964:43"/>
our daily practiſe of mortification. Haſt thou mortified luſt, mortifie alſo <note place="margin">☜</note> couetouſneſſe: haſt thou mortified couetouſneſſe, mortifie alſo pride: haſt thou mortified pride, mortifie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo raſh anger: in a word, haſt thou mortified ſome ſinne, ſtriue to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all ſin. For aſſure thy ſelfe, if thou keepe any one ſinne aliue, it will be bitterneſſe in the end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we deſire to make a comfortable end, we muſt walke faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and labor to glorifie God in our particular calling. How came <hi>Paul</hi> to finiſh his dayes with comfort, but by this, that he had finiſhed his courſe? 2. Tim. 4. that is, he had bene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to accompliſh the worke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was ſent. For it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, my welbeloued, that we obſerue with diligence the workes of pietie, and that we walke faithfully in our generall calling as we are Chriſtians, but we muſt alſo walk faithfully in our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16964:43"/>
particular callings. It is not ſufficient to ſeeme to be a good Chriſtian, but we muſt be good Magiſtrats, or good maiſters, or good husbands, or good wiues, or good ſeruants, or good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c. We muſt glorifie God in the ranke wherein God hath ſet vs, if euer we meane to die with ſound comfort.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if we deſire to make a comfortable end, we muſt be carefull to thinke of our end betimes. When ſicknes and death come vnexpected, they are the more vnwelcome, they come as vnbidden gueſts: but if we haue ſeriouſly thought of theſe things before hand, and made them part of our daily meditation, then they are the leſſe troubleſome, and the more eaſily borne. Euen as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burden, if it be throwne vpon a mans ſhoulders at vnawares, it is ready to breake his backe; but if he be aware of his burden, and fit himſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is farre more tollerable: So
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16964:44"/>
it is with death and ſickneſſe: if thou thinke of theſe things before hand, they will be farre more eaſie; but if thou put this euil day farre from thee, thou ſhalt find by wofull experience, that vnexpected death is the moſt <note place="margin">☜</note> bitter and terrible. Therefore let thy bed put thee dayly in minde of thy graue, and thy ſleepe of thy death; let the putting off thy garments put thee in minde of laying downe this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of thy body; yea let thy ſheetes put thee in minde of thy winding ſheete; and the clothes which couer thee in thy bed, put thee in minde of the earth which ſhall couer thee in thy graue. Thus thou ſhalt imitate <hi>Iob</hi> who waited all the dayes of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time vntil his changing came Iob 14. 14. And thus thou ſhalt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate many deare children of God, which are taught of God thus to thinke of their mortalitie. Thus thou ſhalt be more and more mortified to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16964:44"/>
the world, and thus no doubt thou ſhalt make thy end comfortable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if we deſire to make a comfortable end, we muſt endeuour betimes to make our calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection <note place="margin">☞</note> ſure. Thus <hi>Simeon</hi> departed in peace, becauſe his eyes had ſeene Gods ſaluation. And indeed how can we expect to die with comfort, while we are vnreſolued what ſhall become of our ſoules in the world to come? And that we may make our calling and election ſure, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe rules. Firſt, we muſt be diligent hearers of Gods word; for <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh. What is the reaſon that ſo many wauer? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are idle, and becauſe they will not take the paines to heare ſo diligently, as their caſe requireth? Secondly, that wee may make our calling and election ſure, we muſt frequently receiue the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16964:45"/>
Lords Supper. What experienced Chriſtian is there, but he is able to tell you, that the Sacrament by Gods bleſſing hath a notable confirming and eſtabliſhing power? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe negligent Miniſters are guiltie of the weakneſſe of the faith of the people, in that they do not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as they ought, adminiſter the holy Sacrament. Thirdly, if we deſire <note place="margin">☜</note> our calling and election to be made ſure, then we muſt pray vnto God, as the Apoſtles did, that the Lord would increaſe our faith. For vnleſſe Gods Spirit do teſtifie together with our ſpirit, we can neuer come to any full aſſurance. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> may water, but it muſt be God alone which muſt giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſauing grace. Fourthly, if we would <note place="margin">☜</note> make our calling and election ſure, wee muſt meditate often of Gods promiſes, and we muſt trie our eſtate by the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kes which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16964:45"/>
vnto Gods elect. Fifthly, if we would make our calling and election ſure, we muſt be plentifull in good workes. For, whom hath God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſtrengthen vpon the bed of languiſhing, in Pſal. 41. 3. but ſuch as conſider wiſely of the poore? And who are they which lay vp for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a good foundation againſt the time to come, laying hold of eternall life, but ſuch as are rich in good workes? 1. Tim 6. 19. Thus we ſee the way to a comfortable departure. God almightie giue euery one of vs grace to take this way, that ſo by our death we may glorifie God, bring comfort &amp; good example to our brethren, and eternall benefit to our owne ſoules, and that for the merits of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom with the bleſſed Father, and the holy Spirit, three moſt glorious perſons, and one God, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all honour, praiſe and glorie, all true feare, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16964:46"/>
and obedience, from this time forth for euermore, Amen.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this Sermon (as you know) was for the celebration of the funerall of that excellent ſeruant of God, Miſtris <hi>Elizabeth Iuxon,</hi> the late faithful wife of Maiſter <hi>Iohn Iuxon</hi> Citizen of this famous Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And the reaſon which moued me to make choice of this Text ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of any other, was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of our deare ſiſter deceaſſed, who vpon her death-bed called for her Bible, and turned to this portion of Scripture, and deſired me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of it at her bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iall. And indeed if I had bene left to mine owne free choice, I thinke I could not haue made a fitter choice of a Text in all the Bible. For the eſtate of <hi>Iob</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in theſe words, doth notably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the eſtate of our ſiſter.</p>
            <p>For, were the moneths of <hi>Iob,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16964:46"/>
of vanitie? did they vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like ſmoake? did they paſſe away quickly like the Weauers ſhuttle? Euen ſo it was with the life of this our ſiſter; her dayes were but few and euill; her pilgrimage here was but ſhort; for ſhe was not full ſeuen and twentie yeares old when God tooke her away, as I am informed. As it was with <hi>Henoch,</hi> becauſe he walked with God, therefore the Lord tooke him away in his middle age: euen ſo it was with this worthy woman; ſhe walked with her God, and therefore he hath now taken her vp vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the midſt of her dayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, did <hi>Iob</hi> endure a painfull and tedious griefe in his body? Euen ſo did this our ſiſter; her paines were very great, her triall was a fiery triall; yea her ſickneſſe was not onely dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but likewiſe it was long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, continuing vpon her with great extremitie for the ſpace of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16964:47"/>
yeare and vpwards. God did grinde her in the mortar of his fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection like ſpice, that ſo ſhe might be made the more fragrant ſacrifice vnto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, was <hi>Iob</hi> brought by his ſickneſſe to the ſight of the vanitie of earthly things? So was this ſeruant of God; ſhe had attained an holy ſcorne of the contentments of this life. For when I demanded of her, whether the comelineſſe of the roome where ſhe lay, and furniture of her houſe did not ſomewhat tempt her to deſire ſtill to liue: ſhe anſwered me, That nothing in the world did moue her to deſire life, no not her very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which were farre more deare vnto her, then any worldly riches whatſoeuer. So that I found ſhe was quite dead to the world in her mind, before ſhe was dead or depriued of life in her bodie. God grant that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs may labour for the like
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16964:47"/>
grace of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>und mortification. For, if we be dead and crucified vnto the world, it is a good ſigne that we are aliue to God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, was griefe and ſmart irkeſome and troubleſome vnto <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe? Then it was the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, to giue patience vnto this our ſiſter in any meaſure. And let vs not thinke it ſtrange if ſhe roared and cried with paine at ſome times; but let vs rather feare, that if we had bene in her caſe, and had taſted her ſorrowes, we had bene like to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater extremitie then euer ſhe fell. It is the propertie of a good child to crie whileſt he is a beating, as well as of a bad. But here is the difference; a good child, when the ſmart is gone, will kiſſe the rod, and loue his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and be ſory for his fault; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a wicked child will murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt and hate his parents. Now this our worthy ſiſter ſhewed her ſelfe to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16964:48"/>
be a good child; for ſhe cried when ſhe felt the ſmart: but when ſhe had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y mitigation, ſhe condemned her i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>patiencie, and iuſtified God, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is rod, by ſhewing a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection of loue to God, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe thought or ſpoke ſeriouſly of him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, were theſe painfull nights appointed vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> not by fatall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, or by chance and fortune, but by the prouidence of God? Euen ſo it was with this our ſiſter. For ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uer the firſt occaſion of her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might ſeeme vnto vs to bee meerly caſuall: yet the truth is, that euen caſualties themſelues are guided by the diuine prouidence. For (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is from Iehouah,</hi> Prou. 16. 33. And thus I haue declared vnto you, how fitly this text doth anſwer vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. Now may it pleaſe you
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16964:48"/>
further to conſider the ſpirituall eſtate of this our ſiſter.</p>
            <p>And her ſpirituall eſtate ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by a ſtrict and ſerious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which ſhe tooke of her ſelfe in the time of her health. It is ſet downe with her owne hand, and was found by her husband after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, amongſt the reſt of her things which ſhe moſt eſteemed: and for my owne part, I know them t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be no fables. For I knew her ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, by ſiue yeares experience, liuing in the houſe with her. Now I thought good to make them publike, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a due memoriall of this bleſſed ſeruant of God; but alſo for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of Gods Church: as being indeed exceedingly importuned by good people thereunto. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">☞</note> to reape benefite by the markes, reade them not as a bare report or commendation of the partie deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but duly obſerue euery marke

what it importeth; and next, obſerue in what manner it was found in this worthy woman: thirdly, weigh well the places of Scripture which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to proue the Markes to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Gods elect: and laſtly, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether thou findeſt theſe <note place="margin">☜</note> ſignes in thy ſelfe or no; for this is the way to benefit by them.</p>
            <p>The Markes which this our ſiſter found to be wrought in her, by Gods holy Spirit, are many: I will reduce them to as few heads as I can, for the helpe of your memorie: I will not adde any thing aboue the ſence of that which ſhe hath written; onely it ſhall be my endeuour to bring that which ſhe hath written, into diſtinct order for better capacitie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you my owne particular knowledge conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that this precious ſigne was in this worthy woman, let her pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſhew it. To my knowledge, when ſhe was in the Citie, ſhe heard for the moſt part, nine or ten Sermons euery weeke; whereof foure of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly vpon the Sabbath day, beſides catechizing. Alſo, ſhe read daily morning and euening ſome part of the Scripture, from the beginning of the Bible vnto the end thereof. And ſhe did not reade the Scripture as many do, in haſte, but with ſerious conſideration, application, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. Moreouer, Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements were not grieuous vnto her,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16964:50"/>
but ſhe obeyed them with cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I neuer made any motion vnto her for any that were in diſtreſſe, but as ſoone as ſhe heard it, ſhe obeyed.

               <p>And this conſtant meditation of Gods word, is giuen as an infallible marke of a bleſſed perſon in Pſal. 1. <hi>In that Law will he meditate day and night.</hi> And if this be a ſigne in any, then much more in this good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.

               <q>I find a reſpect to all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, deſiring to obey in the leaſt commandement as well as in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; I find a willingneſſe to obey againſt profit, pleaſure, credite, eaſe, libertie, and the liking of carnall friends.</q>
               <p>And that this ſigne was in this worthy Chriſtian, it is alſo euident. She hath deſired to obey in the leaſt, and much more in the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. She, for her part, made conſcience, as well of litle oaths
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16964:51"/>
as of great; of deceiuing in a ſhilling, as well as in a pound; of the luſt of the eye, as well as of the act of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe; of words, as well as of deedes; and of thoughts, as well as of outward practiſes. This was manifeſt vnto me by her complaints againſt herſelfe, in ſuch things as a carnall hypocrite would haue eſteemed but motes, whereas ſhe eſteemed them beames. And that ſhe had a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to obey againſt profit, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe euident; for ſhe was an eſpeciall meanes to perſwade her husband, not to incomber himſelfe with too much worldly imployment, but rather to content himſelfe with leſſe worldly gaine, and to redeeme time for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods word, and for other holy occaſions. Secondly, ſhe obeyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt  <note place="margin">☞</note> pleaſure; for whereas ſhe had wont to ſeeke her bodily recreation vpon the Sabbath day, in walking vp and downe, in ſitting at her gate, in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16964:52"/>
talking of worldly matters, and ſuch like: now ſhe was growne ſo deuout and pious, as that ſhe made conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to expell worldly thoughts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lords day, as appeared by many godly queſtions, from time to time put forth vnto me by her. Thirdly, ſhe obeyed againſt credite; for whereas in her carnall eſtate, her carnall neighbours reſpected her; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when they obſerued this godly change in her, they ceaſſed to giue her that reſpect which was due vnto her; yea indeed they enuyed, hated, and neglected her. Fourthly, that ſhe obeyed againſt libertie and eaſe, it was alſo manifeſt; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in her carnall eſtate ſhe could take libertie to keepe her bed vpon the Sabbath day till eight of the clocke, now in her ſpirituall eſtate, ſhe could afford to riſe by fiue a clocke in the morning, and that in the cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and when ſhe was with child, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16964:52"/>
to go to the Lecture in the citie at ſix a clocke; and this ſhe did conſtantly. Fifthly, that ſhe obeyed againſt the liking of carnall friends, it was alſo plaine: for they ſtormed againſt her for theſe godly courſes, and did not ſpare to tell her, That if ſhe thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, ſhe would vtterly vndo her ſelfe, and ouerthrow her eſtate: and yet, againſt all theſe pull-backes, ſhe held on her godly courſe vnto the end.</p>

               <p>This marke was apparently in this our ſiſter by theſe ſignes. She feared both the company and doctrine of ſuch Miniſters, as ſhe perceiued would giue her too much liberty. She was likewiſe beſt pleaſed in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtrictneſſe, ſo that it were not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious but commanded of God.

She was fearefull to loſe any part or dram of her firſt loue.

was euident, that ſhe delighted in ſuch wayes whereby her heart might be inflamed to loue God.

Yea not many dayes before her departure out of this life, ſhe made a very excellent ſenſible acknowledgement of the goodneſſe of God vnto her, and how ſhe knew that it ſhould be well with her after this life ended; bleſſing God withall for the benefit which ſhe had receiued by the Miniſterie of the

Word, and exhorting her kinred and friends which were about her, that they ſhould be carefull to heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and to meditate of them. Yea ſhe did ſo ſpeake with that euidence of Spirit, as that ſhe drew teares from them which heard her at that time.</p>

               <p>That this ſeruant of God could pray for her enemies, and humble her ſoule in their diſtreſſe, we may well beleeue it if ſhe auouch it: for great was her truth in ſpeech, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tried. I do not denie but ſhe might ſometimes report an vntruth, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it by report from others whom ſhe beleeued: But to ſpeake a lie, or to ſpeake againſt her owne knowledge, to wrong any, or aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage her ſelfe, it was farre from her. Againe, that ſhe would be at peace with her enemies, without reuenge, and without ſeeking their ſhame, it was manifeſt. For when ſome had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16964:62"/>
wronged her by their ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous tongues, after ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with me, what I thought ſhe might do with a good conſcience in ſuch a caſe; ſhe was content to ſit downe vnder the wrong, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God would cleare her innocencie as the light at noone day. And this was the more excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in this our godly ſiſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">☜</note> indeed by nature ſhe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cholericke, and ſubiect to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>And what greater euidence is there of a good eſtate, then to forgiue our enemies? For Chriſt him ſelfe hath ſaid, that <hi>If we forgiue men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, our heauenly Father will for giue us our treſpaſſes,</hi> Math. 6. 14.</p>

She was content (for the preſent) to endure the hatred of the world for her profeſſion ſake, to endure the perſecution of the tongue, and the taunts of carnall friends.

               <p>This our ſiſter was not onely faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in her generall calling, but alſo in her particular.

               <p>The faith of this our ſiſter was no dead faith. To my knowledge ſhe was exceeding fruitfull in good workes. What money ſhe had of her owne in the time of her health, ſhe diſtributed it freely, partly to poore Preachers about this Citie, partly alſo to poore Chriſtians.

to releeue Gods poore, ſhe intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her husband to ſupply. Yea, ſhe was a very patroneſſe for ſuch as were in diſtreſſe; ſhe was a bleſſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſtirre vp her willing husband to many ſecret gifts, and bountifull almes-deedes, eſpecially vnto them which were of the houſhold of faith. To my knowledge ſhe hath giuen gold and ſiluer plentifully, to ſome more, and to ſome leſſe. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of her charitable workes, I remember that ſhe gaue <note place="margin">☞</note> to the Miniſter which was the means (vnder God) of her conuerſion (as ſhe ſuppoſed:) She gaue, I ſay, vnto him, by the conſent of her husband, the ſumme of fiftie pounds, beſides a large portion which ſhe begged of her husband to be diſtributed after her death vnto charitable vſes. The ſicke had cauſe to bleſſe God for her in her health, for ſhe viſited them with meate, with bodily preſence,

with neceſſarie helpe both by her ſelfe and by her maides. And many that enioy health, haue great cauſe to bleſſe God for her in her death, in reſpect of her liberall gifts.

               <p>Now this fruitfulneſſe did argue the goodneſſe of the Tree; for how doth a Chriſtian ſhew his faith, but by his workes? And the Lord (as you know) promiſeth a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto ſuch as do good vnto his members, Matth. 10. 42. Yea, at the day of iudgement Chriſt will ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ſuch fruitfull ones, <hi>Come vnto me, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

               <p>She continued faithfull to the end in the moſt ſubſtantiall graces. For howſoeuer ſhee mourned for the want of that degree of ioy which ſhe had felt in former times, yet ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in repentance, in the practiſe of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, in a tender loue to God, and to his word and children, in holy zeale, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe euen to the laſt period of her dayes.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16964:66"/>
And I call repentance a better grace then ioy, becauſe howſoeuer ioy is a moſt excellent gift of the Spirit, yet vnto vs repentance is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

She that before knew not the right hand from the left in religion, ſhe was growne to a very great vnderſtanding in ſo much that ſhe was able both to ſpeak diuinely, to inſtruct her ſeruants and children, and to write letters in the very language of Canaan with great ſufficiency.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhe found a change in her will and affections. For ſhe that was dead before vnto any ſound pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, now ſhe was reuiued aboue all things to affect and to ſeeke Gods kingdome.</p>
