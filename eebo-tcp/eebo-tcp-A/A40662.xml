            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>BEfore I commit a sinne, it seems to me so shallow, that I may wade thorow it dry-shod, from any Guiltinesse: But when I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, it often seems so deep, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57121:14"/>
drowning. Thus I am alwayes in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities: Either my sinnes are so small that they need not my Repentance, or so great that they cannot obtain thy Pardon. Lend me, O Lord, a Reed out of thy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, truly to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the demension of my offences. But O! as thou revealest to me, more of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, reveale also more of thy Mercy: Lest,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57121:14"/>
if my wounds, in my Apprehension, gape wider then thy Tents, my Soul runne out at them. If my Badnesse seeme bigger then thy Goodnesse, but one hair's breadth, but one Moment, that's Room and Time enough for me to run to eternall despair.</p>

have long deceived my self.

But when those dayes were come, I have adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Amendment to some other Time. Thus whilst I could

               <p>I Saw one, whom I knew to be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Bad, in great Extremity.

mind to return. How came it to passe, Lord, that he who expell'd him finally out of others, did not propell him so from himself. Sure it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because he did not, he could not do it. Or that he was lesse able to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, because he was more Charitable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others. No, I see my Saviour was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shew himself a God in other mens

matters, and but a Man in such cases wherein he himself was concerned. Being contented still to be tempted by Satan, that his Suffering for us, might cause our Conquering through him.</p>

               <p>I Know some Men very desirous to see the Devill, because they conceive such an Apparition would be a Confirmation of their Faith.

not believe there is a Heaven, except Hell it self be deposed for a Witnesse thereof.

lost it, till at last, I came safely to it, and took my lodging neer it. It fareth thus with us, whilst we are way-fairing to heaven, mounted on the <note n="*" place="margin">
