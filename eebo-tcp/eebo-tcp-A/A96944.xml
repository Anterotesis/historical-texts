            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What the Brittains loſt to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons, they to the Danes, and the Norman got from both, is his birth-right, beſides the Kingdomes of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland, and Principality of Wales, additions to the Normans Conqueſt: Had he begun his firſt <hi>Quinquenium,</hi> as he hath ſpent theſe laſt, and drawne that blood abroad which hath been ſpilt at home; had he been as quick in juſtice, as he hath been apt to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; had he brought in the Scots into this Kingdome, (as his Father did;) had they not been called in, my

Maſter had been the moſt powerfull and the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py King in Chriſtendome, but he was born to raigne when the Aſpects of the Planets were malignant, and in unhappy conjunctions or oppoſitions, in relation to his Kingdomes, diſpoſing Subjects to innovation in Religion, and immoderate deſires of libertie, (as that great Maſter in Aſtrologie, <hi>Tichobrahi,</hi> in his Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon that fatall Comet preceded the Germane war, foretold.) Tis true, Planets may diſpoſe, but cannot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate; <hi>Imperant aſtra ſenſui, non rationi, nil voluntatem impellunt,</hi> for otherwiſe they ſhould be guilty of our ſins, not we. When my Maſter is upon his Throne of Juſtice, he is like the tongue of the Ballance, and makes the Scales ſtand right and equall betwixt the extreames, Mercie and Judgement: but God caſt into the ſcale of Mercie ſome grains of his favour, which turn'd the ſcale, and made him the moſt mild, pious, and beſt beloved Prince of Chriſtendome: yet who can ſay that ever he feared to doe juſtice, or ſpared it, if not over-intreated by ſuch as made too great an advantage of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? It was a ſaying of <hi>Seneca's,</hi> that <hi>Parcere omnibus &amp; nullis eſt aequa crudelitas,</hi> but it is greater cruelty to the good to ſpare all, then to the bad to ſpare none. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes, <hi>Clementia tutum Regem in aperto oſtendit,</hi> for that, he ſaid, begot the love of the people, and I ſay it ſhould make him raigne in the hearts and affections of his Subjects; but never good King was worſe underſtood, nor more unhappily miſtaken. All I can or will ſay, is, the faults which were laid to his charge in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his troubles, (but whiſpered) are now thwarted ſo, that they become <gap reason="foreign">

ſtiffe; at firſt too peacefull, now too martiall: In a word, I need not write his Character, if his Hiſtory be not wronged; I cannot make ſo good an one, as that will prove him: To which I leave him, but with hopes to ſee him break through this cloud, (which over-ſhadowes him) and ſhine as bright and gloriouſly as ever, or more, (improved by theſe ſad tryalls) which ſhall be my Prayer for my Maſter, and ought to be of every loving Subject for his Soveraigne.</p>

Her Wiſdome appeares to all admiration, for ſhe hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done all agents of her ſexe, much more of her quality, in her negotiations, her love adding wings to her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that ſtrength to her body, to expedite what the moſt active here or abroad thought improbable, nay impoſſible to be effected. For her Conſtancie, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at that, more then this, that for a Crowne ſhe dare not change her Religion, having ſuch a Preſident as her glorious Father, (in all but that) and yet admire it more, conſidering her love to the King, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage her wiſdome aſſures the change would bring to their deſignes, the perfection of the preſidents, the one in conſtancie, the other in change, Ladies being more apt to follow the old French, then the new Engliſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. If I knew her not wiſe, as royall and pious as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I could moſt admire her favours to thoſe of our Nation in <hi>France,</hi> conſidering her ſufferance, and her Husbands here; yet ſhe is ſtill a Sanctuary to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands friends, (a rare preſident of Charitie) and in all this ſo cheerfull, ſhe rather encourageth others, then ſeemes to ſinke under ſuch a weight of afflictions, and in this exceeds her ſelfe as much as her ſexe in the other. Though I would not have her mutable, yet from my ſoule I wiſh her conformable to the King in her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt be the work of heaven; In the meane time I wiſh that we were as really charitable, as ſhe is truly pious, that ſhe could ſee our faith by our good works, that they might as much convince her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to change, as reaſon of State might and does move her reaſon to that conformitie, and truly binds her to it.

               <p>THe Duke of Yorke is a Prince for his birth may compare with any of Europe, (being my Maſter, his Brothers parallel) and I dare ſay cannot ſuffer in the compariſon. He ownes his Royall Father, and is as like him as Nature could caſt him in ſo Princely a mould: ſo like he is, we may invert that Royall Epithet was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Father, <hi>Jacobiſsimus Carolus,</hi> to <hi>Caroliſsimus Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus:</hi> and he makes it good. Thoſe who know him, know I flatter him not, if I ſay his diſpoſition ownes his Illuſtrious blood, and his Gallantry ſpeaks the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his birth. I dare promiſe his Princely Brother a gallant ſecond, and as faithfull as he can hope him. As valiant <hi>Clarence</hi> was to our glorious 5. <hi>Henry,</hi> ſo ſhall <hi>James</hi> be to his victorious Brother. Had <hi>Frances Mars</hi> her glorious 4. <hi>Henry</hi> ſeene theſe bloſſomes ſpringing from his Flower-de-luce, he would have rejoyced as much as ſo great a King could, to ſee his deareſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his ſo lively Character their mother ſo happy in this bleſſing, as it repayres or counterballances the ſad condition of her preſent fortune: And he would have righted his intereſt in them, and have made Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land know he was their Grandfather, (which the world ſhall ſee by their glorious actions.) It is not novelty, out of our Hiſtories to produce examples, that our wiſeſt and moſt victorious Kings and Princes have by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power been raiſed out of the duſt, and have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected ſtately monuments and glorious Tropheys upon ſuch ſad foundations as ours muſt build on; So <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> triumphed over his Rebellious Normans, in ſpite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113713:9"/>
of the power of France, and after over the Engliſh: ſo our ſecond <hi>Henry,</hi> our third, our fourth, and ſeventh, (to omit others) made themſelves glorious in ſpite of ſuppreſſion and ſad tryals, and were (like gold refined in the fornace) made more glorious, happy, and wiſe by their afflictions, for the ſweetneſſe of changes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares beſt in oppoſitions. He knowes not true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who hath not felt ſome adverſity. Sharp Schools make the beſt Scholars. Who knowes not the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Warre, cannot value Peace. And no Prince manages Peace ſo happily, as he who knowes the evil of War, yet knowes how to put on his Armes, as well as to lay them aſide. In a word, this hardſhip our hopes have ſuffered, hath much improved them, and I dare promiſe to the world happineſſe from it, and I hope a ſhare in his, whoſe title entitles my hope and intereſt in him, as well as my Princely Maſter.</p>

               <p>A Noble Generall is a man who hath peace with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and forgets not he is to make his accompt to God, as well as man, and therefore dares not doe that he knowes not how to anſwer to God, in reſpect of his conſcience, nor man in regard of his honour: he knowes he is not fit for command of others, is not maſter of himſelfe, and therefore ſtudyes that firſt; yet is not ſuch ſelfe-lover that he forgets his duty to either God or his Prince, it being no queſtion, whether a Generall ſhould obey God, or man, he firſt examines the quarrell before he accepts his Commiſſion, and that ſatisfyed dares dye in it, and that is his rule by which he directs his ſervice.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113713:9"/>
And as the Seaman by his compaſſe ſtears his courſe by that Card, yet varies his courſe as he does in his voyage, applying his experience to Occaſions, yet ſtill with an eye upon his Card, he often turnes his eyes inward, and there findes his Character of his owne charge: An Army of as different humours, and diſpoſitions, as <hi>Hannibals</hi> Army was, and deſires to governe his way: never one Nation was more intire in obedience, never Generall more abſolute in command, never Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtudyed his Commiſſion more, never Army executed it better. Had <hi>Carthage</hi> beene as good a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as he a ſervant, he had maſtred <hi>Rome.</hi> He cannot be happy in command, that knows not to obey, and by that learnt to command. That Prince or State puts an Army into a young Souldiers charge, its probable may pay as dear for his Learning, as he that truſts his fortune in a Ship without a Pilot: If he ſpeede well he is more beholden to chance, then diſcretion; this diſadvantage is too great for a wiſe man to adventure the truſt, and an honeſt man the charge: Paſſions and ſenſualities are not more obnoxious to the ſoule in the naturall Body, then theſe are to a Generall in relation to the body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique, good ſervants they are, but dangerous maſters: As the ſenſes preſent objects to the Phancie, and that to the intellect, yet ſtill the Will commands: ſo he is not in this without his well-choſen and well-rewarded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and correſpondency, nor without his owne Jugdement, and his choice Councells, yet keepes ſtill the prerogative of his command, not ſo premptory, as abſolute. And as the ſoule loves every member, yet makes uſe of it, and communicates liberally to its occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as it relates to the body, ſo he commands not but with as much love, yet indulges not ſo any member of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113713:10"/>
his body, nor ſenſe, or faculty of his ſoul, but he prefers the body to any member, and the ſoul to any ſenſe, and will rather curbe, and ſuppreſſe an inſolency or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in either, then indanger the whole, and knows that is leſſe cruelty to the good to ſpare all, then to the bad to ſave none. He looks upon his Officers as his ſenſes, and his Souldiers as his members, yet had rather cut off a finger then be deaf, or loſe a hand then his eies. And this care of his is happily requited with a dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and affection unto his Souldiers. And yet he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Officers accompts himſelf <hi>ſingulis major,</hi> and to his Army, <hi>univerſis minor.</hi> In a word, as God truſts the ſoule with the charge and command of the body, ſo is he truſted with his Army, and is as loath to hazard that, but feares not: Much leſſe denies to deliver up his commiſſion, or make his accompt, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, by the ſupream power, and hath alwayes his accompt ready in reſpect to that ſupreame Commiſſion of Gods, or that inferiour of Mans, and therefore feares no more to hazard or leave it (when a juſt occaſion commands it) then a well ſatisfyed Chriſtian to dye in God and his Princes juſt cauſe, whoſe faith hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Crowned his head with glorious Martyrdom, and ſuch a Generall deſerves as well the glory of a Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IS one who profeſſeth the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of England, eſtabliſhed firſt by General Councels and Synods, and after confirmed by the knowne Lawes of the Kingdome, and profeſſeth againſt the contrary. He ſticks to the Proteſtation of <hi>Ausburge,</hi> whence he had his name; he loves the unity of the Church ſo, that he endeavours next her verity in faith, her unity and conformity in Diſcipline with that Church, not daring to broach new opinions, nor preach them to diſturbe the peace of his aged Mother. Private interpretations of Scripture he approves not, but ſubmits his owne, and maintaines none againſt the received and approved Doctrine of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is a member: He thinks that Evangelicall counſel is to be obſerved, that all things muſt be done in order and decencie: He conceives the King to be the Head of the Church, as it is perſonall, not ſpirituall, and hath ſworne him Gods Deputy in Government, and truſted with the ſword, which he muſt not beare in vaine: He dares not queſtion his Authority, who is onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to God, but in his heart honours him as his Vice-gerent, and knowes that to reſiſt his power, is to reſiſt him that gave it; and though the penalty be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet he feares not that ſo much as the offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God, who gave the power: He confeſſes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Gods Morall Lawes, and Mans Judiciall, and that there muſt be as well obedience active as paſſive, to the one, as the other: He knowes Chriſts ſpirituall Kingdome oppoſeth not the temporall claime and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113713:11"/>
of Kings, but <hi>Ceſar</hi> muſt have his tribute (the badge of Conqueſt) as God muſt have his in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his protection. He dares call his Soveraigne the Anointed of God, ſince God called <hi>Cyrus</hi> a Heathen ſo, not for the holineſſe of externall unction, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall character of ſupreame power, and <hi>Saul</hi> a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, a perſecutor, a murtherer: ſo he can make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between types and metaphors, the one being in perſons, the other in words. He conceives paſſive obedience alwayes due to the power of the King, where active cannot be performed with a good conſcience. He beleeves faith alone cannot, nor doth juſtifie without works, but both together, the firſt before God, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond before men. He beleeves God rewards above me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet that there is difference in glory, and reward, though all have fulneſſe. Traditions and Ceremonies he reverences, as they are in Antiquity, and ſtreame from the ſprings of originall purity, not to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Doctrine, but Diſcipline. He deteſts Parity in Church or in Common-wealth, as tending to Anarchy, and deſtroy thoſe it will follow. He thinkes it not fit to pull downe the Cantrells of an Arche till the key-ſtone be ſettled, and then the greater the weight is, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it will be; he likes the fabrick of the old ſo well, he thinks the change may be dangerous. He dares not ſweare againſt his conſcience, nor vow implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to occaſionall ordinances. He thinks no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but the ſame, or a greater then that to whom he hath made a Judicial vow, can diſanull it. He is loyall for Conſcience ſake to his Soveraigne, charitable for Gods ſake to his Neighbour, and dares not doe that unto another, he cannot be content ſhould be done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; much leſſe rob his Soveraigne of his birth-right,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113713:11"/>
or deface Gods character; he thinks <hi>Dixi vos dii eſtis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs ſupremely to his Soveraign, miniſterially to his ſubjects: he dares not diſtinguiſh betwixt the King and his Perſon, and thinke the one at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the other in his Armie; and hazard that in the feild to ſave that at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> he likes not that nice diſtinction forged in the Scoole of the Jeſuits, derived from the Devills Logicke: His heart thinks no diſloyall thought, much leſſe dares he ſpeake a word to leſſen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to Majeſtie, not for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the ſinne; who dares not forſake his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in his adverſity, leſt God deny him in his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; who in a dungeon can finde more comfort, then they who commanded him thither. He with <hi>Joſeph</hi> finds his Keepers wrought by a ſupreme power to mercy, if not truſt, whoſe cheerfulneſſe is a comfort to his fellow-Priſoners, and no leſſe advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, God making him the inſtrument of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their adverſities, and him happy in his gallant cheerfulneſſe, and magnanimous patience. In a word, he dares in his Princes juſt quarrell meet death with as much courage, as <hi>David</hi> met <hi>Goliah,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> went into the Lions Den, or the three Children into the fiery for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and in the midſt of his tortures, can with as much cheerfulneſſe ſing his <hi>Nunc dimitte,</hi> as <hi>Simeon</hi> did with his Chriſt in his armes.</p>

You ſhall find him pointed in the New Teſtament (with a <hi>Vae vobis</hi>) who love the chiefe ſeats at feaſts, and make long prayers in Widdowes houſes, and lead ſilly women captive; He approves not that Evangelicall councell, to <hi>worke out ſalvation with feare and trembling,</hi> for this toucheth too much upon our obligation to the Law; Beſides, feare is oppoſite to faith, and trembling to boldneſſe; he is as bold as blind Byard, and ſcarce will be beholding to Chriſt for his ſecuritie; He thinks himſelf of a higher form in the ſchool of Gods Church, then to ſubmit to the pedagogie of the Law Morall, Iudiciall, or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall; he hath found a ſhorter cut to heaven then the Catholicke Church ever heard of, and a cheaper, (faith without workes) he thinks Canonicall obedience a badge of the beaſt, and ſubordination to temporall or eccleſiaſticall powers, of a forfeiture of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of faith; An oath he avoides as a ſnare for his Conſcience, and is ſo tender in this kinde, he wiſely refuſeth the Nationall Covenant; if he hath taken the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113713:12"/>
oath of Supremacie, or that of Allegiance, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented it with more ſorrow and deteſtation then any of his ſinnes; he is confident the ſpirituall power of Chriſts Kingdome here, diſingages him of all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obligation; The Hornet is not a worſe Neighbour to the Bee, then he is to the Presbyterian, and robs his Hive as oft both of his Honie and Bees; he talkes much of a new began Kingdome of Chriſt, ſet up in the hearts and ſoules of the Saints, which diſchargeth him of all Secular duty. He is confident, that this is that Kingdome of Glory here, which ſhall laſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres, and expects no other. He hath heard the laſt Trumpe, which like the voyce of an Angel is not heard, but of thoſe to whom it was ſent. He is confident Chriſt hath already divided the world into two parts, the Goats and the Sheep, and they are ſevered. He thruſts the Presbyterian out of the flock, as Linſey Wolſey was out of the Jewiſh Temple. He will not allow a Biſhop and Presbyter to differ in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but Roman-like takes that himſelfe as his due, which they could not agree on, and would make a Congregationall Hierarchie as abſolute, as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter a Claſſicall, or the Biſhop an Epiſcopall. In a word, he hath ſpun his Religion to ſo fine a thred, that it may more fitly be termed a Myſterie then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: his Charitie is as inviſible as his Faith, and his Hope as his Charitie: he is in this indeed to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he is of ſo publike a ſpirit, that he would have a community of all things: he can endure no preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but that of theirs, (that of Faith) which gives him a title to all ours: and of ſo harmleſſe an humility he is, he avoweth that we need no fig-leaves to cover na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, <hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini</hi> is the firſt command,

and all he ſticks to, he would have none baptized but ſuch as can give an account of their faith, but thinks it needleſſe to give any either to God or man of their works: he thinks that Faith is the forme that gives the <hi>eſſe</hi> to the Sacraments, but not good works the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> to Faith, and ſo either he will goe to heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, or elſe he thinks that God doth his Faith wrong, and his owne promiſe more.</p>

She loves not (with the Phariſees) the higheſt places at Feaſts, nor ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Aſſemblies, knowing Envy attends the firſt, and Pride the other. Her dreſſe is more comely then coſtly, modeſt then gariſh; her viſits, like Sabboth dayes labours, not frequent, and never without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or neceſſity undertaken: her entertainment to her husbands friends, or her owne, ſuits both their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; more neat it is then curious; and is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſolid then ceremonious.
