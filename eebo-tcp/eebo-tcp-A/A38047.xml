            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:63042:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which lyes upon us make this declaration to you.</p>
            <p>And for the avoiding of bloud, We directed the directed the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> Lord Generall, by him selfe or others in some safe and honourable way, to cause to bee delivered an humble Petition, wherein we doe desire nothing from His Majesty but that he would returne in peace to His Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament: And by their faithfull Counsell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice compose the distempers and confusions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in his Kingdomes, as hee is bound to doe, we therin professing in the sight of Almighty God, which is the strongest obligation and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that any Christian, and the most solemne publike Faith which any such State, as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can give, that we would receive him with all Honour, yeeld Him all true obedience and subjection, and faithfully endeavour to defend his Person and Estate from all danger, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of our power to establish to him and to his people all the blessings of a glorious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reigne, as it is more largely expressed in that Petition.</p>
            <p>For the Delivery of which Petition, His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie hath twice sent unto the King, humbly desiring a safe conduct for those who should bee imployed therein, but His Mtjesty refused to give
<pb facs="tcp:63042:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any such safe Conduct, or to receive this humble and dutifull Petition, by any addresse of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> saying, that if Justice had been done, the Gentleman which brought the second Message, could not expect his Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By</hi> all which, and many other Evidences and Inducements, we are fully convinc'd in our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Beliefe, that the Kings Councels and Resolutions are so eng<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Also His Majesty being now growne stronger, and able as he conceives to make good his owne ends by Armes, his confidence in the papists doth more clearly appear, persons imprisond for priests and Iesuites have bin released out of the Gaole of Lancaster, profest papists have bin invited to rise and take up Armes.</p>

For which Reasons, we are resolved to enter into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath and Covenant with God, to give up our selves and fortunes in his hands, and that wee will to the uttermost of our power and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maintain his Truth, and conform our selves to his will.
