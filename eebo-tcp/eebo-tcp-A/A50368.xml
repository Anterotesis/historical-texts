            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He use of History, and the just
Rules for composure of it, have
been so well and fully described
heretofore by judicious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that it were lost labour,
and a needlesse extention of the present work,
to insist by way of Introduction, upon either
of them. I could rather wish my abilities were
such, as that the Reader, to whose judgement
it is left, might finde those Rules observed in
the Narration it self, then told him in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
by a vaine Anticipation.</p>
            <p>I will only professe to follow that one Rule,
Truth, to which all the rest (like the rest of
Morall Vertues to that of Justice) may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
against which there are many waies,
besides plaine falshood, whereby a Writer
may offend. Some Historians, who seeme to
abhorre direct falshood, have notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dressed Truth in such improper Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as if they brought her forth to act the
<pb facs="tcp:96346:3"/>
same part that falshood would; and taught
her by Rhetoricall disguises, partiall conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and invective expressions, instead of
informing, to seduce a Reader, and carry the
judgement of Posterity after that Byas which
themselves have made. It was the opinion of
a learned Bishop of <hi>England,</hi> not long ago
deceased, that Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
did more wound the Protestant Cause,
then the Controversies of <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> And
it may well be true. For against the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
stroke of partiall History the ward is not
so ready, as against that Polemike writing,
where Hostility is professed with open face.</p>
            <p>This fault I have indeavoured to avoid:
But it is my misfortune to undertake such a
subject, in which to avoid partiality, is not
very easie: But to escape the suspition or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, is almost impossible for the cleerest
integrity that ever wrote. Others, I suppose,
will handle this Theame; and because that
none, perchance, may perfectly please, I shall,
in the behalfe of all, intreat a Reader, that
in his censure he would deale with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of men, as with mankinde it selfe, to call
that the best, which is least bad.</p>
            <p>The Subject of this work is a Civill War,
a War indeed as much <hi>more then Civill,</hi> and
as full of miracle, both in the causes and effects
of it, as was ever observed in any Age; a
<pb facs="tcp:96346:3"/>
Warre as cruell as unnaturall; that has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as much rage of Swords, as much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
of Pens, both publike and private, as
was ever knowne; and divided the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of men, as well as their affections,
in so high a degree, that scarce could any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
gaine due applause, any reason give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
or any Relation obtaine credit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
amongst men of the same side. It were
therefore a presumptuous madnesse, to think
that this poore and weake Discourse, which
can deserve no applause from either side,
should obtaine from both so much as pardon;
or that they should here meet in censure,
which in nothing else have concurred.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore be so stupid, as not at all
to be sensible of the taske imposed on me, or
the great envy which attends it; which other
men who have written Histories, upon farre
lesse occasion have discoursed of at large in
their Prefaces. And <hi>Tacitus</hi> himselfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of those ill times which were the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
subject of his Annals, though he wrote
not in the time of the same Princes, under
whom those things were acted; yet because
the Families of many men, who had then been
ignominious, were yet in being, could not
but discourse how much happier those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were, who had taken more ancient and
prosperous times for their Argument; such
<pb facs="tcp:96346:4"/>
as he there expresses, in which the great and
glorious actions of the old Romans, their
honourable Atchievements, and exemplary
Vertues are recorded.</p>
            <p>And I could have wished more then my
life (being my self inconsiderable) that for the
Publike sake, my Theame could rather have
been the prosperity of these Nations, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and happinesse of this King, and such
a blessed Condition of both, as might have
reached all the ends, for which Government
was first ordained in the world: Then the
description of Shipwracks, Ruines, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations.
Yet these things truly recorded
and observed, may be of good Use, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
Posterity in divers kinds. For though
the present Actions, or rather sufferings of
these (once happy) Nations, are of so high
a marke and consideration, as might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
throw themselves into the knowledge
of Posterity by Tradition, and the weight of
their owne Fame: Yet it may much conduce
to the benefit of that knowledge, to have the
true causes, originall, and growth of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by an honnest Pen.</p>
            <p>For the truth of this plaine and naked Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which is here presented to the publike
view, containing a briefe Narration of those
Distractions which have fallen amongst us,
during the sitting of this present Parliament;
<pb facs="tcp:96346:4"/>
as also some Passages, and visible Actions of
the former Government (whether probably
conducing to these present calamities or not,
of which let the Reader judge) I appeale only
to the memory of any English man, whose
yeares have been enow to make him know the
Actions that were done; and whose conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
has been enough publike, to let him
heare the Common Voice, and Discourses of
People upon those Actions, to his memory
I say, do I appeale, whether such Actions
were not done, and such Judgements made
upon them, as are here related. In which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
some Readers may be put in minde
of their owne thoughts heretofore; which
thoughts have since, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi>
dreame, departed from them. An English
Gentleman, who went to travell when this
Parliament was called, and returned when
these differences were growne among us, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what Discourses were daily made, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (in his
opinion) was more mis-understood in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
then at <hi>Rome;</hi> And that there was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
need to remember our own Countrymen,
then to informe strangers of what was past;
So much (said he) have they seemed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the things themselves, and their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning them.</p>
            <p>But where Warre continues, people are
inforced to make their residence in severall
<pb facs="tcp:96346:5"/>
Quarters, and therefore severall, according to
the places where they converse, must their
information be concerning the condition and
state of things. From whence arises not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a variety, but a great discrepancy for the
most part in the Writings of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
the passages of such times. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it has seldome happened, but that in such
times of calamity and Warre, Historians
have much dissented from each other. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus
Haraeus</hi> compiled Annals of the bloody
and fierce Warres in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> when
some of those Provinces fell from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Philip</hi> the second, King of <hi>Spaine:</hi>
Which businesse he relates in such a way, as
must in probability lead a Reader to believe
that the King and his Officers were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
innocent, and the people of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
the only causers of their own Calamity.
<hi>Meteranus</hi> wrote the History of those very
times; which who so reads, must needs make
a contrary censure concerning the occasion of
that Warre. The like discrepancy hath been
found in Historians of all ages and Nations,
and therefore not to be much wondred at, if
it now happen.</p>
            <p>But that which of all other is most likely
to be differently related (because informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will not agree in such a distance) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the actions of Warre and Souldiery;
and in the time of this Warre it is a thing of
<pb facs="tcp:96346:5"/>
extreme difficulty (I might say of impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)
for those of one Party to be truly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of all the Councels, or the very Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
and Actions of Commanders and
Souldiers on the other side. How much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
the English Nation on both sides have
been guilty of in this unnaturall Warre, the
World must needs know in the generall fame.
But for particulars, how much Worth,
Vertue, and Courage, some particular Lords,
Gentlemen, and others have shewed, unlesse
both sides do write, will never perfectly be
known. My residence hath bin, during these
Wars, in the quarters, and under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Parliament; and whatsoever is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related of the Souldiery, being toward the
end of this Book, is according to that light
which I discerned there. For whatsoever I have
missed concerning the other Party, I can make
no other Apology then such as <hi>Meteranus</hi>
(whom I named before) doth in the Preface to
his History, <hi>De Belguis tumultibus.</hi> Whose
words are thus: <hi>Quòd plura de Reformatorum,
&amp; patriae defensorum, quàm de Partis adversaere.
bus gestis exposuerìm; mirum haudquaquam est,
quoniam plus Commercii, &amp; familiaritatis mihi
cum ipsis, &amp; major indagandi, opportunitas furt.
Si Pars adversaidem tali probitate praestiterit, &amp;
ediderit; Posteritas gesta omnia legere, &amp; liquido
cognoscere magno cum fructu poterit.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may I averre, that if in this discourse more
<pb facs="tcp:96346:6"/>
particulars are set down, concerning the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those men who defended the Parliament,
then of them that warred against it; it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my conversation gave me more light on
that side; to whom, as I have indeavoured to
give no more then what is due, so I have cast
no blemishes on the other; nor bestowed any
more characters, then what the truth of Story
must require. If those that write on the other
side will use the same candour, there is no feare
but that posterity may receive a full informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning the unhappy distractions of
these Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>This I must adde, that to inform the world
of the right nature, causes, and growth of these
Distractions, it will require that the Discourse
begin from precedent times; which I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deduce down to the present with
as much brevity, as the necessity of unfolding
truth can possibly admit.</p>
            <p>Neither is it needful to begin the Story from
times of any great distance; or to mention the
Government of our most ancient Princes; but
from that Prince (fresh in the memory of some
yet living) who first established the Reformed
Religion in this Kingdome, and according to
that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a new interest in the State; which
was most behoofefull and requisite for her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
to follow, and much conducing, besides
the glory of Almighty God, to their own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Power, and Greatnesse.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Q</seg>Ueene ELIZABETH, of glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
together with that great
Stock of Wealth and Honour, which
her prudent and just Government
had brought to the English Nation,
had enriched them besides with a
greater Treasure (which we may justly account the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96346:9"/>
cause of all the rest) Religion reformed from Popish
Superstition.</p>
                  <p>That Reformation engaged the Queene in a new
Interest of State, to side with the Protestants against
those Potent Monarchs of the other Religion, which
seemed at the beginning as much danger and disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to her, as it proved in conclusion security and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
so impossible it is for any disadvantage to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
over them that helpe the Lord against the
Mighty.</p>
                  <p>That Storme from <hi>France,</hi> which so much threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the weake beginnings of her Reigne, was sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blowne over by the death of HENRY the second,
and some few Moneths after of his Sonne FRANCIS,
who had married the Queene of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the danger
which remained greatest was from <hi>Spaine,</hi> where
PHILIP the second then reigned, a Prince not greater
in Dominion, Treasure, and Armies, then deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
against the Protestant Religion, by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and assistance of the Jesuites, an <hi>Order,</hi> which
in the Age before had beene highly counrenanced by
Pope PAUL the third, in opposition to the Gospell-Doctrine,
that then began to spread apace in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and other parts.</p>
                  <p>The whole <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Iesuites</hi> (as endeavouring to
set up one Temporall Kingdome of <hi>Christendome,</hi> sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the <hi>Papall Hierarchy</hi>) applyed their service al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as being then far
the greatest in <hi>Europe</hi> (and fittest for their purpose)
by the late uniting of so many Kingdomes and Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
under the person of CHARLES the Emperour,
who by a fortunate birthright inherited, together with
<hi>Casule,</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> and all the great Acquisitions of
his Grandfather FERDINAND in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>West
Indies,</hi> the rich and usefull patrimony of his Father
PHILIP, <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> all these
he had left intirely to his Sonne PHILIP, who to
so large a Territory, had made that strong addition of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96346:9"/>
the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and might seeme an
Enemy too mighty for <hi>England</hi> and all the <hi>Protestants</hi>
of <hi>Europe</hi> to oppose.</p>
                  <p>But Queene ELIZABETH had woven the interest
of her own State so inseparably into the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it selfe, that it was hard to overthrow one
without the ruine of the other. And God, who had
given her so much grace and courage as to rely wholly
upon him, did with that Almighty hand, not onely
hold her up from sinking, but lift her above the heads
of all her enemies.</p>
                  <p>By what degrees and means she atchieved the great
Actions of her reigne, and brought so much prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to her Nation, it is not the scope of this discourse
to relate at large (for her History is not the worke in
hand) but only in briefe to declare that before her
death she was the happy instrument of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Protestant Religion in all parts. She cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the Spanish greatnesse by supporting <hi>France</hi> from
ruine, to give some balance to the other, as she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<hi>Scotland</hi> from being swallowed up by the
French before. She protected the <hi>Hollanders</hi> against
him, vanquished his Armies both by Land and Sea,
with many other such things as might seeme too
much to be the atchievements of one Reigne. And
last of all, she reduced <hi>Ireland</hi> wholly to obedience,
notwithstanding all the subtill machinations of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and open assistance given in Armes to her Irish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.
All which she accomplished by the justice and
prudence of her government, by making the right
use of her Subjects hearts, hands and Purses in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
way; as also securing her own Kingdome
by strengthning the hands of Protestants abroad; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as she stood at last above the reach of any
enemy by open warre; and protected by God, though
often attempted by domestick Treasons and Assasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
till in the end she died in a good old age, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to her Successor King JAMES the Kingdom of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96346:10"/>
                     <hi>England</hi> in an happier condition then ever it was; the
Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> wholly subdued and reduced,
to reap for himselfe the harvest of all her labour and
expence; and nothing to do for it, but to propagate
the true Faith in that Kingdome, which she prevented
by death could not performe; and was, in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
an easie taske for King JAMES at that time;
much conducing, besides the honour of God, to his
owne Temporall strength and greatnesse, if he had
onely gone fairely on in that way which Queene
ELIZABETH had made plaine for him.</p>
                  <p>The Prosperity of <hi>England</hi> seemed then at the
height or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and it pleases God that States many
times shall decline from their happinesse without any
apparent signes to us, or reasons that we can give, as a
Heathen complaines:
<q>
                        <l>Oh faciles dare summa Deos, eademque tueri</l>
                        <l>Difficiles? <hi>Lucan.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>How easie are the Gods to raise States high,</l>
                        <l>But not to keepe them so?</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things have made some high-reaching Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
impute the raising and declination of Kingdomes
and Common-wealths to certaine aspects of heavenly
Constellations, to Conjunctions, and Oppositions of
Planets, and various Ecclipses of Celestiall Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
others, to an hidden strength, and secret efficacy
of Numbers themselves; and most men to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Rotation of fortune: but the judgements of God
in those things are past our finding out, and they are
too wise, who are not content sometimes to wonder.</p>
                  <p>For King JAMES, the Successour to Queene ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH,
was a wise and learned Prince, of disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mercifull and gracious, excellently grounded in
that Religion which he professed, as the world may
finde by his extant writings; a Prince of whom <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
conceived wonderfull hope, and received with
great joy and Triumph; but he did not beginne where
his Predecessor left, proceeding rather in a contrary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96346:10"/>
way; what the reasons of it were, I will not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to deliver my opinion, though some have beene
bold to write and publish of late yeeres, that it was
feare for his own Person, that made him to temporize
with <hi>Rome,</hi> considering the boldnesse of Jesuiticall
Assasines: others more candidly conceived it might
be his great desire of peace and union with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
though he might erre in the meanes of attaining
that end; for he was by nature a great seeker of Peace,
and abhorrer of bloodshed, according to that Motto
which he ever used, <hi>Beati Pacifici.</hi> I cannot search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mens thoughts, but onely relate the Actions which
appeared.</p>
                  <p>King JAMES, at the beginning of his Reigne, made
a Peace with <hi>Spaine,</hi> which was brought very low by
Queene ELIZABETH, and had beene neerer to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
in all probability, had she lived a few yeares lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
the Estates of the united Provinces of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
those usefull Confederates to <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be despised by the English Court, under a
vaine shadow in stead of a reason, that they were an
ill example for a Monarch to cherish. Then began se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Treaties to passe betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and the Court of
<hi>England;</hi> care to be taken about reconciliation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions;
the rigour of Penall Lawes against the Papists
(notwithstanding that odious plot of the Gunpowder
Treason) was abated; the pompe of Prelacy, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Ceremonies, encreased daily in the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and according to that were all Civill Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
managed both at home and abroad.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it easie for the King to turne himselfe
out of that way, when he was once entred into it; so
that at last the Papists began by degrees to be admitted
neerer to him in service and conversation. Exceeding
desirous he then was to match the Prince his Sonne to
the Infanta of <hi>Spaine,</hi> about which many and long
Treaties passed, wherein not onely the Spaniard, but
the Pope, made many present advantages of the Kings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96346:11"/>
earnest desires, and many waies deluded him, as it
appeared plainely by his owne Letters to his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
there, since found and published.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the King by degrees brought, not onely
to forsake, but to oppose his owne interest both in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and religious affaires, which was most unhappily
seene in that cause (as the Duke of ROHAN obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,)
wherein, besides the interest of all Protestants,
and the honour of his Nation, the estate and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of his owne children were at the height concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the Palatinate businesse.</p>
                  <p>From hence slowed a farther mischiefe; for the
King being loath perchance that the whole people
should take notice of those waies in which he trod,
grew extremely dis-affected to Parliaments, calling
them for nothing but to supply his expences, dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them when they began to meddle with State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and divers times imprisoning the Members for
Speeches made in Parliament, against the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
priviledges of that high Court.</p>
                  <p>Parliaments being thus despised and abused, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
against the Lawes were found out to supply the
Kings expences, which were not small; and the King
(whether to avoid the envy of those things, or the
trouble of them) did in a manner put off all businesse
of Government from himselfe into the hands of a
young Favourite, the Duke of BUCKINGHAM,
whom he had raised from a Knights fourth Sonne, to
that great height, and entrusted with the chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Kingdome; besides the great power which
he had by that extraordinary favour of confering
all places and preferments both in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>This Duke, not long before the death of King
JAMES, was growne into extraordinary favour and
intirenesse with the Prince, whom he afterward sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no lesse then he had before his father; like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
vapour exhaled from the earth to so great an
height, as to cloud not only the rising, but the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sunne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96346:11"/>
King CHARLES, with great hopes and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the people, and no lesse high expressions of
love and duty from all in generall, began his Reigne
on the 27 of <hi>March,</hi> 1624. and indeed that love
which the people bare to his Person, had been before
testified, whilest he was yet Prince, at his returne from
<hi>Spaine,</hi> though the journey it selfe had not beene
pleasing to the Kingdome; for when the people saw
him arrived in safety, there needed no publike Edict
for thanksgiving or joy; every society and private
family (as if the hearts of all had beene in one) did
voluntarily assemble themselves together, praising
God, with singing of Psalmes, with joyfull feasting,
and charity to the poore; insomuch that I suppose
the like consent, without any interposing authority,
hath not been often knowne.</p>
                  <p>The same affections followed him to his Throne;
the same hopes and faire presages of his future Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
whilest they considered the temperance of
his youth, how cleare he had lived from personall vice,
being growne to the age of 23. how untainted of
those licentious extravagances, which unto that age
and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tune are not only incident, but almost thought
excusable.</p>
                  <p>But some men suspended their hopes, as doubting
what to finde of a Prince so much and so long reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
for he had never declared himselfe of any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or scarse interposed in any State affaires, though
some things had been managed in his fathers Reigne,
with much detriment to his owne present and future
fortunes. Yet that by the people in generall was well
censured, as an effect of his piety and obedience to
the King his father, and happy presages gathered from
it, That so good an obeyer would prove a just Ruler.</p>
                  <p>They wondered also to see him suddenly linked in
such an intire friendship with the Duke of BUCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGHAM;
for extraordinary Favourites do usually
eclipse and much depresse the Heire apparent of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96346:12"/>
Crowne, or else they are conceived so to do; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that reason hated, and ruined by the succeeding
Prince; in which kinde all ancient and moderne Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are full of examples.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of King CHARLES his Reigne,
a Parliament was called, and adjourned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> the
plague raging extremely at <hi>London,</hi> where the Duke
of BUCKINGHAM was highly questioned, but by
the King (not without the griefe and sad presage of
many people, that private affections would too much
prevaile in him against the publike) he was protected
against the Parliament, which for that onely purpose
was dissolved, after two Subsidies had been given,
and before the Kingdome received reliefe in any one
grievance; as is expressed in the first and generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
of this present Parliament, where many
other unhappy passages of those times are briefly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
as that the King, immediately after the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Parliament, contrived a Warre against
<hi>Spaine,</hi> in which the designe was unhappily laid, and
contrary to the advice which at that time had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by wise men, who perswaded him to invade the
<hi>West Indies;</hi> a way, no doubt, farre more easie and
hopefull for <hi>England</hi> to prevaile against <hi>Spaine</hi> then
any other: instead of that, the King with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Treasure, raised an Army and Fleet to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
<hi>Cales,</hi> the Duke of BUCKINGHAM bearing the
Title both of Admirall and Generall, though he went
not himselfe in person; but the matter was so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the expedition proved altogether successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and as dishonourable as expensive.</p>
                  <p>They complained likewise of another designe
(which indeed was much lamented by the people of
<hi>England</hi> in generall) about that time put in practice,
a thing destructive to the highest interest of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the maintenance of Protestant Religion; a Fleet of
English Ships were set forth, and delivered over to the
French, by whose strength all the Sea forces of <hi>Rochell</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96346:12"/>
were scattered and destroyed, a losse to them irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable,
and the first step to their ruine.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this loane of Ships from <hi>England</hi> (for
such was the peoples complaint and suspition against
those, who at that time stood at the Helme) suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to proceed so much from friendship to the State
of <hi>France,</hi> as from designe against Religion; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon it, the King, by what advice the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
understood not, made a breach with <hi>France,</hi> by
taking their Ships, to a great value, without making
any recompence to the English, whose Goods were
thereupon imbarr'd, and confiscate in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>In revenge of this, a brave Army was raised in
<hi>England,</hi> and commanded by the Duke of BUCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGHAM
in person, who landing at the Isle of <hi>Rhea,</hi>
was at the first encounter victorious against the French;
but after few Moneths stay there, the matter was so
unhappily carried, the Generall being unexperienced
in Warlike affaires, that the French prevailed, and
gave a great defeat, where many gallant Gentlemen
lost their lives, and the Nation much of their ancient
Honour.</p>
                  <p>From thence proceeded another step to the ruine of
<hi>Rochell;</hi> the sick and wounded English were sent into
that City, and relieved by the besieged Rochellers,
out of that little provision which they then had, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
faithfull promise of supplies from <hi>England</hi> in the
same kinde: The provisions of <hi>Rochell</hi> were little
enough for their owne reliefe at that time, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what ability the French King had to continue
that siege; when to the proper wealth and greatnesse
of his Crowne, was added that reputation and strength,
which his late successe against all the other Protestant
Garrisons in <hi>France</hi> had brought.</p>
                  <p>The besieged Rochellers, not doubting at all of
the due and necessary supply of Victuall from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
sent their Ships thither for that purpose; but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96346:13"/>
those Ships, whose returne with bread was so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expected, were stayed in <hi>England</hi> by an <hi>Imbargo;</hi>
and so long stayed, till that unhappy Towne was
enforced to yeeld by famine, the sharpest of all
Enemies.</p>
                  <p>But in the meane time, whilest these Ships with
Victuall were detained, a great Army was raised in
<hi>England</hi> for reliefe of <hi>Rochell,</hi> but too great was the
delay of those preparations, till time was past, and
that Army in the end disbanded by the sad death of
the Duke of BUCKINGHAM their Generall, who
was stabbed at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> by a private Gentleman,
JOHN FELTON.</p>
                  <p>This FELTON was a Souldier of a low stature, and
no promising aspect; of disposition serious, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
but religious in the whole course of his life
and conversation; which last I do not mention out of
purpose to countenance his unlawfull act, as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him to have had (as some did then talke) any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
or calling of God to it: His confessions to his
friends, both publike and private, were, That he
had often secret motions to that purpose, which he
had resisted and prayed against, and had almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
untill he was at last confirmed in it, by reading
the late dissolved Parliaments Remonstrance against
the Duke: That then his conscience told him it was
just and laudable, to be the executioner of that man,
whom the highest Court of Judicature, the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
body of the Kingdome, had condemned as a
Traytor. But let Posterity censure it as they please;
certain it is, that FELTON did much repent him of the
unlawfulnesse of the fact, out of no feare of death,
or punishment here, for he wished his hand cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the execution, which his Jugdes could not
doome by the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King had not long before broken off another
Parliament, called in the second yeare of his Reigne,
in which the Petition of Right was granted, to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96346:13"/>
great rejoycing of the people. But it proved imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to be no reliefe at all to them; for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
presently dissolved, the King acted over the
same things, which formerly he had done; and that
grant, instead of fortifying the Kingdomes Liberty,
made it appeare to be more defencelesse then before,
that Lawes themselves were no barre against the Kings
will. The Parliament in hope of gracious Acts, had
declared an intent to give his Majesty five Subsidies,
the full proportion of which five Subsidies was, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the dissolution of that Parliament, exacted by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Loane from the people, and those impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
which refused the payment of that Loane:
Great summes of money were required and raised by
privy Scales: A Commission for squeezing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by way of Excize: Souldiers were billited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: And a designe laid to inslave the Nation by
a force of German Horse: with many other things of
that nature.</p>
                  <p>Those affaires of State which concerned Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
abroad, had been managed with as much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
and infelicity to them, as dishonour to
the English Nation, and prejudice to the Cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Peace was made with <hi>Spaine</hi> without consent of
Parliament; by which all hope was utterly lost, of
re-establishing the Kings neerest kinred in their just
Dominion; and the Protestant Religion much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
in <hi>Germany.</hi> What Counsells had then influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the Court of <hi>England,</hi> might be the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a wise man to consider; and the plaine truth
must needs seeme a paradox to posterity; as that the
Protestant Religion, both at home and abroad, should
suffer much by the Government of two Kings; of
whom the former in his own person wrote more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
in defence of it; and the latter in his owne
person lived more conformably to the Rules of it,
then any of their Contemporary Princes in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96346:14"/>
But the Civill Affaires of State were too ill managed,
to protect, or at least to propagate true Religion;
or else the neglect of Religion was the cause that
Civill Affaires were blessed with no more honour and
prosperity. The right waies of Queen ELIZABETH,
who advanced both, had been long ago forsaken, and
the deviation grew daily farther, and more fatall to
the Kingdom. Which appeared in a direct contrariety
to all particulars of her Reigne. Titles of Honour
were made more honourable by her, in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
sparingly, and therefore probably upon great
desert, which afterwards were become of lesse esteem,
by being not onely too frequently conferred, but
put to open sale, and made too often the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of Mechannicks, or the reward of vitious
persons.</p>
                  <p>At the death of that Duke, the people were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with an unusuall joy, which they openly testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by such expressions, as indeed were not thought
fit nor decent by wise men, upon so tragicall and sad
an accident, which in a christian consideration might
move compassion, whatsoever the offences of the
man were.</p>
                  <p>To such people that distick of <hi>Seneca</hi> might give
answer:
<q>
                        <l>Res est sacra miser; noli mea tangere fata:</l>
                        <l>Sacrilegae Bustis abstinuere manus.</l>
                        <l>Sacred is woe; touch not my death with scorne:</l>
                        <l>Even sacrilegious hands have Tombs forborne.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it may be that God was offended at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of their joy, in that he quickly let them see,
the benefit was not so great to them as they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by it; but his judgements are too high for men
to search. True it is, that the people in generall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Kings Person, and very unwilling to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
the least opinion of ill in him, looked upon the
Duke, as the onely hinderance of the Kingdomes
happinesse; supposing, that though other Statesmen
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96346:14"/>
might afterwards arise, of as bad or worse intentions,
then the Duke; yet none would have so great a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
for execution of them; nor any other Genius be
ever found, to have so great a mastery over the Kings
Genius. But it is certaine, that men did much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rejoyce at the death of this Duke, because they
did before much feare what mischiefe might befall a
Kingdome, where that man, who knew himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
hated by the people, had all the keyes of the
Kingdome in his hand, as being Lord Admirall and
Warden of the Cinque-Ports; having the command
of all the Souldiers, and the onely power to reward
and raise them.</p>
                  <p>These joyes and hopes of men lasted not long, for
in the same yeer (being the fourth of King CHARLES)
and after the death of the Duke of BUCKINGHAM,
another Parliament was dissolved; and then the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of that high Court more broken then ever
before. Six Members of the House of Commons,
who had been forward in vindicating the Priviledges
of Parliament, were committed close Prisoners for
many moneths together, without the liberty of using
books, pen, inke and paper, while they were detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this condition; and not admitted Bayle accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Law: They were also vexed with informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in inferiour Courts; where they were sentenced,
and fined for matters done in Parliament; and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such Fines extorted from them. Some were
enforced to put in security of good behaviour, before
they could be released: The rest who refused to be
bound, were detained divers yeares after in custody,
of whom one Sir JOHN ELLIOT, a Gentleman
of able parts, that had been forwardest in expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>But to be silent in that, were great injustice and
impiety toward God, to relate his judgements upon
a Kingdome; and forget the sinnes of that Kingdom,
which were the cause of them. The Heathen Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
do well instruct us in that point of piety; who
never almost describe any Civill Warre, or publike
affliction, without relating at the beginning, how viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and corrupted their State was at that time grown,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96346:16"/>
how faulty both the Rulers and People were, and
how fit to be punished, either by themselves or others.
Nor doe any of the Roman Poets undertake to write
of that great and miserable Civill Warre, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed

how wicked the manners of <hi>Rome</hi> were growne,
how the chiefe Rulers were given to avarice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and the whole State drowned in luxury, lusts
and riot, as you may see upon that subject in two the
most elegant of them. And shall we Christians, who
adore the true God, and live under the Gospell-light,
not be sensible under so heavy a judgement of our

their illegall oppression of the people, during these
eight or nine yeers, in which Parliaments were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed

whole Kingdome for default of Knighthood, under
the shadow of an obsolete Law. Tonnage and
Poundage were received without the ordinary course
of Law; and though they were taken under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of guarding the Seas, yet that great Tax of
Ship-money was set on foot under the same colour;
by both which there was charged upon the people
some years neere 700000. li. though the Seas at that
time were not well guarded.</p>
                  <p>These things were accompanied with an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Torrests, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the
forcing of Coat and Conduct-Money, taking away
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96346:16"/>
the Armes of Trayned Bands in divers Counties,
disarming the people by engrossing of Gunpowder,
keeping it in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and setting so
high a rate upon it, that the poorer sort were not able
to buy it; nor could any have it without license;
whereby severall parts of the Kingdome were left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of their necessary defence.</p>
                  <p>No Courts of Judicature could give redresse to the
people for these illegall sufferings, whilest Judges
were displaced by the King, for not complying with
his will, and so awed, that they durst not do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
For to hold a rod over them, the clause, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu

                  <p>New illegall Oathes were enforced upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and new Judicatories erected without Law; and
when Commissions were granted for examining the
excesse of Fees, and great exactions discovered, the
Delinquents were compounded with, not onely for
the time past, but immunity to offend for the time to
come; which in stead of redressing, did confirme, and
encrease the grievance of the Subjects.</p>
                  <p>By this time, all thoughts of ever having a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againe, were quite banished; so many oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had been set on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oot, so many illegall actions done,
that the onely way to justifie the mischiefes already
done, was to do that one greater, To take away the
meanes which was ordained to redresse them, the
lawfull Government of <hi>England</hi> by Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Whilest the Kingdome was in this condition, the
serious and just men of <hi>England,</hi> who were no way
interessed in the emolument of these oppressions,
could not but entertaine sad thoughts and presages,
of what mischiefe must needs follow so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice;
that things carried so farre on in a wrong way,
must needs either inslave themselves and posterity for
ever, or require a vindication so sharpe and smarting,
as that the Nation would groane under it; and though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96346:17"/>
the times were jolly for the present, yet having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the judgement of God upon other secure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they could not chuse but feare the sequell.
Another sort of men, and especially Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
by whom the pressures of the Government
were not much felt, who enjoyed their owne plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fortunes, with little or insensible detriment, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no farther then their present safety and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the yet undisturbed peace of the Nation,
whilest other Kingdomes were embroyled in calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and <hi>Germany</hi> sadly wasted by a sharpe Warre,
did nothing but applaud the happinesse of <hi>England,</hi>
and called those ingratefull and factious spirits, who
complained of the breach of Lawes and Liberties;
That the Kingdome abounded with wealth, plenty,
and all kinde of elegancies, more then ever; That it
was for the honour of a people, that the Monarch
should live splendidly, and not be curbed at all in his
Prerogative, which would bring him into the greater
esteeme with other Princes, and more enable him to
prevaile in Treaties; That what they suffered by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,
was insensible, and not grievous, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with other States; That the Duke of TUSKA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY
sate heavier upon his people in that very kinde;
That the French King had made himselfe an absolute
Lord, and quite depressed the power of Parliaments,
which had beene there as great as in any Kingdome,
and yet that <hi>France</hi> flourished, and the Gentry lived
well; That the Austrian Princes, especially in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
layed heavy burdens upon their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Thus did many of the English Gentry, by way of
comparison, in ordinary discourse, pleade for their
owne servitude.</p>
                  <p>The Courtiers would begin to dispute against Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
in their ordinary discourse, That they were
cruell to those whom the King favoured, and too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to his Prerogative; That the late Parliament
stood upon too high termes with the King; and that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96346:17"/>
they hoped the King should never need any more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.
Some of the greatest Statesmen and Privy
Counsellors, would ordinarily laugh at the ancient
Language of <hi>England,</hi> when the word Liberty of the
Subject was named. But these Gentlemen, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so forward in taking up their owne yoake, were
but a small part of the Nation (though a number
considerable enough to make a Reformation hard)
compared with those Gentlemen who were sensible of
their birth-rights, and the true interest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
on which side the common people in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality,
and Country Freeholders stood, who would
rationally argue of their owne Rights, and those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
that were layed upon them.</p>
                  <p>But the sins of the English Nation were too great,
to let them hope for an easie or speedy redresse of such
grievances; and the manners of the people so much
corrupted, as by degrees they became of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which the Historian speakes of his Romans, <hi>ut
nec mala, nec remedia ferre possent,</hi> they could neither
suffer those pressures patiently, nor quietly endure the
cure of them. Prophannesse too much abounded eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where; and which is most strange, where there
was no Religion, yet there was Superstition: Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in diet. and excesse both in meat and drinke, was
crept into the Kingdome in an high degree, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the quantity, but in the wanton curiosity. And
in abuse of those good creatures which God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon this plentifull Land, they mixed the
vices of divers Nations, catching at every thing that
was new and forraigne.</p>

the great Statesmen plyed it the harder, to compleat
that worke they had begun, of setting up Prerogative
above all Lawes.</p>
                  <p>The Lord WENTWORTH (afterward created
Earle of STRAFFORD for his service in that kinde)
was then labouring to oppresse <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which he
was Deputy; and to begin that worke in a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Kingdome, which was intended to be afterward
wrought by degrees in <hi>England:</hi> And indeed he had
gone very farre and prosperously in those waies of
Tyranny, though very much to the end ammaging
and setting backe of that newly established King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of great parts, of a deepe reach,
subtle wit, of spirit and industry, to carry on his
businesse, and such a conscience as was fit for that
worke he was designed to. He understood the right
way, and the Liberty of his Country, as well as any
man; for which in former Parliaments, he stood up
stiffely, and seemed an excellent Patriot. For those
abilities he was soone taken off by the King, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in honour, to be imployed in a contrary way, for
inslaving of his Country, which his ambition easily
drew him to undertake. To this man, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that character which LUCAN bestowes upon
the Roman Curio, in some sort may suit.</p>

                  <p>The Court of <hi>England,</hi> during this long vacancy
of Parliaments, enjoyed it selfe in as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and splendour, as ever any Court did. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
Triumphs, and Princely Pastims, were for those
many yeares kept up, at so great a height, that any
stranger which travelled into <hi>England,</hi> would verily
believe, a Kingdom that looked so cheerefully in the
face, could not be sick in any part.</p>
                  <p>The Queene was fruitfull, and now growne of
such an age, as might seeme to give her priviledge of
a farther society with the King, then bed and board;
and make her a partner of his affaires and businesse;
which his extreme affection did more encourage her
to challenge: That conjugall love, as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vertue of a King, in midst of so many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the people did admire and honour.</p>
                  <p>But the Queenes power did by degrees give pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to Papists; and among them, the most witty,
and Jesuited, to converse, under the name of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and Courtship, not only with inferiour Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
but the King himselfe, and to sowe their seed
in what ground they thought best; and by degrees,
as in complement to the Queene, Nuntio's from the
Pope were received in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZANI,
CON, and ROSETTI; the King himselfe
maintaining in discourse, That he saw no reason why
he might not receive an Embassadour from the Pope,
being a Temporall Prince. But those Nuntio's were
not entertained with publike Ceremony; so that the
people in generall tooke no great notice of them;
and the Courtiers were confident of the Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by his due frequenting Prayers and Sermons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96346:19"/>
The Clergy, whose dependance was meerely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King, were wholly taken up in admiration
of his happy Government, which they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from himselfe, as often as the Pulpit gave them
accesse to his eare; and not onely there, but at all
meetings, they discoursed with joy upon that Theam;
affirming confidently, that no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> was
so great a friend to the Church, as King CHARLES;
That Religion flourished no where but in <hi>England;</hi>
and no reformed Church retained the face and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Church but that: Many of them used to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their opinion, That God had therefore so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
punished the Palatinate, because their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
had beene so great in taking away the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Bishopricks.</p>
                  <p>Queene ELIZABETH her selfe, who had refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion, was but coldly praised, and all her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
forgotten, when they remembred how she cut
short the Bishoprick of <hi>Ely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HENRY the eight was much condemned by them,
for seizing upon the Abbies, and taking so much out
of the severall Bishopricks<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as he did in the 37 yeer
of his Reigne. To maintaine therefore that splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of a Church, which so much pleased them, was
become their highest endeavour; especially after
they had gotten in the yeare 1633. an Archbishop
after their owne heart, Doctor LAUD; who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for divers yeares ruled the Clergy, in the seces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Archbishop ABBOT, a man of better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and discretion; which discretion or vertue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale,
would be an injury to that Archbishop; he
was a man who wholly followed the true interest of
<hi>England,</hi> and that of the Reformed Churches in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
so farre as that in his time the Clergy was not
much envied here in <hi>England,</hi> nor the Government of
Episcopacy much dis-favoured by Protestants beyond
the Seas. Not onely the pompe of Ceremonies were
daily increased, and innovations of great scandall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96346:19"/>
brought into the Church; but in point of Doctrine,
many faire approaches made towards <hi>Rome;</hi> as he that
pleaseth to search may finde in the Books of Bishop
LAUD, MOUNTAGUE, HELYN, POCKLINGTON,
and the rest; or in briefe collected by a Scottish Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
Master BAILY. And as their friendship to
<hi>Rome</hi> encreased, so did their scorne to the Reformed
Churches beyond the Seas; whom, instead of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that reliefe and succour to them, which God had
enabled this rich Island to do, they failed in their
greatest extremities, and in stead of harbours, became
rocks to split them.</p>
                  <p>Archbishop LAUD, who was now growne into
great favour with the King, made use of it especially
to ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vnce the pompe and temporall honour of the
Clergy, procuring the Lord Treasurers place for
Doctor JUCKSON, Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring,
as the generall report went, to fix the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
temporall preferments upon others of that Coat;
insomuch as the people merrily, when they saw that
Treasurer with the other Bishops, riding to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
called it the Church Triumphant: Doctors and
Parsons of Parishes were made every where Justices
of Peace, to the great grievance of the Country in
civill affaires, and depriving them of their spirituall
edification.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop, by the same meanes which he
used to preserve his Clergy from contempt, exposed
them to envy; and as the wisest could then prophecy,
to a more then probability of losing all: As we reade
of some men, who being fore-doomed by an Oracle
to a bad fortune, have runne into it by the same
meanes they used to prevent it. The like unhappy
course did the Clergy then take to depresse Puritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,
which was, to set up irreligion it selfe against it,
the worst weapon which they could have chosen to
beat it downe, which appeared especially in point of
keeping the Lords day; when not only books were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96346:20"/>
written to shake the morality of it, as that of <hi>Sunday
no Sabbath,</hi> but sports, and pastims of jollity and
lightnesse permitted to the Country people upon
that day, by publike Authority, and the Warrant
commanded to be read in Churches; which in stead
of producing the intended effect, may credibly be
thought to have been one motive to a stricter obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of that day, in that part of the Kingdome,
which before had been well devoted; And many men
who had before been loose and carelesse, began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that occasion to enter into a more serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it, and were ashamed to be invited by the
authority of Church-men, to that which themselves
at the best, could but have pardoned in themselves,
as a thing of infirmity.</p>
                  <p>The example of the Court, where Playes were
usually presented on Sundaies, did not so much draw
the Country to imitation, as reflect with disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
upon the Court it selfe, and sowre those other
Court pastims and jollities, which would have reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
better without that, in the eyes of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as things ever allowed to the delights of great
Princes.</p>
                  <p>The countenancing of loosenesse and irreligion,
was, no doubt, a good preparative to the introducing
of another Religion: And the power of godlinesse
being beaten downe, Popery might more easily by
degrees enter; men quickly leave that, of which
they never took fast hold: And though it were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
whether the Bishops and great Clergy of
<hi>England</hi> aimed at Popery, it is too apparent, such
was the designe of Romish Agents; and the English
Clergy, if they did not their owne worke, did theirs.
A stranger of that Religion, a Venetian Gentleman,
out of his owne observations in <hi>England,</hi> will tell
you how farre they were going in this kinde; his
words are:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96346:20"/>
THe Vniversities, Bishops, and Divines of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
do daily imbrace Catholike opinions, though
they professe it not with open mouth, for feare of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans:
For example, They hold that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church; That the Pope is superiour to
all Bishops; That to him it appertaines to call generall
Counsels; That it is lawfull to pray for soules departed;
That Altars ought to be erected; in summe they believe
all that is taught by the Church, but not by the Court
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was much against
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> though not against that Church,
in so high a kinde: For the Doctrine of the Roman
Church was no enemy to the pompe of Prelacy;
but the Doctrine of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would have
swallowed up all under the Popes Supremacy, and
have made all greatnesse dependant upon him: Which
the Archbishop conceived would derogate too much
from the King in Temporalls, (and therefore hardly
to be accepted by the Court) as it would from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in Spiritualls, and make his Metropoliticall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
subordinate, which he desired to hold absolute
and independent within the Realme of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certaine,<note place="margin">In the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Pope.</note> that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
(as an English Gentleman observes) would often
professe against those Tridentine Papists, whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he hated as Papists properly so called. For at the
Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> all matters concerning the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are of themselves but disputable,
were determined as points of faith, to be believed
upon paine of damnation: But matters of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
concerning the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were left dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,
and no Anathema annexed to them. But
that Venetian Gentleman, whom before we cited,
declares in what state, for matter of Religion, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at that time stood; and how divided, namely,
into Papists, Protestants, and Puritans; Papists are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96346:21"/>
well knowne. <hi>The Protestant party</hi> (saith he) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of the King, the Court Lords, and Gentlemen, with
all that are raised by favour to any honour: Besides
almost all the Prelates, and both the Vniversities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What the Protestants are, he farther declares. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They hate Puritans more then they hate Papists;
That they easily combine with Papists to extirpate Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans;
and are not so farre engaged to the Reformed
Religion, but that they can reduce themselves againe
to the old practise of their fore-fathers; That they
are very opinionative in excluding the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He speaks then concerning the Puritans, and saies:</hi>
That they consist of some Bishops, of almost all the
Gentry and Communalty; and therefore are far the most
potent party.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And further declares what they are.</hi> viz. They
are such as received the Discipline of the French, and
Netherlanders, and hold not the English Reformation
to be so perfect, as that which CALVIN instituted at
<hi>Geneva;</hi> That they hate Papists far more then they hate
Protestants, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of this strangers observation, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

great art used by two Kings in managing the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

stood; as you may reade at large in some late Writers

                  <p>Neither were the Peeres and Gentry of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                     </gap> onely out
of zeale to preservation of Religion in purity, (though
that, no doubt, were their greatest reason; that
Church having been ever much addicted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of <hi>Geneva:</hi> And those other Churches, as
it appeared by their great unwillingnesse to receive
those few Ceremonies of the English Church, at
their Synod of <hi>Perth,</hi>) but as loath also to suffer any
diminution of their Temporall Liberties, which could
not be avoided in admittance of Episcopall Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and was manifested in that Kingdome, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
examples of rigorous proceedings, which some
Bishops used against Gentlemen of quality, by way
of Fines and Imprisonments, and the like; which
particulars are too large to be here inserted in this
Narration.</p>
                  <p>In the yeare 1637. a Booke of Lyturgy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and sent out of <hi>England,</hi> (which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, because it was not before allowed by
their Church in a Nationall Synod, as was fit for a
businesse of so great import) with an expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from the King, that they should reverently
receive it, and publikely reade it in their Churches,
beginning on Easter day, and so forward; against
which time the Privy Councell of <hi>Scotland</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that every Parish should buy two at the least
of them.</p>
                  <p>That Service-Booke was the same with the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96346:22"/>
Common-Prayer Booke of <hi>England,</hi> excepting some
few alterations, of which some (as they observed)
were alterations for the better, but others for the
worse.</p>
                  <p>For the better, they esteemed, that so many
Chapters of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> were not appointed to
be read, as in the English Prayer Booke; and where
the English retained the old vulgar Latine Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
especially in the Psalmes, that Booke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the last Translation, commonly called that
of King JAMES.</p>
                  <p>Those alterations for the worse were divers, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the Scots, especially in the Lords Supper,
of which some were these: The expresse command
for situation of the Altar (so called) to the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
Wall; together with many postures of the
Minister, whilest he officiated, expressed in their
exceptions; but especially this, that in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
prayer, those words, which in the English
Common-Prayer Booke, are directly against Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
were quite left out in that Booke, and
instead of them, such other words, as in plaine sense
agreed with the Roman Masse Booke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for example:</hi> Heare us, O most mercifull Father,
and of thy Omnipotent goodnesse grant, so to blesse and
sanctifie by thy Word and Spirit, these creatures of bread
and wine, that they may be to us the body and blood of
thy beloved Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Many other alterations the Scots have observed
and expressed in their writings, and in one word
affirmed, that wheresoever that Booke varies from
the English Lyturgy, it approaches directly to
the Roman Missall; and offered to prove, that
all the materiall parts of the Masse Booke are semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
there.</p>
                  <p>It was thought by many, that if the Booke,
without any alteration at all, had been sent into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> though the Scots perhaps would not have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96346:23"/>
received it, they would not have taken it in so evill
part: And it might have been construed onely as
a brotherly invitation to the same service which
<hi>England</hi> used. But what the reasons were of those
alterations, I finde no where expressed, but onely
where the King in his Declaration concerning that
businesse, is pleased to say thus:</p>
                  <p>WE supposing that they might have taken some
offence, if we should have tendred them the
English Service-Booke <hi>totidem verbis;</hi> and that some
factious spirits would have endeavoured to have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construed
it, as a badge of dependance of that Church
upon this of <hi>England,</hi> which we had put upon them to
the prejudice of their Lawes and Liberties; We held it
fitter that a new Booke should be composed by their owne
Bishops, in substance not differing from this of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that so the Roman Party might not upbraid us
with any weighty or materiall differences in our Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes;
and yet in some few insensible alterations, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, that it might truly and justly be reputed
a Booke of that Churches owne composing, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Our Royall Authority, as King of <hi>SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were the Kings expressions, which, as it
seemed, were not satisfactory to the Scots in that
point.</p>
                  <p>For they were (as is before specified) not well
affected to their owne Bishops, whose power and
jurisdiction over them, was rather enforced then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to. Neither did they suppose that a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Church-Worship, had it been such as their
consciences could well have imbraced, had beene
any badge of their dependancy upon <hi>England,</hi> as
being a people not conquered, but united in an equall
freedome under the same King.</p>
                  <p>Besides, they could not relish it well, that the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96346:23"/>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other English Bishops,
who in many points of Ceremony and Worship,
which they accounted things tolerable, did make
as neere approaches to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they could; for no other reason (as they professe
in their writings) then that they laboured to bring
union into the Christian Church, if it were possible;
should now invite the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (whom
they accounted more puritanicall then themselves) to
union, by a quite contrary way; as in stead of framing
their Service neerer to the Scottish profession and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
to urge them to a Lyturgy more popish
then their owne: So that it seemed, for unity
they were content to meet <hi>Rome,</hi> rather then
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To returne to the Narration; The Service-Booke,
according to the Kings command, was offered to the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Councell there, and
published by Proclamation; a day for the reading of
it in all Churches appointed, which was the Easter
day following. 1637.</p>
                  <p>But then upon some considerations, and further
triall of mens minds (as the King declares) the first
reading of it was put off untill the 23. of <hi>Iuly</hi> next
ensuing, to the end that the Lords of the Session
(their Session being the same with the Terme in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
and others, who had any Law businesse, might
see the successe of it before the rising of the Session,
which alwaies endeth upon the first of <hi>August;</hi> and
that so upon their returne into their severall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they might report the receiving of this Booke
at <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> it being ordered, That on that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the Booke should be read only in the Church of
<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and some other neere adjacent; and
warning was printed, and published in those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Pulpits the Sunday before, that it was to be
read.</p>
                  <p>On the 23. day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> being Sunday, the Booke
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96346:24"/>
was read in Saint <hi>Gyles</hi> Church, commonly called, the
great Church at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where were present ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Privy Councell, both Archbishops, and
divers other Bishops, the Lords of the Session, the
Magistrates of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and a great auditory of
all sorts.</p>
                  <p>But the people, especially the meanest vulgar,
(for they first appeared against it) and some women
expressed so great a detestation of the Booke, not
onely in words and outcries, but actions; that the
City Magistrates were troubled much to get the
Service performed; and the Bishop who read it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of the Church, had probably beene slaine
by the multitude, if he had not been rescued by a
Nobleman.</p>
                  <p>Betweene the two Sermons the Councell and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
met about preventing future tumults; but
though the Booke were read more quietly in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone,
yet the tumult was farre greater after even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prayer, from the people who had stayed in the
streets; and the Bishop, in the Earle of ROXBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUGH
his Coach, hardly escaped from being sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to death.</p>
                  <p>The greatest men and Magistrates of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
to excuse themselves to the King (some of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
writing to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) layed
all the fault upon the Rabble; for as yet none of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had appeared, insomuch as that the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
and Magistrates of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the next morning
held some consultation about finding out, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the ringleaders of that uproare.</p>
                  <p>But not long after, upon the appearing of some
others of higher ranke, and Petitions from divers
Ministers, That the reading of that Booke might be
a while tespited, till his Majesty might be further
petitioned and informed; the Councell yeelded so
far, as that it should not be urged by the Bishops, till
his Majesties pleasure were further knowne.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96346:24"/>
Upon which, many Gentlemen and Ministers, who
had resorted to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with Petitions not long
before, returned in part satisfied to their owne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations;
and at many places met together, with
fastings, and Prayer, That God would be pleased
to direct the Kings heart in that way which they
conceived most conducible to the happinesse of the
Church and State of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the 18. of <hi>October</hi> following, harvest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now ended, a great conflux of all sorts was at
<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to heare what the King was pleased to
determine of the businesse; where they finde an Edict
against them, That upon paine of being guilty of
Rebellion, all should within few houres warning,
depart the City; and because the Citizens of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
had twice tumultuously opposed the Prayer
Booke, and assaulted the Bishop of <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> as
a punishment to that City, the Terme was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the Burgh of <hi>Linlithgow;</hi> and the next
Terme, after the ordinary vacants, to be held at the
Burgh of <hi>Dendie,</hi> there to remaine during his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The Petitioners (as they were then called) were
much moved at this Edict; and on the 19. of that
<hi>October,</hi> presented to the Privy Councell a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against the Bishops, whom they conceived
the Authors of all this businesse, and desired ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
against them, as well for other crimes, as for
introducing contrary to Law, that superstitious and
idolatrous Book.</p>
                  <p>To this complaint a great number of all ranks sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
and professed to the Councell, that they
could not depart out of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> till some way
were found out to settle the present grievances.</p>
                  <p>Whilest they stayed there, their number daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
from all the remotest Provinces, that the
Councell were enforced to give way, that till the
Kings pleasure were yet further knowne, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96346:25"/>
might chuse some out of their number of all ranks,
to represent the rest, and follow the cause in the
name of all the rest: Upon which they chose foure
of the higher Nobility, foure of the lower ranke
of Nobility, as representers of Provinces; as many
Burgesses of Townes; and foure Pastors, as represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Classes; having setled this, the rest quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed to their owne homes.</p>
                  <p>The King hearing of these things, sent a command
to the Councell of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> not to take upon
themselves any more the decision of this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
which he reserved in his owne power: And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
was made in <hi>December,</hi> 1637. concerning
the Kings intentions, that they were not to infringe
the Lawes or Liberties of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the Commissioners petitioned the
Councell to give way to them, to bring their Actions
against the Bishops, the Councell answered, That
the King had commanded them to receive no more
Petitions, against either the Bishops, or Booke of
Service.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Commissioners discontented, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a Protestat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on against the Kings Councell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
That what mischiefe soever might afterwards
ensue, was to be all imputed to the Kings Councell,
for denying Justice.</p>
                  <p>The Councell fearing what effects might follow,
desired the Bishops to absent themselves, and gave
leave to the Commissioners to appeare before them;
where the Lord of <hi>Lowden,</hi> in name of all the rest,
made an Oration, in which charging the Bishops
with other crimes, besides these stirres; he desired
them to be altogether removed from the Councell
Table, till they had answered and cleered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
To the like purpose spake one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
                  <p>The Councell seemed sorry, that it lay not in their
power (since the Kings Command was peremptory)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96346:25"/>
to give satisfaction to their desires; but intreated
their patience for so small a time, as till they might
againe receive notice of his Majesties pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The King further certified by them, sent for the
Earle of TRAQUARE into <hi>England,</hi> who was
soone dispatched againe into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
1638. caused the Kings Mandate in <hi>Sterlin</hi>
(where the Councell then sate) to be published.</p>
                  <p>The Proclamation declared that the Bishops were
wrongfully accused, as Authors of sending the Prayer
Booke; That his Majesty himselfe was Author of it,
and all was done by his Command; That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all tumultuous proceedings of his Subjects
to exhibite Petitions or complaints against the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Bishops, and booke of Lyturgy, and all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
to that purpose hitherto, as conspiring
against the publike peace; pronouncing pardon to
those which repented, and the punishment of high
Treason to such as persisted; promising to heare the
just complaints of his Subjects, so they offended not
in matter or forme.</p>
                  <p>After the Proclamation was made at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the
Earle of HUME, Lord LINDSEY, and others, in
name of all the Petitioners, made a Protestation
against it; which Protestation was afterward repeated
at <hi>Lithgow,</hi> and last at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The effect of that Protestation was (for we cannot
here insert it at large) That the Service Booke was full
of Superstition and Idolatry, and ought not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon them, without consent of a Nationall
Synod, which in such cases should judge; That it
was unjust to deny them liberty to accuse the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
being guilty of high crimes, of which till
they were cleered, they did reject the Bishops as
Judges or Governours of them. They protested
also against the High Commission Court, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their owne meetings, and superscriptions to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
as being to defend the glory of God, the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96346:26"/>
Kings Honour, and Liberties of the Realme. This
Protestation was read in the Market place at <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>

HAMILTON is sent thither from
the King. A Nationall Synod is granted

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom <hi>Sterlin</hi> the Commissioners resorted
to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> whither many from all
parts met to consult of the present bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse;
and concluded there to renew
solemnly among them that Covenant,
which was commonly called, The lesser confession of
the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or, The confession of the
Kings family; which was made and sealed under
King JAMES his hand, in the yeare 1580. afterwards
confirmed by all the Estates of the Kingdome, and
Decree of the Nationall Synod, 1581. Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
was againe subscribed by all sorts of persons
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 1590. by authority of Councell and
Nationall Synod; and a Covenant added to it, for
defence of true Religion, and the Kings Majesty;
which Covenant the aforesaid Lords, Citizens, and
Pastours, in the yeare 1638. did renew, and tooke
another according to the present occasion.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant it selfe (expressed at large in the
Records of that Kingdome) consisted of three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
parts: The first was a re-taking word for word,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96346:26"/>
of that old Covenant, 1580. confirmed by Royall
Authority, and two Nationall Synods, for defence
of the purity of Religion, and the Kings Person and
Rights, against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The second part
contained an enumeration of all the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in defence of the reformed
Religion, both in Doctrine and Discipline against
Popery.</p>
                  <p>The third was an application of that old Covenant
to the present state of things, where, as in that all
Popery, so in this all innovations in those Bookes of
Lyturgy unlawfully obtruded upon them are abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and a preservation of the Kings Person and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
as likewise a mutuall defence of each other
in this Covenant are sworne unto.</p>
                  <p>Against this Covenant the King, much displeased,
made these foure principall objections: First, By
what authority they entred into this Covenant? or
presumed to exact any Oath from their fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
Secondly, if they had power to command the
new taking of this Oath, yet what power had they
to interpret it to their present occasion? it being a
received Maxime, That no lesse authority can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
a Law, then that which made it, or the Judges
appointed by that Authority, to give sentence upon
it. Thirdly, What power they had to adde any thing
to it, and interpose a new Covenant of mutuall assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to each other, against any other power that
should oppose them, none excepted. And fourthly,
That all Leagues of Subjects among themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the privity and approbation of the King, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be seditious by two Parliaments in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
one of the tenth Parliament of JAMES the
sixth, Act the twelfth; and the other the fifteenth
Act of the ninth Parliament of Queene MARY.</p>
                  <p>What answer the Covenanters made to these obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and what arguments the King used to enforce
the contrary, are largely expressed in many writings;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96346:27"/>
being such indeed, as not onely then, but since, in
the sad calamities of <hi>England,</hi> have been discoursed
of in whole volumes; containing all that can be said
concerning the true Rights and Priviledges of Princes
and People.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant notwithstanding was generally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by all there present at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in <hi>February,</hi>
1638. and Copies of it sent abroad to those who were
absent, and so fast subscribed by them also, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of <hi>Aprill,</hi> he was scarce accounted one
of the Reformed Religion, that had not subscribed to
this Covenant. And the Church and State were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into two names, of Covenanters, and Non-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters;
the Non-Covenanters consisting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irst of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
whose number was thought small in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
scarce exceeding six hundred: Secondly, some States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Office and favour at that time: Thirdly, some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
who though they were of the Reformed Religion,
were greatly affected to the Ceremonies of <hi>England,</hi>
and Booke of Common-Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Many Bishops at that time came from thence to
the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and three Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom the King had sent for, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
about the affaires of that Kingdome, where, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many debates what course to take, whether of
reducing the Covenanters by Armes, or using more
gentle meanes: The King at last sent the Marquesse
HAMILTON, together with those three Lords, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marquesse arrived at <hi>Dulketh,</hi> and within few
daies entred <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in <hi>Iune,</hi> being met and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
into the City by a great multitude of all
ranks, in which number were seven hundred Pastors
of Churches.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse, by the Kings Command, dealt
with the Covenanters, to renounce their Covenant,
or else told them, there was no hope to obtaine a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Synod, which they so much desired, for setling
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96346:27"/>
of the Church, which they affirmed could not be
done, without manifest perjury and profanation of
Gods Name.</p>
                  <p>But when nothing was agreed upon, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
the Marquesse at his returne into <hi>England,</hi>
to present their humble desire to the King: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his departure, in <hi>Iuly</hi> he published the Kings
Proclamation, wherein his Majesty protests to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Protestant Religion; and that he would no
more presse upon them the Booke of Canons, or
Service Booke, but by lawfull Mediums; That he
would rectifie the High Commission, and was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take a speedy opportunity of calling both
a Parliament and Synod.</p>
                  <p>When the Proclamation was ended, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
read their Protestation; of which the heads
were: That they never questioned his Majesties sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in the Protestant Religion; That these grants
of his were not large enough to cure the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers;
for he doth not utterly abolish that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Booke,
nor the High Commission, being both
obtruded against all Law upon them; That their
meetings are not to be condemned in opprobrious
words, being lawfull, and such as they would not
forsake, untill the purity of Religion, and peace,
might be fully setled by a free and Nationall Synod.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse went into <hi>England,</hi> to returne at
a prefixed day, the twelfth of <hi>August;</hi> In the meane
time the Scots keepe a solemne Fast; and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,
not hoping from the King so quick a call of
a Nationall Synod, as the present malady required,
published a writing, wherein they endeavour to
prove, That the Church in such a condition may
provide for it selfe; <hi>That the power of calling a Synod,
in case the Prince be an enemy to the truth, or negligent
in promoting the Churches good, is in the Church it selfe.</hi>
And that the State of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at that
time was necessitated to such a course; which they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96346:28"/>
endeavour to prove by reciting all their particular
grievances, and by answering all arguments of the
contrary side, for the Right of Princes, howsoever
affected to Religion; as appeares at large in their
Tractate concerning the necessity of Synods.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse returned into <hi>Scotland</hi> before the
appointed day, and brought Articles from the King,
to which the Covenanters, if they would have
either Parliament or Synod, were required to
consent.</p>
                  <p>But they utterly rejected those Articles, as too
invalid for their purpose of setling things; so that
the Marquesse fearing least the Covenanters, weary
of delayes, would call a Synod without staying the
Kings consent, earnestly perswaded them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
it onely till his next returne from Court, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would presently go to perswade the King.
Which request of his, with much a do was granted
by them, and the day for his returne appointed the
22 of <hi>September;</hi> by which time, unlesse the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
returned, it was free for the Covenanters to
provide for their owne affaires.</p>
                  <p>But the Marquesse with singular diligence preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his day, and published the Kings Proclamation,
of which the chiefe heads were: First, The King did
abrogate all Decrees of Councell for the Booke of
Canons and Common-Prayer, and abrogate the High
Commission. Secondly, That none should be pressed
to the five Articles of <hi>Perth.</hi> Thirdly, That Bishops
should be subject to the censure of a Synod. Fourthly,
That no Oath should be given at Ordination of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
but by Law of Parliament. Fifthly, that
the lesser Confession of 1580. should be subscribed
to by all the Kingdome. Sixtly, That the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Nationall Synod to begin at <hi>Glasco</hi> the 21 of
<hi>November,</hi> 1638. and a Parliament at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the
15. of <hi>May,</hi> 1639. Lastly, for peace sake he would
forget all their offences past.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:96346:28"/>The Covenanters at the first hearing of this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Message, were much joyed; but looking neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the words, they found (as they affirme)
<hi>That their precedent actions were tacitly condemned,
and the just freedome of a Nationall Synod taken
away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore loath to be deceived, they frame a
Protestation, not (as they alledged) mis-doubting
the candor of the King, but not trusting those in
favour with him; by whose destructive Councell
they supposed it was, that the King had not shewed
this clemency at first.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe heads of their Protestation were these:
First, after humble thanks to God and the King,
they conceived this grant no sufficient remedy for
their sores.</p>
                  <p>For His Majesty calls that a panick feare in them,
which was upon no imaginary, but just grounds, as
a reall mutation both of Religion and Lawes, by
obtrusion of those Bookes directly popish.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas the King in his former Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
so highly extolled those Bookes, as most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and fit for the Church; they could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with a bare remission of the exercise of them,
unlesse he would utterly abrogate and condemne
them; or else itching Innovators would not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hereafter to raise new troubles to the Church
about them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the just liberty of Nationall Synods is
diminished, and Episcopacy set up, they being
allowed as Bishops, though not deputed by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to give their voices in a Synod.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the subscribing againe of that old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
could not be admitted for many reasons
there at large expressed; of which some are, That it
would frustrate their late Covenant, and make it
narrower then before, and not able to suit to the
redresse of present grievances, and be a needlesse
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96346:29"/>
multiplying of Oathes, and taking the Name of
God in vaine; with many other objections, which
cannot be fully here inserted.</p>
                  <p>That Covenant notwithstanding was solemnly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by the Marquesse of HAMIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,
the Kings Commissioner, and all the Privy
Councell.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse then gave Order for the Synod,
fearing least the Covenanters, if he delayed to call
it, would do it themselves, and on the 16. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
came to <hi>Glasco</hi> in great state.</p>
                  <p>Where after many meetings for preparation to the
businesse, on the 21 of the same Moneth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Kings Edict, the Nationall Synod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:
But within seven daies that Synod was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by the Marquesse HAMILTON, in the
Kings Name, and they commanded to sit no
more.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse alleadging for reason of it, that
they had broken the Lawes of a free Synod in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proceedings, not onely in those few daies of
their sitting, but before it began in their manner of
Elections, with other such like matters.</p>
                  <p>But they protested against that dissolution, and
continued the Synod when the Marquesse was gone.
What were the Acts of that Synod, what proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
it had, and what impediments it met withall,

published by the King, the other by the Synod;
how the Bishops protested against the Synod; how
the Synod answered their Protestation; how the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
wrote to the King; how they proceeded against
the Bishops, deposing them all from their Dignities;

how the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the Booke

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96346:29"/>
were all condemned, the High Commission taken
away, and whatsoever else had crept into the Church
since the yeare 1580. when that Nationall Covenant
was first established.</p>
                  <p>The Scots Covenanters, when themselves broke
up the Synod, wrote a Letter of thanks to the
King, and immediately after published a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
dated the fourth of <hi>February,</hi> 1638. from
<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and directed <hi>To all the sincere and good
Christians in</hi> England, <hi>to vindicate their actions and
intentions, from those aspersions which enemies might
throw upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Declaration was welcome to the people of
<hi>England</hi> in generall, and especially to those who
stood best affected to Religion, and the Lawes and
Liberties of their Country: But by the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
it was suppressed, as all other papers that
might be sent from the Scots; and a Proclamation
soone after, bearing date the 27. of <hi>February,</hi>
1638. was published by the King, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be read in all Churches of <hi>England;</hi> the
Title of it was, <hi>A Proclamation and Declaration to

and execrations against the Scottish Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters;
but the truth is, it wrought little upon
the hearts of the English People; who conceived
a good opinion of the Scots; and were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in it, because the King had carried the
whole businesse so closely from the English Nation,
as not onely not to declare unto them in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(which former Princes used to call upon lesse
occasions) but not revealing the proceedings of it
to the Body of his Privy Councell, acquainting

Souldiers that imbraced it as their profession, a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Army was made up, <hi>Yorke</hi> was appointed for
the Rendezvouze, and the Earle of ARUNDELL
Commander in chiefe.</p>
                  <p>The King, as it was well knowne, had beene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
by many, and especially by the prosecuted
Bishops, who were fled out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the
Scottish Covenanters were in no sort able to resist
him; That scarce any English Army at all would
be needfull to fight, but onely to appeare, and His
Majesty would finde a party great enough in <hi>Scotland</hi>
to do the worke.</p>
                  <p>And indeed much might have been done in that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96346:31"/>
kinde, if the Lords of the Covenant had not used
a most dexterous and timely prevention, which
is as necesssry in a defensive, as an offensive
Warre.</p>
                  <p>For besides the feared incursion of the English
upon their Borders, and what invasion the Deputy
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on the Westerne Coast might make, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Earle of ANTRIM, and his Forces
from the Hebrides; the Marquesse HUNTLEY in
the North, and Marquesse DUGLAS towards the
Southerne parts, with the Earle of HETH, were
to be feared, and the Towne of <hi>Aberden</hi> to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
before it could fortifie to receive the Kings
Fleet.</p>
                  <p>All which with timely care was undertaken, and
provided against by severall Lords, as ARGILE for
the West, MONTROSSE for the North, Colonell
MONROE for the South.</p>
                  <p>The most considerable Forts in that Kingdome
were taken in at the beginning, without any blood
or resistance, and furnished by them with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
as <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Dun-Britain,</hi> and the
Haven of <hi>Leeth,</hi> to secure <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> suddenly
fortified. All Neuters, or suspected persons, they disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
without tumult; The Castle of <hi>Dalketh</hi> they sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and tooke, with all the warlike provision which
had been brought into it by Marquesse HAMILTON
the yeare before. In that Castle they found the Kings
Crowne, Scepter, and Sword, which in great
state and solemnity were carried from thence by
the greatest Noblemen, and layed up in <hi>Edenburgh</hi>
Castle.</p>
                  <p>The Covenanting Lords at the same time publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
a long Remonstrance, in answer to the Kings
Proclamation against them, the 27. of <hi>February,</hi> and
to satisfie the people of <hi>England</hi> concerning their
proceedings and intents.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse HAMILTON arrived at <hi>Forth</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96346:32"/>
with a Fleet in <hi>May,</hi> and sent Letters to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to obey the Kings Commands,
and especially to publish in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> that Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which had been by the King proclaimed at
<hi>Yorke,</hi> upon the 25<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of <hi>Aprill;</hi> wherein among other
things, the Rents and Debts due to Covenanters
from Tenants and others, are forbidden to be paid
to them.</p>
                  <p>The Governour desired the Marquesse to expect
an answer till the Parliament sate, which was to
begin within few daies, who returned answer to
the Marquesse, That they could not in that obey
his Command, for many reasons, expressed at large
in their Commentaries.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time the King commanded the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to dissolve, which immediately obeyed;
And being threatned with Warre on every side, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Sir ALEXANDER LESLEY, an experienced
Commander in the German Warres, to be their
great Generall; to whom all the greatest Earles and
Lords of the Covenant, swore obedience in all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Commands; taking an Oath of him for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his duty; and immediately betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
every man to his charge throughout all parts
of the Kingdome, according as they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by LESLEY.</p>
                  <p>Whilest the Armies on both sides advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and no decision of this difference seemed with
reason to be hoped for, but such as the stroke of
Warre must allow; The Scottish Covenanters did
neverthelesse continue their first course of petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King; and by many addresses to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
their loyalty to his Crowne and Person; and
did not omit by Letters and Messages, to solicite
as Advocates those English Noblemen, whom they
esteemed best and truest Patriots, as the Earles of
ESSEX, PEMBROOKE, and HOLLAND, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that this Warre was not approved of by any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96346:32"/>
that were firme to the Cause of Religion, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of both Kingdomes, (for so themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it.)</p>
                  <p>The Earle of DUMFERLING having free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
about that time to the English Army, assured
his fellow-Covenanters, that those Noble fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Earles, and almost all the English Nobility, were
much averse from this Warre, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avourers of their
suit to the King.</p>
                  <p>Which did so much encourage the Covenanters
to continue their humble Petitions to the King,
(and God being pleased to give his blessing) that
after some few Messages to and fro, the King was
pleased to give leave, that six of them should come
and personally treat at the Earle of ARUNDELL
his Tent, upon the tenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> with some of
the English Nobility; at which Discourses some few
daies after, the King himselfe vouchsafed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
At last after many humble expressions of the
Covenanters, and some expostulations of the King
with them, by the happy mediation of wise and
noble Councellors, a Pacification was solemnly made,
upon such Articles as gave full satisfaction to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
save onely that the Scottish Covenanters were
not pleased with some expressions which the King
had used in the Preface to the Pacificatory Edict,
as calling their late Synod, <hi>Pseudo Synodus Glasquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;</hi>
and aspersing their proceedings in Armes, with
such Epithites, as tumultuous, illegall, and rebellious.</p>
                  <p>Which notwithstanding, at the humble suit of
them, the King was pleased to moderate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge
some of those harsh phrases; as likewise to
explaine more cleerely other ambiguous sentences,
to take away all suspitions from peoples hearts;
the Copies of which were delivered to divers of
the English Nobility, who had taken faithfull paines
in procuring that happy peace; that if any doubts
should afterwards happen, their judgements might
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96346:33"/>
be taken concerning the intention of the writing.</p>
                  <p>The King also declared, for satisfaction of the
Scots, That though his expressions at some places
might seeme harsh, yet his meaning to them was
never the worse; That care must be taken of his
owne reputation in forraigne parts; and that liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
about words was vaine, when the matter
was cleere, and their suit wholly granted.</p>
                  <p>The King granted them a free Nationall Synod,
to be holden upon the sixth of <hi>August</hi> following,
and a Parliament to begin upon the 20. day of the
same Moneth, to confirme and ratifie what the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
should decree; which the Scots thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
esteeming that to be the onely proper and
efficatious way to settle a firme peace both in Church
and State.</p>
                  <p>They were also joyfull, that the King had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be there himselfe in person; but that hope
afterwards failed them, for the King excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
affirming that urgent and weighty affaires at
<hi>London,</hi> as he was certified by Letters from his Queen
and Councell, required his presence there; but that
he would send a Deputy thither, with full power
to make good whatsoever he had promised, which
was the Earle of TRAQUARE.</p>
                  <p>This Pacification, to the great joy of good men,
was solemnly concluded on the 18. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1639.
and both Armies within eight and forty houres to
be disbanded, which was accordingly done, and
both the English and Scots returned home, praising
God; who without any effusion of blood had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
this difference, and prevented a Warre so
wickedly designed.</p>
                  <p>But that joy lasted not long; for the Earle of
TRAQUARE, the Kings Commissioner could not
agree with the Scottish Parliament; the Scots com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
that nothing was seriously performed,
which the King had promised at the Pacification, as
shall more appeare afterward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:96346:33"/>But however it were, within a little time after
that the King had been at <hi>London,</hi> that Paper which
the Scots avowed to containe the true Conditions
of that Pacification, was by the King disavowed,
and commanded by Proclamation to be burned by
the hands of the hangman; though the Contents of
that Paper were not named at all in the Proclamation,
nor the people of <hi>England</hi> acquainted with any of
them. Which put the English in great feare that
the former Councells of divisions yet prevailed in
the Court, especially discerning a shew of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Warre againe.</p>
                  <p>But leaving the Scots at their Parliament a while.
In the meane time the Lord WENTWORTH, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the King with great expressions of grace and
favour, dignified with a higher Title, and created
Earle of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great was the expectation of all the English, what
might be the effect of his coming over; great was
the opinion which men in generall had conceived of
his ability and parts; looking at him as the onely
hinge, upon which the State was now likely to turne.
But very different and various were the conjectures
of Gentlemen at that time, in their ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
(for I will relate the truth,) what use
this great Statesman would make of his ability and
favour.</p>
                  <p>Some (as they wished) did seeme to hope, when
they considered his first right Principles, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he had acted since his greatnesse, was but to
ingratiate himselfe perfectly with the King; that so
at last by his wisdome and favour he might happily
prevaile, both upon the Kings judgement and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and carry him from those evill Councells
which he had long beene nurtured in, to such
waies as should render him most honourable and
happy; That the Earle was so wise as to understand
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96346:34"/>
what most became a wise man, and would make great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
beloved and permanent.</p>
                  <p>But others durst not hope so much from him, when
they considered his Government in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the
ambition of the man: They feared that neither his
vertue was great enough to venture his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
by opposing any evill Councells about the
King, nor his favour great enough to prevaile in
over-ruling; That he was sent for onely to compleat
that bad worke, which others of lesse braine then he
had begun.</p>
                  <p>Which he would sooner venture to do, then to
make himselfe the Author of a new and good one;
seeing it hath been observed, that few Statesmen have
ever opposed Princes, but rather seconded and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in their bad inclinations.</p>
                  <p>From whence it comes, that few Statesmen have
converted Princes from ill courses, but been them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
perverted from that goodnesse which seemed
to be before in them. Historians therefore neither
imputed the goodnesse of AUGUSTUS to MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUS
AGRIPPA, or STATILIUS TAURUS,
nor TIBERIUS faults to SEJANUS. According
to that sentence of MACHIAVELL, <hi>Recta consilia
à quocunque profiscuntur, à Principis prudentia; non
autem Principis prudentia à rectis consiliis derivatur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that time the King declared to his Councell
an intention that he had of calling a Parliament in
<hi>England,</hi> to begin in <hi>Aprill</hi> following. The people
seemed to wonder at so great a novelty as the name
of a Parliament, but feared some further designe,
because it was so long deferred, whilest in the meane
time preparations for a Warre against <hi>Scotland,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to go forward, and the Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> was
first to go over, and summon a Parliament in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which he accordingly did, crossing the Seas
about the end of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What worke he was to do there, the people
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96346:34"/>
knew not, but wished that the English Parliament
might have begun, before the Scottish businesse had
proceeded too farre, which they supposed might
happily prevent so sad a Warre, and save those char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which would before <hi>Aprill</hi> grow upon such war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
preparations, and require a supply from that
Parliament; that it were better to prevent such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
then purposely to stay till that necessity
were made.</p>
                  <p>On the 18. day of that <hi>December,</hi> the Earle of
TRAQUARE, by a Command from the King, under
his Privy Seale, broke up the Parliament in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and prorogued it till the second day of <hi>Iune</hi>
in the following yeare.</p>
                  <p>The Scots complained that it was a new example
and breach of their Liberties, not heard of before
in twenty ages; That a Parliament fully assembled,
and compleat in all her Members, whilest businesse
of moment was depending, should be dissolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent of the House it selfe; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Kings in other Kingdomes might do, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
not them to enquire, but it was absolutely
against their Lawes, according to which, the King
had lately promised them he would onely proceed.</p>
                  <p>TRAQUARE, immediately upon the dissolution
of the Scottish Parliament, hastened to the Court
of <hi>England</hi> to certifie the King of all proceedings.</p>
                  <p>And the Parliament Deputies of <hi>Scotland</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
away with speciall instructions to the King
also foure Commissioners, the Earles of DUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERLING
and LOWDEN, DUGLASSE, and
BARCLAY.</p>
                  <p>Their instructions were, That before the King
himselfe, not the Councell of <hi>England</hi> (because of
the independency of that Kingdome) they should
complaine of those injuries, and intreat redresse,
which had been offered to them since the Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
The dissolving of their Parliament; The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risonning
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96346:35"/>
of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle with three times as
many as would serve for defence; The garrison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Dun-Britain</hi> Castle with English Souldiers;
That the Scots trading in <hi>England,</hi> but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were enforced to new Oathes, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their late Covenant, and contrary to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Pacification.</p>
                  <p>They sent withall an information to the English
Nation in generall, touching all their proceedings
and intentions, and expressing at large (as may be
there read) what particular injuries they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
since the Pacification, and how much contrary
to that Agreement.</p>
                  <p>The foure Scottish forenamed Commissioners, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some audiences before the King, and divers of
his English Councell, were in <hi>March</hi> committed to
Prison, the King intending shortly to charge them,
the Parliament being neere, LOWDEN to the Tower,
and the other three to other custody.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Earle of STRAFFORD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he had held a short
Parliament, and gotten foure Subsidies from them,
came to the King againe; and the English Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being presently to begin, an accusation was
drawne against LOWDEN, then Prisoner in the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
concerning a Letter written from the Scottish
Covenanters to the French King; to which Epistle
the said Earle had set his hand.</p>
                  <p>The matter of accusation was, That the Scots,
weary of obedience to their owne King, had recourse
to a forraigne Prince for assistance, and by that
meanes might draw the Armies of <hi>France</hi> into this
Island.</p>
                  <p>His answer was, The Letter was written in <hi>May,</hi>
1639. when <hi>Scotland</hi> was threatned with a grievous
invasion, and they had notice, that by Ambassadors
and Agents their Cause was represented odious to
all forraigne Princes and States; That their intention
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96346:35"/>
was to cleare themselves from those aspersions abroad,
and especially to the King of <hi>France,</hi> whose Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
had been ancient friends to the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and for feare least that King might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be wrought upon to be their Enemy otherwise.</p>
                  <p>That it was not to draw Warlike assistance from
the King of <hi>France</hi> (which neverthelesse they thought
lawfull in an extreame necessity and persecution)
but only his mediation in their behalfe to their owne
King; and that the Letter well examined would
beare no other sence; Though there were mention
of aid, yet their secret instructions to their Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had specified what kinde of aid it was which
they desired; But howsoever, they alledged that
the draught of that Letter did not then please them,
nor was it at all consented to, nor intended to be
sent; besides that, the Superscription <hi>To the King,</hi>
at which so great exception was taken, as if they
acknowledged the French King for their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
was not written at all by them, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by some Enemy, after that it was gotten out
of their hand. Besides all this, the thing was
done afore the Pacification, and Act of Oblivion,
and ought not now to be remembred against them.
Whether their answer were sufficient or not, true
it is, that nothing at all was made of that businesse,
though the King himselfe at the beginning of the
English Parliament, mentioned it against the Scots,
as a proofe of their disloyalty, and justification of
those Warlike preparations which he had made
against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Scots in the meane time had written to the
English Parliament a large Justification of all their
proceedings, intreating them by the way of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
advice,</hi> To be wary in vindicating their owne
Lawes and Liberties, to frustrate the designe of those
evill Counsellors, who had procured this Parliament
for no other end, then to arme the King with warlike
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96346:36"/>
supplies against his Scottish Subjects, and by that
Warre to inslave, if not ruine both the Nations; That
after so many violations and dissolutions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>England,</hi> this was not called to redresse
grievances, but to be so over-reached (if they were
not carefull and couragious) that no possibility should
be left for the future of redressing any; That some
dangerous practise might be well suspected, when at
the same time a Parliament was denyed to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
though promised by the word of a King, granted to
<hi>England</hi> when not expected; and obtruded upon <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
when not desired.</p>
                  <p>Many particulars of that nature were expressed in
the Scottish Remonstrance.</p>

and a necessity in him of

purpose that the King had briefly expressed himself,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96346:36"/>
the Lord Keeper FINCH, in a long and eloquent
Oration dilated the businesse.</p>
                  <p>Twelve Subsidies were demanded by the King, in
lieu of which, the release of Ship-Money was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
to which demand answer was made by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Members of the House in severall Speeches,
That redresse of grievances was the chiefe end of
assembling Parliaments, and ought to precede gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Subsidies. Which not onely reason, but the
constant practise of all ages had confirmed; That
there was never more need of redressing grievances
than at this time; without which the people would
repine to part with twelve Subsidies; That the sum
was extraordinary great, especially to be given for
releasing of that which they never conceived the
King had any Title to, but had taken by power
against the Lawes.</p>
                  <p>The King promised that grievances should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
redressed, but required the Money first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was a necessity of hastening the Warre;
without which the opportunity of Summer would
be lost. To which it was answered by many, That
the people had no reason to pay for that which was
never caused nor desired by them, nor could any
way prove to their good, but quite contrary to the
danger and detriment of the whole Kingdome; That
the same people would undoubtedly pay with more
willingnesse so many Subsidies to prevent that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Warre, to settle the State, and punish the
principall contrivers or assistors of that disturbance.</p>

                  <p>Master PYM also, a grave and religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in a long Speech of almost two houres, recited
a Catalogue of all the grievances which at that time
lay heavy upon the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Of which many abbreviated Copies, as extracting
the heads onely, were with great greedinesse taken
by Gentlemen and others throughout the Kingdom;
for it was not then in fashion to print Speeches of
Parliament,</p>
                  <p>Divers of the Members besides (too many to be
here named) did fully descant upon such particular
grievances, as they had informed themselves of, in
their severall Countries and Burroughs.</p>
                  <p>But it is most true, though it have been said,
<hi>Quicquid multis peccatur, inultum est,</hi> That there was
never any Parliament which was more unanimous in
apprehension of grievances, and yet more moderate
in the Language and manner of declaring against
them. And so great seemed to be their care of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this Parliament, being the first that in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares had been granted to <hi>England;</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96346:37"/>
they perceived the Money they were
to give to the King, must be imployed against their
owne interest, yet they tooke the Subsidies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
consideration; by which they might perchance
gaine the Kings affection to Parliaments; and were
content to hope, that whilest the Houses sate, the
bad Councell about the King might be awed into
moderation; and the Warre against <hi>Scotland,</hi> by
wise and honest interpositions, might be againe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
as it had been the Summer before.</p>
                  <p>But whilest the businesse was in debate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were not quick enough in granting, or
the Conditions were too much feared by the King,
I will not judge, but onely relate what was done.</p>
                  <p>The King in Person came into the House upon
the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> and dissolved the Parliament, but
used faire language to them, protesting that he
would governe as much according to Law, as if a
Parliament were constantly sitting: Yet the next
day after the dissolution of it, some Members were
imprisoned, the Lord BROOKE was searched for
Papers, his Study, Cabinets, and Pockets; Master
BELLOSIS, and Sir JOHN HOTHAM, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Prison for Speeches, but soone discharged;
Master CREW, who was a Member of the House of
Commons, and was in the Chaire for Petitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Ministers, was committed to the Tower, for
not discovering some Petitions delivered to him in
Parliament, and continued a Prisoner almost to the
beginning of the next Parliament.</p>
                  <p>After the dissolution of this Parliament, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Divines continued their sitting, and by
authority from the King, made divers Canons, and an
Oath to be imposed upon not onely Clergymen, but
many of the Laity.</p>
                  <p>That continuance of the Convocation, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themselves, perchance ignorant of the Law, might
thinke of it, was judged very illegall, as it appeared
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96346:38"/>
by the Votes of the succeeding Parliament, and the
opinion of Lawyers delivered there.</p>
                  <p>When Master BAGSHAW, the <hi>November</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
inveighing against those Canons which were
made whilest they sate, proved the Bishops and
Clergy in a premumire: The Lord DIGBY at the
same time affirming, that their Convocation was a
new Synod, patched out of an old Conventicle. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Lawyers of note at severall times argued
the case concerning those Canons.</p>
                  <p>Insomuch that the House of Commons in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
following, <hi>nullo contradicente,</hi> resolved that those
Canons were against the fundamentall Lawes of the
Kingdome, the Property and Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
And in the following <hi>Aprill,</hi> 1641. falling
againe upon the late Convocation, for their Canons
and other misdemeanours, they voted the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
House in 200000 pounds fine to the King; The
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to pay 20000 pounds,
the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> 10000 pounds, the Bishop
of <hi>Chester</hi> 3000 pounds; and the rest of the Clergy
according to their abilities proportionably, to make
up the summe.</p>
                  <p>Certaine it is, it was not in any substantiall way
advantagious to the King; but onely to give them
time and opportunity to taxe the Clergy in Money
for supplying his Majesty in the Warre then on foot
against the Scots.</p>
                  <p>The King must needs be driven to a great exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
at that time, having so expensive a Warre
in hand, and wanting the assistance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The courses that were then taken by the King,
to supply that defect, were partly the contribution of
the Clergy, to whom that Warre was lesse displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
then to the Laity.</p>
                  <p>Collections were made among the Papists; Writs
of Ship-money were issued out againe, in a greater
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96346:38"/>
proportion then before; great Loanes were attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be drawne from the City of <hi>London,</hi> to which
purpose the names of the richest Citizens were by
command returned to the Councell Boord. But these
waies being not sufficient, some other were made
use of, which were of a nature more unusuall, as
the seizing of <hi>Bolloine</hi> in the Tower; the Lord COT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINGTON
also for the Kings use tooke up a great
Commodity of Pepper at the Exchange, to be sold
againe at an under rate.</p>
                  <p>A consultation was also had of coyning 400000.<hi>l.</hi>
of base Money, upon allegation that Queen ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH
had done the like for her Irish Warres, but
the King waved that, upon reasons which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
gave of the inconveniencies of it.</p>
                  <p>The Scots hearing of the breach of this English
Parliament, thought it high time to provide for their
owne safety; and being restrained in their Trade,
and impoverished by losse of Ships seized in divers
parts, resolve to enter <hi>England</hi> with a sword in one
hand, and a Petition in the other; signifying in the
meane time to the people of <hi>England</hi> in two large
Remonstrances, what their intentions were to that
Nation, and the reasons of their entrance; which
who so pleases, may reade at large in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Booke.</p>
                  <p>When the King had notice of the Scots intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
a Fleet was forthwith sent to annoy the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Coasts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a Land Army to meet
at <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the Earle of STRAFFORD, as
President of the North, commanded in Chief, though
the Earle of NORTHUMBERLAND at the time of
raising the Army was named <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> but for
want of health could not be present.</p>
                  <p>A great Magazine of Ammunition had been sent
to <hi>Hull, Newcastle,</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Castle of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
being kept by RIVEN, a firme man to the
Kings side.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:96346:39"/>But in the Expedition of the Kings Army towards
the North, it was a marvellous thing to observe in
divers places the aversenesse of the Common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from this Warre.</p>
                  <p>Though Commanders and Gentlemen of great
quality, in pure obedience to the King, seemed not
at all to dispute the cause or consequence of this
Warre; the Common Souldiers would not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
questioning in a mutinous manner, Whether
their Captaines were Papists or not, and in many
places were not appeased till they saw them receive
the Sacrament; laying violent hands on divers of
their Commanders, and killing some, uttering in
bold speeches their distaste of the Cause, to the aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
of many, that common people should be
sensible of publike Interest and Religion, when
Lords and Gentlemen seemed not to be.</p>
                  <p>By this backwardnesse of the English Common
Souldiers, it came to passe that the Warre proved not
so sharpe and fatall to both Nations, as it might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have done.</p>
                  <p>Some blood was shed, but very little, first at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
a Towne five miles distant from <hi>Newcastle,</hi>
where part of the English Army encamped to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the passage of the Scots, as they marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Newcastle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But many of the English Souldiers forsooke their
Commanders and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led, sooner then the use of that
Nation is to do in Warre: But the English Horse
made good a fight, and with great courage and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
charged upon the Scots, but all in vaine, their
number being too small.</p>
                  <p>In this Skirmish which happened upon the 28.
of <hi>August,</hi> the number of men slaine on both sides
is not related, either by the English or Scottish
Relation; but certaine it is, that it was not
great.</p>
                  <p>Three valiant and active Commanders of the English
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96346:39"/>
Army were taken Prisoners, Colonell WILMOT
Sir JOHN DIGBY, and ONEALE, the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being Papists, and both Captaines of Horse.</p>
                  <p>This fight opened that rich Towne of <hi>Newcastle</hi>
to the Scots, and within few daies after, they put a
Garrison into <hi>Durham,</hi> commanded by the Earle of
<hi>Dumferling,</hi> and taking that Fort of <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon
<hi>Tine,</hi> intercepted some Ships which were newly
arrived there with Provision of Corne for the Kings
Army.</p>
                  <p>Some blood was also shed about the same time,
when part of the English Garrison at <hi>Berwick,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that some Ammunition was layed up in a little
Towne of <hi>Scotland, Dunsian,</hi> made an attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, but found it better fortified then was expected,
and were repelled with some slaughter; from whence
hearing that a greater power of Scots was making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them, under the command of the Lord HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINTON,
(who unfortunately perished afterward,
blowne up with powder at <hi>Dunglasse</hi>) they returned
to <hi>Berwick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King, during these Skirmishes, had by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
warned all the English Nobility, with
their followers and Forces, to attend his Standard
at <hi>Yorke</hi> against the Scots, the 20. of <hi>September;</hi>
where whilest himselfe in Person resided, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
an humble Petition from the Scots, containing
an expression of their loyalty to him, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of their intentions toward <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But their expressions were in such generall termes,
that the King returned answer to the Earle of LANU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICK,
Secretary for <hi>Scotland,</hi> Commanding them to
specifie their demands more particularly: Which whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
the Scots prepared to do, it pleased God to open
the hearts of many English Lords, who considering
and bewailing the great calamity and dishonour
which <hi>England</hi> was then throwne into, by these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
proceedings of the King, framed an humble
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96346:40"/>
Letter, subscribed by all their hands, and sent it to
His Majesty, wherein they represent to him the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
condition of the Kingdome, and mischiefes
attending that wicked Warre; as the danger of his
Person, the waste of his Revenue, the burden of
his Subjects, the rapines committed by that Army
which he had raised; wherein Papists, and others ill-affected
to Religion, are armed in Commands, who
are not by the Lawes permitted to have Armes in
their owne houses; The great mischiefe which may
fall upon the Kingdome, if his intentions, which
are reported of bringing in Irish and forraigne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
should take effect; The urging of Ship-money;
The multitude of Monopolies and other Patents, to
the great and universall grievance of his people; The
great griefe of the Subjects, for the long intermission
of Parliaments, for dissolving of the last, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dissolutions of such as have been called, without
any good effect: For remedy whereof, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of future dangers to his owne Royall Person,
and the whole State, they humbly intreat his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
That he would be pleased to summon a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
within some short and convenient time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the causes of these, and other great grievances,
which the people lye under, may be taken away,
and the Authors and Counsellors of them, may be
brought to legall tryall, and condigne punishment;
And that this War may be composed without blood,
in such manner as may conduce to the honour and
safety of his Majesty, the comfort of the people,
and uniting of both Kingdomes, against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy of the Reformed Religion. Subscribed
by almost twenty Earles and Barons.</p>
                  <p>The King receiving this Message from the Peeres
of <hi>England;</hi> by his Proclamation ordained a day,
which was upon 24. of <hi>September,</hi> for all the Lords
to meet at <hi>Yorke,</hi> to whom he declared, that of
his owne free accord he had determined to call a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96346:40"/>
Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> to begin as soone as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could be, allowing the usuall time for issuing out
of Writs, which was upon the third of <hi>November</hi>
ensuing, 1640.</p>
                  <p>But he desired first to consult with them, what
answer to returne to the Scots demands, and how
with his honour he might deale with them, who had
so boldly invaded <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to make them understand the whole state of
the businesse, he commanded the Earle of TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUARE,
who had beene his Commissioner there,
to relate all occurrences since the beginning.</p>
                  <p>He desired likewise their advice how his Army
might be payed before supplies of Parliament could
come.</p>
                  <p>After many debates, and different opinions in point
of honour and convenience; it was at last agreed by
the greater part of Peeres, and so conluded, that
sixteene Lords should be chosen to treat with the
Scots, and agree upon what Conditions they
thought fit.</p>
                  <p>Eight Earles were named, BEDFORD, ESSEX,
HARTFORT, SALISBURY, WARWICK, HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,
BRISTOLL, and BARKSHIRE; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
eight Barons, WHARTON, PAGET, KIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>OLTON,
BROOKE, PAWLET, HOWARD, SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILE,
and DUNSMORE.</p>
                  <p>The Scots were required to send as many with
full Commission, to whom Letters of safe Conduct
in the amplest manner were granted.</p>
                  <p>When the matter came to debate, the Earle of
<hi>Bristoll</hi> for the most part was Prolocutour to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and the Earle of LOWDEN to the Scots.</p>
                  <p>After many demands on both sides, and expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
upon sleighter matters, which were easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
there was one point, which seemed too hard
a case in the eyes of the English Peeres, that the
Scottish Army should be payed by the English,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96346:41"/>
whilest their owne Army was in great distresse by
reason of Arreares.</p>
                  <p>But in conclusion, those honest Lords, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the condition of that unhappy Warre,
were content upon any termes to make an end of
it; and in conclusion an agreement was made upon
these termes:
<list>
                        <item>1. A Truce or Cessation of Armes for two Moneths,
till the 16. of <hi>December.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That 850. <hi>l.</hi> a day should be paid to the Scots, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that Truce.</item>
                        <item>3. That if it were not payed, the Scots might force
it from the Counties of <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland,
Westmerland,</hi> and <hi>Durham.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. That those Counties should be allowed the Scots for
their winter Quarters.</item>
                        <item>5. No new preparations for Warre to be made.</item>
                        <item>6. That private injuries should not breake the Truce,
so satisfaction were made upon complaint.</item>
                        <item>7. That Merchants might freely traffique in either
Kingdome, without Letters of safe Conduct, but
Souldiers without leave might not passe their limits.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon such termes was this unnaturall Warre (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Armies could not as yet be disbanded)
brought to a Cessation; and both Nations rested in
assured confidence, that a peace must needs follow,
since the whole matter was now to be debated in the
English Parliament, which was to begin about a
fortnight after; for it was likely that a Parliament
should put a period to that Warre, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been begun, but for want of a Parliament.
They were also confident, that that freedome which
the fundamentall Lawes and Constitutions of the
Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> allow to Parliaments, could
not be denyed to this (though to many others it had
long been) as being that Parliament, to which the
King was necessitated; and the onely way which was
now left him to tread, after so many deviations
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96346:41"/>
unfortunately tried; and upon which the people
had set up their utmost hope, whom it seemed not
safe after so long suffering, to provoke any further.</p>
                  <p>In what a desperate condition the Kingdome of
<hi>England</hi> was at that time, what necessity there was
of a present cure, with how much difficulty that
cure was to be wrought, and with what warinesse
and wisdome it concerned both King and people to
play their parts, a judicious Reader may partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
by the former passages already related.</p>
                  <p>But further to enlighten the Reader (for in this
plaine Relation I shall be sparing to use any descants
of my owne (I will referre him to Speeches which at
the beginning of this Parliament were made by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Gentlemen, and those of greatest moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
labouring as much as they could possibly to spare
the King, and touch tenderly upon his Honour, which
I shall mention anon.</p>
                  <p>According to the reason of the Parliament and
Kingdome, went along the sence of Courtiers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

in which the King and Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> were
in, when this so much expected Parliament was to

expressed himselfe very well, in a

seeme too low for the Majestie of his Person; but

were to make it a glorious and flourishing Kingdome. In
which businesse he did freely and willingly leave it to
them where to beginne.</p>
                  <p>He desired also that all Jealousies and Suspitions
might be layed aside by them, which he promised to
doe on his part. And withall, to give some reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
colour to his former Warre, whether to excuse

had entred <hi>England</hi> with an Army against his will;

you <hi>(said he)</hi> that the Rebels must be put out of this
Kingdome; it is true, I must needs call them so, so long
as they have an Army that do invade us; although
I am under Treaty with them, and under my Great
Seale doe call them Subjects, for so they are too.</p>
                  <p>His desire to have them out, was sweetned with
that reason, That he was sensible how much his
English Subjects of the North would suffer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                  <p>All which, with more particulars, was set forth
in a long Oration by the Lord Keeper FINCH; who
likewise justified the Kings intention of calling this
Parliament, before the Peeres petitioned him at
<hi>Yorke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the King were thanked for his Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his English Parliament; yet that motion of
expelling the Scots, was otherwise considered of by
the Houses, as will appeare in the particulars of it:
For about a weeke after it was ordered by the House
of Commons, That 100000<hi>l.</hi> should be paid to the
two Armies, to be levied rateably upon all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>England,</hi> (except the Northerne Counties,
which were then charged) and till it could be leavied
the Money to be taken up at Interest.</p>
                  <p>And Scottish Commissioners were allowed to come
and exhibite their complaints, and dispute the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at <hi>London;</hi> who accordingly came thither about
the nineteenth day of the same Moneth, for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
was not yet ended, but still in Treaty, which
Treaty (as the King said in his Speech) was but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from <hi>Kippon</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the great cure, which was expected from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96346:43"/>
this Parliament, could go on, it was necessary that
some time should be spent in searching and declaring
the wounds, which in divers elegant and judicious
Speeches, was done by some Members of both
Houses.</p>
                  <p>The abuses which of late yeares had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about Religion, and the manifold violations of
Lawes and Liberties, were upon the first day after
the House of Commons was setled, being the ninth
of <hi>November,</hi> enumerated and discoursed upon by
Master GRIMSTON, Sir BENJAMIN RUDIERD,
Master PYM, and Master BAGSHAW, and the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> reflecting much upon the Earle of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> were opened by Sir JOHN CLOTWOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY
of <hi>Devon,</hi> but living in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like Speeches for many daies following, were
made by divers Gentlemen of great quality; where
in the midst of their complaints, the King was never
mentioned, but with great Honour. They alwaies
mixing thanks for the present hope of redresse, with
their complaints of former grievances.</p>
                  <p>The first of which they rendred to the King, and
threw the other upon his Ministers; of which if the
Reader would see a perfect exemplar, Sir BENJAMIN
RUDYERD his Speech (the second that was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the House) will best discover the present
state of grievances, and the way of sparing the
King, a Religious, Learned, and Judicious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
                  <q>Cujus erant mores, qualis facundia.</q>
                  <p>Whose Speech I shall wholly insert, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the State may the better bee understood.</p>
                  <p>Master Speaker:</p>
                  <p>WEE are here assembled to doe Gods businesse,
and the Kings, in which our owne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
as we are Christians, as we are Subjects:
Let us first feare God, then shall we honour the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96346:43"/>
King the more; for I am afraid we have beene the
lesse prosperous in Parliaments, because we have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
other matters before him. Let Religion be our <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
quaerite,</hi> for all things else are but <hi>Et caetera's</hi> to
it; yet we may have them too, sooner and surer, if we
give God his precedence.</p>
                  <p>We well know what disturbance hath been brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church for vaine petty trifles; How the whole
Church, the whole Kingdome, hath been troubled, where
to place a Metaphor, an Altar.</p>
                  <p>We have seene Ministers, their wives, children, and
families undone, against Law, against conscience, against
all bowels of compassion, about not dancing upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies:
What do these sort of men thinke will become of
themselves, when the Master of the House shall come and
finde them thus beating their fellow Servants?</p>
                  <p>These inventions were but sives, made of purpose to
winnow the best men, and that is the Devills occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
                  <p>They have a minde to worry preaching; for I never yet
heard of any but diligent Preachers that were vext with
these and the like devices.</p>
                  <p>They despise Prophecy, and as one said, they would
faine be at something were like the Masse, that will not
bite; a muzzled Religion. They would evaporate and
dis-spirit the power and vigour of Religion, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it out into solemne and specious formalities, into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete
antiquated Ceremonies, new furbish'd up. And
this (belike) is that good worke in hand, which Doctor
<hi>HEYLIN</hi> hath so celebrated in bis bold Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets:
All their acts and actions are so full of mixtures,
involutions, and complications, as nothing is cleare,
nothing sincere, in any of their proceedings: Let them
not say, That these are the porverse suspitions, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
interpretations of some factious spirits amongst us,
when a Romanist hath bragged and congratulated in
print, That the face of our Church begins to alter, the
Language of our Religion to change: And <hi>SANCTA
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96346:44"/>
CLARA</hi> hath published, That if a Synod were held
<hi>Non intermixtis Puritanis,</hi> setting Puritans aside, our
Articles and their Religion would soone be agreed.</p>
                  <p>They have so brought it to passe, that under the name
of Puritans, all our Religion is branded, and under
a few hard words against Iesuites, all Popery is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever squares his actions by any rule, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
or humane, he is a Puritan: Whosoever would be
governed by the Kings Lawes, he is a Puritan.</p>
                  <p>He that will not do whatsoever other men would have
him do, he is a Puritan. Their great worke, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterpiece
now is, to make all those of the Religion, to be
the suspected party of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Let us further reflect upon the ill effect these courses
have wrought, what by a defection from us on the one
side, a separation on the other; some imagining whether
we are tending, made hast to turne or declare themselves
Papists before hand; thereby hoping to render themselves
the more gracious, the more acceptable. A great company
of the Kings Subjects, striving to hold communion with
us; but seeing how farre we were gone, and fearing how
much further we would go, were forc'd to fly the Land,
some into other inhabited Countries, very many into sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Wildernesses, because the Land would not beare
them. Do not they that cause this cast a reproach upon the
Government?</p>
                  <p>Master Speaker:</p>
                  <p>Let it be our principall care, that these waies neither
continue, nor returne upon us; if we secure our Religion
we shall cut off and defeat many plots that are now on
foot by them and others. Beleeve it, Sir, Religion hath
been for a long time, and still is the great designe upon this
Kingdome. It is a knowne and practised principle, That
they who would introduce another Religion into the
Church, must first trouble and disorder the Government
of the State, that so they may worke their ends in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which now lies at the doore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:96346:44"/>I come next, <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> to the Kings businesse
more particularly; which indeed is the Kingdomes, for
one hath no existence, no being, without the other, their
relation is so neere; yet some have strongly and subtilly
laboured a divorse, which hath been the very bane of both
King and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>When foundations are shaken, it is high time to looke
to the building; he hath no heart, no head, no soule, that
is not moved in his whole man, to looke upon the distresses,
the miseries of the Common-wealth, that is not forward in
all that he is and hath, to redresse them in a right
way.</p>
                  <p>The King likewise is reduced to great straights, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it were undutifulnesse beyond inhumanity to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of him: Let us rather make it an advantage for
him, to do him best service, when he hath most need, not
to seeke our owne good, but in him, and with him, else we
shall commit the same crimes our selves, which we must
condemne in others.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty hath cleerely and freely put himself into
the hands of this Parliament; and I presume, there is
not a man in this House, but feeles himself advanced in
this high Trust; but if he prosper no better in our hands,
then he hath done in theirs, who have hitherto had the
handling of his affaires, we shall for ever make our selves
unworthy of so gracious a confidence.</p>
                  <p>I have often thought and said, That it must be some
great extremity, that would recover and rectifie this State,
and when that extremity did come, it would be a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
whether it might prove a remedy or ruine. We are
now, <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> upon that verticall turning point,
and therefore it is no time to palliate, to foment our owne
undoing.</p>
                  <p>Let us set upon the remedy; we must first know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease;
But to discover the diseases of the State, is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to some) to traduce the Government; yet others
are of opinion, That this is the halfe way to the
Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:96346:45"/>His Majesty is wiser then they that have advised him,
and therefore he cannot but see and feele their subverting
destructive Counsels, which speak lowder then I can speak
of them; for they ring a dolefull deadly knell over the
whole Kingdome: His Majesty best knowes who they are.
For us, let the matters bolt out the men, their actions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them.</p>
                  <p>They are men that talk largely of the Kings Service,
yet have done none but their owne, and that is too
evident.</p>
                  <p>They speak highly of the Kings power; but they have
made it a miserable power, that produceth nothing but
weaknesse, both to the King and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>They have exhausted the Kings Revenue to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
nay through the bottome, and beyond.</p>
                  <p>They have spent vast sums of money wastfully, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,
dangerously; so that more money without other
Councels, will be but a swift undoing.</p>
                  <p>They have alwaies peremptorily pursued one obstinate
pernicious course; first, they bring things to an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then they make that extremity of their owne making,
the reason of their next action, seven times worse then the
former; and there we are at this instant.</p>
                  <p>They have almost spoiled the best instituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world, for Soveraignty in a King, Liberty
to the Subject, the proportionable temper of both
which, makes the happiest State for power, for riches,
for duration.</p>
                  <p>They have unmannerly, and slubbringly, cast all their
projects, all their machinations, upon the King, which
no wise or good Minister of State ever did, but would
still take all harsh, distastefull things, upon themselves, to
cleare, to sweeten their Master.</p>
                  <p>They have not suffered His Majesty to appeare unto his
people in his owne native goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>They have ecclipsed him by their interpositions. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
grosse condense bodies may obscure and hinder the
Sun from shining out, yet he is still the same in his owne
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96346:45"/>
splendour. And when they are removed, all creatures
under him are directed by his light, comforted by his
Beames.</p>
                  <p>But they have framed a superstitious seeming Maxime
of State for their owne turne, <hi>That if a King will suffer
men to be torne from him, he shall never have any
good service done him.</hi> When the plaine truth is, That
this is the surest way to preserve a King from having
ill servants about him; and the Divine truth likewise is,
<hi>Take away the wicked from the King, and his Throne
shall be established.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Master Speaker:</hi> Now we see what the sores are in
generall; and when more particulars shall appeare, let
us be very carefull to draw out the cores of them, not to
skin them over with a slight suppurating festring cure,
least they breake out againe into a greater mischiefe: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it, consult, and speake your minds.</p>
                  <p>It hath heretofore been boasted, That the King should
never call a Parliament, till he had no need of his people:
These were words of division, and Malignity. The King
must alwaies, according to his occasions, have use of the
peoples power, hearts, hands, purses; The people will
alwaies have need of the Kings Clemency, Iustice, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
And this reciprocation is the strongest, the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
union.</p>
                  <p>It hath been said too of late, That a Parliament will
take away more from the King, then they will give him.
It may well be said, That those things which will fall
away of themselves, will enable the Subject to give him
more then can be taken any way else. Projects and Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are but leaking Conduit-Pipes; The Exchequer it selfe
at the fullest, is but a Cisterne, and now a broken one;
Frequent Parliaments onely are the fountaines, and I do
not doubt, but in this Parliament, as we shall be free in
our advices, so shall we be the more free of our purses,
that His Majesty may experimentally finde the reall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of better Councels, the true solid grounds of raising
and establishing his Greatnesse, never to be brought againe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96346:46"/>
(by Gods blessing) to such dangerous, such desperate
perplexities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Master Speaker:</hi> I confesse I have now gone in a way
much against my nature, and somewhat against my custome
heretofore used in this place: But the deplorable, dismall
condition, both of Church and State, have so farre wrought
upon my judgement, as it hath convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed my disposition;
yet am I not <hi>vir sanguinum;</hi> I love no mans ruine: I thank
God, I neither hate any mans person, nor envy any mans
fortune, onely I am zealous of a thorow Reformation, in a
time that exacts, that extorts it. Which I humbly beseech
this House, may be done with as much lenity, as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
as the publike safety of the King and Kingdome
can possibly admit.</p>
                  <p>In so great a concurrence of businesse, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affaires, concerning the safety, and the very being
of three Kingdomes, as farre as the Parliament had
leisure to consider and redresse the damages or other
injuries of particular persons; Their first care was to
vindicate distressed Ministers, who had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
or deprived by the Bishops, and all others who
in the Cause of Religion had been persecuted by
them: Many of those Ministers, within few weeks
after the beginning of the Parliament were released
from durance, and restored to their Charges, with
damages from their oppressours; Many Doctors and
other Divines, that had been most busie in promoting
the late Church innovations about Altars and other
Ceremonies, and therefore most gracious and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in the State, were then questioned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
insomuch as the change, and the suddennesse
of it, seemed wonderfull to men, and may worthily
serve as a document to all posterity.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Quam fragili loco starent superbi.</l>
                     <l>In what fraile places stand the proudest men.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Among divers others of this kinde, and the most
remarkable of all, was that reliefe which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96346:46"/>
immediately upon their first sitting, gave to
three persecuted Gentlemen, Doctor BASTWICK
a Phisitian, Master PRYNNE a Lawyer, and Master
BURTON a Minister.</p>
                  <p>The whole passage of whose Story we will here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
in one continued discourse, that it may not
hereafter interrupt any other Relations of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>These three men, for the same offence, or very
little differing in substance, (as those that read their
extant Bookes may perceive) not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
themselves in such a cause, had written against
the manner of English Episcopacy, and those incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
or extravagancies, which, as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
flowed from it, to the prejudice of purity in
Religion; For which offence they were all three hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
censured in the High Commission Court, at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times, and committed to severall Prisons, where
they long remained in durance, till afterward their
cause was brought into the Starre-Chamber, where
they received a sad doome; and the same day stood
all three upon Pillories in <hi>Westminster</hi> Pallace yard,
where their eares were likewise cut off.</p>
                  <p>It seemed, I remember, to many Gentlemen (and
was accordingly discoursed of) a spectacle no lesse
strange then sad, to see three of severall Professions,
the noblest in the Kingdome, Divinity, Law, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
exposed at one time to such an ignominious pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and condemned to it by Protestant Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
for such Tenents in Religion, as the greatest
part of Protestants in <hi>England</hi> held, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in <hi>Europe</hi> maintained.</p>
                  <p>But the Court of Starre-Chamber seemed to take
cognizance onely of their unlawfull publishing those
Tenents, and disobedience to the Authority then
in being.</p>
                  <p>This was but the beginning of their punishment;
they were afterward banished to remote places of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96346:47"/>
Kingdom, and there kept in close and solitary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinement,
not allowed pen and paper, nor the sight
of any friends, no not so much (for two of them
were married) as of their owne wives. Their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments,
at severall removes, were in the Castles
of <hi>Lanceston, Lancaster, Carnarvon,</hi> and Isles of <hi>Sylly,
Garnsey,</hi> and <hi>Iersey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three, within five daies after the Parliament
began to sit, were sent for home from their banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and accordingly Master PRYNNE, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
BURTON, upon the 28. of <hi>November</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>London,</hi> (Doctor BASTWICK within few daies
after in the same manner) being met upon the way,
some few miles from <hi>London,</hi> and brought into the
City by five thousand persons, both men and women,
on horseback, who all of them wore in their hats
Rosemary and Bayes, in token of Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
                  <p>The discourses of men upon this action, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different, some both of the Clergy, of the Court,
and other Gentlemen besides, did not conceale their
dislike of it, affirming that it was a bold and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
affront to Courts of Justice; and the Kings
Authority: Others, who pittied the former sufferings
of those men, and they that wished Reformation in
matters of Justice, were pleased with it; hoping that
it would worke good effects in the Kings minde, and
make him sensible how his people stood dis-affected
to the rigour of such proceedings; and esteemed it as
a good presage of the ruine of those two Courts, the
High Commission, and Star-Chamber. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
true within halfe a yeare after.</p>
                  <p>How it wrought at that present upon the King, is
not knowne. But actions of that nature, where the
people of their owne accords, in a seeming tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner, do expresse their liking or dislike of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Government, cannot have alwaies the same
successe, but worke according to the disposition of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96346:47"/>
the Prince or Governour, either to a sense causing
Reformation, or to an hatred of them as upbraiders
of his actions, <hi>aut corrigunt, aut irritant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within a moneth after, the businesse of these
three men, was by Order of the Parliament referred
to Committees to examine and report.</p>
                  <p>Upon which reports, not two Moneths after, it
was voted by the House of Commons, That those
Judgements so given against them (but severally for
every one of the three) were illegall, unjust, and
against the liberty of the Subject; and within a month
after voted that they should receive damages for their
great sufferings; and satisfaction should be made them
in money, to be paid by the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
the High Commissioners, and those Lords who
had voted against them in the Star-Chamber; That
they should be againe restored to their callings, and
receive Master BURTON 6000.<hi>l.</hi> and Master
PRYNNE 5000.<hi>l.</hi> Doctor BASTWICK in a vote
by himself was given the like summe.</p>
                  <p>As these were comforted after their sufferings, so
other Divines (for the beginning of this Parliament
seemed a little Doomesday) after a short pleasure
were brought to their torment.</p>
                  <p>A Committee was made to enquire of scandalous
Ministers; which appeared in two kindes (and were
accordingly censured) either loose livers, and men of
a debauched behaviour, for many such were gotten
into good preferments, and countenanced to affront
the Puritans; or else offendours in way of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
of the former sort many were in short time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
by degrees censured, and turned out of their
livings: Of the latter sort there was no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of offendors, nor in likelihood could that, which
had beene the way to all high preferments, want
walkers in it.</p>
                  <p>Among all the men of his ranke, Dr. COOSENS,
Master of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96346:48"/>
most noted for superstitious and curious observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in many kindes; a man not noted for any great
depth of learning, nor yet scandalous for ill living,
but onely forward to shew himselfe in formalities and
outward Ceremonies concerning Religion, many of
which were such as a Protestant State might not well
suffer.</p>
                  <p>This man was questioned upon many Articles,
some by himselfe, some, where other Divines were
joyned with him, imprisoned he was, afterwards
bayled; and though deprived of some preferments,
yet escaped without any great punishment, and was
one of them, in that crowd of offendors, who might
rejoyce that the Parliament had so much businesse.</p>
                  <p>But greater Clergymen then Doctor COOSENS
were then to come upon the Stage; Bishop WRENNE
a man guilty of the same crime in Superstition, that
COOSENS was, as farre as concerned his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but farre more guilty as a Magistrate, and able
to impose it upon others, was upon the 19. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
accused of Treason, and entred into a recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of 30000<hi>l.</hi> to appeare, with three sureties
ingaged each of them in bonds of 10000.<hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This WRENNE being Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in which there were as many strict Professors of
Religion (commonly called Puritans) as in any part
of <hi>England,</hi> had there violently pressed superstitious
Ceremonies, or such as they conceived so, upon them,
put downe accustomed Lectures, and deprived many
Ministers much beloved and reverenced among them.
By which rigour he grew accidentally guilty of a
wonderfull crime against the wealth and prosperity
of the State.</p>
                  <p>For many Tradesmen (with whom those parts
abounded) were so afflicted and troubled with his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
censures and vexations, that in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to avoid misery, they departed the Kingdome,
some into new <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of <hi>America,</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96346:48"/>
others into <hi>Holland,</hi> whether they transported their
Manufactures of Cloth, not onely a losse by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
the present stock of the Kingdome, but a great
mischiefe by impairing and indangering the losse of
that peculiar Trade of Clothing, which hath been a
plentifull fountaine of Wealth and Honour to the
Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> as it was expressed in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Remonstrance; but more particular crimes
were laid against the Bishop, which there may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to discourse of hereafter, in the proccedings
against him.</p>
                  <p>The day before Bishop WRENNE was accused,
being the 18. of <hi>December,</hi> a greater man, both in
Church and State, WILLIAM LAUD, Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was voted in the House of Commons
guilty of High Treason; Master DENZILL HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS,
a Member of that House, was sent up to the
Lords, to appeach him there; upon which he was
sequestred, and confined to the Black Rod. He was
also charged by the Scottish Commissioners, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as a chiefe Incendiary
in the late Warre betweene both Nations; and divers
Articles laid against him; which to examine and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse
further, a Committee was appointed.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 23. of <hi>February,</hi> Master PYMME made
report to the House of Commons, what hainous and
capitall crimes were objected against him: Upon
which the House fell into a serious debate, and a
Charge of High Treason in fourteene Articles was
drawne up against him; which Charge two daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was sent from the House of Commons by Master
PYMME up to the Lords.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop was that day brought before the
Lords, to heare that Charge read; and it was there
voted, That he should immediately be sent to the
Tower; but upon his earnest suit, for some speciall
reasons, he was two daies longer suffered to abide
under the Black Rod, and then accordingly sent to

the Tower; where we will leave him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Articles.</p>
                  <p>Civill offendors, as well as Ecclesiasticall, must

matters of Church and Religion, so he shall first
be named.</p>
                  <p>Sir FRANCIS WINDEBANKE, Principall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of Estate, a great Favourite and friend to the
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by his friendship, as
was thought, advanced to that place of Honour, was
upon the 12 of <hi>November</hi> questioned in an high kinde
concerning Popish Priests; of whom in that seven or
eight yeares that he had been Secretary, he had bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a great number, and released many by his power,
contrary to the Lawes made, and then in force against
them; which being examined by a Committee, and
certaine to prove foule against him, as it did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
for upon examination there were proved
against him 74. Letters of grace to Recusants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
foure yeares, signed with his owne hand, 64 Priests
discharged from the Gate-House, 29 discharged by a
verball Warrant from him; he thought it his best
course, before triall, to fly the Land; so that upon
the fourth of <hi>December</hi> newes was brought to the
House, that Secretary WINDEBANKE, with Master
READ his chiefe Clarke, was fled; and soone after,
notice was given that he arrived in <hi>France,</hi> where he
long continued.</p>
                  <p>About that time came the great businesse of Ship-Money
into debate in Parliament; and was voted by
both Houses to be a most illegall Taxation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
grievance; in reference to which case, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Judges were made Delinquents, for their
extrajudiciall opinions in it, as more particularly will
afterward appeare. As for other petty grievances,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96346:49"/>
such as were the multitude of Monopolies upon all
things, and Commodities of greatest and most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
use; the House daily condemned them, and the
Delinquents of meaner note in that kinde, were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and censured, too many to be here named:
Nay, so impartiall was the House of Commons in
that case, that many of their owne Members, who
had been guilty of such Monopolies, were daily tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of the House for that offence.</p>
                  <p>But the businesse of Ship-money, did reflect with
a deeper staine of guilt upon the then Lord Keeper
FINCH, then upon any of the other Judges what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
for his great activity and labouring in it, by
threats and promises working upon the other Judges,
as we finde alleadged against him.</p>
                  <p>Sir JOHN FINCH, in the yeare 1636. when that
Taxation of Ship-money was first plotted and set on
foot, was newly made Lord Chiefe Justice of the
Common Pleas, a man in favour with the King, and
many of the greatest Lords in Court, having before
been the Queenes Attorney, a Gentleman of good
birth, of an high and Imperious spirit, eloquent
in speech, though in the knowledge of the Law not
very deepe.</p>
                  <p>Upon the death of the Lord Keeper COVENTRY
about <hi>December</hi> 1639. the King was pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
that high Trust of keeping the Great Seale up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; which Office at this time he held.</p>
                  <p>Upon the seventh of <hi>December,</hi> when Ship-money
was fully debated, and absolutely damned by the
House of Commons, and the offence of the Judges
began to be scanned, sixteene Gentlemen of that
House were chosen to examine those Judges, that had
given their extrajudiciall opinions for it (for three
gave their opinions otherwise: The arguments of
two, Judge CROOKE, and Judge HUTTON, were
very famous; Baron DENHAM, by reason of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
could not declare his opinion in so large a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96346:50"/>
what threats or promises had been used to them,
and by what persons.</p>
                  <p>Upon which examination, and further light given,
the next day a Committee was named to draw up
Charges against the Judges, and against the Lord
FINCH, then Lord Keeper, a Charge of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
He not many daies after, became an humble Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to the House of Commons, That before the
Charge of High Treason were delivered against him,
they would be pleased to heare him <hi>Ore Tenus</hi> in their
owne House.</p>
                  <p>His suit was granted; and the next day save one,
in a long Oration he endeavoured to cleare himselfe;
but all in vaine was that endeavour, though his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
were very humble and submissive, and his
Speech full of perswasive Rhetorick, it could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
to divert the Judgement, though many in the
House were moved to a kinde of Compassion.</p>
                  <p>He, either secretly informed by friends, or himself
perceiving by evident signes, how things were likely
to go with him, conceived it best to use a timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and the next day disguised fled, and soone
crossed the Seas into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his flight, he was voted by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
guilty of High Treason for foure causes:
<list>
                        <item>1. Disobeying the House, in refusall to speake at
their command, when he was Speaker in Parliament,
in the fourth yeare of King CHARLES.</item>
                        <item>2. For threatning some Judges in the matter of
Ship-money.</item>
                        <item>3. For his illegall and cruell Judgements in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
businesse, when he was Lord Chiefe Justice of the
Common Pleas.</item>
                        <item>4. For drawing that injurious Declaration after
dissolution of the last Parliament.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon which a Charge was drawne up against him,
and carried up to the Lords upon the 14. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
three weeks after his flight, by the Lord FAWKLAND;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96346:50"/>
who presented it with a very pithy and sharpe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the man.</p>
                  <p>These two last Delinquents (though men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
place in the Common-wealth) as they did not
long trouble the Parliament, nor much retard the
progresse of publike businesse, preventing their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
by timely flight, so can they take up no large

of this Parliament, and the hopes of three Kingdoms

arraigned.</p>
                  <p>Many Subjects in <hi>Europe</hi> have played lowder parts
upon the Theater of the world, but none left it with
greater noise; nor was the matter of his accusation
confined within one Realme; three whole Kingdoms

                  <q>Offensis <hi>Ruffinum</hi> divide terris.</q>
                  <p>Within ten daies after the Parliament began, the
Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> newly returned from the North,
was sitting in the House of Lords; when Master
PYMME, an ancient Gentleman of great experience in
Parliamentary affaires, and no lesse knowne fidelity
to his Country, came up to the Lords, and in the
name of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> accused THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS
Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
of High Treason; and desired their Lordships that
he might be sequestred from Parliament, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
committed to Prison; as also to let them know,
that the Commons within very few daies would resort
to their Lordships with the particular Articles and
grounds of this Accusation.</p>
                  <p>The Earle was required to withdraw; and after a
debate thereof, called in, was committed to safe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody
to the Gentleman Usher; And immediately
after, upon the 13. day of <hi>November,</hi> a Serjeant at
Armes was sent into <hi>Ireland</hi> for Sir GEORGE RAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIFFE,
a great Favourite of the Earles, and one that
under him had beene very active in the oppression of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> a man of subtle wit, and knowledge of the
Law; as having before beene educated at the Innes of
Court, and taken the degree of Barrister.</p>
                  <p>Sir GEORGE accordingly upon the fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
came in, and yeelded himselfe to the Speaker;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96346:51"/>
from whence he was committed to custody. And
foure daies after the Lords of Parliament sent the
Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> to the Tower, with a strict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to the Lieutenant, that he should keepe a
close guard upon him.</p>
                  <p>Much time was interposed betweene the severall
proceedings against this Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the multiplicity of weighty businesse which
the Parliament then had. But before the end of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
a long Charge was read against him in the
House of Commons, and a Message not long after
sent to the Lords, to desire that he might be seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
from all his places of Dignity and Honour, in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Charge against him consisted of nine Articles,
which afterwards upon a further impeachment, were
extended to eight and twenty. All those Articles are
to be seene at large in the Records: But for further
satisfaction of the Reader, I will give a briefe touch
of the scope of them. The first and second being
much alike, concerning his ruling of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
those parts of <hi>England,</hi> where his Authority lay,
in an Arbitrary way, against the fundamentall Lawes
of the Kingdome, which Lawes he had indeavoured
to subvert. Thirdly, his retaining part of the Kings
Revenue, without giving a legall account. Fourthly,
The abusing of his Power, to the increase and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of Papists. Fifthly, That he malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
had indeavoured to stir up Hostility betweene
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> Sixthly, That being Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Generall of the Northerne Army, he had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
suffered the Scots to defeat the English at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
and take <hi>Newcastle;</hi> that by such a losse and
dishonour, <hi>England</hi> might be ingaged in a Nationall
and irreconcileable quarrell with the Scots. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That to preserve himselfe from questioning, he
had laboured to subvert Parliaments, and incense the
King against them. Eightly and lastly, That these
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96346:52"/>
things were done during the time of his Authority
as Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Lieutenant Generall of
the Northerne Armies in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons, saving to themselves a liberty
of further impeachment against the said Earle, &amp;c.
do require his legall answer to all.</p>
                  <p>The further impeachment, consisting of 28. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
was for the most part branched out of these,
and insisted upon in more particulars, concerning
his Tyranny in <hi>Ireland</hi> over divers persons, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Law. Concerning which the Reader must be
referred to the Records themselves, as being too large
to be here inserted.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> upon the 23. of <hi>February</hi>
was brought before the Lords, to give in his answer;
which he accordingly did; the King himself being
there present to heare it read.</p>
                  <p>It was very large, and when it was done, he was
sent back to the Tower, there to remaine till further
Order.</p>
                  <p>A Committee being appointed to consider of that
businesse, upon the fourth of <hi>March</hi> following made
report in the House, That they would mannage and
maintaine their Accusation of Treason against him;
and thought it not fit to reply to his Answer, but call
him to speedy triall.</p>
                  <p>Immediately upon which, a Conference was
had with the Lords concerning that Triall, and some
Circumstances which were thought fit to be used
at it.</p>
                  <p>The Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> had likewise a
Charge against the Earle of <hi>Strafford;</hi> concerning
those injuries, which, as they conceived, their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Kingdome had suffered from him. But the
substance of that Charge was implyed in these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
before specified, which the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had exhibited against him.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 22. of <hi>March,</hi> 1640. that remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96346:52"/>
Tryall of the Earle of STRAFFORD began.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall was the place chosen, where
Scaffolds were raised on both sides, nine degrees in
height; whereof seven were appointed for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House of Commons to sit on, who were
all there in a Committee: The two upper degrees of
the Scaffold, were appointed for the Commissioners
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were then
come over.</p>
                  <p>In the midst, on a lower ascent, sate the Peeres of
<hi>England,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> being Lord high Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the Earle of <hi>Lindsey</hi> Lord High Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Throne was placed for the King: But
the King comming thither (which he did every day of
the tryall) sate private with the Queene and other
Ladies, in a close Gallery, made of purpose to heare
the proceedings, and tooke notes himselfe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them,</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> answered daily at the Barre,
whilest the whole House of Commons, having put
themselves into a Committee, had liberty to charge
him, every man as he saw occasion: But though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them did sometimes speake, yet the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
were chiefly managed by two expert Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
Master GLYNNE, and Master MAYNARD,
both Members of the House.</p>
                  <p>Many foule misdemeanours, committed both in
<hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> were daily proved against him:
But that ward which the Earle, being an eloquent
man, especially lay at; was to keepe off the blow
of High Treason, whatsoever misdemeanours should
be layed upon him; of which, some he denied, others
he excused, and extenuated with great subtilty; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to make one thing good, That misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
though never so many and so great, could
not by being put together make one Treason, unlesse
some one of them had been Treason in its owne
nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:96346:53"/>Every day the first weeke, from Munday to Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
without intermission, the Earle was brought
from the Tower to <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, and arraigned
many houres together; and the successe of every
daies tryall, was the greatest discourse or dispute in
all companies.</p>
                  <p>For by this time the people began to be a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in opinions; The Clergy in generall were so
much fallen into love and admiration of this Earle,
that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was almost quite
forgotten by them.</p>
                  <p>The Courtiers cryed him up, and the Ladies,
whose voices will carry much with some parts of the
State, were exceedingly on his side.</p>
                  <p>It seemed a very pleasant object, to see so many
Semproniaes (all the chiefe Court Ladies filling the
Galleries at the Tryall) with penne, inke, and paper
in their hands, noting the passages, and discoursing
upon the grounds of Law and State. They were all
of his side; whether moved by pitty, proper to their
Sex, or by ambition of being thought able to judge
of the parts of the Prisoner.</p>
                  <p>But so great was the favour, and love, which they
openly expressed to him; that some could not but
thinke of that Verse:

                  <p>After all this long Triall, the House of Commons
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell into debate about a Bill of Attainder against the
Earle of <hi>Strafford;</hi> and voted him guilty of high
Treason in divers particulars of that Accusation, in
which they had proceeded against him; and in more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96346:53"/>
particular he was voted guilty of High Treason, for
his opinion given before the King, at a secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
which was discovered by some notes of Sir
HENRY VANE, who was also a Privy Councellor,
and present at that time; in which notes it was found
that the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> had said to the King, <hi>That
he had an Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which his Majesty might
imploy to reduce this Kingdome to obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These notes Sir HENRY VANE, eldest Sonne to
the before named Sir HENRY had found (as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
to the House) in his Fathers Cabinet, and
produced before the House without his Fathers
knowledge; who seemed extreme angry with his
Sonne for it.</p>
                  <p>This is related the more at large, because it was
the first occasion (that was open and visible) whereby
so eminent a Member as the Lord GEORGE DIGBY
was lost from the House of Commons, as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appeare: For that Vote was opposed by the
Lord DIGBY, and some others.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse a Committee was appointed to draw
up the Bill of Attainder, which was accordingly done,
and read in the House of Commons on the 21 day of
<hi>April,</hi> when the Earle was againe voted guilty of
High Treason; which was carried by farre the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part; for on the other side were but nine and fifty,
of whom the Lord DIGBY was one; who made to
that purpose a very elegant, though much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing,
Speech in the House; Of which more
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>That Bill of Attainder was sent up to the Lords,
where after the reading of it, a great division was
in that House, and many of the Lords much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it.</p>
                  <p>But Master St. JOHN, the Kings Solicitour, and a
Member of the House of Commons, was appointed
within few daies after to make good the Bill by Law,
and give the Lords satisfaction, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96346:54"/>
done upon the 29. of <hi>April</hi> in <hi>Westminster</hi>
Hall; where the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was present at the
Barre, and the King and Queene seated in their usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
places.</p>
                  <p>Master St. <hi>JOHN</hi> opened the Branches of the Bill,
and in a Discourse of two houres made it good by
precedent Statutes, and the like, to the satisfaction of
almost all that heard him.</p>
                  <p>But the King was not satisfied in conscience, as he
declared to both Houses two daies after, to condemne
him of High Treason; and told them, No feares or
respects whatsoever should make him alter that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
founded upon his conscience: But confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that his misdemeanors were so great, he held
him unfit to serve him in any Office whatsoever; with
other expressions of that kinde.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Speech was somewhat displeasing to the
Houses; but the City were out of patience, and
within foure daies after came to <hi>Westminster,</hi> about
five thousand of them, crying for Justice against the
Earle of <hi>Strafford;</hi> and following the Lords, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that they were undone, and trading decayed for
want of due execution of Justice.</p>
                  <p>The Lords gave them good words, and promised
them to acquaint the King with it. But the next day
they appeared againe with the same complaint. Their
feares being more aggravated, by reason of reports,
that attempts were made to get the Earle out of
Prison; upon which occasion some Lords were
sent to keepe the Tower, and assist the Lieutenant
there.</p>
                  <p>But the King was hard to be removed from his
resolution, although the Judges in the meane time
had delivered their opinions in the House of Lords
concerning the Earle of <hi>Strafford;</hi> and the Lords had
voted him guilty of High Treason upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>teenth
Article, for leavying of money in <hi>Ireland</hi> by force of
Armes; and upon the nineteenth, for imposing an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96346:54"/>
Oath upon the Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That they
should not protest against any of the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>The King at last, wearied with these complaints,
called a Privy Councell at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he spent
a great part of the day, calling also the Judges to
deliver their opinions before him, concerning the
Earle of <hi>Strafford;</hi> and sent for foure Bishops, to
resolve him upon scruple of conscience. After which
he granted a Commission to the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi>
the Lord Privy Seale, and the two Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines,
to signe that Bill for the execution of the
Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> three daies after, being Wednesday,
the 12. of <hi>May,</hi> 1641. which was accordingly done
upon the Scaffold on Tower Hill.</p>
                  <p>This was the unfortunate end of that Earle of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> whose character and actions have beene in
some manner before described.</p>
                  <p>Of whom we may truly say, That as his life and
Councells had been of great moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the State before, so did his death and Tryall
by unhappy accidents prove to be.</p>
                  <p>The divisions and disturbances which his life could
make, were not greater then those that his death
occasioned.</p>
                  <p>APPIANUS observes of SYLLA the Dictator,
That as his living power had rob'd the Romane Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of their freedome; so did his very Funerall:
Where so many of his old Souldiers and Hacsters
followed the solemnity, that the Senators who were
present, durst not with freedome expresse their
thoughts of him; but were inforced to flatter him
dead, as well as living.</p>
                  <p>How farre the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> did in his life
time divide the Kings affections from his People and
Parliaments (which was part of his Charge) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
surely tell; But certaine it is, That his Tryall
and death (which has made me insist the longer upon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96346:55"/>
it) did make such a division in that kinde, as, being
unhappily nourished by degrees afterward, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
ruined the three Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>The length of his Tryall, whilest two Armies at
an heavy expence were to be paid, and other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
at a great stand, did divide some impatient
people (at least in some degree) from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
The manner of his condemnation divided the
Parliament in it selfe; and the eager pressing of his
death did discover or cause a sad division of the King
from his Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Nine and fifty Members of the House of Commons
dissented in Vote from the rest, upon the Bill of
Attainder, Upon which some indiscreet persons (for
so I must needs esteeme them, though it was never
knowne who they were, or by whose notice it was
done) the next day set up a paper upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
with the names of those nine and fifty,
and a Title over it, <hi>The names of those men, who
to save a Traytor, would betray their Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that were thus posted up, supposing it to
be done or caused by some of their House, were
much provoked at it, many of them growing by
degrees dis-affected to the Parliament, (not all, for
there were among those dissenting Gentlemen very
wise and learned men) and upon that unhappy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
that fell out about a yeere after, forsooke the
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Upon the same Bill of Attainder, the Lord DIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BY
made his foresaid Speech, which by a Command
from the House (for he had printed it) was to be
burnt by the Hangman, which was the visible cause
of his deserting the Parliament, and proving so
great an Actor against it, as shall hereafter be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p>The worst consequence of all was, that the Kings
heart did upon this occasion appeare to be quite ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated
from the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:96346:55"/>For to prevent the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> death, an
escape for him out of the Tower was contrived. To
further which, and to curbe the Parliament in other
things by force of Armes, a great conspiracy was
entred into by many Gentlemen of ranke and quality.
The designe of this conspiracy had many Branches, as
shall appeare in the Narration.</p>
                  <p>The persons of chiefest note in it, were Master
HENRY PERCY, brother to the Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
Master HENRY JERMIN, the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of the Queene, to whom he was Master of
the horse, Master GORING, eldest Sonne to the
Lord GORING, Master WILMOT, eldest Sonne to
the Lord WILMOT, Colonell ASHBURNHAM,
Captaine POLLARD, Sir JOHN SUCKLING,
ONEALE an Irish man and a Papist, with divers
others of a more inferiour ranke, such as were privy
but to some part of the designe: For it seemes their
Counsells were divided, and they not all guilty of
the same things, as by their severall Examinations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath appeared.</p>
                  <p>But that which grieved the hearts of honest men,
and made them almost despaire of that happinesse
which was before hoped for by this Parliament, was,
That they discovered the King himself to be privy
to this conspiracy against them; which was plainly
testified by Colonell <hi>Gorings</hi> examination; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by a Letter Written by Master PERCY to his
Brother the Earle of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> where he names
the Kings discourses with him, and the desire which
the King had to joyne such as he thought fit with
them.</p>
                  <p>The Conspirators had taken an Oath of secrecy
among themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Report made in Parliament from Committees
after the Examination of severall Gentlemen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this conspiracy, discovered many branches of
their designe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:96346:56"/>One was concerning the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> That
Soulders should have been put into it. For sir JOHN
SUC<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>LING, and some others of the Conspirators,
under pretence of raising Forces for the <hi>Portugall,</hi>
had gathered men in <hi>London,</hi> who were to possesse
themselves of the Tower.</p>
                  <p>The Lieutenant, Sir WILLIAM BALFORE,
was commanded by the King himselfe to admit those
Souldiers into the Tower. But he perceiving that it
was a Plot to let the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> escape, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
that Command of the Kings, as appeared
by his Examination.</p>
                  <p>In which is likewise specified, that the Earle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
2000. <hi>l.</hi> in Marriage with his daughter to the
Laeutenants Sonne, if he would consent to the Earles
escape.</p>
                  <p>Another branch, and that the chiefe of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
was to bring up the English Army, which
was in the North, as yet undisbanded, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it against the Parliament, to awe the Houses
in diver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> things concerning the Kings Prerogative
and maintaining Episcopacy, as Master PERCY sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in the forementioned Letter.</p>
                  <p>To joyne with these Forces, and strengthen the
Plot, a French Army was to be landed at <hi>Poris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
and that Towne for the same purpose was
to be put into Master JERMINS hands.</p>
                  <p>The Irish Army, consisting of eight thousand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Papists, when the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> had
escaped out of the Tower, was to be brought over
under his conduct, and engaged in the same
Service.</p>
                  <p>All these things were confessed upon severall Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament were most grieved to finde the
King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arre in it; and then re-called to minde,
how His Majesty on the 28. of <hi>Aprill</hi> before, had
told the Houses, That he could not allow of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96346:56"/>
disbanding of the Irish Army for divers reasons best
knowne to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The Conspiracy being in some part detected,
PERCY, JERMYN, and SUCKLING fled the day
before they should have been examined, being the
sixth of <hi>May,</hi> and passed into <hi>France,</hi> where SUCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING
not long after dyed.</p>
                  <p>But afterwards, upon the reading of a Letter in
the House upon the 14. of <hi>Iune,</hi> sent by Master PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CY
out of <hi>France</hi> to his Brother the Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
WILMOT, ASHBURNNAM, and POL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARD,
(three Members of the House of Commons,
mentioned in that Letter, as privy to this Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
were commanded to withdraw, and then called
in severally, examined, and committed, WILMOT
to the Tower, ASHBURNHAM to the Kings Bench,
and POLLARD to the <hi>Gate-House;</hi> from whence they
were not long after released upon Bayle, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found guilty, not in so high a degree as others
were.</p>
                  <p>GORING, upon his Examination, dealt so cleerly
with them, and so farre purged himselfe from evill
intentions, that he was not at all committed by the
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>ONEALE, who proved most guilty of that part
of the Conspiracy, for bringing up the English Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against the Parliament, was presently after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
and committed to the Tower, whence
it was generally thought he would be brought to
Tryall for his life, and suffer; but he made an
escape.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament considering what great disturbance
they began to finde in setling the State, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
had been on foot; and doubtfull of the
Kings sincere affection towards them; considering
also what great disbursements of money were to be
made for payment of two Armies, and other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<hi>for setling the State,</hi> to which purpose money
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96346:57"/>
was to be borrowed upon the Publike Faith; by a
joint consent of both Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, moved the King to
signe a Bill for continuance of this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That it should never be dissolved till both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
did consent, and agree that publike grievances were
fully redrest.</p>
                  <p>A Bill was drawne up to that purpose, and the
King, the same day that he signed the Bill for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> being the 10. of
<hi>May,</hi> 1641. signed that also for continuance of the
present Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But in this place it is sit to insert what had past
before in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>The King upon the 15. of <hi>February</hi> before, had
signed a Bill, presented to him by both Houses, for a
Parliament to be held in <hi>England</hi> every third yeare;
That the Lord Keeper, and Chancellor of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
for the time being, should be sworne to issue
forth the Writs, and upon default to lose their
places.</p>
                  <p>The same day in the afternoone there was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene the two Houses, to returne the
King thankes; upon which it was concluded that the
whole House should go to the King to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
and that the Lord Keeper, in the name of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
should returne their thankfulnesse to his Majesty,
which was accordingly done.</p>
                  <p>Expressions of joy, by Order from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were that night made about <hi>London,</hi> with
ringing of Bells, making of Bonesires, with such
usuall things.</p>
                  <p>It is observable in the course of Histories, how
much Kings in such limited Monarchies as that of
<hi>England,</hi> do in time by degrees gaine upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Rights and Priviledges. That those things, which
by constitution of the Government, the people may
challenge as due from the Prince, having been long
forborne, become at last to be esteemed such Acts
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96346:57"/>
of extraordinary grace, as that the Prince is highly
thanked for granting of them.</p>
                  <p>Such was the case of this Trienniall Parliament, as
both Houses afterward, when the unhappy division
began, and the King upbraided them with this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
could plainly answer, That it was not so much
as by Law they might require, there being two
Statutes then in force, for a Parliament once a
yeere.</p>
                  <p>The King himselfe also at the time when he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Trienniall Parliament, could not forbeare
to tell them, That he put an obligation upon them
in doing it, which they had scarse deserved.</p>
                  <p>For hitherto <hi>(said he)</hi> to speake freely, I have had
no great incouragement to grant it, if I should looke to
the outward face of your actions or proceedings, and not
to the inward intentions of your hearts, I might make
question of doing it.</p>
                  <p>But that Grant which the King since passed upon
the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> for continuance of the present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
not onely afterward by himselfe was much
upbraided to them, but by many Gentlemen, who
were not well affected to their Parliament, and all
the Faction of Prelaticall Clergy, in their ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
was censured a greater grace then was fit for
the King to grant.</p>
                  <p>To such men, their discourses and writings, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when the great distraction happened, and the
Warre was breaking out, the Parliament in many
of their Declarations answered:</p>
                  <p>That though there were in it some seeming restraint of
the Regall Power in dissolving Parliaments; yet really it
was no taking that Power from the Crowne, but sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending
the execution of it for this time and occasion only.
Which was so necessary for the Publike Peace, that
without it they could not have undertaken any of those
great Charges; but must have left both the Armies to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and confusion, and the whole Kingdome to blood and
ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:96346:58"/>For to pay the Armies, and defray other necessary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
money was to be borrowed upon the Publike Faith;
which had been nothing worth, if that Parliament could
have been dissolved at the Kings pleasure.</p>
                  <p>And where it was objected, That no King ever
granted the like before; they answered, It was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that no King before ever made so great a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for a Parliament to require it. And besides that, in
the constitution of <hi>Englands</hi> Government, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the meaning of the Law-givers, that the King
should dissolve any Parliament, whilest the great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of the Kingdome were depending; and though
the King had used to do so, it was neverthelesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p>The Scots in their Remonstrance 1640. told the
King, That he had broken their Lawes in dissolving
the Parliament there, against the consent of their
House.</p>
                  <p>And it is very well understood by those that are

                  <p>It was neverthelesse probably then thought by all,
that the King would not have assented to that Act, if
at that time the freshnesse of those fore-mentioned
grievances in the peoples hearts, and the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of that odious Treason, of bringing an Army
against the Parliament, had not made it unsafe for
him to deny.</p>
                  <p>That opinion was more confirmed by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Actions, since time, and the unconstancy of some

                  <p>The Cessation of Armes, which was made before,
to expire about the end of <hi>December</hi> last, was at that
time renewed by the Parliament for a Moneth longer;
who presently after tooke it into consideration, that
the Scots should be satisfied for all their charges they
had been at, and losses sustained since that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Warre that the King had raised against them.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>February</hi> following, after a serious debate
concerning that businesse, the necessities of the Scots
being well weighed, and their demands considered,
it was not onely agreed that their Ships, taken since
that Warre, should be restored, and 4000. <hi>l.</hi> in
ready money given to them to rigge those Ships;
but for the maine of all, it was resolved upon by both
Houses, to give the full summe of 300000. <hi>l.</hi> in these
words expressed, <hi>Towards a supply of the losses and
necessities of our Brethren of Scotland;</hi> and that the
Parliament would in due time take into consideration
the manner of raising, and daies of payment.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Scottish Commissioners three daies
after returned thankfulnesse to the Parliament, not
onely for that great summe of 300000. <hi>l.</hi> but for the
stile of Brethren which they had given them.</p>
                  <p>And the same weeke, to continue, and further
strengthen the amity of both Nations, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> Ordained that all Books, Libels,
and Proclamations against the Scots, should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in; and a thanksgiving to God should be in all
Churches thorow <hi>England,</hi> for the happy conclusion
of that peace.</p>
                  <p>But before the time came that the Parliament, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with so many great and weighty Affaires, could
have leisure to consider and fully determine the times
for payment of that great summe to the Scots (which
was not till the 19. day of the following <hi>Iune,</hi> when
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96346:59"/>
it was concluded, that they should receive 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
of it at Midsomer come twelve Moneth, and the
other 200000. <hi>l.</hi> at Midsomer two yeares after) the
Scots presented many Papers to the House at severall
times, for money to supply the wants of their Army,
which were friendly entertained, and considered by
the Parliament; for that Army was kept long undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded;
insomuch as about the end of the following
<hi>May,</hi> there was in Arreare due to the Scottish Army
(besides the gift of 300000 <hi>l</hi>) 120000. <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So great a charge was the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
content to be at, rather then suffer the Scots to go, till
businesses were better setled; which gave occasion to
many of the Clergy, and others not well affected to
them, not onely in discourse, but written Libels, to
taxe the Parliament, and impute it to them as a crime
of too much distrust of the King; and that they kept
a forraigne Army to awe their owne Prince.</p>
                  <p>But certaine it is, that since that time when the
forenamed Conspiracies began to breake out, the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
not well assured of the King, nor fully trusting
the English Army, were content that the Scots should
not be disbanded, untill the other were; being also
doubtfull of that Irish Army, which the King (as is
before expressed) had told them he could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
for some reasons best knowne to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Nor was that Army of Scots disbanded till <hi>August,</hi>
at the same time when the English Army was, by the
Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> appointed Generall to that purpose.
And both the Armies quietly departed, conducted
to their owne homes by Order from Justices of Peace,
through the severall Counties.</p>
                  <p>To defray so vast a charge as the payment of two
great Armies, the Parliament, besides the grant of
six Subsidies, imposed a Taxe seldome or never
knowne, which was that of the Poll-Money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the whole Kingdome were to be personally
assessed. Every Duke at 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Marquesse at 80 <hi>l.</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96346:60"/>
Earles at 60 <hi>l.</hi> Viscounts and Barons at 40 <hi>l.</hi> Knights
of the Bathe 30 <hi>l.</hi> other Knights 20 <hi>l.</hi> Esquires 10 <hi>l.</hi>
every Gentleman dispending 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> was
seized at 5 <hi>l.</hi> and all others of ability to pay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
proportion, the meanest head of the whole
Kingdome was not excused under six pence.</p>
                  <p>This Bill of Poll-Money was offered by the Houses
to the King, together with two other of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
one for putting downe the High Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Court, and the other for putting downe the
Starre-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>But the King shewed some reluctancy in that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
desiring to passe only that Bill of Poll-Money
for the present, and to deliberate about passing of
the other two. At which the House of Commons,
being certified so much by the Lords, were not well
contented, and voted that his Majesty should passe
all three, or none at all.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, the King upon the second of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> did accordingly passe the Poll-Money, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred
upon the other two. But understanding that
the matter was so ill taken, and loath, upon mature
deliberation, to displease the Kingdome at that time,
he came againe upon the following Tuesday, being
the fifth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and passed the other two, for
putting downe the High Commission and Starre-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>Many of the Courtiers, and neerest servants about
the King, were very sorry that his Majesty, seeing
that he passed those two Bills so soone after, had
not freely done it at the same time (as was desired)
together with the Poll-Money: Because it might be
thought an unwillingnesse in him, and that his heart
(which was then feared) did not perfectly concurre
with his Peoples desires: Whereby much of the
thanks, which so great a grace freely and forwardly
expressed, might have deserved, did seeme in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
lost.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:96346:60"/>
                     <hi>The King therefore at the passing of those two
Bills, told them as much, That</hi> He could not but be
sensible of those reports of discontent, which he had heard
was taken by some, for his not passing them before; and
thought it very strange, that two things of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
should be expected from him, without an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of time to consider of them: That he wondred
they could harbour any discontent, if they remembred
how much he had done this Parliament, as his granting
that the Iudges hereafter should hold their places <hi>quam
diù se benè gesserint;</hi> bounding the Forrest Lawes; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away Ship-money; establishing the Subjects proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Tonnage and Poundage; granting the Trienniall
Parliament; free Iustice against Delinquents. <hi>With
other things; Concluding graciously, That He
would omit nothing which might give them just
content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when he had signed the forenamed Bills, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a short mention of the journey which he intended
speedily to take into <hi>Scotland;</hi> he propounded to
them a thing very acceptable, concerning his Nephew
the Prince Elector Palatine, that he could not but (at
the desire of that Prince) send an Ambassadour to
assist him at the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and fearing that he should not receive so good
an Answer, as might in justice be expected. For the
better countenancing that businesse, he intended to
publish a <hi>Manifesto</hi> in his owne name, but would not
do it but by consent and advice of Parliament; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which he conceived it would be a thing of no
validity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which Manifesto</hi> was afterwards made by the full
consent of both Houses, and Sir THOMAS ROE, a
Member of the House, and a Gentleman of great
abilities, was sent to the Emperour at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> about
it, but without any good successe.</p>
                  <p>At the same time the Queene Mother of <hi>France,</hi>
as was before desired by the Parliament, was to take
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96346:61"/>
her leave of <hi>England.</hi> The King consented to her
departure; but Money wanting for the Provision of
her Journey, the Parliament allotted ten thousand
pounds to her, out of the Poll-Money. This great
Lady had arrived in <hi>England</hi> almost three yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and so long been entertained by the King, her
Sonne in Law, with great respect, and an allowance
answerable to support her State, 100. <hi>l. per diem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was her mis-fortune, (how farre her crime I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell) that during her abode here, the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were imbroyled in
great troubles; which the People were apt to impute
in some measure to her counsels, knowing what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
the Queene her Daughter had with the King.</p>
                  <p>Others taxed her not at all, but looked upon other
causes, the same counsells, which long before her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall
had distempered <hi>England;</hi> but the people made
their judgement upon it, from her actions or successes
in other places.</p>
                  <p>But however it were, the Queene was fearefull of
the people here, and had not long before desired to
have a guard allowed her, pretending feare of her
life, by reason of some attempts, which she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
made against her; upon which a Guard was
set about her house.</p>
                  <p>Her Regency in <hi>France</hi> had not beene happy, nor
according to the interest of that Kingdome; though
that, perchance, may be accounted a fault not so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to her, as commonly incident to the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Queene Mothers in that Land: In so much as
THUANUS commends the saying of CHARLES
the ninth (a Prince whom otherwise he doth not
praise) upon his death bed, <hi>That since he must dye at
that age,</hi> (being foure and twenty) <hi>he thanked God
he had no Sonne, least</hi> France <hi>should fall under a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
of which he had found the sad effects.</hi> His
Mother was KATHERINE DE MEDICIS
of the same Family with this Queene.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:96346:61"/>After the time of her Regency, her actions had
been such, that the King her Sonne would not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
her in his owne Kingdome; nor was she wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
into the Territories of her Sonne in Law the
King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But the people there were no lesse
desirous of her departure, then afterward in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Insomuch as she became a strange example of the
instability of humane fortunes, that so great a Queen,
and Mother to so many mighty Princes, should want
a quiet Harbour for her age.</p>
                  <p>Not long after her departure from <hi>England,</hi> she
died at <hi>Culleine,</hi> and might seeme a parallel in some
things, to the same Empresse, who founded that City,
and there planted a Roman Colony, AGRIPINA,
wife to CLAUDIUS CESAR, and Mother to NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RO.
They both had tasted of power, been active in
it, but not pleasing to the people. They were both
taught, that the greatnesse of their Sonnes, was not
so much advantage to their Power, as they had hoped;
and had learned, that all power dependent upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is of small validity, and lesse stability; as TACI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS
observes, speaking of the same AGRIPINA,
<hi>Nihil rerum mortalium tam instabile, &amp; fluxum est, quam
fama potentiae non sua vi nixa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About two Moneths before the departure of this
Queene, the Princesse MARY, eldest daughter to
the King, not yet ten yeares of age, was married
with great triumph at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to the young Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> WILLIAM; Bishop WRENNE, being
then Deane of the Kings Chappell, performed the
solemnity on Sunday the second of <hi>May,</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>The Marriage had been before debated of in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and consented to; The King himselfe upon
the ninth of <hi>February</hi> having declared to the Lords
what large Propositions the Ambassadours of the
States had made to him upon that purpose.</p>
                  <p>The people in generall were pleased with this
Marriage, and glad the King had chosen out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96346:62"/>
Prince, and servant to a State, which had
beene long confederate with <hi>England,</hi> and whose
interest carried them the same way, Professors of
the same Religion, and in that kinde of Discipline,
to which the greatest part of Parliament and People
were inclined; and hoped (though at that time it was
not so fully declared as afterward) to reforme the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to, as that of <hi>Scotland</hi> already
was. By this Match of the Kings owne chusing, they
began to hope that the Spanish Faction in Court was
not now at all prevalent, but that things might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be carried according to the right English way.</p>
                  <p>In this hope they were the more confirmed, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parliament go on without any opposition
from the King, no dissention having yet happened,
nor likely to happen, as they conceived; for that
Conspiracy of bringing up the Army against the
Parliament, which we touched before, was not yet
discovered, nor at all thought of, though within
few daies after it broke out.</p>
                  <p>But some there were, who suspended their joy,
and were not much confident that this Marriage
would bring happinesse to <hi>England,</hi> unlesse the King
were perfectly right with his People, and wished the
same thing they did; considering at one side the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that he might
be ambitious of more then was due to him; and for
that reason ingage himselfe in a reciprocall way for
the King against his People, if occasion served.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, they considered the States as
Polititians of this world, and men who had other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
then that of Religion; and if dissention should
in <hi>England</hi> happen, betweene Prince and People
(which was never but feared in some degree) might
be apt to side with the King against the just freedome
of the Subject; which must needs depresse the
strength of <hi>England,</hi> and keepe it from so much
greatnesse, as might ecclipse their owne; the King
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96346:62"/>
of <hi>Spaine</hi> being now weake, and no such feare from
him, as might inforce them to need <hi>Englands</hi> strength
as heretofore.</p>
                  <p>But the Parliament about the beginning of this <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
were busied in such a multiplicity of Affaires,
which by severall Committees they daily did, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the reformation of domesticall abuses, that
it were an endlesse, and indeed an improper thing
for an Historian to describe them all: The Records
will at large satisfie those that are curious in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
onely some of the chiefe I will briefly touch
which happened before the King went into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the fifth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1641. the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for that purpose, made their report to the
House of Commons, of the Charge against MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEW
WRENNE Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> whose Accusation
was before mentioned, consisting of many Articles;
which all tended to the introducing of Superstition,
and too neare approaches to the Roman Religion, as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hose Articles will declare.</p>
                  <p>After some time spent in debate upon the Articles,
it was resolved upon the question, and voted, That
it was the opinion of the House, That Bishop
WRENNE was unworthy and unfit to hold or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
any Office or Dignity in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
And further voted, That there be a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
sent to the Lords, to desire them to joyne with
the Commons, in petitioning His Majesty to remove
the said Bishop both from his Person and Service.</p>
                  <p>About the same time also the Charges against
those Judges before mentioned, who gave their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudiciall
opinions for leavying of Ship-money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
five in number, Judge BRAMSTON, Baron
TREVER, Baron WESTON, Baron DAVENPORT,
Judge CRAWLEY, were read in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and severall Members appointed to present
those particular Charges against every Judge, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96346:63"/>
they all did, making large Speeches in aggravation
of their Crimes: Against Judge BERKLEY there
was a higher Charge, so great as amounted to High
Treason.</p>
                  <p>The King was now wholly intent upon his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he determined to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tenth of <hi>August,</hi> to which both Houses had
once agreed; but afterwards upon mature considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
desired the King to deferre it fourteene daies
longer for divers reasons.</p>
                  <p>That the distempers of the Kingdome were such,
as could not well be composed, unlesse His Majesty
would stay the desired time, there being many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affaires to be taken into consideration, and no
course yet set downe for the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in his absence.</p>
                  <p>The King, notwithstanding their often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pressing this suit, was stedfast to the first day,
alleadging that the affaires of <hi>Scotland</hi> did necessarily
require his presennce there at that time, and that he
would passe any thing of just concerne before he
went, and that he had to the same purpose many
times desired them to hasten their businesses for him
before such a time.</p>
                  <p>The King accordingly upon the tenth of <hi>August</hi>
departed out of <hi>London</hi> toward <hi>Scotland;</hi> but the
same day before he tooke his journey, coming to the
Lords House, he passed divers Bills which the Houses
had prepared for him; some concerning the publike,
as the Bill for Knighthood, the Bill for free making
of Gunpowder and Saltpeter; and others concerning
the Estates and affaires of private men.</p>
                  <p>He likewise signed the Commission for passing of
Bills in his absence; the Commissioners appointed
were the Lord Keeper, the Lord Privy Seale, the
Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> Marquesse

in case of necessity.</p>
                  <p>But to another request, which both Houses had
made to him the day before, which was, That the
Earle of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> might be made Lord Steward, in
the Earle of <hi>Arundels</hi> place, during his absence, (for
the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> was then going over with the
Queene Mother) and that the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi>
might be appointed Lord Treasurer; he said he
would take further time to consider of it.</p>
                  <p>By this time many jealousies began to arise in the
hearts of people, many divisions, and differences of
opinions, concerning the Parliament, which being
by degrees formented by such persons as were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to it, by reason of their owne losses, and
particular interests, whose number could not be
small, did fatally prepare the way to that misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confusion which after followed.</p>
                  <p>Bishops had been much listed at, though not yet
taken away, whereby a great party whose livelihood
and fortunes depended on them, and farre more,
whose hopes of preferment looked that way; most
of the Clergy, and both the Universities, began to
be daily more dis-affected to the Parliament; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that all rewards of learning would be taken
away, which wrought deeply in the hearts of the
young, and most ambitious of that Coat.</p>
                  <p>Another thing which seemed to trouble some,
who were not bad men, was that extreame License,
which the Common People, almost from the very
beginning of the Parliament, tooke to themselves, of
reforming, without Authority, Order, or decency,
rudely disturbing Church-Service, whilest the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer
was reading, tearing those Bookes, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,
and such things: which the parliament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too much busied in variety of affaires, of (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96346:64"/>
too much) fearing the losse of a considerable
Party, whom they might have need of against a reall
and potent Enemy, did not so farre restraine as was
expected, or desired by those men.</p>
                  <p>To this were added those daily reports of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Conventicles, and preachings made by Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and illitterate people of the lowest ranke, to
the scandall and offence of many: Which some in a
merry way would put off, considering the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
times, that these Tradesmen did but take up
that which Prelates and the great Doctors had let fall,
preaching the Gospell; That it was but a reciprocall
invasion of each other callings, that Chandlers, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Weavers, and such like preached, when the
Archbishop himselfe, instead of preaching, was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
busied in Projects about Leather Salt, Sope, and
such commodities as belonged to those Tradesmen.</p>
                  <p>Many people by degrees grew dis-affected to the
Parliament, being daily poysoned by the discourses
of the friends, kindred, and retainers to so many
great Delinquents, as must needs feare such a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
who, though they be no considerable party,
in respect of the whole Common-wealth; yet ply
their particular interests, with more eagernesse then
most do the publike.</p>
                  <p>Some are taken off by time and their owne incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
when they have looked for quicker redresse
of grievances, then the great concurrence of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
weighty businesses (in a long discontinued and
reforming Parliament) can possibly admit, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
soever they be, distracted with so great a
variety; those people, after some time spent, grew
weary againe of what before they had so long wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
to see; not considering that a Prince, if he be
averse from such a Parliament, can finde power
enough to retard their proceedings, and keepe off
for a long time the cure of State; when that happens,
the people tired with expectation of such a cure, do
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96346:64"/>
usually by degrees forget the sharpnesse of those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
which before required it; or else in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of many and long disorders, and to secure
them for the future, there being for the most part a
necessity of laying heavy Taxes, and draining of
much Money from the people, they grow extreamly
sensible of that present smart, feeling more paine by
the Cure for a time, then they did by the lingring
disease before, not considering that the causes of all
which they now indure, were precedent, and their
present suffering is for their future security.</p>
                  <p>It was the generall opinion of all Gentlemen at that
time, That a Parliament so much and long desired, as
this was, after so great and constant a violation of
the Lawes and Liberties of <hi>England</hi> in the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Government, could scarce in possibility ever
grow into the dislike of the people, or at least so great
a part of the people, as might be able (which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one yeare was after seene) to make a Warre against
it, and indanger the utter ruine and subversion of it.
But I have spoken before of some causes, which
might seeme strong enough to ingage a part of the
people against the Parliament; whose particular in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terests
and livelihoods were neerely touched; how
farre any proceeding might distaste others, who
were uninterested in their private fortunes or callings,
I cannot tell any certaine reason: But I remember
within the compasse of a yeare after, when this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Warre began to breake out over all the Kingdom,
and men in all companies began to vent their opinions
in an argumentative way, either opposing or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Parliament Cause; and Treatises were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on both sides: Many Gentlemen who forsooke
the Parliament, were very bitter against it for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in Religion, in countenancing, or not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing,
the rudenesse of people in Churches (which
I related before) acting those things which seemed
to be against the Discipline of the English Church,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96346:65"/>
and might introduce all kindes of Sects and Schismes.
Neither did those of the Parliament side agree in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning that point; some said it was wisely
done of the Parliament, not to proceed against any
such persons, for feare of losing a considerable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as is said before. Others thought and said, That
by so doing they would lose a farre more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
party of Gentlemen, then could be gained of
the other. They also affirmed, That Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
having been so much violated by the King,
if the Parliament had not so farre drawne Religion
also into their cause, it might have sped better; for
the Parliament frequently at that time, in all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
whensoever they charged the corrupt States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of injustice and Tyranny, would put Popery,
or a suspition of it, into the first place against them.
I remember, when the Warre was begun, among those
little Treatises, which were then published, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there were without any names to them, I found
one, in which the case is thus expressed, to recite
the words of it. <hi>Perchance</hi> (saith he) <hi>too much insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Religion, and taxing the King for affecting
Popery, hath by accident weakened the Parliament, and
brought Parties to the King. It may seeme a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox
that the best and onely necessary of all things, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
being added into the scale of Lawes and Liberties,
should make the scale lighter then before. Neither can it
be true but by accident; as thus: The strange intercourse
betwixt</hi> Rome <hi>and the English Court; The Kings owne
Letters to the Pope; His favouring of Priests, and such
things; though they may give a State just cause of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition,
that their Religion is undermining: Yet because
it cannot be so absolutely proved to the sight of all the
people, that the King favoured Popery, as that he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdome; which
latter was visible to all; the former, concerning Religion,
remaines in the peoples reason, as a controverted que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
(the King still protesting for Religion) and the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96346:65"/>
disputes about that amusing the People, make them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
forget that crime of the Kings, which was without
controversie, and evident, the violation of Lawes and
Liberties: And more then so; for some supposing that
the Parliament unjustly taxed him in Religion, did in
time believe, that he was not so guilty of the other, as they
would make him; which I have heard some of late main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
From whence may follow a strange conclusion;
That the Kings dealing so much with</hi> Rome, <hi>to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of the Protestant Religion, should now turne
to his owne advantage in a Protestant Kingdome. And
we may make this as paradoxicall a supposition, That if
the King had never done any thing prejudiciall to the
Protestant Religion, he would have found fewer Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
this Parliament to take his part. For then, there
being no dispute at all about Religion, the crimes of his
State mis-government had plainly and inexcusably appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to all; as we have seene that some of our former
Kings, for the like violation of Lawes and Liberties,
when there was but one Religion, and therefore no dispute
about it, have been heavily censured in Parliament, no
man appearing in their justification. And why should not
a Parliament thinke that such things are cause enough to
be stood upon, and to justifie their quarrell before God?
as if the Almighty did not adhorre Injustice, Oppression,
Tyranny, and the like, in any Kingdome, unlesse the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion were also depraved. Nay, he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it more in that place where the purest profession of
Religion is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, that frequent naming of Religion, as if it
were the onely quarrell, hath caused a great mistake of
the question in some, by reason of ignorance, in others
of subtilty; whilest they wilfully mistake, to abuse the
Parliaments Cause, writing whole Volumes in a wrong
stated case; as, instead of disputing whether the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> lawfully assembled, where the King vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
is, may by Armes defend the Religion established
by the same power, together with the Lawes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96346:66"/>
of the Nation, against Delinquents, detaining with
them the Kings seduced Person: They make it the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether Subjects, taken in a generall notion, may
make Warre against their King for Religions sake?</p>
                  <p>Such was the sense of many Gentlemen at that
time, which adhered to the Parliament. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the Narration.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament had been of late sensible of the
losse of some from them, and having detected divers
Conspiracies and Machinations of dis-affected people
against them, and fearing more, had in <hi>May</hi> last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a Protestation, which was solemnly taken by
all the Members of both Houses, and sent thorow
<hi>England</hi> to be taken by the people; the forme of it
was in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> A.B. in the presence of Almighty God, promise, vow,

will maintaine and defend his Majesties Royall Person,
Honour and Estate, as also the Power and Priviledge
of Parliaments, the lawfull Rights and Liberties of the
Subjects, and every Person that shall make this Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in whatsoever he shall do in the lawfull pursuance
of the same; and to my power, as farre as lawfully I
may, I will oppose, and by all good waies and means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to bring condigne punishment on all such as shall by
force, practise, counsels, plots, conspiracies or otherwise,
do any thing to the contrary, in this present Protestation
contained: And further, That I shall in all just and
honourable waies, indeavour to preserve the union and
peace betwixt the three Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and neither for hope, feare, or any other
respects, shall relinquish this Promise, Vow, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station.</p>

It were not amisse in this place briefly to mention
some alterations, which had been made before the
time that the King tooke his journey into <hi>Scotland;</hi>
though they were not done immediately about that
time, but some weekes or Moneths before, because
they concerne some Noble men, of whom we shall

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE businesse of <hi>England</hi> by this absence
of the King was at a great stand. In
such a concurrence of high affairs &amp; so
great an expectation to find redress of
pressing Grievances, nothing was so irksome to the
People as delay. To retard the cure, was little
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96346:68"/>
better then to destroy. And the Sequel within a
short time, proved worse, then the wisest men could
imagine, or the most jealous possibly suspect;
though jealousies and fears were then grown to a
great height, &amp; the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> less then
ever, assured of the Kings real affection to them.
Nothing of State was transacted in Parliament, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Kings absence. Some debates there were
only about Church-service, and alterations to be
made in the Book of Common-prayer, in which
notwithstanding nothing was concluded. One
businesse only came to be discussed; of which the
King himself gave occasion; who within few daies
after his arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> signified by a Letter to
the Lords, That he was engaged to the Spaniard
by promise to let him have four thousand souldiers
out of that lately disbanded Irish Army, which the
Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> had before raised; his desire was
to make good his promise by consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the House of Commons whom the
Lords had invited to a Conference for that purpose,
would not consent that any Irish should go to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Spaniard; some reasons were then given, but
more particular cause was shewed about ten daies
after, when a second Letter came from the King, in
which his Majesty declared, That the Spanish
Ambassador claimed his promise, from which in
honor he could not recede. Notwithstanding
since he had found that Ambassador so reasonable,
as that he was content to accept of two thousand;
he hoped the Parliamnnt would not deny that.
The House took it into consideration; and within
two dayes, the Lord of FAWKLAND a Member of the
House of Commons at a conference delivered to
the Lords, gave reasons in the name of that House,
why it was very unfit to grant the Kings desire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Spaniard was not only an Ally, &amp; confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
but an assistant to the Emperor against the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96346:68"/>
Prince Elector, his Majesties Nephew; who by
the power and oppression of that Emperor had bin
long deprived of his inheritance; And at this
time, when the King had published a Manifesto in
behalf of his Nephew, and to that purpose sent an
Ambassador to the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> it would
seem a contradiction in the King to assist the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the said Prince Elector, and a drawing of
his own Sword against himself: besides the great
prejudice it must needs bring to the Protestant
cause, which this present Parliament so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and laboured to promote. Upon these
reasons it was thought fit not to consent to the
Kings desire in that point. And immediately the
two Houses of Parliament rejourned themselves
from that day, being the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> till
the twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> and appointed a standing
Committee of fifty Members during that recesse.</p>
                  <p>Before the Accesse and meeting again of the
Parliament, Letters came from the English Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were read before that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Committee of <hi>Westminster,</hi> importing the
discovery of a Treasonable plot against the lives of
Marquesse HAMILTON, and others, the greatest
Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>res of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the conspirators being the
Earle of <hi>Crayford,</hi> and some others. How it was
discovered, or how prevented, or whether the King
had any privity to it (though one of that country
have since written very plainly charging the King
with it) because the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> were very
silent in it, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> took the lesse
notice of it: Only the standing Committee, for
avoiding the like attempts at <hi>London,</hi> and fearing
that such might flow from the same spring, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
strong guards to be placed in many parts of the
City, till further directions might be given from
the two Houses at their Accesse. The malignancy,
which at that time began to appear in people,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96346:69"/>
of that condition and quality, which wee before
mentioned, and was not only expressed in usual
discourse among their companions, but vented in
scurrilous and bitter Libels against those Lords and
Commons, who were generally reputed the most
Sedulous for the common-wealth, was cause suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to increase the feares and jealousies of the
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But that fatall fire, which so sadly wasted the
three Kingdoms, broke out there, where it was
least feared; and those that seemed most secure,
were the first sufferers. About the end of <hi>October</hi>
1641 during the Kings abode in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the most
barbarous and bloudy Rebellion that ever any age,
or Nation were guilty of, broke out in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
The atrocity of it is without a paralell, and as full
of wonder was the close carriage of so black and
far-reaching a Designe. The innocent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
were upon a suddain disseised of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
and the persons of above two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, women, and children murthered, many
of them with exquisite and unheard of tortures,
within the space of one month.</p>
                  <p>That which increased the amazement of most
men, was, The consideration that the ancient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
which the Irish (a thing incident to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Nations) had borne to the English, did now
seeme to be quite buried and forgotten; forty years
of peace had compacted those two Nations into one
body, and cemented them together by all conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of alliance, intermarriages, and consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which was in outward appearance strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by frequent entertainments, and all kinds of
friendly neighbourhood. There seemed in many
places a mutuall transmigration (as was observed by
a noble Gentleman,<note place="margin">Sir Ioh. Temple.</note> whose place in that Kingdom
gave him means to know it, out of whose faithfull
relation of that Rebellion and Massacre, I have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96346:69"/>
partly collected my discourse of it) into each others
manners. <hi>Many English strangely degenerating into the
Irish manners &amp; customers; and many Irish, especially of
the better sort, having taken up the English language,
apparel, and decency of living in their private houses.</hi>
The present Government was full of lenity and
moderation; and some redresse of former grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
had then been newly granted by the King
to his Irish subjects; The same Gentleman in his
History of the Irish Rebellion (where the Reader
may more fully enforme himself of particulars) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that he could never hear of any one English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that received any certain notice of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
till that very evening before which it was
to be put in execution. Some intimations had
been given by Sir WILLIAM COLE in a Letter to
the Lords Justices Sir WILLIAM PARSONS, and
Sir JOHN BURLACE, with the rest of the Councell,
concerning dangerous resorts, and meetings of
some persons who were judged fit instruments
for such a mischief.</p>
                  <p>This horrid plot contrived with so much secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was to take effect upon the 23 of <hi>October.</hi> The
Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the chief strength of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and principall Magazine of the Kings
Armes and Ammunition, where all those Armes
which were taken from the late disbanded Irish
Army, and others which the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> had
provided, were deposited, was to be seized by nine
of the clock that day by the Rebels; to which
purpose many of the Irish Gentry of great quality
were the night before come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to be in
readinesse for the performing of that exploit. It
was further agreed among those conspirators, that
upon the same day, all other his Majesties Forts
and Magazines of Armes and Ammunition in that
Kingdom should be surprized, and all Protestants
and English that would not joyn with them, should
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96346:70"/>
be cut off. But it pleased God to prevent the sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that Castle, and so to save the Kingdom
from being wholly lost in one day, and that by a
means strange and unexpected. HUGH MAC MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HON
Esquire, grand-son to the famous Rebel TY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RONE,
a Gentleman of a plentifull fortune in the
county of <hi>Monagan,</hi> and one that had served in
Armes under the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as Leiutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
a principal Agent in this Rebellion, and
coming with others (as aforesaid) into <hi>Dublin</hi>
the day before that great Designe was to be put in
execution, being the 22 of <hi>October,</hi> admitted into
his company at a Tavern in that City, one OWEN
CONALLY, of Irish extract, but a protestant, and
servant to Sir JOHN CLOTWORTHY a Member of
the English Parliament. To this OWEN he revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
so much, as they were drinking, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man escaping from him, though not without
great danger to himself, at the present, informed
the Lord Justice PARSONS that night about nine of
the clock, of a dangerous Designe upon the whole
Kingdom; which being taken into present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
MAC MAHON was apprehended, and
after his examination, the Lord MAQUIRE also,
another principal actor; who were both commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to close custody, and the Castle secured with
all diligence. But many conspirators of great
note escaped that night out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as
BIRNE, MORE, PLUNKET, and others.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of the Counsel, amazed at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of so horrid a Treason, did notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
endeavour (since there was no prevention;
for MAC MAHON had plainly told them, when
he was examined, that by that time all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Ireland</hi> were risen) to use the best remedies
to that desperate disease; and hoping that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
the news how the plot for seizing of <hi>Dublin</hi>
castle was disappointed, might somewhat dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96346:70"/>
the conspirators in remote parts, and encourage
the good Subjects, with more confidence to stand
upon their guard; issued forth a Proclamation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
and by carefull messengers spread it into as
many parts of the Kingdom as they could. The
effect of which proclamation was to signifie the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Treason, and exhort all men to their
duty in suppressing of it.</p>
                  <p>But the generall Designe was past prevention;
and that very day came in some poor English
protestants, and others in a short time, every day,
and almost every hour; shewing how they had
been robbed, their houses surprised by the Rebels,
whose outrage daily increased in rapine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
and fireing Towns and Villages in divers
counties. To oppose therefore the growth of
that desperate malady, the Lord Justices (dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
Letters to the King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the
Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> lately made Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the King, and yet resident at <hi>London,</hi> of
their lamentable condition) examined with all
diligence how they were provided for such a War.
They found in <hi>Dublin</hi> Stores, Armes for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
with Artillery, Powder, Match and Lead
proportionable, laid in by the late Earle of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
though designed by him another way, yet
reserved by Gods providence for this service. But
the Officers and souldiers of the old standing army
were so much dispersed into remote places of the
Kingdom for the guard of other Forts; that there
was scarse any possibility of drawing a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
company together to defend <hi>Dublin,</hi> or make
head against the Rebels in the North. The
greatest mischeif to the State, and advantage to
the Rebels, was, That there was no Money in the
Exchequer; besides, the Kings Revenues, and
Rents of English Gentlemen due for that halfe
year, were either in Tenants, or Collectors hands
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96346:71"/>
in the country, and must unadvoidablly fall into
the Rebels power; so that although their disease
were present, the only means of cure was remote,
which was a dependence upon some supplies from
the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the very day designed for surprisall of
the Castle at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
Rebels broke out in the Province of <hi>Vlster,</hi>
and in few dayes got possession of so many Towns,
Forts, and Gentlemens Houses, within the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of that Province, as might seeme almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
if we consider only the cheif actors, men
of no great skill in Martiall affairs, or any policy:
such as Sir PHELIM ONEALE, and his Brother,
with the rest; and not rather (which indeed was
the true reason) the generall engagements of the
Irish, and their deep dissimulation, concurring
with the great credulity of the English, upon the
causes aforementioned, of so long intermixed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation,
and friendly Relations betwixt them.
Both these were the causes which afterward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
the Massacre of the English, who when the
fire brake out, implored the friendship of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
neighbors, Landlords, or Tenants; commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into their hands and protection their treasure,
wives and children, with all that was dear unto
them, in hope that former friendship might prevail.
But they generally either betrayed them into the
power of other Rebels, or perfidiously, and cruelly
murdered them with their own hands: which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
falshood, and cruelty in the Irish was thought
to be much encreased by the charmings of their
Priests, who told them, That it was a mortall
sin to protect, or releive any of the English.</p>
                  <p>That intermixture of the Nations, did also at
this sad time, make the English lesse able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves, then if they had lived singly by
parties of their own. For where the English were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96346:71"/>
able to make any head, or stand upon their guard
(though in such an amazement and suddain surprisal)
they defended themselves beyond beleif, till the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
(principled by their Preists) offered them fair
Quarter; with assurance of lives and goods, safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and free passage to what places they pleased;
confirming such covenants with deep oathes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
and sometimes their hands and Seales.
But when they had the deceived English in their
power; the Souldiers spoiled, stripped, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them at their pleasure. So were many served,
as at <hi>Armagh</hi> by Sir PHELIM ONEALE, and his
Brother; at <hi>Belterbert</hi> by PHILIP ORELLEY;
at <hi>Longford, Tullough,</hi> and other Castles in the
County of <hi>Fermanagh</hi> by other of those Rebels. But
if the English, who stood to defend their private
houses, and so were the more easily cut off, could
have deserted their habitations at the first rising, and
joyned themselves into bodies, they might happily
have made a better resistance. Whilest these inhumane
cruelties and Massacres were acting in miserable <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and daily spreading themselves in every part
of that Kingdom; many Counties in several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
declaring themselves, and following the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
example of those in <hi>Vlster;</hi> the sad newes
was brought to the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Letters, which before were mentioned,
sent from the Lords Justices upon the 25 of <hi>October,</hi>
were carried, and delivered at <hi>London</hi> on the last
day of that month by OWEN Ô CONALLY the
happy discoverer of the first Plot; with a full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of all particulars within his knowledge: which
by the Lords, who were first acquainted with it,
was delivered at a Conference to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
who presently ordered, <hi>That the House forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
should be resolved into a Committe, to consider the
matter offered concerning the Rebellion in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as
likewise to provide for the safety of</hi> England. By
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96346:72"/>
which Committee it was agreed that 50000 pound
should presently be provided; and that the Loane of
it should be entreated from the City of <hi>London</hi> upon
Publick security. 2 That a Select Committee of both
Houses be named to consider the affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
3 That OWEN Ô CONALLY, who discovered
this great Treason, should have 500 pound present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paid him; and 200 pound <hi>per annum</hi> Pension, till
Provision in Land of a greater value be made for him.
4 That Papists of quality be secured in their severall
Counties within <hi>England.</hi> 5 That no persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
except those, who are Merchants, shall be
admitted to go over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> without Certificate
from the Committee of both Houses appointed for
the affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things were reported to both Houses, and
willingly assented too, within two dayes after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
first made unto them of that Rebellion. And
(notwithstanding those present distractions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which began then to appear) part of every
day, during that <hi>November,</hi> was allotted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Within four dayes after the
beginning of which month, they ordered many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of great import for the releif of it, consisting
of supplies of Money, Magazines of Victuals, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
of all sorts, courses to be taken for raising
Forces for the occasions of that Kingdom; and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for guard of their Sea coasts; as more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
appeareth in the records of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the English Parliament were thus ordering
the affaires of bleeding <hi>Ireland;</hi> other Letters from
the Lords Justices bearing date the fifth of <hi>November</hi>
were brought, and communicated to both Houses.
Who in earnest zeal to the promotion of that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
voted two hundred thousand pounds to be
raised for suppressing the Irish Rebellion, securing
<hi>England,</hi> and payment of the Publick debts. For
which, the City of <hi>London</hi> must of necessity be made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96346:72"/>
use of, (collections through the Kingdom being too
slow for such an urgency) And to encourage the
City in it, an Order was made to secure them for
monies formerly lent, and to allow them the full Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of eight <hi>per cent.</hi> for altogether.</p>
                  <p>Whilest the <hi>English</hi> Parliament were thus busied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the releif of <hi>Ireland;</hi> the horrid Rebellion with
a swift motion run throughout that unhappy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
many Counties daily joyning with them, and
divers Lords and Gentlemen, who for many daies
had lived unsuspected in <hi>Dublin,</hi> went into the
Country to side with the Rebels, and act their parts
in those inhumane outrages; the Lords Justices, and
Privy Counsell were enough troubled to secure <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
to victuall the Castle, and prepare defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those dangers, which threatned the City, and
were made much more by the feares of spoyled people
resorting thither.</p>
                  <p>But the care of the Privy Councell extended further
(notwithstanding the troubles there) then to the
City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and having a Magazine of Armes
within the Castle, resolved so to dispose of them,
as that resistance might be made against the Rebels in
other parts. Some Armes were happily disposed to
such Gentlemen (Sir HENRY TI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>HBORNE,
Sir CHARLES COOTE, and others, of whom
more hereafter) as to their lasting honor did excellent
service. But another part were worse then losse,
those which were distributed to the Lords and
Gentlemen of the English Pale; who afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themselves for the Rebels, and used the Arms
to the destruction of those, who put them into their
hands. That English Pale is a large circuit of Land
possessed at the first conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and ever since inhabited by them; containing
divers Counties, as <hi>Dublin, Meth, Lowth, Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords of the Councel thought fit to trust those
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96346:73"/>
Lords and Gentlemen of the Pale both with Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Armes (though many of them professed
Papists) hoping that this great confidence would
work so far upon their hearts, if any truth or loyalty
were left there, as to keep them at least, from joyning
with the Enemy; but if they were honest, would
enable them to oppose the threatning incursions of
the Northren Rebels. This great Trust the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
were more encouraged to repose in these perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lords and Gentlemen of the Pale, because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had appeared at <hi>Dublin</hi> of their own accords,
professing truth and loyalty, with deep and solemne
Protestations, and that they were most forward, and
ready to concur with their Lordships in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>But so great an affliction was to fall upon unhappy
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that all those Lords that were Papists, after
they had received Commissions, and Armes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all their deep vowes, did most perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
soon after desert their houses, and openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
themselves in actuall Rebellion: such as were
Viscount MONGANNET, GORMANSTON,
and COSTELOE, DILLON, BIRNE, BEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER,
TALBOT, and many others.</p>
                  <p>The Condition of <hi>Dublin</hi> was more lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day then other; and not so much afflicted were
they with feares, and dangers, which threatned
themselves, as that extream sorrow, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
must needs work in them, toward all the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
English which resorted thither. <hi>Dublin</hi> was
the Sanctuary of all the despoiled Protestants; and
by that meanes, the sad stage, upon which all hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was represented; and what mischeifes soever
were acted in other parts, were there discovered and
lamented. Their eyes were sad witnesses of the
Rebels cruelty, in those despoiled English which
daily resorted to the City; but their eares much
more afflicted with relation of those horrid tortures
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96346:73"/>
which had been used to those who died in other
parts. Their eyes could not but extremly suffer
from such wretched Spectacles as daily from all parts
presented themselves; People of all conditions, and
qualities, of every age and Sex spoiled, and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
with no coverings, but ragges, or twisted
straw, to hide their privities; some wounded almost
to death, others frozen with cold, some tired with
travell, and so surbated that they came creeping on
their knees; others famished beyond all releif. And
besides the miseries of their bodies, their minds tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
with the losse of all their fortunes, and sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of their husbands, wives, or children
most barbarously murdered before their faces. In
this most lamentable plight, with wasted bodies and
distracted mindes did they arrive at <hi>Dublin;</hi> some to
be releived, some entombed (which was more then
their murdered friends could obtaine from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels)
insomuch as they appeared like walking ghosts
in every street, and all the Barnes, Stables, and
out-houses were filled with them, where they soon
died after they had recovered the City, in so great
numbers, that all the Church-yards of <hi>Dublin</hi> could
not contain them: but the Lords were enforced to
take in large peeces of ground on both sides of the
River, to set apart for burying places.</p>
                  <p>But that part of this wofull Tragedy, which was
presented to their eyes, was the least, and but the
shadow of that other, which was related to their eares,
of which the Readers and all posterity may share the
sorrow. Many hundreds of those which had escaped
under their oathes, lawfully taken upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and recorded with all particulars, (as may be
seen at large in the Records) delivered to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
what horrid Massacres the bloudy villains had
made of men, women, and children; and what
cruell inventions they had to torture those, whom
they murdered; scarce to be equalized by any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96346:74"/>
the most black, and balefull story of any age.</p>
                  <p>Many thousands of them at severall places (too
many to be here inserted) after all despites exercised
upon them living, put to the worst of deaths; some
burned on set purpose, others drowned for sport and
pastime; and if they swam, kept from landing with
poles, or shot, and murdered in the water; many
were buried quick, and some set into the earth breast-high,
and there left to famish. But most barbarous
(as appears in very many examinations) was that
cruelty, which was shewed to great bellied women;
whom the villaines were not content to murder, but
ripped up their bellies, and many times took delight
to see the Hogges eate the abortive Infants. But I
am loath to dwell upon so sad a narration.</p>
                  <p>The greatest part of these inhumane cruelties were
acted by the Irish upon the poor unarmed Brittaines,
before any provocation given unto them: and the
bloud of so many thousand innocent persons sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to their meer malice, as many afterwards were
sacrificed to their revenge; as whensoever the Irish
received any blow from English Forces, the English
Protestants that lived among them, were murdered
in great numbers.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Lords of the Councell had armed
as many as they were able, and given Commissions
for raising of severall Regiments, which were put
into the hands (for the most part) of gallant men,
as their actions after testified to the world; Sir
CHARLES COOTE an active, and valiant man,
(who was also made Governor of <hi>Dublin</hi>) with
great speed made up his Regiment out of the poor,
robbed, and stripped English, which had fled to
<hi>Dublin;</hi> Sir HENRY TICHBORNE, a worthy
Commander was dispatched away with a Regiment
of Foot, to keep <hi>Tredagh</hi> from the approaching
Rebels: The Lord LAMBERT also, Sir THOMAS
LUCAS, Captain ARMESTRONG, Captain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96346:74"/>
YARNER, with others raised by Commissions
souldiers there.</p>
                  <p>This was done about the middle of <hi>November;</hi> at
which time also the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> with his well
armed Troop of Horse came to <hi>Dublin;</hi> where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few dayes after he was by a Commission sent from
the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi>
(as likewise by the Kings approbation from <hi>Scotland</hi>
signified in a Letter) made Lieutenant Generall of
all the Forces there.</p>
                  <p>For the Earl of <hi>Lecister</hi> at that time was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
so far with necessaries for the service of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
as to repair thither in person.</p>
                  <p>The Earl also sent over to the Lords at <hi>Dublin</hi> (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with an Order of the Lords and Commons of
the Parliament in <hi>England</hi>) comfortable Letters in
this time of distresse, to let them know that the
King had referred the whole businesse of <hi>Ireland</hi>
to the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the charge, and management of the War,
had declared a speedy, and vigorous assistance, had
designed for their present supplies the summe of
50000 pound, and taken order for all further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
necessary.</p>
                  <p>But that they might not be altogether destitute
of reall comfort, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> sent
them over at the same time Twenty thousand
pound, which arrived most seasonably at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
(their treasure beginning utterly to fail) for
paying those new Companies which they had
raised.</p>
                  <p>About the end of <hi>November,</hi> the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,
and Councell of <hi>Ireland</hi> considering the
miserable desolations brought upon that whole
Kingdom, and what miseries were further threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

                  <p>Of which extraordinary testimonies of affection

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96346:75"/>
where they were feasted, and divers Aldermen knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>While the King resided at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, the
House of Commons presented to him a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
or Declaration of the state of the Kingdom;

appeared in that Petition of theirs which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the Remonstrance) as so much truth could
possibly be uttered. For all the fault is laid upon
ill Ministers, who are there called a Malignant
Party.</p>
                  <p>That Remonstrance, some little time before the
Kings return out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had bin with much
earnestnesse debated in the House of Commons: and
at that time when it was Voted, so much divided
was the House, that not above nine voices carried
it.</p>
                  <p>So fierce, and long were the disputations about
it, and arguments urged on both sides, that not
only the day, but a great part of night was spent in
it. For the House arose not untill two of the clock
in the morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The prevailing part alleadged for it (as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
expressed in their Petition to the King) that</hi>
Their intention was only to inform his Majesty, his
Peers, and all other his loyall Subjects; with no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at all of laying the least blemish upon his Person, but
to represent how much his Royall Authority and Trust
had been abused, to the great prejudice and danger of
his Majesty, and all his good Subjects.</p>
                  <p>It was alleadged by many Gentlemen in ordinary
discourses, who were of the same opinion that the
prevailing Voters in Parliament were, That such a
Remonstrance might be of good use, and that the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96346:76"/>
King having perchance been ignorant in some degree,
of how much evill had formerly been wrought, might
by this Remonstrance be not only brought to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his past Errors, but a salubrious fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
again, by considering how publick and
manifest to the World the defaults of Princes in
point of Government must needs appear.</p>
                  <p>The other side were of opinion, That this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
in stead of directing him for the future,
would teach him only to hate the makers of it, as
upbraiders of his crimes, and those that went about
to lessen or blemish (and so the King seemed to rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

were in hope to change his disposition for the future,

                  <p>For mine own part, I will make no judgement
at all upon it; nor can we truly judge by the successe
of things. But such an unhappy Genius ruled those
times (for Historians have observed a Genius of

the forementioned costly, and splendid entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which the City of <hi>London</hi> gave to the King,
would have exceedingly endeared them unto him,
and produced no effects but of love and concord?
Yet accidentally it proved otherwise. For many
people, ill-affected to the Parliament, gave it out
in ordinary discourse (<hi>Non ignota loquor,</hi> it is a
known truth) that the City were weary of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96346:76"/>
tedious proceedings, and would be ready to
joyn with the King against them. Whether it
bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the same opinion in the King or not, I cannot
tell; but certainly some conceived so, by actions
which immediately followed, expressing a greater
confidence against the Parliament then before, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
some from such Trusts, as they had conferred
on them: Insomuch that the City presently after,
finding what ill use was made of these expressions,
were enforced to declare themselves in a Petition to
both Houses; That since some ill-affected People
had interpreted their Loyal and affectionate enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of the King, as a sign that they would
wholly adhere to him, and desert the Parliament;
they openly professed the contrary; and that they
would live and die with them for the good of the
Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>After which, the City, no lesse then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did seem to be distasted both by the King and
Queen.</p>
                  <p>The fears and jealousies that now reigned, were
of a sadder nature then the fears of any former
times had been; two years before, the people feared,
that whilest this King lived, they should never see a
Parliament; but now they began to fear that no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
could do them good.</p>
                  <p>At this time began that fatal breach between King
and Parliament to appear visibly, and wax daily
wider, never to be closed, until the whole Kingdom
was by sad degrees brought into a ruinous War.</p>
                  <p>From henceforth no true confidence appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and that high Court; every day almost
contributed somewhat to the division, and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon severall occasions were published to the
world; of which, though the language for the most
part were fairely couched, and sweetned with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
intermixtures of gracious expressions from the
King, and affectionate professions from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96346:77"/>
yet the substance was matter of expostulation,
and many intervening actions (which we shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to expresse particularly) did so far heighten
them, and sharpen by degrees the stile, till those
Paper-contestations became a fatall Prologue to
that bloudy, and unnaturall War, which afterward
ensued.</p>
                  <p>The King to answer that Remonstrance before
mentioned, published a Declaration to justifie his
own Honor and Government; and at the same time
sent a Message to the Common Councell of <hi>London,</hi>
complaining of tumultuary assemblies of People from
the City, daily resorting to <hi>Westminster,</hi> to the
disturbance of that place, and his Palace of <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For people about that time in great numbers used
to present Petitions to the Parliament, and make
Protestations of their fidelity to them, in these times
of fears and jealousies, which grew now so great,
that the House of Commons, upon the same day that
the King sent that complaining Message to the City,
Petitioned him to allow them a Guard for security of
their Persons while they sate: alleadging in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
that there was <hi>a Malignant Party bitterly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
against them, who did daily gather strength
and confidence, and were now come to that height of
boldnesse, as to give out insolent, and menacing speeches
against the Parliament it self.</hi> It was therefore their
humble desires that they might have a Guard out of
the City, commanded by the Earl of ESSEX, Lord
Chamberlain of his Majesties Houshold, of whose
fidelity to King and Common wealth no question
was ever made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which Petition was denied by the King; but
with a solemn engagement of himself by the</hi> Word of
a King, that the security of all, and every one of them
from violence was, and ever should be as much his care,
as the preservation of himself and his Children, and if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96346:77"/>
this generall assurance would not suffice to remove these
apprehensions, he would command such a Guard to
waite upon them, as he would be responsible for to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God.</p>
                  <p>The next day after that the King had thus answered
the Petition of the House, being the fourth of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
1641 he gave unhappily a just occasion for all men
to think that their fears and jealousies were not cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.
For upon that day the King came to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in Person, attended with a great number of
Gentlemen, Souldiers, and others armed with
Swords and Pistols to the number of about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
who came up to the very door of the House of
Commons, and placed themselves there, and in all
passages neer unto it: The King in Person entered
the House of Commons, and demanded five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that House to be delivered to him. The
manner of it was, seating himself in the Speakers
Chair, he asked him whether those five Members
were there or not? The Speaker Mr. WILLIAM
LENTHALL, returned to his Majesty an humble
and discreet answer, That he had neither eyes to see,
nor tongue to answer any thing, but what he was
commanded by the House.</p>
                  <p>The names of those Members whom he demanded
were Mr. DENZILL HOLLIS second Sonne to
the Earl of <hi>Clare,</hi> Sir ARTHUR HASLERIG,
Mr. PYM, Mr. HAMDEN, and Mr. STRODE:
All Gentlemen of great esteem, and reputation in
the House. Two of them Mr. HOLLIS, and
Mr. STRODE having before suffered many years
of sharp and harsh imprisonment from the King after
the dissolution of that Parliament in the fourth year of
his Reign, for matters done in Parliament contrary to
the Priviledges of that High Court. The King had
the day before by his Attourny Generall Sir EDWARD
HERBERT, a Member also of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
demanded the deliverance of those five fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96346:78"/>
Gentlemen; and sent a Sergeant at
Armes to apprehend them, pretending that he meant
to charge them, and together with them, the Lord
MANDEVILE eldest son to the Earl of MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHESTER
a Member of the House of Lords, with
Articles of high Treason, and other misdemeanors:
which Articles were to this purpose;
<list>
                        <item>1 That they had endeavoured to subvert the
Government, to deprive the King of his legall
power, and to place on Subjects an arbitrary and
tyrannical power.</item>
                        <item>2 That they had endeavoured by foule
aspersions upon his Majesties Government,
to alienate the affections of his people from
him.</item>
                        <item>3 That they endeavoured to draw His
late Army from His Obedience, to side with
them in traiterous Designes.</item>
                        <item>4 That they trayterously invited and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
a forraign power to invade His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties

                        </item>
                        <item>5 That they trayterously endeavoured to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the very Rights and Beeings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                        <item>6 That they have endeavoured by force, and
terror to compell the Parliament to joyne with
them in their trayterous designes, and to that end
have actually raised and countenanced tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King and Parliament.</item>
                        <item>7 That they have trayterously conspired to
Leavy, and actually have Leavyed Warre against
the King.</item>

                     <hi>But the House of Commons hearing this demand,

for such a Member, or any Person in his assistance,
to stand upon his, and their guard of defence, and to
make resistance, according to the Protestation taken, to
defend the Priviledges of Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These things had passed the day before that the
King had so entered into the House of Commons. His
Majesty finding that those five Members were not
there (for they by consent of the House, upon some
informations of what would happen, had absented
themselves) from the Speakers Chair, where he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ate, made a Speech to the House, wherein he told
them, That he was very sorry for that occasion; but
yet,</hi> no King of <hi>England</hi> that ever was, should be more
carefull to maintain the Priviledges of Parliament then
he would be; that those five Members were dangerous
men; but he protested in the word of a King, That he
nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r intended any force; but to proceed against them in
a legall and fair way. But sithence he could not now do
that, which he came for, he would trouble them no
more: but expected, as soon as those five Members came
to the House, that the House would send them to him:
or else he would take his own course to find them.</p>
                  <p>But this great breach of Priviledges of Parliament
was encreased by many circumstances. For the day
before being the third of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> contrary to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96346:79"/>
forementioned order of the House of Commons, the
Chambers, Studies, and Trunks of those five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
by a Warrant from the King were sealed up;
Sir WILLIAM KILLIGREW, and Sir WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM
FLEMEN, with others being imployed in
that service. And within two dayes after, upon the
sixt of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> a Proclamation was made by the
King for the apprehending and imprisoning of those
five Members; wherein it was suggested, that through
the conscience of their own guilt, they were absent,
and fled, not willing to submit themselves to
Justice.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the House of Commons in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their own Priviledges, and those five Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
published within a few dayes after, a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in which that Proclamation of the Kings (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
there, <hi>A Printed Paper</hi>) is declared to be
false, scandalous, and illegall; and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the said Printed Paper, or any Warrant
issued out, or any other matter yet appearing against
them, or any of them, they may and ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the service of the said House of Commons, and
the severall Committees then on foot: And that it
was lawfull for all Persons to lodge, harbour, or
converse with them, or any of them; and whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
should be questioned for the same, should be under
the protection, and Priviledge of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The House of Commons further declared, That
the publishing of severall Articles purporting a form
of a Charge of high Treason against the Lord MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEVILL,
and the forenamed five Members, by Sir
WILLIAM KILLIGREW, Sir WILLIAM
FLEMEN, and others in the Innes of Court, and
else where, in the Kings name, was an high breach of
the priviledge of Parliament, a great scandall to his
Majesty, and his Government, a seditious act
manifestly tending to the subversion of the Peace
of the Kingdome, and an injury, and dishonour
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96346:79"/>
to the said Members, there being no legall charge, or
accusation against them.</p>
                  <p>Whereas there is mention made in the late recited
words of this Declaration, concerning the Innes of
Court, we cannot omit, that about the same time
(so unhappy a Genius of division reigned among all
sorts) there wanted not some men dis-affected to the
Parliament, who went up and down, perswading
the young Gentlemen of the Innes of Court to make
offer of their service to the King, as a guard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
if any danger threatned his Person. Upon
which, divers of those young Gentlemen, to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
themselves, repaired to the Court, and were kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received by the King and Queen.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament at that time further declared, That
the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Liberties of
the Subject so violated and broken, could not be
fully and sufficiently vindicated, unlesse his Majesty
would be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eased to discover the names of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who advised his Majesty to issue out such War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
for sealing of the Chambers and Studies of the
said five Members; to send a Sergeant at Armes to the
house of Commons to demand those members; to issue
out Warrants for their apprehension; to come thither
himself in Person; to publish Articles in the forme of
a Proclamation against the said Members in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared
manner; to the end that all such persons, who
advised him to these actions, might receive condigne
punishment.</p>
                  <p>According to this, the Houses humbly desired his
Majesty that he would so far satisfie their just and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
request, as to let them know those informers (for
the Law in two severall Statutes provides that satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that if in time of Parliament, the King accuse
a Member of the same, of what crime soever, he ought
to signifie to the Parliament, who were the informers)
but the King refused to do it. Upon which the House
of Commons examined his Atturny General Sir ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96346:80"/>
HERBERT, who had preferred the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Articles; he confessed nothing to them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
any other Person, or informer; but only that
he received the Command from the King himself, and
knew nothing further of it. The same the King te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
concerning his said Attourny in a Letter to the
Lord Keeper; wherein he justifieth the Atturny his
action, as being no otherwise then the duty of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
required. But the Parliament made another
judgement of it, as namely that Sir EDWARD HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT
had broken the Priviledge of Parliament in
preferring the said Articles, and done an illegal act;
upon which he was committed to prison.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These actions of the King, did exceedingly afflict
all honest Protestants, especially at such a time, when
the affairs of bleeding</hi> Ireland <hi>did so much and so
speedily require the assistance of</hi> England; <hi>which
must needs by these unhappy distractions be retarded,
and the totall losse of the Protestant Cause there much
endangered. But the City of</hi> London <hi>was not the
least sensible of it; who in a deep and sorrowfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of this designe, Petitioned the King with
an expression of all the fears and dangers which they
conceived themselves in at that time. The things
which they enumerate in their Petition are,</hi> That his
Majesty had put out a Person of Honor and Trust from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lieutenant of the Tower; That he had lately forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
White-hall with men and munition in an unusuall
manner: Some of which men had abused with provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
language, and with drawn swords wounded divers
unarmed Citizens passing by. <hi>To explain this branch
of their Petition, the Reader must be informed, That
the King the very next day after he had entred the
House of Commons, as aforesaid, went in his
Coach into the City of</hi> London, <hi>whither he had heard
that those five Members had retired themselves; and
was every where humbly entreated by the Citizens,
in flocks about his Coach, That he would be pleased
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96346:80"/>
to agree with his Parliament, and not infringe the
Priviledge thereof. The King perceiving which way
the affections of the City went, returned again to</hi>
White-hall, <hi>where he staid about a week after. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time (by what advice, or to what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I cannot tell) he built there a little Court of
Guard, and entertained some Gentlemen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who, as the Petition declares, gave those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
to divers Citizens that passed by. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
likewise in the Petition of</hi> the late endeavours
used to the Innes of Court: the calling in divers Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,
and other assistants into the Tower: the late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of divers Fire-works in the hands of a Papist.
But most of all <hi>(say they)</hi> our feares are encreased by
your Majesties late going into the House of Commons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a great number of armed men, besides your
ordinary Guard, for apprehending divers Members of
that House, to the endangering of your sacred Person,
and of the Persons and Priviledges of that Honorable
Assembly. The effects of all which fears tend, not only
to the overthrow of the whole trade of this City and
Kingdom; which your Petitioners already feel in a deep
measure; but also to the utter ruine of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Lives and Liberties of all your loyall
Subjects. The Petitioners therefore most humbly pray
your sacred Majesty, that by the advice of your great
Councell in Parliament, the Protestants in <hi>Ireland</hi> may
be speedily relieved, the Tower put into the hands of
Persons of Trust, that by removall of doubtfull, and
unknown Persons from about <hi>White-hall,</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
a known and approved Guard may be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the safety of your Majesty, and Parliament; and
that the Lord <hi>MANDEVILL</hi> and the five Members
of the House of Commons lately accused, may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
of Liberty, or proceeded against otherwise
then according to the Priviledges of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The King, though he conceived this Petition (as
himself expressed) of an unusuall nature, yet wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96346:81"/>
to give content to the City, returned a Gracious
Answer to their particulars; That for <hi>Ireland,</hi> he
conceived he had expressed as much care on his part,
as possibly he could, and would not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l for the future.
What he had done concerning the Tower, had been
to satisfie their fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> before, in displacing one or good
Trust, and putting in another of unquestionable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
and what preparation of strength soever he
made there, was with as great an eye of safety and
advantage to the City, as to his own Person. For
his Guard entertained at <hi>White-hall,</hi> he alleadged the
disorderly and tumultuous conflux of people to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
to the danger of his Royall Person, not
punished at all by course of Law; and if any Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
were wounded, he was assured it happened by
their own ill demeanours: that he knew no other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to the Innes of Court, then a gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation,
that he accepted the tender of their loyall
affections, encouraging them to continue the same
upon all occasions. That he knew of no Fire-works
in the hands of Papists. For his going to the House of
Commons, that he intended no course of violence,
though that way had been justifiable; for he was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that no Priviledge of Parliament could extend
to Treason; which he knew would be proved against
them upon cleer grounds, and they in due time
should be acquainted with it; and that his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
against them should be according to the
Lawes.</p>
                  <p>The King presently after his answering of that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
sent another Message to the Parliament, that
for the present he would wave his proceedings against
those five Members; and returned a gentle Answer
at that time to the Petitioners of <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> who
came to the number of about 2000 in behalf of their
Knight Mr. HAMDEN, a Gentleman much hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by them, and by most of the whole Kingdom; in
which Petition they prayed that Mr. HAMDEN, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96346:81"/>
the rest, that lie under the burden of that accusation,
might enjoy the just priviledges of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It was then grown a custom, which proved acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
very unhappie to the Kingdom, however
it were meant, to come in great numbers to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
when they presented Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itions to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
though the people petitioning were unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no just fear from them in the opinion of
those who affected the Parliament; yet those who
thought themselves not well relli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hed by the people
in general, took occasion from thence, either to fear
indeed, or at least to pretend fear, alleadging that
the Parliament was disturbed by such a numerous
confluence of people, and the freedom of the Houses
in some degree infringed, that some of the meaner
sort were too apt to cast out rude words against such
as they thought to be no good members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
of what degree soever they were.</p>
                  <p>From hence was occasion taken by some, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that Guard about White-hall, and afterwards to
excuse the Kings absenting himself from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And from this ground did the twelve Bishops,
about a week before this City-Petition, frame their
Petition and Protestation (for so it was called) to
His Majestie and the Peers, which was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:</p>
                  <p>They protested themselves to abominate all actions or
opinions tending to Poperie, or any Malignity against the
State; but were willing and ready to perform their duties
in Parliament: But whereas, coming to perform that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and service, they have been rudely menaced, affronted,
and put in fear of their lives by multitudes of people,
and can finde no redresse or protection upon complaint
made, they therefore humbly protest before His Majestie
and the noble Peers, that saving to themselves all their
Rights and Interests of sitting and voting in that House
at other times, they dare not sit or vote in the House of
Peers, until His Majestie shall further secure them. And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96346:82"/>
because their fears are not vain, but upon true grounds
and objects, they do in all duty and humility therefore
protest before His Majestie and the Peers, against all
Laws, Orders, Votes, Resolutions and Determinations,
as in themselves null, and of none effect, which in their
absence since the 27 of this instant <hi>December 1641</hi>
have already passed, as likewise against all such as shall
hereafter passe, during this their enforced absence from
the said House. <hi>Which Protestation they desired
the King to command the Clerk of that House to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords of Parliament immediately delivered
by the mouth of the Lord Keeper at a Conference,
to the House of Commons, That seeing this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
was of dangerous consequence, and deeply
entrenching upon the fundamental Priviledges and
Being of Parliament, therefore they thought fit to
communicate it to the house of Commons. The
Commons thanked their Lordships for imparting it
to them with so much affection and speed, and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
their sense thereof; and came to this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
To accuse those twelve Bishops of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>Master GLYNN therefore was sent to the Lords;
who at their Bar, in the name of all the Commons
of England, accused those twelve Prelates of high
Treason, for endeavouring to subvert the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Laws of the Realm, and the very Being of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and to desire the Lords that they might be
forthwith sequestred from Parliament, and put into
safe custodie; and that their Lordships would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a speedie day for the Commons to charge them.
The Lords instantly sent the Black-Rod to finde out
these Bishops, and apprehend them: so that by eight
of the clock at night they were all taken, and brought
upon their knees to the Bar, and ten of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Tower: two of them, in regard of
their age, were committed to the Black-Rod. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96346:82"/>
twelve Bishops were these: JO. <hi>Eborac.</hi> THOMAS
<hi>Duresme,</hi> ROBERT <hi>Coven.</hi> and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> JOS. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
JO. <hi>Asaph,</hi> GUIL. <hi>Bath &amp; Wells,</hi> GEO.
<hi>Hereford,</hi> ROB. <hi>Oxon.</hi> MATTH. <hi>Ely,</hi> GODFREY
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> JO. <hi>Peterborough,</hi> MOR. <hi>Landaff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such work as this was daily made to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England;</hi> whereby not onely the relief of
<hi>Ireland</hi> was wholly obstructed, but all redresse of the
grievances of <hi>England,</hi> and settlement of the State
there, was so long retarded, till both Kingdoms were
at last involved in the same War and Confusion. It
was a strange thing that so barbarous and bloody a
Rebellion should break out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without any
the least suspicion or fear of such a Calamity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any cause given by the innocent English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:
and surely it may seem as strange a thing, if
well considered, that the revenge of so horrid and
inhumane a Massacre should be thus hindered; and
indeed might be thought almost impossible, unlesse
the raising of the one, and hindering the other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the same cause.</p>
                  <p>There was a great hope about the beginning of
<hi>December,</hi> that <hi>Ireland</hi> would speedily be relieved,
and Forces transported out of <hi>Scotland</hi> within a short
time to that purpose, considering what careful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (as is before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
had made upon the first notice of it. But at
that time the King was returned from <hi>Scotland;</hi> and
in a Speech to the Parliament, in which he conjured
them to proceed in the businesse of relieving <hi>Ireland,</hi>
he likewise took notice of a Bill for pressing of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> depending in the House of Peers,
and declared his dislike of putting it in that way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as he said, a great infringement and diminution
of his Royal Prerogative; telling them withal, that
he was little beholding to that man, who began such a
dispute concerning the bounds of his ancient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Prerogative. But he offered at last that the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96346:83"/>
Bill might passe with a <hi>Salvo jure</hi> both to King and
People, leaving such debates to a time that might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bear it.</p>
                  <p>This Speech of the King's was much distasted by
both Houses, as a great breach of Parliament-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
insomuch as they framed a Petition to him,
wherein they expresse, That the King, by taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the debate in the House of Lords concerning
a Bill for pressing of Souldiers, had broken the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Priviledge of Parliament, which is, that <hi>he
ought not to take notice of any matter in agitation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
in either House, but by their information and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that he ought not to propound any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or limitation to a Bill in debate and preparation, or
to manifest his approbation or dislike of the same, until
it be presented to his Majestie in due course of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that every particular Member of either
House hath free liberty of speech, to propound or debate
matters according to Order of Parliament; and that the
King ought not to conceive displeasure against him for
such opinions or propositions.</hi> They intreated like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a reparation for that great breach of Priviledge;
and for prevention of the like, that the King would
make known who they were, by whose mis-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and evil counsel he had done it, that they might
receive conding punishment.</p>
                  <p>This businesse took up some time, and was one
unhappie impediment to the sudden relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
notwithstanding the high necessities of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the affections of <hi>England</hi> in general to it;
and so heavily went on all preparations, that it was
long before the House of Commons could finde means
to enable the Lord Lieutenant to send over so much
as one Regiment, for defence of the Castle and City
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which was commanded by a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
Sir SIMON HARCOUT; who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
Governour of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> was sent
away by Order of Parliament with his Regiment,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96346:83"/>
and landed there on the last day of <hi>December</hi> 1641,
to the great comfort of that City, being much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
and terrified by the neer approach of the Irish
Rebels.</p>
                  <p>Another obstruction of the relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
about three weeks after, when the Scots de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
eight Propositions to the English Parliament,
touching the sending over of Two thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Scots, which were then in readinesse, into the
north of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Both Houses of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to all the Propositions; but the King except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against one of them, being the third, which was,
<hi>That the Scots desired to have the keeping of the Town
and Castle of</hi> Carricksergus, <hi>with power to remain there,
or enlarge their Quarters at discretion; and if any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
or Troops in that Province should joyn with
them, that they receive Orders from the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Scotish Forces.</hi> Against this Article the
King took exceptions, and desired the Houses to
take it again into consideration, as a thing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which he doubted might be prejudicial to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
But if the House desired it should be so, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would speak with the Scotish Commissioners, to
see what satisfaction he could give them therein.
The Scots told his Majestie, that since it was agreed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon by both Houses of Parliament, and that the
strength of his Majesties argument was, That Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
implied too great a Trust for Auxiliary Forces,
they were in good hope that his Majestie, being their
native King, would not shew lesse trust in them,
then their neighbour-Nation had freely done. Upon
which the King at last was content to admit the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and the advice of his Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This fatal obstruction of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s relief, did but
second another immediately before: For at the first,
the Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> had not power given
them from the State there, to treat for sending over
a lesse number then ten thousand men; which the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96346:84"/>
Lords were unwilling to yeeld to. But that obstacle
seemed to be removed by the zealous affection of
the House of Commons; who according to those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
voted the sending over of ten tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sand Scots.
But the House of Lords, after long debate, would
not yeeld unto it, unlesse the House of Commons
would give assurance that ten thousand English might
be as speedily sent over: which the Commons as
much desired, and promised their endeavour in it;
but that the English then could not be so soon raised,
much lesse transported, as the Scots, every man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
There was no other reason given, that
ever I understood, but onely That it was dishonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Ireland</hi> should be reduced by
the Scots: and this was the discourse of Papists, and
other persons disaffected to the Cause, among the
people every where.</p>
                  <p>Though it were much wondered at by all good
Protestants, that so nice a point of Honour should
be stood upon, when their Religion and Cause lay
bleeding in <hi>Ireland</hi> after so sad and deplorable a
kinde; which began to deject the spirits of the
poor Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and make them suspect
some secret workings under-hand against the good
affections expressed by the House of Commons, and
those Lords who were well-affected to the State: for
they by the greater number were over-voted, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Popish and ill-affected Lords, besides four and
twenty Bishops (for the Bishops voices in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were not then taken away) sitting in that
House.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was then also generally talked, and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of among the well-affected people, that the
King had been so backward in proclaiming those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Irish, Rebels: and not onely talked among
the people, but alleadged by the Parliament it self
(in their own Declaration afterward, when the breach
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96346:84"/>
between King and Parliament grew greater) as
a signe that those inhumane Rebels had been</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by the Court of <hi>England,</hi> in that the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
whereby they were declared Traitors, was so
long with held, as till the first of <hi>January,</hi> though the
Rebellion broke forth in <hi>October</hi> before; and then no
more then fourty Copies were appointed to be printed,
with a special command from His Majestie not to exceed
that number; and that none of them should be published,
till the Kings pleasure were further signified, as by
the Warrant appears, a true copie whereof was printed:
so that a few onely could take notice of it. And this
<hi>(say they)</hi> was made more observable by the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
proceedings against the Scots, who were in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quick and sharp manner proclaimed, and those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
forthwith dispersed with as much diligence
as might he, thorow all the Kingdom; and ordered to
be read in every Church, accompanied with publike Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Execrations.</p>
                  <p>That Declaration of the Lords and Commons,
in which this is expressed concerning the Kings slowe
proclaiming of the Irish Rebels, was published when
the King was gone to <hi>York;</hi> at which he was much
distasted in many particulars, and returned Answer
to them. Among others, because that of <hi>Ireland</hi>
seemed to lie heavie upon his reputation, it is just
that the Reader should see the King's own Answer
to that point, that he may the more fairly judge;
which shall be therefore inserted, in the very words of
the Kings Declaration.</p>
                  <p>To countenance those unhandsome expressions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
usually they have implied Our connivence at, or want
of zeal against the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland</hi> (so odious to
to all good men) they have found a new way of expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
That the Proclamation against those bloodie
Traitors came not out till the beginning of <hi>January,</hi>
though that Rebellion broke out in <hi>October;</hi> and then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96346:85"/>
by special Command from Vs, but fourty Copies were
appointed to be printed. It is well known where we
were at that time, when that Rebellion broke forth, in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> that we immediately from thence recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the care of that businesse to both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
here, after We had provided for all fitting Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
from our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> that after Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
hither, We observed all those Forms for that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which We were advised to by Our Councel of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or both Houses of Parliament here: and if no
Proclamation issued out sooner (of which for the present
We are not certain, but think that others before that time
were issued by Our directions) it was, because the Lords
Iustices of that Kingdom desired them no sooner; and
when they did, the number they disired was but twenty,
which they advised might be signed by Vs; which We
for expedition of the service, commanded to be printed
(a circumstance not desired by them) thereupon We
signed more of them then Our Iustices desired: all which
was very well known to some Members of one or both
Houses of Parliament, who have the more to answer, if
they forbore to expresse it at the passing of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if they did expresse it, We have the greater
reason to complain, that so envious an aspersion should be
cast upon Vs to Our People, when they knew well how
to answer their own Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This was the Kings Answer to that point of the
Parliaments Declaration concerning</hi> Ireland. <hi>But the
House of Commons in another Declaration, though
long after, charge the King upon the same particular,
with more circumstances of aggravation: as,</hi> That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Rebels had most impudently styled themselves
<hi>The Queens Army,</hi> and professed that the cause of their
rising was, To maintain the King's Prerogative, and the
Queens Religion, against the Puritan Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and thereupon both Houses of Parliament did
humbly and earnestly advise His Majestie to wipe
away this dangerous Scandal, by proclaiming them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96346:85"/>
Rebels and Traitors to His Majestie and the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> which then would have mated and weakned the
Conspirators in the beginning, and have encouraged both
the Parliaments here, and good people there, the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
to have opposed their proceedings: yet such was
the power of evil counsel about him, that no Proclamation
was set forth to that purpose, till almost three months
after the breaking out of this Rebellion; and then
Command given that but fourty should be printed, nor
they published, till further direction should be given
by His Majestie. <hi>But the businesse of</hi> Ireland <hi>was
more particularly touched in subsequent Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which in their due time and place may hereafter
be related.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Proclamation against the Irish Rebels, came
not out above two days before the King entred the
House of Commons, as is before expressed; by
which act so great a disturbance was made, and the
relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> so much retarded.</p>
                  <p>It was likewise complained of to the King by the
House of Commons, within three weeks after, that
since the Ports by order of both Houses (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned) had been stopped against all Irish
Papists, many of the chief Commanders, then in the
Head of the Rebels, had been suffered to passe by
His Majesties immediate Warrant. Of which the
King cleared himself in Answer to them, that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
his own memory, and the notes of his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
he could not finde himself guilty of granting
any such Warrants.</p>

when so many courses were

the middle of <hi>February,</hi> both
Houses of Parliament had found a way, which they
conceived to be most substantial and firm to carry on
that War; namely, by adventuring for proportions
of Land in <hi>Ireland;</hi> there being, by their account,
within the four Provinces of <hi>Vlster, Connaught, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
and <hi>Leinster</hi> two millions and an half of Acres

would bring in or subscribe such Sums of money as

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96346:86"/>
consideration set down in particular; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
if an happie Conquest were made upon those
bloody Rebels, a large recompence might be made
to all those English who either in Person of Purse
had contributed to so good a work. The King was
well contented with these Propositions, off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ring
withal to go himself in Person into <hi>Ireland</hi> (but that
was not thought sitting by the Parliament); and so
far it passed, that an Act was made to that purpose,
enabling the Parliament with power to carry on that
War, until <hi>Ireland</hi> should be declared to be wholly
subdued; and that no Peace or Cessation of Arms
should be at any time made with those Rebels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
both Houses of Parliament assented to it.</p>
                  <p>But while these things were acting, other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wherein the safety and security of <hi>England</hi> was
concerned, fell into debate; which was touching the
<hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion
of <hi>Wales,</hi> to be setled in every County upon such
persons as the Parliament should approve. A Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this purpose was sent to the King, presently
after they had received a Message from him, dated
the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> wherein the King in fair
language desires the Parliament, since that particular
Grievances and Distractions were too many, and
would be too tedious to be presented by themselves,
that they would comprise and digest them into one
entire Body, <hi>that so His Majestie and themselves might
be able to make the more clear Iudgement of them; and
that it should then appear, by what His Majestie would
do, how for he hath been from intending or designing any
of those things, which the too-great fears and jealousies
of some persons, seem to apprehend; and how ready he
would be to equal or exceed the greatest examples of most
indulgent Princes in their Acts of Grace and Favour to
the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Message was received with thanks by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who resolved to take it into speedie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96346:87"/>
consideration. But to enable them with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to discharge their duties in those affairs, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the King to raise up to them a sure ground of
safety and confidence, by putting in the mean time
the Tower, with other principal Forts, and the
whole <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, into the hands of
such persons as the Parliament might trust, and should
be recommended to him by both Houses. This Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theirs was not well rellished by the King, as
appeared by his Answer. But the thing was of so
great consequence, that one Answer could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Many reiterated Petitions were presented, and
many Answers returned upon this subject, which are
extant upon Record; where the King often promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to be careful, that no hands, but those who are
very faithful to the Common-wealth, shall be by him
entrusted with any part of the <hi>Militia;</hi> but the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of any persons to those places, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to himself, it being a principal and inseparable
flower of his Crown, vested in him, and derived to
him from his Ancestors, by the Fundamental Laws of
the Kingdom. The Parliament on the other side af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
that nothing could enable them to suppresse
the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and secure themselves, but
the instant granting of that humble Petition; which
they hoped the King would not absolutely deny: That
it was their duty to him and the Common-wealth, to
represent unto him whatsoever they found so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary; for the preservation of both which,
the Laws both of God and man enjoyn them to see it
put in execution.</p>
                  <p>During the debate of this businesse, and before any
absolute conclusion was made of it, the King took a
journey to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> upon what reasons, shall be
anon declared. It was before related, that the King
after his entring into the House of Commons to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
the five Members, had stayed a week at <hi>White-hall,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96346:87"/>
and then retired to <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> the next
day after, divers Citizens, with a great shew of Boats,
and Guns in them, brought the five Members to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
with many expressions that they would not
forsake them, who sare to defend their Religion, Laws
and Liberties.</p>
                  <p>The King now resident at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> seemed
extremely distasted at the Citie, and pretended the
reasons of his absence from Parliament to be fear for
his Person, by reason of Tumults that might be raised:
but true it is, after this time, he never could be
brought neer the Citie or Parliament either in body
or minde.</p>
                  <p>Within few days after the King had been at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton-Court,</hi>
he sent for divers of his servants, who
were then Members of the Parliament, to leave the
House, and give their attendance upon his Person:
But two, the chief of them, ROBERT Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi>
lately made Lord Chamberlain of this Houshold, and
HENRY Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Groom of the Stool, chose
rather to obey his Writ whereby they were called to
assist in Parliament about the highest affairs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
then to obey this private Command of his, to
come and attend at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> alleadging in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
that their attendance in Parliament was truer
service to him as King, then any other could be.
For this, the King presently after sent a Messenger
to demand the Staff of the one, and the Key of the
other, being the Ensignes of their Offices; which
they willingly resigned to the Messengers hands.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> about the midst of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
the King and Queen went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and so
to <hi>Dover,</hi> with the Princesse MARY their eldest
daughter, married, not a yeer before, to WILLIAM
son to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> The Queen her self
passed from thence into <hi>Holland,</hi> under pretext of
keeping her daughter company to her husband, (the
Lady was then about ten yeers of age) which was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96346:88"/>
not at all hindered by the Parliament. But the Queen
carried with her all or the greatest part of the Crown-Jewels
of <hi>England,</hi> which immediately she pawned
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and with that money bought Arms and
Ammunition for that sad War which ensued not long
after, between the King and the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King's stay at <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> was not
long, nor the places so remote, but that some busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
might passe, though with great trouble of those
Lords, and others, Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
who posted between, upon all occasions. The
greatest thing which was done in that time, was, that
the King at <hi>Canterbury</hi> signed the Bill for taking away
Bishops Votes in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>When the Queen and her daughter had taken Sail,
the King came back to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> whither he sent
for the Prince and Duke of <hi>York</hi> to come to him,
and attend him in his journey to the City of <hi>York,</hi>
which was the place which he intended to reside at,
and to that purpose immediately went on his way as
far as <hi>Theobalds;</hi> to which place he was followed
with a Petition from both Houses, presented to him
upon the first of <hi>March</hi> 1641. The substance of it
was, to intreat his Majestie that be would at last be
pleased to grant their necessary Petition concerning
the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> which if he did refuse, in
these times of distraction, they must be enforced,
and did resolve to dispose of it for the safety of the
Kingdom, in such manner as had been propounded
to his Majestie. They likewise intreated him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his abode neer <hi>London,</hi> and his Parliament, and
not to take his son the Prince out of those parts: and
in conclusion, desired his Majestie to be informed by
them, his great Councel, that by the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the power of raising, ordering and disposing of
the <hi>Militia</hi> within any Citie, Town, or other place,
cannot be granted to any Corporation by Charter, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96346:88"/>
otherwise, without the authority and consent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>The King denied to give any other Answer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Militia,</hi> then what he had before done;
That he conceived himself not safe in any place neer
<hi>London;</hi> and that he would take such a care of the
Prince his son, as should justifie him to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to his Dominions as a King.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament, upon occasion of that short An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of the King to their Petition, voted presently
that that Answer was a flat Denial; and that all was
truth which they had averred in their Petition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the danger of his removal so far from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and likewise carrying of his son away. It
was likewise ordered by the Lords and Commons,
that the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> Lord Admiral, should
give speedie directions for all the Ships belonging to
the Navie Royal, to be speedily rigged, and fitted
for the service of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>A Declaration was drawn then by both Houses, and
presented to the King at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> upon the ninth
of <hi>March,</hi> by the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
with some Members of the House of Commons,
wherein were represented to him some of the old
Grievances expressed in the first Remonstrance at his
return out of <hi>Scotland:</hi> as, That the designe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Religion had been carried on by those of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
authority about him, for divers yeers: That the
War against <hi>Scotland</hi> was procured in order to that
designe: That the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> was contrived
here in <hi>England,</hi> out of many presumptions gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from several examinations there. They speak
likewise of his attempt for bringing his Army against
the Parliament, of which before mention was made;
of his Warrants granted contrary to promise, for
transportation of JERMYN, DIGBY, and other
Delinquents; of that great breach of Parliament-Priviledge,
in coming to the House of Commons to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96346:89"/>
surprise those Members: by all which they endeavour
to prove their fears and jealousies grounded upon
true substantial reasons, and necessary for the safety
the Common-wealth entrusted to them; and that the
Kings fear to reside neer <hi>London,</hi> is altogether without
ground, and pretended for nothing but to perplex the
Common-wealth, proceeding from evil and traiterous
Counsels; affirming, that His Majesties absence
would cause men to believe, that it was out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
to discourage the undertakers, and hinder the
other provisions for relieving <hi>Ireland;</hi> that it would
hearten the Rebels there, and all dis-affected persons
in this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The King expressed much indignation when he
received this Remonstrance, complaining of the
manner of it, that it was onely an upbraiding, not
an invitation or perswasion of him to return to the
Parliament; and told them, that in all ARISTOTLE'S
Rhetoricks there was no such argument of Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and that he would answer it in another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
which within few days after was drawn up,
and published; wherein, with deep protestations,
he vindicates the truth of his Religion, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
his other proceedings, denying those Warrants
for transporting Master JERMYN and others, in that
manner which they urge them: taxes them with
their needlesse fears, and uncertain expressions
of advertisements from <hi>Rome, Venice, Paris,</hi> and
other places: recites the many gracious Acts which
he had already passed this Parliament, to satisfie his
People; and protests in conclusion, that he is most
desirous to reside neer his Parliament, and would
immediately return to <hi>London,</hi> if he could see or hear
of any provisions made for his security.</p>
                  <p>The King sent them another Message from <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon</hi>
on the 15 of <hi>March,</hi> being then upon his
removal to the City of <hi>York;</hi> wherein he expresses
his care of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not to break the Priviledge
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96346:89"/>
of Parliament; but chiefly, to let them know that he
understands his own Rights; forbidding them to
presume, upon any pretence of Order or Ordinance
(to which he is no party) concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> or
any other thing, to do or execute what is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by those Laws; and withal recommending to
them the substance of his Message of the twentieth
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> last; that they compose and digest with
all speed such Acts as they shall think fit, for the
present and future establishment of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                  <p>These were the heads of some Declarations, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Answers: for about this time, and for
three months after, such Messages, Remonstrances,
Petitions and Answers grew so voluminous upon all
occasions, as might, recited <hi>verbatim,</hi> make a large
History.</p>
                  <p>Thus is the King gone to <hi>York,</hi> while the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sit at <hi>London,</hi> declaring in vain, and voting
(as they did upon receipt of his last Message) by
consent of both Houses,
<list>
                        <item>1. That the King's absence so far remote from his
Parliament, is not onely an obstruction, but may be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to the affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That when the Lords and Commons in Parliament
shall declare what the Law of the Land is, to have this
not onely questioned and controverted, but contradicted,
and a Command that it should not be obeyed, is an high
breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</item>
                        <item>3. That they which advised the King to absent
himself from the Parliament, are enemies to the peace
of this Kingdom, and justly to be suspected as favourers
of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may seem strange to a Reader, that the King,
without any, but such bootlesse opposition as Pen
and Paper can make against him, even in the sight
and notice of a Parliament, whilst they not onely
beheld his actions, but seemed to discern the designes,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96346:90"/>
and foresee the effects which would flow from them,
could be able to carry the work on so clearly and so
far, until the whole Kingdom were thereby involved
in a most calamitous and destructive War. I will not
presume to publish any opinion of mine own, how
or when this ruine of the Kingdom should have been
prevented; but onely relate what was then done, that
posterity hereafter may judge of it.</p>
                  <p>It was not unknown to the Parliament, at least not
unsuspected (for it was usually talked among the
people of that time) that the Queen, when she passed
into <hi>Holland,</hi> carried with her the Crown-Jewels, to
pawn or sell there: which if she did, they could not
be ignorant what the intention was, or what the effect
was like to prove; nor could it be unknown to them
how unlawful the act was, and therefore how fit to be
prevented; for they indicted her asterwards of high
Treason for that fact, and were able to tell the world
in a Declaration, how great a crime it is in a King
himself to make away the Ornaments of the Crown,
and in particular, the Jewels of it; yea, in such Kings
as did it onely to spend or give away, not to maintain
War against their own People, for whose preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not onely those, but whatsoever they possesse, was
first bestowed on them.</p>
                  <p>They seemed to oppose the Prince his departure
from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> to attend the King his Father
into the North, because it might increase fears and
jealousies in the People: but the King carried him
away.</p>
                  <p>Above all the rest, they were not ignorant how
wonderful an obstruction to all businesse of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to the setling of <hi>England,</hi> or relieving of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that far removal of the Kings Person from
the Parliament must needs prove, and which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sufficiently expressed: That the very Journey it
self, though no worse designe were in it, was in no
kinde excusable, as most inconvenient, for the reasons
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96346:90"/>
aforesaid, and convenient in nothing that was ever
alleadged for it. Yet the King passed quietly thither.</p>
                  <p>One designe of the King, which indeed was thought
the chief of that his Northern Expedition, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the Parliament by an open and forcible
way, which was the seizing upon the strong Town
and Fort of <hi>Hull,</hi> with all that Magazine of Arms
which was there deposited. But it was very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
what means had been used on both sides, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
if it had been possible, that open denial of the
King's entrance into <hi>Hull,</hi> and that the matter should
not have come so far: Which the King conceived
so great an affront to him, that it grew the subject of
many large and voluminous Declarations afterward,
from either Part.</p>
                  <p>For the prevention of that, before it happened,
the King from <hi>York,</hi> had sent a Message to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the eighth of <hi>April</hi> 1642, that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to go in Person over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to chastise by
force of Arms those barbarous and bloodie Rebels;
and to that purpose, he thought fit to advertise the
Parliament that he intended to raise forthwith, by his
Commissions, in the Counties neer <hi>Westchester,</hi> a
Guard for his own Person (when he should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ireland</hi>) consisting of two thousand Foot, and
two hundred Horse, which he would arm at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
from his Magazine of <hi>Hull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But at the same time, the Lords and Commons in
Parliament had sent a Petition to the King, for leave
to remove the Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
alleadging that the Stores of Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
in the Tower were much diminished, and that
the necessity of Supplies for the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi>
(for which they had been issued from thence) daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased:
That the occasion for which the Magazine was
placed at <hi>Hull,</hi> was taken away, there being no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
now from <hi>Scotland.</hi> They likewise alleadged that
it would be kept in the Tower with lesse charge, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96346:91"/>
more safety, and transported from thence with much
more convenience for the service of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King seemed very angry at this Petition,
alleadging, among other things, that if any of those
Arms were designed for <hi>Vlster</hi> or <hi>Leinster,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of them would be more easie and convenient
from <hi>Hull,</hi> then from <hi>London.</hi> But most of all he
seemed to be exasperated (for the Parliament had
used timely prevention) that they had sent to keep
out from thence the Earl of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> whom the
King in that Answer termeth <hi>A Person of honour, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and unblemished reputation,</hi> and committed
that Town and Fort (without his consent) to the
hands of Sir JOHN HOTHAM.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament, as it appeared by their expression
in a Declaration at that time, were much confirmed
in that opinion which they had of the King's aiming
at <hi>Hull,</hi> when he went Northward, by an intercepted
Letter from the Lord GEORGE DIGBY, dated
from <hi>Middleborough</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> the 20 of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
1641, to Sir LEWIS DIVES, wherein he writes,
that if the King will declare himself, and retire to a
safe place, he should be able to wait upon him from
thence, as well as out of any part of <hi>England,</hi> over
and above the service which he might do for him there
in the mean time. The like expressions he used in
another Letter to the Queen, intercepted in the same
Packet, intimating some service he might do her in
those parts; and desired a Cypher, whereby to hold
correspondencie with her in writing. This young
Lord, of whom we spake before about the death of
the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> a man of excellent parts, and
one that had been acceptable to the Parliament, until
his Speech about that businesse, and some other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
detected upon the same occasion, was much
alienated in heart from the Parliament, because that
Speech of his (which he had printed against Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
was ordered to be burned by the hands of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96346:91"/>
Hang-man; so that afterward he became a great
cherisher, as appeared in divers things, of those divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which were growing between the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and was voted against in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as a disturber of the publike peace, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
armed at <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> in an unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and illegal manner, with other circumstances there
to belonging. Whereupon the Lords in Parliament
sent for him; and if he appeared not within twenty
days, proclaimed him Traitor. But he in the mean
time was transported by Sir JOHN PENNINGTON
into <hi>Holland,</hi> by a Warrant under the Kings hand, as
the Declaration of the Lords and Commons to the
King in <hi>March</hi> following expressed.</p>
                  <p>During the time that the King and Parliament
were (as aforesaid) busied about getting the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of <hi>Hull,</hi> the Parliament proceeded by degrees in
setling the <hi>Militia</hi> in divers Counties, and putting
the Commands into such hands as they reposed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in; as likewise to take charge of the Navie,
and provide by that means against any forraign force
that might assault the Kingdom. And because the
Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> Lord Admiral, by reason of
indisposition of health, was disenabled then for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Fleet in his own person, they thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
recommended to his Lordship the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
(a man of such ability in Sea-affairs, and such
untainted reputation, as they durst highly trust) to
supply his Lordships room in that employment. But
understanding that the King had chosen Sir JOHN
PENNINGTON into that Command, a Message
was sent from both Houses to the King on the 28 of
<hi>March,</hi> to intreat him that the employment might no
longer be detained from the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> as a
noble person chosen by both Houses of Parliament in
that Service, the Charge whereof was to be born by
the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The King refused to admit of the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96346:92"/>
taking great exception at the Message from
both Houses, as appeared by his Letter to the Lord
Keeper concerning it, that they would take upon them
the nominating of the chief Sea-Commander. But
the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> within few months after, though
not without some opposition of divers Gentlemen,
who had before been placed in Command by the King,
and strove to carry away their Ships to His Majestie,
was possessed of the whole Navie: of which some
more particulars may hereafter be related.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 23 of <hi>April</hi> 1642, the King, attended by
some Noble-men, and no great train of Gentlemen
and Souldiers, came before the walls of <hi>Hull,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
entrance there; but he found the Gates shut,
and the Bridges drawn up, by the command of Sir
JOHN HOTHAM a member of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and by the Parliament entrusted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of that Town. Sir JOHN HOTHAM ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
upon the Wall, and kneeling down there,
intreated his Majestie that he would be pleased not to
command that, which he must be enforced (though
extremely grieved to disobey his Majestie in any
thing) to deny at that time; alleadging that he
could not admit his Majestie, without breach of trust
to the Parliament, beseeching the King to give him
leave to send to the Parliament, to acquaint them with
his command, and take their direction.</p>
                  <p>The King, upon this denial, grew into choler, and
after some hot words, seeming not to believe that the
Parliament had commanded any such thing; &amp; to that
purpose speaking, demanded of Sir JOHN HOTHAM,
that if he had Order from the Parliament to keep out
his Person, he should shew it in Writing; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he would not believe it. But Sir JOHN HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAM,
because the Order was not in those expresse
words, as naming the Kings particular person, though
he knew the sense and meaning of the Parliament, did
not produce any Writing; onely beseeching the King
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96346:92"/>
not to command him that which he might not do.
Whereupon the King, after some hours spent in vain
about the Town, proclaimed Sir JOHN HOTHAM
Traitour; and returned, when he had received out
of the Town his Son the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and his
Nephew the Prince Electour, whom Sir JOHN the
day before had admitted into the Town, entertained,
and lodged there that night.</p>
                  <p>The next day the King, in a Message to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
complained of that affront offered by Sir
JOHN HOTHAM, accusing him for that he had
traiterously and seditiously strived to put his disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
upon the Parliament, the King seeming to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that HOTHAM had done it upon his own head,
without any direction or authority from them: And
within two days after, sent another Message to the
Parliament, complaining in a sharper manner then
before, of that great indignity, which, if they affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him no reparation, would make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that his priviledges were lesse then any Subjects
in the Land; and that it was more lawful to rob him
of his proper Goods, then the meanest Member of
the Kingdom. He sent also, at the same time, a
Letter to the Maior of <hi>Hull,</hi> commanding him, and
all Officers of that Town, to take care that no part of
the Magazine should be removed, or transported out
of the Town, under any pretence of Order or
Power whatsoever, without his Royal Assent, under
his Hand. He caused likewise all Passages between
<hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>London</hi> to be stopped up, and by that means
apprehended a servant of Sir JOHN HOTHAM'S,
going with a Letter to the Parliament concerning the
proceedings before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament immediately, upon notice of these
things, declared their reasons for <hi>Hull,</hi> and that the
stopping of Passages, and intercepting of Messengers
or Letters to or from the Parliament, or in their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
was an high breach of the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96346:93"/>
which by the Laws of the Land, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
they were bound to defend, and punish the
violators; authorizing, by Ordinance of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
all Sheriffs, Justices, Constables, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
to aid them employed in the said service, for their
more speedie, free, and safe passage; giving Order al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the said Officers within the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> to suppresse any Armies raised to force <hi>Hull,</hi>
or stop the passages before mentioned, in disturbance
of the Kingdom's peace.</p>
                  <p>It was voted by them, two days after, that Sir JOHN
HOTHAM had done nothing <hi>but in obedience to the
Command of both Houses of Parliament.</hi> Resolved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it was upon the Question, <hi>That this declaring of
Sir <hi>JOHN HOTHAM</hi> Traitor, being a Member of the
House of Commons, was an high breach of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Parliament.</hi> Resolved again, <hi>That declaring
Sir</hi> JOHN HOTHAM <hi>Traitor, without due Processe
of Law, was against the Liberty of the Subject, and Laws
of the Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Order of Assistance was then given to the Earl
of <hi>Stamford,</hi> the Lord WILLOUGHBY of <hi>Parham,</hi>
Sir EDWARD AYSCOUGH, Sir CHRISTOPHER
WRAY, Sir SAMUEL OWFEILD, and Master
HATCHER, as Committees of both Houses sent
down to <hi>Hull,</hi> and the two Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi>
for service of the Kindom, that all Sheriffs, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Maiors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be assisting to them upon all
occasions.</p>
                  <p>To that Declaration, Votes, and Orders of Assistance
of both Houses of Parliament, the King, on the fourth
of <hi>May,</hi> returned an Answer, wherein at large he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
how hainous the affront was, and how much he
accounts himself injured by the Parliament, in not
repairing him against HOTHAM; labouring to prove
by ancient Statutes there cited, that Sir JOHN HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAM'S
denial of entance to him, was absolutely
high Treason by the Law of the Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:96346:93"/>
Upon this subject, within the space of one week,
two other Declarations and Answers passed between
the King and both Douses, too large to be here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
but the scope of the King's Declarations in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
are to vindicate his own Rights and dignity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him as King, by the Laws of the Land; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he seemeth not to take notice of the present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or such things as are conceived dangers, and
thought necessary to prevent, by a Parliament sitting.
The Parliament on the other side, with all humility,
and reverent expressions to the Kings Person, seeming
to take no notice of any affront offered or intended to
his Majestie himself, but onely of preserving <hi>Hull,</hi>
the <hi>Militia,</hi> and Navie, out of the hands of those wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Counsellors, which they conceived to be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
with him, to the danger of ruining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and himself; both which they laboured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and were lawfully called to it by that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which belongs to Parliaments, by the Fundamental
Constitution of English Government. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to inform the King, that his Interest in Towns,
Arms, or the Kingdom it self, is not of that kinde
that private men have interest in their Goods, to sell
or dispose of at pleasure; but onely as entrusted to
him for the good of all: in performance of which
trust, none but the Parliament, while it sitteth, are or
ought to be his Counsellors and directors: that there
can be no good or useful disputation, where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are not granted: and it was ever heretofore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
(say they) for a certain Principle, That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
sitting is the onely Judge of what is dangerous
to the Common-wealth, and what useful, as likewise
what is lawful in those cases; which the King, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of no private Counsel whatsoever, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol,
or contradict: which Principle till the King will
be pleased rightly to apprehend, Disputations and
Declarations are endlesse, and no true understanding
between him and his people can be begotten.</p>

                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:96346:94"/>
Of all these things if a Reader desire to be satisfied
in particular, he may sinde the questions all fully sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Parliament, and the King's desires expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by himself, in two large Declarations; one called
the Parliaments third Remonstrance, dated the 26 of
<hi>May,</hi> 1642; and the King's Answer to that Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance.</p>
                  <p>But things began to go on in an high manner; the
Parliament authorizing Sir JOHN HOTHAM to
issue out Warrants to Constables, and other Officers,
to come with Arms for the defence of <hi>Hull:</hi> and the
King on the other side, forbidding any such Warrants,
bringing, or training, without an expresse Authority
under his hand.</p>
                  <p>The King had summoned the Gentry of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to attend him at the City of <hi>York,</hi> which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did, upon the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> 1642; where he
caused, after he had spoken some few words to them,
to be read aloud in their hearing, his Answer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of both houses concerning <hi>Hull,</hi> the Answer
of the Parliament to his two Messages concerning <hi>Hull,</hi>
together with his Reply to the same, and his Message
to both houses, declaring the reasons why he refused to
passe that Bill of the <hi>Militia:</hi> after which, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Speech to them, wherein he strove to make
them apprehend, that traiterous attempts might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Person; and for that reason he desired a
Guard of Horse and Foot to be levied there for his
defence. He complained likewise that the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Parliament consisting of four Members of the
house of Commons, FERDINANDO Lord FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX,
Sir HUGH CHOLMLEY, Sir PHILIP STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLETON,
and Sir HENRY CHOLMLEY, refused
to obey his Command: for they being there employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their own Country by the Parliament, to do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the State, were commanded by the King to
depart out of the County; which they durst not do,
against the intention of the Parliament, who employed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96346:94"/>
them there. But the King in that Speech to the
County, bade them take heed of those four Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
not knowing what doctrine of disobedience they
might preach to the people, under colour of obeying
the Parliament. The King's Speech and Declaration
read, seemed to be much applauded by many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and their servants: as when those things
which came from the Parliament were read, the same
persons expressed much scorn, hissing, and reviling the
language and reason of them.</p>
                  <p>But divers of the Gentry, and greatest part of the
Free-holders, began with sorrow to consider that this
division of the King from his great Councel, could
produce nothing but misery to the Kingdom, and
dishonour to himself: and therefore they humbly
answered his Propositions concerning a Guard, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
they were willing to do any service, or expose their
lives to any hazard for the safety of his Majesties
Royal Person; yet they thought themselves unworthy
to advise him in a thing of so high consequence; but
humbly beseeched him to impart the grounds of his
fears and jealousies to his high Court of Parliament, of
whose loyal care and affections to the King's honour
and safetie, and prosperitie of the whole Kingdom,
they were most confident. And in behalf of the
four fore-mentioned Members of Parliament lately
employed to attend <hi>your Majestie</hi> (said they) <hi>from
both Houses, being all Gentlemen of quality and estate in
the County; we humbly crave your Majesties leave to
expresse our confidence in their unstained loyalty to your
Majestie, so far as that you may securely admit their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
to negotiate their employments, until they shall
be recalled by the Parliament. And we do all engage our
selves for their fidelity, as being most assured that your
Royal Person shall be secure in the General loyalty of your
Subjects in this County, without any extraordinary
Guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King was presented also, the next day, with a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96346:95"/>
Petition from many thousands, who termed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
peaceably-affected Subjects in the County of <hi>York,
in which expressing their loyaltie and affection to him,
they speak thus:</hi> We are confident that no so absolute and
hearty observance of your Majesties just commands can
be demonstrated, as when you shall in Parliament declare
them: If they be divided (which God forbid) our
hearts even tremble to consider the danger, and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the honour and safety of your Self and Kingdom;
since it is clear to every understanding, that it is not a
divided part of one or several Counties, can afford that
honour and safety to your Majestie, as the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Which you may command, no ground of fear or
danger remaining, if a good confidence were begot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
your Majestie and the Parliament; whose grave
and loyal Counsels are, as we humbly conceive, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way, under God, to put a speedie end to the troubles
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and establish your Throne in Righteousnesse.
And lastly, we humbly supplicate that we may represent
our unfitnesse to become Iudges betwixt your Majestie
and Parliament in any thing, or dispute the Authority of
either; which we humbly conceive do fortifie each other,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The king was not well satisfied, or pleased with
this Petition, but persisted still in his former way of
raising Forces, under the name of a Guard; whilst
the Parliament were voting to maintain those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
their Committee in the North, in such things as
they have done, and shall further do in obedience to
their commands, for preservation of the Kingdom's
Peace; as also to maintain their Ordinance concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to issue out Commissions into all
parts of the Kingdom, and appoint certain days for
all the Trained Bands to be exercised in each County
according to that Ordinance; and that some Members
might be sent into the several Counties, to see the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
performed; and the Magazines of those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Counties in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> to be forthwith
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96346:95"/>
put into the power of the Lord Lieutenants of the
said Counties, being such as were entrusted by the
Parliament. And whereas the King had made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
for all the Gentlemen and others of that
County to attend him in Arms as a Guard; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
three days after declared, that it was against
the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, that any of
the Subjects thereof should be commanded by the
King to attend him at his pleasure, but such as are
bound thereto by special service; and that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
upon pretence of his command, shall take Arms,
and gather together with others in a warlike manner,
to the terrour of the King's people, shall be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
disturbers of the publike peace: and that the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
of those Counties where such raising or drawing
of armed men should be, should immediately raise
the power of the Countie to suppresse them, and keep
the King's Peace according to Law.</p>
                  <p>So different and directly contrary, at this time, were
the Commands of the King and Parliament, in all
things, that the Lords in Parliament having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that the King was resolved to adjourn the next
Term from <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and had given com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to the Lord Keeper to issue Proclamations and
Writs to that purpose, voted that such a removal of
the Term, while the Parliament sate, was illegal; and
ordered that the Lord Keeper should not issue any
Writs, or seal any Proclamation tending to that end.</p>

                  <p>At the revolt of so many members from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the Kingdom in general began to fear; and
all that loved the Nations Peace, were in an high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

heard, in all meetings and discourses, but sad presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of misery to the Kingdom, if Almighty God

                     </gap> That as the ruine of <hi>England</hi> could not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
be wrought but by it self; so the Parliament
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96346:97"/>
could not be broken (a Prologue to the other) but
by her own Members, and that sentence verified, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio
tua ex te.</hi> Though the opinions of men differed
concerning the censure of those Members; while
some condemned, others in some degree excused
them, according as affection and private interests did
lead them: yet concerning the Effects which that
Revolt in all probability must produce, all rational
men concurred in opinion, that nothing but Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Ruine could flow from it. What else (said
they) can this Revolt do, but nourish and increase
the King's disaffection to the Parliament? What,
but encourage his distance from it, and attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it? What, but secure the Irish Rebels, and
endanger the losse of that Kingdom; cherish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
obstruct Justice, and give impunity to all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents?
Nothing else had power to undermine
and shake the dignity and reverence belonging to
that high Court; whilst not onely the People by that
diminution of their number, were perswaded to
esteem of it as an imperfect Parliament; but the
King might take that advantage of it (which proved
true in his succeeding Declarations and Writings,
what he never did before) as to call them a Faction,
or pretended Parliament, and such like.</p>
                  <p>In censuring those Lords and Commons who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
the Parliament, the People, as was said before,
did much differ. Some considering how great the
number was, that many of them were of whole
estates, of good reputation, and able parts, began to
to think, or at least to say, that the Parliament was
not free enough; that those Members (which was
also their own excuse) were curbed by a prevalent
faction in the Houses, and over-awed by tumults from
the City of <hi>London.</hi> Upon that occasion, they called
to minde in what manner the names of nine and fifty
Members of the House of Commons had been posted
up at the Exchange, for dissenting from the rest
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96346:97"/>
about condemning of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> besides
what menacing speeches had been given by rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to some Lords, whom they thought ill-affected.</p>
                  <p>Others answered, that although such things had
been rashly and foolishly done by some unadvised
persons, yet it could not be feared that any tumults
from the Citie would ever violate a Parliament sitting;
and that the tumultuous appearance of such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
from the Citie, was rather intended for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
and security of the Parliament against such
invasions as might be made upon them, to aw their
just freedom, and treacherous Conspiracies which by
report were made against them by people disaffected
to that high Court; which that Plot of bringing the
Army against them formerly, and late resorts of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons about <hi>White-hall,</hi> gave them cause to fear:
That no fears of danger could be pretended from the
House it self against any Member, but such as that
Member was bound to undergo and suffer, rather then
betray so great a trust of the people: That it was to
be presumed, no Member of Parliament who was
well-affected to his Country, could suffer any thing
from the house it self; whose ends and counsels
must needs be supposed to tend to the publike good,
or else our Ancestours, who constituted that Frame
of Government, were much deceived: That it was
very improbable the Liberty of Subjects should be
violated by that Court, which is the onely defence and
conserver of it, and without which, it had always
suffered from Princes, yea, such Princes as were not
very wicked.</p>
                  <p>They alleadged that it was very dishonourable for
those Lords, being the greater number, to pretend
fear for deserting the Parliament: for if it were upon
a true dislike of any proceedings there, they were
enow to haved stayed, and perchance have cured those
inconveniences, and too many to have suffered in a
good Cause; though Honour would command one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96346:98"/>
man alone, lawfully called to it, to maintain a truth
with any hazard. On the other side, they were too
many to flee, to encourage the King against his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and thereby soment that dissention which
could produce no good effect.</p>
                  <p>It was alleadged by many men, that some of those
Lords were Noble-men of honourable and vertuous
repute. Though that were not denied, nor could
any certain signe from the former d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>meanours of the
Lords in general, arise, to distinguish who were likely
to adhere to the Parliament, and who to desert it (for
they were deceived on both sides, in some particulars)
yet certainly it was averred, that those Lords whom
the people had most especially trusted in, as true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
proved to be part of those who continued in
the House; and those whom the people in general
distasted or distrusted, happened to be among those
who upon this occasion forsook the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It was likewise frequently spoken, that those Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House of Commons who deserted it, were
men generally of as able parts as any that continued
there. It was no wonder, (replied others) but very
probable that they were such men, and such as had, or
thought they had good parts enough to be looked
upon by a Prince: for those men (though we
should esteem them all of equal honesty) were likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to fall off. There is a difference between Wisdom
and good Parts, such as we count Eloquence, Wit,
polite Learning, and the like: and that Wisdom
which is least adorned with such dresses as these, is
usually at such times most safe in it self, and freest
from being corrupted; as that Beauty is, which is set
off with the least witchery of Attire: for that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which is curiously decked, as it is most subject to
be tempted by others; so it is most apt to be proud
of it self, and by consequence, to betray it self to such
a temptation as is great enough. So it hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
seen in this case (as was observed by an old
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96346:98"/>
Parliament-man) that those Gentlemen of fine parts,
when other men of a plainer wisedom have had the
honour in a constant way to do excellent service for
the Common-wealth, have been won from their
Countrey's cause, as soon as Majestie hath at all
vouchsafed to tempt them, or that perchance their
opinion of themselves hath made them meet or seek
such a temptation. Besides that danger of invitation
from a King, it hath been too often known, that men
of such parts, or that think so of themselves, have been
apter to take pet, and grow angry, when any Speech of
theirs hath not received that honour which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
or any other affront hath been offered to them;
and what such an anger may make proud and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spirits to do, even against their own Country,
and the dictates of their Conscience and Reason, the
world hath been taught by many examples, some of
high consequence, and very remarkable, such as CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOLANUS
the Romane, and JULIAN the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
General, which for the eminence of the persons,
and extraordinary effects which they wrought in the
world, must needs fall into Record; when the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of mean and private men are buried in oblivion.
Besides, there are many, whose Callings make them
capable of easier and greater gratifications from the
King then other men; as Lawyers and Divines; who
will therefore be apt to lean that way where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
lies. Such discourses were frequent in all
companies at that time, for different affections did at
all meetings beget such argumentative language.</p>
                  <p>What sense and apprehension the Parliament had
of so many Members forsaking their station, shall
appear anon, by a Vote passed in the House of
Commons, and presented to the Lords by Master
DENZIL HOLLLS, after some intervening passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
have been related.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the King encouraged and strengthened by
this great accession of reputation to his side, pursued
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96346:99"/>
his designe of raising Forces in the North; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after that they had on the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ioned
the King to disband such Forces, and rely
for his security (as his Predecessours had done) upon
the Laws, and affections of his People, contenting
himself with his usual and ordinary Guards; declared
that otherwise they held themselves bound in duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and the Trust reposed in them by the
People, and by the Fundamental Laws and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Kingdom, to employ their care and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
power to secure the Parliament, and preserve the
Kingdom's Peace; and immediately it was voted in
Parliament, and resolved upon the Question, <hi>That
it appears that the King, seduced by wicked Counsel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make War against the Parliament, who in all
their consultations and actions have proposed no other
end unto themselves, but the care of his Kingdoms, and
the performance of all duty and loyaltie to his Person.</hi> It
was likewise resolved upon the Question, <hi>That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the King maketh War upon the Parliament, it is
a breach of the Trust reposed in him by his People, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Lords HOWARD of <hi>Charleton,</hi> RICH, GREY of

refused to come away, returning an Answer in
writing; which the Parliament judged to be a slighting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96346:99"/>
and scornful Letter: Upon which, a Vote was passed
against them in the house of Commons, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the 15 of <hi>Iune</hi> to the Lords, by Master HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS;
with an Oration of his own concerning the
importance of the businesse; the greatest part of
which Speech being here inserted, may give light to
the Reader concerning the condition of the Kingdom
at that time, and the judgement of the Houses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                  <div type="speech">
                     <head>His Speech began thus:</head>
                     <q>
                        <p>My Lords, By command of the Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and Burgesses of the house of Commons, I
come hither to your Lordships in behalf of the
Parliament, or rather in behalf of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
labouring with much distraction, many fears,
great apprehensions of evil and mischief intended
against it, and now hatching and preparing by
that malignant party, which thirsts after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Religion, Laws and Liberty; all which
are folded up, cherished and preserved in the careful
bosome of the Parliament.</p>
                        <p>It hath ever been the policie of evil Counsellors
(who are the greatest enemies we have in the world,
or can have) to strike at Parliaments, keep off
Parliaments, break Parliaments, or divide Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by making Factions, casting in Diversions
and Obstructions, to hinder and interrupt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Parliament; all against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordships have had experience of this
Truth this Parliament; a succession of designes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: First, to aw it, and take away the freedom
of it by the terrour of an Army; then, to bring
Force against it, actually to assault it, and with the
Sword to cut in sunder this onely Band which ties
and knits up King and People, the People among
themselves, and the whole frame of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96346:100"/>
in one firm, and I hope indissoluble knot of
Peace and Unity.</p>
                        <p>God diverted those designes, did blowe upon
them; presently, another is set upon, which
was, To obstruct and hinder our proceedings, that
in the mean time the flame of Rebellion might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and distempers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
and jealousies be somented here at home,
to tear out the bowels of this Kingdom, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being disabled from helping it, by occasion of
so many diversions, so much businesse cut out unto
it, many obstructions and difficulties, especially
that great one, from whence all the rest receive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and support, his Majestie's absenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
not concurring with us, and so withdrawing
both his presence and influence; by which means
such remedies could not be applied as were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and what was done, was done with infinite trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Parliament, and excessive charge to the
Subject, double, treble, what otherwise would have
served the turn: So the Subject is grieved, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with charge, and the blame of all is laid
upon the Parliament, and the Parliament unjustly
said to be the cause of all these Evils, which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of them had made so great, and so confirmed
and secured by the frequent interruptions of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that they could not suddenly nor easily be
suppressed or removed.</p>
                        <p>Well, by God's infinite blessing, the Parliament
was in a fair possibility to wade thorow this likewise;
and though the Night had been black and stormy,
some Day began to appear: miraculously our Armies
have prospered in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and God be praised, the
malevolent practices of these Vipers at home, as they
appeared, were in some sort mastered; and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
began to act and operate towards the setling
of the great Affairs both of Church and State, and
providing for the defence and safety of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96346:100"/>
against either forraign Invasion, or any striving
of the disaffected party among themselves.</p>
                        <p>Then three ways are together assayed for the
weakning and invalidating the proceeding and
power of the Parliament, and making way for the
utter subversion of it.</p>
                        <p>1. Force is gathered together at <hi>York,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Guard for His Majesties Person, to make
an opposition against the Parliament, and by strong
hand to support and protect Delinquents, so as no
Order of Parliament can be obeyed, but on the other
side is slighted and scorned, to make the Parliament
of no reputation, to be but <hi>Imago Parliamenti,</hi> a
meer shadow, without substance, without efficacie.</p>
                        <p>2. To send out in His Majesties name, and as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
and Messages from him, bitter invectives
against the Parliament, to perplex it, and engage it
in expence of time to answer them: and besides,
cunningly to insinuate and infuse into the people by
false colours and glosses, a disopinion and dislike of
the Parliament, and if it be possible, to stir up their
spirits to rise against it, to destroy it, (and in it,
all other Parliaments) to the ruine of themselves,
their wives and children.</p>
                        <p>3. The third Plot is: The Members are drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and perswaded to forsake their duty and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
here, and go down to <hi>York,</hi> thereby to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
the actions of both Houses, as done by a few
and an inconsiderable number, and rather a Party
then a Parliament, and perhaps to raise and set up
an anti-Parliament there.</p>
                        <p>My Lords, this is now the great Designe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they hope by little and little the Parliament
shall even bleed to death, and moulder to nothing,
the members dropping away one after another: a
desperate and dangerous practice, and as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
well observed (when you were pleased to
communicate the businesse to us) an effect of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96346:101"/>
evil Counsels now prevailing, and tending to the
dissolution of the Parliament, of this Parliament,
which under God must be the preserver of three
Kingdoms, and keep them firm and loyal to their
King, subject to his Crown, save them from being
turned into a Chaos of disorder and confusion, and
made a dismal spectacle of misery and desolarion;
this Parliament, which is the last hope of the long-oppressed,
and in other Countries even almost
wholly-destroyed Protestant Religion: this Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is the onely means to continue us to be
a Nation of freedom, and not of slaves; to be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of any thing: in a word, which must stand in
the Gap, to prevent an in-let and inundation of all
misery and confusion.</p>
                        <p>My Lords, this Parliament they desire to destroy;
but I hope it will destroy the destroyers, and be a
wall of Fire to consume them, as it is a wall of Brasse
to us, to defend King, and Kingdom, us, and all
we have.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordships wisely foresaw this Mischief,
and as wisely have endeavoured to prevent it, by
making your Orders to keep your Members here;
as that of the ninth of <hi>April,</hi> and several other Orders
enjoyning them all to attend; thereby restraining
them from repairing to <hi>York,</hi> where the Clouds
were observed to gather so fast, threatning a storm,
and such preparations to be made against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it necessitated both Houses to passe a
Vote, <hi>That the King, seduced by wicked Counsel,
intended to make War against the Parliament: and all
who shall serve and assist in such Wars, are declared
to be Traitours:</hi> which Vote passed the 20 of <hi>May:</hi>
so setting a mark upon that place, and their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning those who should at this time resort
thither.</p>
                        <p>Yet now, in such a conjuncture of time, when
the Kingdom had never more need of a Parliament,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96346:101"/>
and the Parliament never more need of all the help
and assistance, of the best endeavour and advice of
every Member; the Safety, and even Being of three
Kingdoms depending on it; after such Orders and
Commands of your Lordships House to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
such a Vote of both Houses; and expressely
against their Duty; being called thither by Writ
under the Great Seal, which is the King's greatest
and highest Command, and not controllable, nor
to be dispensed with by any other Command from
him whatsoever; and called to treat and consult <hi>de

such a time as both Houses had declared, That the
King, seduced by wicked Counsel, intended to make
War against the Parliament; and their still continuing
at <hi>York,</hi> notwithstanding their Summons and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

in this Particular, and in pursuance of their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
which obliges them to endeavour to bring to

not onely the Priviledges, but the very Essence of

Lords, and desire that speedy and exemplary Justice
may be done upon them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And accordingly,</hi> I do here, in the name of the
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the Commons
House assembled in Parliament, and in the name of all
the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> Impeach <hi>SPENCER Earl
of</hi> Northampton, <hi>WILLIAM Earl of</hi> Devonshire,
<hi>HENRY Earl of</hi> Dover, <hi>HENRY Earl of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
<hi>CHARLES Lord HOWARD of</hi> Charleton,
<hi>ROBERT Lord RICH, CHARLES Lord GREY

to their duty, they being Peers of the Realm, and
summoned by Writ to attend the Parliament; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to an Order of the House of Peers of the ninth of
<hi>April</hi> last, and several other Orders requiring the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
of the Members of that House; and after a
Vote past in both Houses the twentieth of <hi>May</hi> last,
That the King, seduced by wicked Counsel, intended
to make War against the Parliament; and that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
served or assisted him in that War, was adjudged
a Traitour; did notwithstanding afterwards, in the
same month of <hi>May,</hi> contemptuously, having notice of
the said Votes and Orders, withdraw themselves from
the said House of Peers, and repair to the City of
<hi>York,</hi> where the preparations of the said War were,
and yet are, in contrivance and agitation; they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such preparations: and being by an Order of
the thirtieth of <hi>May</hi> duely summoned by the House of
Peers, to make their appearance before that House upon
the eighth day of <hi>June</hi> last past, they refused to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96346:102"/>
and returned a scornful Answer by a Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hands, directed to the Speaker of the Lords
House, and remaining there upon Record.</p>
                        <p>For which Crimes and Misdemeanours, to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the proceedings of Parliament, and great
Affairs of the Kingdom, and tending to the dissolution
of the Parliament, and disturbance of the Peace of the
Kingdom; I am commanded, in the name of the said
Commons, to demand of your Lordships that the said
Lords may be forthwith put to their Answer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
speedy and exemplary punishment, according to
their demerits. The Commons saving to themselves
liberty at all times hereafter, to exhibite any other or
further Impeachment or Accusation against the said
Lords, or any of them.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Upon this Impeachment of the nine Lords, the
House of Peers, about a month after, being in their
Robes, entred into debate of the said Impeachment;
and after divers Speeches made by some Lords, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth the greatnesse of their Offence, they were
censured, 1. Never to sit more as Members of that
House. 2. That they should be utterly uncapable
of any benefit or priviledges of Parliament. 3. That
they should suffer Imprisonment during their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
After which Censure, it was concluded that
the said Lords should be demanded, in the behalf of
both Houses of Parliament, to submit to the said Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>About that time, when the Members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament did daily forsake their station, and
repair to the King at <hi>York,</hi> another accident fell out,
which gave a great wound to the Parliament, and
much encouragement to the King in his designes;
which was the carrying away of the Great Seal of
<hi>England</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>EDWARD Lord LITTLETON, on whom the
King, when the Lord Keeper FINCH fled out of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96346:103"/>
                        <hi>England,</hi> as is before related, had conferred the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Great Seal (he being before Lord chief
Justice of the Common-Pleas, and created a Baron of
the Realm) had continued for some space of time,
after the rest were gone to <hi>York,</hi> firm to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all appearance, and upon all occasions voted
according to the sense of those that seemed the best af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
that way; and among other things, gave his
Vote for setling the <hi>Militia</hi> by Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
insomuch that there seemed no doubt at all to
be made of his constancy; till at the last, before the
end of the month of <hi>Iune,</hi> a young Gentleman, one
Master <hi>Thomas Eliot,</hi> Groom of the Privie Chamber
to the King, was sent closely from <hi>York</hi> to him; who
being admitted by the Lord Keeper into his private
Chamber, when none else were by, so handled the
matter, whether by perswasions, threats, or promises,
or whatsoever, that after three hours time, he got the
great Seal into his hands, and rid post with it away to
the King at <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord Keeper L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>TTLETON, after serious
consideration with himself what he had done, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffered, and not being able to answer it to the
Parliament; the next day, early in the morning, rode
after it himself, and went to the King.</p>
                     <p>Great was the complaint at <hi>London</hi> against him for
that action; nor did the King ever shew him any great
regard afterwards. The reason which the Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
LITTLETON gave, for parting so with the
great Seal, to some friends of his who went after him
to <hi>York,</hi> was this; That the King, when he made him
Lord Keeper, gave him an Oath in private, which he
took, That whensoever the King should send to him
for the great Seal, he should forthwith deliver it. This
Oath (as he averred to his friends) his conscience
would by no means suffer him to dispense withal; he
onely repented (though now too late) that he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the Office upon those terms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:96346:103"/>
The Parliament, to prevent so sad a War, sent out
two Orders; one, to all Sheriffs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Justices, and other
Officers within 150 miles of the City of <hi>York,</hi> that
they should take special care to make stay of all Arms
and Ammunition carrying towards <hi>York,</hi> until they
have given notice thereof to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and received their further direction; and to
that purpose, to keep strict Watches within their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
limits, to search for, and seize all such Arms, and
apprehend the persons going with the same: The
other was to the Sheriff of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Counties, to suppresse the raising and coming
together of any Souldiers, Horse or Foot, by any
Warrant from the King, without the advice of the
Lords and Commons in Parliament; as likewise to
declare all that should execute any such Warrant from
the King, disturbers of the peace of the Kingdom;
and to command the Trained Bands to be assistant to
the Sheriffs in that service.</p>
                     <p>These Orders of the Parliament were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered by a Proclamation from the King, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
all his Subjects belonging to the Trained
Bands, or <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdom, to rise, march,
muster, or exercise by vertue of any Order or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of one or both Houses of Parliament, without
Consent or Warrant from his Majestie. The Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
notwithstanding proceed in setling the <hi>Militia</hi>
of the Kingdom (having made on the second of <hi>Iune</hi>
an Order for those revolted members to return to
their duty again before the 16 of that month, under
the forfeiture of an hundred pound, to be disposed
to the Wars in <hi>Ireland,</hi> besides undergoing such pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
as the Houses should think fit) and had by
this time at many places began to settle the said <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the same second of <hi>Iune</hi> also, the Lords and
Commons sent a Petition to the King, with nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Propositions; which the King received with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96346:104"/>
great indignation, as appeared in his Answer to them
both in general, and in divers Particulars concerning
those Propositions, as esteeming himself injured in

                     <p>To these Propositions sent from the Parliament, the
King returned such an Answer, as shewed that he was
much displeased with the whole Businesse: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his particular Answers to the several Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he complaineth in general, and those very sharp,
expressions of the method of their proceedings against
him: and that the Cabalists of this businesse (for so
he calls them) have used great art and subtilty against
him, first to strengthen themselves with unlawful
power, before they make their illegal demands. He
taxes them, that first they had removed the Law it self,
as a rub in their way, and pressed their own Orders
and Ordinances upon the people (tending to a pure
arbitrary power) as Laws, and required obedience to
them, without the consent or concurrence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
That they had wrested from him the command
of the <hi>Militia,</hi> (a thing inherent in his Crown) coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
the Treason of HOTHAM against him, and
directed to the people invectives against his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to weaken his just authority and due esteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Subjects; casting upon him aspersions of a
strange nature, as, that he should favour a Rebellion in
the bowels of his Kingdom. He complains likewise
that they had broached (for so he calls it) a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
namely, that the King is bound to passe all Laws
that shall be offered to him by both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
a point of policie fit for their present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as destructive to all his Rights. That they have
overawed his Subjects, in stifling all Petitions that did
not please them; and filled the peoples ears with
needlesse fears, and jealousies, and such like things,
before they thought his Majestie sufficiently prepared
to take those bitter Pills. For (saith he) <hi>if they had
unseasonably vented such Propositions, as the wisdom and
modestie of their Predecessours never thought fit to offer
to any of Our Progenitours, nor We in honour or regard
to Our Regal Authority (which God hath intrusted Vs
with for the good of Our People) could receive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96346:107"/>
just indignation (for such many of the present Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
are) their hopes would soon have been blasted,
and those persons to whom Offices, Honours, Power, and
Commands were designed, by such ill timing of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
would have failed of their expectation, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a brand upon the Attempt.</hi> Therefore he saith, that
they had made before-hand those fore-named prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The King seems to doubt likewise, because
the Parliament have not told him that this is all they
desire of him, that these Propositions are probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make way for a Superfetation of a (yet)
higher nature. And in the Propositions in general
he observes, that the Contrivers of them (the better
to advance their true ends) disguised as much as
they could, their intents with a mixture of some
things really to be approved by every honest man, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
specious and popular, and some already granted
by him: All which (saith he) are cunningly twisted,
and mixed with other things of their main designe of
ambition and private interest.</p>
                     <p>But the King desires not to be understood so, as if
he intended to fix this designe upon both or either
House of Parliament: for he utterly professeth against
it, being most confident of the loyalty, good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and integrity of the intentions of that great
Body, and knowing well that very many of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were absent, and many dissented from all those
particulars of which he complains: but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
and accordingly professes to all the world, that
the malignity of this designe hath proceeded from
the subtil informations, mischievous practices, and
evil counsels of some ambitious turbulent spirits, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to God's true Religion (using their own
language) the Unity of the professours thereof, his
Honour and Safety, and the publike peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of the people. (And such other like General
expressions.)</p>
                     <p>In particular, the King expressed himself with great
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96346:108"/>
indignation against ten of their Propositions, which
were the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19: averring,
that if they did intend the establishment of his honour,
together with the security of his people (as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is) they would not offer him such Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for that Profession, joyned to these Propositions,
appeared to his judgement as a mockery and scorn.</p>
                     <p>He averreth further, that their Demands are such,
as that he were unworthy of that Royal descent from
so many famous Ancestours, unworthy of the Trust
reposed in him by the Laws, if he should devest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of such a power so inherent in his Crown, and
assume others into it; protesting, that if he were both
vanquished, and a prisoner, in worse condition then
any the most unfortunate of his predecessours had
ever been reduced unto, he would never stoop so
lowe as to grant those demands, and to make himself
of a King of <hi>England,</hi> a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The several Answers that the King made, and
Arguments that he used to each several branch of those
Propositions, are too large to be here inserted, and
may be read by those that would be further informed,
in the printed Book of Parliament-Declarations and
Ordinances.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the tenth day of <hi>Iune</hi> following, an
Order was made by both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for bringing in of Money and
Plate, to maintain Horse, Horse-men
and Arms for Preservation of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Peace,
and defence of the King's Person (for
that the Parliament in their expressions always joyned
together with their own safety) and both Houses of
Parliament. Wherein it was expressed, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
should bring in any Money or Plate, or furnish
any Horse-men and Arms for that purpose, should
have their Money repayed with Interest, according to
eight in the hundred; for which both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
did engage the Publike Faith.</p>
                  <p>Four Treasurers were ordained, whose Acquittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for the receipt of any Sum, should be a sufficient
ground to the Lenders to demand their Money and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96346:109"/>
Plate again with the Interest belonging thereunto.
The Treasurers were Sir JOHN WOLLASTON Knight
and Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> Alderman TOWES, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
WARNER, and Alderman ANDREWES.
Commissaries also were appointed to value the Horse
and Arms which should be furnished for that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>It was desired in that Order, that all men resident
in or about <hi>London,</hi> or within 80 miles, would bring
in their money, Plate, or Horse within a fortnight
after notice; and they that dwell farther off, within
three weeks: and that those who intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
within the time limited, but were not for the
present provided of money or Horse, should subscribe,
that it might be soon known what provision would
be for effecting of that great and important Service.
And in conclusion, it was declared, that whatsoever
was brought in, should be imployed to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
but those before mentioned; the maintenance
of the Protestant Religion, the King's Person, dignity
and authority, the Laws of the Land, the Peace of the
Kingdom, and Priviledges of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Whilest this Order was drawing up, advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Letters was given to the Parliament, that
the Crown-Jewels were pawned at Amsteldam, and
other places of the Netherlands; upon which money
was taken up, and Warlike Ammunition provided in
those Parts, as Battering-pieces, Culverins, Field-pieces,
Morter-pieces, Granadoes, with great store of
powder, pistols, carabines, great saddles, and such
like. Whereby the Parliament thought they could
not otherwise judge, then that the King did plainly
intend a War against them, and had designed it long
before.</p>
                  <p>They received intelligence at the same time, that the
King had sent a Commission of <hi>Array</hi> into <hi>Leicester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
directed to the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Devonshire,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> HENRY HASTINGS, second son to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96346:109"/>
the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> (for the Lord HASTINGS
eldest son to that Earl, did then adhere to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
which three were chief in the Commission; but
many other Knights and Gentlemen of that County
were named in it. Together with this Commission of
Array, the King sent a Letter also, containing the
reasons of it, wherein he complaineth that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
by their Ordinance for the <hi>Militia,</hi> would
devest him of that power which is properly inherent
in his Crown. And for the occasion and reason of
that Commission, he urgeth a Declaration of their
own, using their very expressions and words in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
that whereas it hath been declared by Votes of
both Houses of Parliament, the fifteenth of <hi>March</hi>
last, that the Kingdom hath of late been, and still is in
evident and imminent danger, both from enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and a Popish disconted party at home; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that for the safeguard both of his own Person
and People, there is an urgent and inevitable necessity
of putting his people into a posture of defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus did the Parliaments Prologue to their Ordinance
of <hi>Militia,</hi> serve the King's turn for his Commission
of Array, <hi>totidem verbis.</hi> The copie of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Letter coming into the hands of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
it was resolved upon the Question by the
Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, that
<hi>this Commission of Array for</hi> Leicester <hi>is against Law,
and against the Liberty and Property of the Subject:</hi> and
resolved again upon the Question, within two days
after, <hi>That all those that are actours in putting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Array in execution, shall be esteemed as distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Kingdoms Peace, and betrayers of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Subject.</hi> It was also ordered by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that this Commission of <hi>Array,</hi> and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Votes, should be forthwith printed, and
published thorow the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The King was not wanting to his own designe in
the mean time, and whatsoever might give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96346:110"/>
to the businesse he had in hand: but made a
short Declaration to the Lords who then attended him
at <hi>York,</hi> and others his Privie Councel there, in these
words:</p>
                  <p>We do declare, that We will require no obedience
from you, but what is warranted by the known Laws,
as We expect that you shall not yeeld to any Commands not
legally grounded, or imposed by any other. We will defend
all you, and all such as shall refuse any such Commands,
whether they proceed from Votes and Orders of both
Houses, or any other way, from all danger whatsoever.
We will defend the true Protestant Religion established
by the Laws, the lawful Liberties of the Subjects of
<hi>England,</hi> and just Priviledges of all the three Estates
of Parliament; and shall require no further obedience
from you, then as We accordingly shall perform the same.
We will not (as is falsely pretended) engage you in any
War against the Parliament, except it be for Our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
defence against such as do insolently invade, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against Vs and Our Adherents.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Declaration of the King, those Lords
and others of his Councel made a Promise to him, and
subscribed it with their hands, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>We do engage our selves not to obey any Orders or
Commands whatsoever, not warranted by the known
Laws of the Land. We engage our selves to defend
Your Majesties Person, Crown and Dignity, with Your
just and legal Prerogative, against all Persons and Power
whatsoever. We will defend the true Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
established by the Law of the land, the lawful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and just Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Your Majestie, and both Houses of Parliament.
Lastly, we engage our selves not to obey any Rule, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Ordinance whatsoever, concerning any <hi>Militia,</hi>
that hath not the Royal Assent.</p>

Sir JOHN CULPEPER, Lord
Chief Justice BANKS.</p>
                  <p>The King immediately wrote a Letter to the Lord
Maior of <hi>London,</hi> the Aldermen and Sheriffs, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by expresse Command any Contribution of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Plate, toward the raising of any Arms whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for the Parliament; and that they should lend no
Money, unlesse toward the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scots. He published then a Declaration
to all his Subjects, inveighing bitterly against the
Parliament, for laying a false and scandalous imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon him of raising War against the Parliament,
or levying Forces to that end: in which he invites all
his loving Subjects, to prevent his own danger, and the
danger of the Kingdom from a malignant party (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up the Parliaments language) to contribute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Plate to him, and they shall be repayed, with
consideration of eight in the hundred. And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon it made a Profession before those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Lords and Councellours about him (call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God to witnesse in it) disavowing any prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96346:111"/>
or intentions to levie War against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
upon which, those forementioned Lords, and
others, then present at <hi>York,</hi> made this Declaration
and Profession, subscribed under their hands.</p>
                  <p>We whose names are under-written, in obedience to
His Majesties Desire, and out of the Duty which we owe
to His Majesties Honour, and to Truth, being here upon
the place, and witnesses of His Majesties frequent and
earnest Declarations and Professions of His abhorring
all designes of making War upon the Parliament; and
not seeing any colour of Preparations or Counsels that
might reasonably beget the belief of any such Designe,
do professe before God, and testifie to all the world, that
we are fully perswaded that His Majestie hath no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
but that all his endeavours tend to the firm and
constant settlement of the true Protestant Religion, and
the just Priviledges of Parliament, the liberty of the
Subject, the Law, Peace and Prosperity of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>The King strengthned with Arms and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from <hi>Holland,</hi> and more strengthened (for as yet
he wanted hands to weild those Arms) by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of Lords in his behalf concerning his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of not making War against the Parliament,
whereby the people might more easily be drawn to
side with him, proceeded in his businesse with great
policie and indefatigable industry. His Pen was
quick in giving answer to all Petitions or Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which came from the Parliament; and with many
sharp expostulations, in a well-compiled Discourse,
on the 17 of <hi>Iune,</hi> answered a Petition of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which Petition was to this effect, that he
would not disjoyn his Subjects in their duty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and Parliament, destroying the Essence of that
high Court; which was presented to him at <hi>York</hi> by
the Lord HOWARD, Sir HUGH CHOLMELY, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96346:111"/>
Sir PHILIP STAPLETON: And within three
weeks, both in his own Person, and by his Messengers,
with Speeches, Proclamations, and Declarations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
his businesse in a wonderful manner. At
<hi>Newark</hi> he made a Speech to the Gentry of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamshire</hi>
in a loving and winning way, commending
their affections toward him; which was a great part
of perswasion for the future, coming from a King
himself. Another Speech he made at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to the
Gentry of that County, full of Protestations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his good intentions, not onely to them, but
to the whole Kingdom, the Laws and Liberties of it.
In that short time also, by the help of many subtil
Lawyers, whom he had about him, he returned a very
long and particular Answer, with arguing the case in
all points, to a Declaration which the Parliament had
before made against the Commission of <hi>Array,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
that Statute 5 HEN. 4, whereupon that
Commission was supposed to be warranted. The
proofs and arguments on both sides, are to be read at
large in the Records, or in the printed Book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and Declarations, where a Reader may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his own judgement. Within that time also the
King sent out a Proclamation against levying Forces
without his Command, urging Laws and Statutes for
it: And another long Proclamation to inform the
people of the legality of his Commissions of <hi>Array,</hi>
and to command obedience to them. Another he
sent forth against the forcible seizing or removing
any Magazine of Ammunition of any County; and
another, forbidding all relieving or succouring of
<hi>Hull</hi> against him. Upon which, the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that those Proclamations, without their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
were illegal; and forbade all Sheriffs, Maiors,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to proclaim them, and all Parsons and Curates to
or publish them.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>York</hi> the King removed to <hi>Beverley;</hi> from
whence he sent a Message to both Houses, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96346:112"/>
concerning his going to <hi>Hull,</hi> to take it in;
requiring, before his journey, that it might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to him. But that Message of his came to the
House of Peers, after they had agreed upon a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was drawn up, to move the King to a good
accord with his Parliament, to prevent a Civil War;
to be carried to him, and presented at <hi>Beverley,</hi> by
the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Sir JOHN HOLLAND, and Sir
PHILIP STAPLETON. That very Petition seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them so full an answer to the King's Message,
that both Houses resolved to give no other answer to
that Message, but the said Petition. But immediately
after, a Declaration was published by both Houses of
Parliament, for the preservation and safety of the
Kingdom, and the Town of <hi>Hull;</hi> with assurance of
both Houses to satisfie all losse sustained by any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done for the safety of the said Town, by reason
of overflowing of water upon the grounds there, to
all persons who should be found faithful in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
services.</p>
                  <p>The King continued resolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in his intention of
gaining <hi>Hull:</hi> By what means he attempted it, and
how those attempts proved to be frustrate, is now the
subject of a short Discourse.</p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Hull</hi> was not more considerable to
the Kingdom as a Maritime and strong place, then it
was now made remarkable to the world in many high
and famous circumstances of this Civil War: for
which cause, I shall the more particularly insist upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hull</hi> was the place which (being intrusted with
so rich a Magazine of Ammunition) did probably
allure the King to forsake a Parliament sitting at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and visite the North. <hi>Hull</hi> was the place where
the King in person did first finde his Commands deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his attempts resisted in an actual way; which
proved the subject of so many Declarations and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
of State and Government: and <hi>Hull</hi> is the
place which must now bear the first brunt of his armed
indignation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:96346:112"/>
The King with an Army of three thousand foot,
and one thousand horse, was removed from <hi>York</hi> to
<hi>Beverley,</hi> a Town distant from <hi>Hull</hi> six miles; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to besiege <hi>Hull</hi> by Land (expecting also that
Sir JOHN PENINGTON with some of his ships
should stop the passages, and cut of provisions from
relieving the Town by Sea, though that expectation
were made frustrate by the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> his sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
on the Navie Royal) proclaimed that none, on
pain of death, should convey any provision or relief
thither. He disposed many men in cutting of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to divert the current of fresh water that ran to
<hi>Hull,</hi> and sent two hundred horse into <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>
under the command of the Lord WILLOUGHBY
son to the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and Sir THOMAS
GLENHAM, to stop all relief of it from <hi>Burton</hi>
upon <hi>Humber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir JOHN HOTHAM perceiving the King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and endeavours, and knowing him to be in
person within an hour and halfs march of the Town,
having first sent three Messengers, one after another,
with humble Petitions to him, who were all laid fast
by the King, and not suffered to return; called a
Councel of War, in which it was debated, Whether
or not they should permit the enemies to march neer
the Town with their Ordnance, holding them play
from off the Walls and Out-works, until the Tide
came to its hight, and then draw up the Sluce, and let
them swim for their lives. But a more merciful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
prevailed, which was, (for prevention of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deaths) to draw up the Sluce presently, having
the advantage of a Spring-tide, and drown all the
Countrey about <hi>Hull.</hi> But Sir JOHN HOTHAM,
before it was done, gave the inhabitants and owners of
land thereabout sufficient and timely notice to remove
their Cattel, and all their goods, and assured them
(which was ratified by the Parliament upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Faith) that whatsoever damage they received
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96346:113"/>
thereby, should be repaired by the authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
out of the estates of those persons who had
been most active and assistant to the King in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
                  <p>Sir JOHN by Letters informed the Parliament in what
condition the Town was, desiring onely (so it might
speedily be done) a supply of Money and Victuals,
with five hundred men. Upon which, by command
of Parliament, Drums were beat up in <hi>London,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adjacent places, for Souldiers to be sent to <hi>Hull</hi>
by Sea. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was desired by the
Houses to send two of the King's ships from the
<hi>Downs</hi> to <hi>Hull,</hi> to do as Sir JOHN HOTHAM should
direct for his best assistance. And Sir JOHN MELDRUM
a Scotish Gentleman, an expert and brave Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
was appointed to assist Sir JOHN in that service.</p>
                  <p>The King's Army were not confident to carry the
Town by plain force, making their approaches with
great difficulty and disadvantage, and those for the
most part in the night-time, when undiscovered they
burnt two Mills about the Town; they therefore had
recourse to subtilty; and knowing some within the
Walls sit for their purpose, a Plot was therefore laid
to fire the town in four places, which whilst the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and inhabitants were busie in quenching, two
thousand of the King's Army should assault the walls.
The signe to those within the town, when to fire those
places, was, when they discerned a fire on <hi>Beverley</hi>-Minster,
this should be assurance to them within the
town that they without were ready for the assault. But
this treason had no successe, being discovered by one of
the instruments, and confessed to Sir JOHN HOTHAM.
Many particular services were done both by Land and
Water, by Barks and Boats upon the River <hi>Humber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The towns men of <hi>Hull</hi> were so far provoked by
this treacherous designe of their enemies, and so much
animated against them, that they all entered into Pay;
and now the Walls could not contain them; but five
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96346:113"/>
hundred of the town, conducted by Sir JOHN MEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRUM,
issued out, about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> upon
their besiegers; who seeing their approach, prepared
couragiously to receive and encounter them: but they
were but a small part of the King's Forces which were
resolute to fight; the other part, which consisted of
the Trained Bands of that Countrey, were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be engaged against their neighbours: the
King's Horse, and most resolute assistants, seeing
themselves deserted by the Foot, retired as fast as
they could to <hi>Beverley:</hi> but Sir JOHN MELDRUM
pursued them, slew two, and took thirty prisoners in
the pursuit. And not long after, when the supplies
from <hi>London</hi> arrived at <hi>Hull,</hi> Sir JOHN MELDRUM,
with a greater Force, made so fierce a sally upon his
enemies, as caused most of the Leaguer to retire dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
one and twenty of them being slain, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
taken prisoners. Sir JOHN MELDRUM follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the advantage of his successe with a swift motion,
arrived suddenly at a Leaguer-town called <hi>Aulby,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three and four miles from <hi>Hull;</hi> where the
King's magazine was kept in a Barn, in which was a
great quantity of Ammunition, Powder, and Fire-bals,
and certain Engineers employed there for making of
Fire-works: Sir JOHN suddenly set upon it in the
night, drove away the Guard, who consisted most of
Trained Bands, and other <hi>York-shire</hi> men, bearing no
great affection to the War, and therefore ran more
speedily away, leaving their Arms behinde them: mu
of the Ammunition and other Arms they took away
with them, fired the Barn, the Powder, and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
and what else they could not carry with them,
and returned safely again into <hi>Hull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King calling a Councel of War, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ill successe of his proceedings, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse
of that time which he consumed there, by
their advice resolved to break up his siege before <hi>Hull,</hi>
and march away; the chief men about him laying
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96346:114"/>
the fault of this failing upon the unskilfulnesse of the
Countrey Captains, and cowardice of the Trained
Bands. The King probably might have sped better,
if Sir JOHN PENINGTON could have brought
part of the Navie to his assistance: but that was sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> of which it will be
now time to speak more particularly.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> had in former times been so
great a lover of the Sea-service, and so well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in those affairs, being besides a man of Courage,
of Religious life, and known Fidelity to his Country,
that among all the Noble-men at this time, he was
esteemed by the Parliament ( in this important busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of setling their <hi>Militia</hi> by Land and Sea) the
fittest man to take Command of the Navie as Lord
Admiral. According to that, an Ordinance of both
Houses was drawn up, to confer the Office on him.</p>
                  <p>The King had given the employment to Sir JOHN
PENINGTON, a man who had long been Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
and a successeful Commander; and had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his Letters to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> with a strict
Command to quit the Place. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
was in a great straight between two such high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
being gone down to take possession of the
Navie, and therefore called a Councel of War, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
them all both with the Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the King's Letters. But the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was swayed in conscience to give obedience ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Ordinance of Parliament; and the reason
of it himself gives in a Letter directed to a Lord of
the House. <hi>When I considered</hi> (saith he) <hi>the great
care which I have seen in the Parliaments of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for the good and safety both of King and Kingdom,
and every man's particular in them; and that they are
the great Councel, by whose authority the Kings of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>have ever spoken to their Subjects; I was resolved
to continue in this employment, until I shall be revoked by
that Authority that hath intrusted me with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:96346:114"/>
Most of the Captains took up unanimously the
same resolution that the Earl did, excepting five, which
were the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

who alleadged that they had the King's Command to
obey Sir JOHN PENINGTON, whom he had appointed
Admiral in stead of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
These five had gotten together round, to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the Earl: but he came to Archor about
them, and having begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> them, summoned them again;
upon which three of them came in, and submitted:
two onely, Captain S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>INGSBY and Captain WAKE
stood out. The Earl let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> a Gun over them, and
turned up the Glasse upon them, sending his Boat,
and most of the Boats in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to let them know
their danger, if they came not within that space. But
so peremptory was their answer, that the Masters and
Sailors grew impatient; and although they had no
Arms, assaulted them, seized upon those Captains,
being armed with their Pistols and swords, strook their
Yards and Top-masts, and brought them to the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thus by the wonderful courage of these unarmed
men, the businesse was ended without e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>usion of any
blood, when the Earl was ready to give fire upon
them.</p>
                  <p>Within few days after, another addition of strength
was brought to the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> by an accident.
A great and strong ship of the King's, called The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
putting to Sea from <hi>Holland,</hi> and bound for <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi>
being much distressed with soul weather, was
driven into the <hi>Downs.</hi> Captain FOXE, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that ship, saluted the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who
presently acquainted the Captain with the Ordinance
of Parliament, whereby his Lordship had commanded
of those ships, requiring his submission thereunto. The
Captain at first refused to yeeld obedience to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and thereupon was presently clapt in hold:
but all his Officers in the ship submitted themselves,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96346:115"/>
and strook their Sails and Top-yards in token of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the said Ordinance. This ship was very
considerable, carrying two and fourty great Pieces of
brasse Ordnance; besides, a little Vessel laden with
Gun-powder of a great value, was taken also together
with this ship. The Earl was informed by some of her
men, that young Prince RUPERT and Prince MAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICE,
with divers other Commanders, intended to
have come from <hi>Holland</hi> in this ship, the Lion. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three days and three nights storm at Sea, those two
Princes (in a sick and weak condition) landed again
in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing of the surprisal of the Lion, sent
a Messenger to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to demand her
again, with all the goods therein, and that she should
be brought to <hi>Scarborough.</hi> But the Earl returned an
Answer to this effect, that the Parliament had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
him with the Care of the Fleet, and that that
ship was a part thereof: therefore he humbly besought
his Majestie to pardon him; for without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
he might not part with her; and that he knew of
no goods within her belonging to his Majestie.</p>
                  <p>But leaving the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to his Sea-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
it is time to return to those warlike Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
and Preparations which were made by Land: for
now the fatal time was come, when those long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Paper-conflicts of Declarations, Petitions, and
Proclamations, were turned into actual and bloody
Wars, and the Pens seconded by drawn swords.</p>
                  <p>On the twelfth of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1642, the Parliament
voted that an Army should be raised for the safety of
the King's Person, and defence of the Parliament;
for so they called it, desiring to joyn together what
seemed to be at so great a distance and enmity.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was by a great and unanimous
consent of both Houses chosen General of that Army,
and of all Forces raised for the Parliament; with
whom they protested to live and die in that Cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:96346:115"/>
The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was a Gentleman of a noble and
most untainted reputation, of undoubted loyalty to
his Country and Prince; having always (what course
soever the Court steered) served in an honourable
way, the right Interest of the English Nation, and the
Protestant Religion; and to that end had formerly
engaged himself in the <hi>Palatine</hi> War, and service of
the <hi>Netherland</hi> United Provinces: insomuch as at
this time, when they sought a Lord to undertake the
high charge of commanding in chief, there seemed to
be no choice at all; but we may say of this Election,
as PATERCULUS did of another, <hi>Non quaerendus
erat quem eligerent, sed eligendus qui eminebat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament at that time were very able to raise
Forces, and arm them well, by reason of the great
masse of Money and Plate which to that purpose was
heaped up in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and daily increased by the
free Contribution of those that were well-affected to
the Parliament Cause: where not onely the wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Citizens and Gentlemen who were neer-dwellers,
brought in their large bags and goblets; but the
poorer sort, like that widow in the Gospel, presented
their mites also; insomuch that it was a common Jeer

                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was very careful and industrious
in raising of his Army; in which he desired to have as
great a Body of Horse as could conveniently be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
by reason that he conceived his chief work was to
seek out the King's Forces, and prevent their spoiling
of the Country, and disarming several Counties, to
furnish themselves. And indeed, his Forces, considering
the long Peace of <hi>England,</hi> and unreadinesse of Arms,
were not onely raised, but well armed in a short time.
Many of the Lords who then sate in the House of
Peers (besides those Lords who went into divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to settle the <hi>Militia,</hi> and therefore raised Forces
for safety of those several Places) listed themselves in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96346:116"/>
the Lord General's Army, and took Commissions as
Colonels; the Lord ROBERTS, the Lord SAINT-JOHN
eldest son to the Earl of <hi>Bullenbrook,</hi> the Lord
of <hi>Rochford</hi> eldest son to the Earl of <hi>Dover:</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentlemen of the House of Commons, of greatest
tank and quality there, took Commissions for Horse
and Foot-service in that Army; of whom these were
some: Sir JOHN MERRICK, who was made Serjeant-Major-General
of that Army; the Lord GREY of
<hi>Grooby,</hi> son to the Earl of <hi>Stamford;</hi> Master DENZIL
HOLLIS, Master HAMDEN, Sir PHILIP STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLETON,
Sir WILLIAM WALLER, Sir SAMUEL
LUKE, Sir HENRY CHOLMLY, Master GRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAM,
Master WHITLOCK, with divers others.
The Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> within two days after that the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was chosen <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> was voted to
be General of the Horse.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A brief Relation of the condition of divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in England, when the Parliaments Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
for the Militia, and the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Array were put in execution. With
a mention of some Lords and others who were
actors on either side. The Lord Maior of

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Uring the time that this Army was
raising for the Parliament, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by his Excellency in person,
the King with small strength as yet,
was removing from place to place to
gather Forces, and draw people to
his side. Of whose proceedings, and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
he encreased in power, I shall speak hereafter in
a continued Series, to avoid confusion in the Story.
But in the mean time, the Parliaments Ordinance of
<hi>Militia,</hi> and the King's Commission of <hi>Array,</hi> were
justling together almost in every County: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of the English Nobility on both sides appearing
personally, to seize upon those places which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96346:117"/>
to them either by the King or by the Parliament.
No Ordinances from the One, or Proclamations from
the Other, could now give any further stop to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and spreading Mischief. God was not pleased that
one Chimney should contain this Civil fire; but small
sparks of it were daily kindling in every part of the
Land.</p>
                  <p>Let it not therefore seem amisse, if in the first place
I make a brief Relation into what posture every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
County, or most of them, had endeavoured to
put themselves, during that time, which was since the
twelfth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> when the first apparant denouncing
of War began, and the General was elected in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
till the three and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> when
it broke out into a fierce and cruel Battel. But let not
the Reader expect any full or perfect Narration of this,
which would take up too great a time, and prove as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
as unnecessary. The onely reason why I have
entered into it, is to inform the Reader what Lords and
Gentlemen did first appear in action on either side,
in those particular Counties, that in the progresse of
the Story he may be better acquainted with those
names, whose Actions proved of so high concernment
in the future War. Nor can any perfect Judgement
be made of the affections or condition of any one
County in this brief Narration of so short a time:
for scarce was there any City or Shire, but endured in
processe of time many Changes, and became altered
from their first condition, either by unconstancy of
affections, or else enforced to take a new side, as they
were threatned by approaching Armies of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when the War grew to a greater height.</p>
                  <p>In some Counties there was no strugling at all, one
side wholly prevailing, and the Peoples affections ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the same way: as it appeared in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> at
the first, (which was the first account given to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of their <hi>Militia,</hi> and where some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are of that note, as to make it justly deserve a more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96346:117"/>
particular recital then other places) when the Lord
WILLOUGHBY of <hi>Parham</hi> went down thither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen by the Parliament Lord Lieutenant of that
County. This young Lord being come to <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
expresseth to the Parliament what cheerful and hearty
obedience he found from the Captains and Officers
of the Trained Bands, and in how good a posture
they were, beyond all expectation; considering the
unhappinesse of the Plague being then in the Town,
which hindered the appearance of some: but that
was fully supplied by a Company of Voluntiers, equal
in number and goodnesse of Arms to the Trained
Bands. Yet that Change which I spake of before,
did afterwards sadly appear in this County, which
was afterwards as much divided in it self as any part
of <hi>England,</hi> and by that means a most unhappie seat
of War, often gained and regained by either side.
<hi>Lincolnshire</hi> was then very forward for the Lord
WILLOUGHBY (however afterward he found
some resistance from the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> who sided
with the King) as he wrote up to the Parliament,
and sent also to them the King's Letter, and his
own Answer: Which are both fit to be inserted into
the Story, being the first of that kinde, and much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
the nature of the businesse.</p>

not a little, how to expresse that Duty which I owe to
Your Majesties late Commands, and not falsifie that Trust
reposed in me by Your high Court of Parliament; through
whose particular directions I am now come into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to settle the <hi>Militia,</hi> according to the Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which by the Votes of my Lord <hi>LITTLETON,</hi>

Your Majesties Chief Iustice Sir <hi>JOHN BANKS,</hi> both

how much further they proceeded, I

                           <p>But, Sir, if the opinions of those great Lawyers drew
me into an act unsutable to Your Majesties liking, I hope

since by the Command of the Parliament, I am now so far
engaged in their Service, as the sending out Warrants to
summon the County to meet me this day at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and
afterwards in other places; I do most humbly beseech
Your Majestie not to impose that Command on me, which
must needs render me false to those that relie on me, and so

                     <p>Upon the receipt of these Letters, the Lords sent a
Message to the House of Commons, in which they

their readinesse to concur with them, upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

to manifest the sense they have, and shall retain of
his deservings; which appear the greater, by how
much the difficulties (appearing by the circumstances
of those Letters) have been greater. The Lords
therefore, as they resolved to make his Interest their
own, in this Service for the publike good and safety
of the Kingdom; so they desired the Commons to
joyn with them in so just and necessary a work. To
this the House of Commons consented, and resolved
to joyn with the Lords in this Vote, making the like
resolution also for the Deputy-Lieutenants for the
County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and desired the Lords concurrence
therein. Upon which it was ordered by the Lords in

Lieutenant by the Parliament, when he went down
to muster and exercise the Country, was received
with great applause. The Trained Bands were not

were in general, that they presented a Petition to the
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and the Deputy-Lieutenants, in the

Companies, and in the name of all persons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it was read in the field, they expressed a full consent

                     <p>In <hi>Kent</hi> there was cheerful obedience (without any

as it appeared by their Petition and Proclamation,
and more by their real and constant actions. True it is,
that some Gentlemen of that County were not much
affected to the Parliaments Cause, who did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frame a displeasing Petition to the Houses, and
brought it up to <hi>London,</hi> accompanied with many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of that County: but the Parliament having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, sent Officers, and disarmed those Gentlemen
who brought the Petition, before they passed over <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>-bridge:
and the two which presented it to the

who favoured the King's party and Commission of
<hi>Array,</hi> were not a number considerable enough to
bring that County into any combustion; the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which adhered to the Parliament used so great a

those few (but great) Papists among them, in raising
Arms, and taxing themselves at high rates for the ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

stood firm to the Parliament, and were very industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

means of many revolted Members of the Parliament,
inhabitants there, together with their Allies and

<hi>Cambridgeshire,</hi> once the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi>
were happily kept from the beginning without any
great combustion; though it were certain that many
of the chief Gentry in those Counties, bended in
their affections to the King's Commission of <hi>Array:</hi>
but they were not a part strong enough to engage
their Countries in a War: For the Free holders and
Yeomen in general adhered to the Parliament; and
those Gentlemen who attempted to raise men, or draw
Forces together, or provide Arms for the King, were
soon curbed, and all their endeavours crushed at the
beginning, by those of the other side; especially by
the great wisdom and indefatigable industry of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

                     <p>The County of <hi>Southampton</hi> began at the first to be
divided, and continued so, being long and variously
perplexed with the changing fortunes of either side.
Colonel GORING, eldest son to the Lord GORING,
who had been, the yeer before, a means to detect that
Conspiracie of bringing the Northern Army against
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96346:121"/>
the Parliament, (of which already hath been spoken)
and by that, grown into some Trust with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which he was a Member, was sent down to
<hi>Portsmouth,</hi> to keep that place for them, and three
thousand pounds allowed him for the charges of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.
He receiving that money from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
broke his Trust, and kept the Place for the King
against them; with what successe, shall hereafter be
declared. But immediately after his revolt, the Earl
of <hi>Portland,</hi> Governour of the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> a man
suspected by the Parliament, was committed to custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in <hi>London,</hi> for security of his person, lest he should
comply with Colonel GORING, and command that
Island for the King's party. The Government of
<hi>Wight</hi> was then committed to the Earl of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mbrook,</hi>
a man of whose fidelity the Parliament doubted not.</p>
                     <p>Though the Southern and Eastern parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
enjoyed some shew of rest, the Counties more
remote from <hi>London,</hi> toward the North and West,
could not at all partake of that happinesse.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Lancashire</hi> the Lord STRANGE, son to the Earl
of <hi>Derby,</hi> who was made Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
and <hi>Cheshire</hi> by the King, seeking to put the
Commission of <hi>Array</hi> in execution, found great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
from the Parliamentary Gentlemen, Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS
STANLEY, Master HOLLAND, Master HOLCRAFT,
Master EGERTON, Master BOOTH, as also Master ASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,
and Master MOOR, both Members of the House
of Commons; by whom, within the space of few
months, he was quite driven out of the County, and
that Shire wholly ruled by the Parliament, though it
abounded more with Papists then any other.</p>
                     <p>The Lord STRANGE upon the fifteenth day of <hi>Iuly</hi>
had made an attempt to gain <hi>Manchester,</hi> and by those
Gentlemen was repulsed; where one man was slain;
which was the first blood shed in these Civil Wars.
But this Lord was not at all fortunate in service against
the Parliament; who not long after, returned again
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96346:122"/>
with a great Force, consisting of three thousand men,
to the Town of <hi>Manchester;</hi> where, after he had
sharply besieged it for the space of two whole weeks,
he was at last quite beaten, with the losse of many of
his men.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Cheshire</hi> also, the other County of which he
was made Lieutenant by the King, his fortune was no
better; where he was resisted by Sir WILLIAM
BRERETON and other Gentlemen, and hindered
from seizing the Magazine of that County, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Nor could the Earl of <hi>Rivers,</hi> whom the
King had put into the Commission of <hi>Array</hi> (being a
Papist) assist him sufficiently to make good that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the King, but that the Papists were all disarmed
there by those Protestant Gentlemen that adhered to
the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Further North, the Countries were more full of
variance. The Earl of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with a strong Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
kept for the King the Town of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> And
the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> made Lord-Lieutenant of
<hi>York-shire</hi> by the King, was active in putting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Array</hi> in execution: but resisted they
were by the Lord FAIRFAX, and others of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Gentlemen. But this businesse of the North
shall now be passed over, deserving a larger Story
hereafter, when time shall require, to speak of the Earl
of <hi>Newcastle</hi>'s greatnesse, and the various fortunes of
the Lord FAIRFAX, and his son Sir THOMAS FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> where many great Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
inhabited, none at all of note stood for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but Sir JOHN GELL and his brother: of whose
actions it will be seasonable to speak in another place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Staffordshire</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamshire</hi> were in no lesse
combustion.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Leicestershire</hi> the troubles were far greater, and
early begun by Master HENRY HASTINGS, second
son to the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> whom the King had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96346:122"/>
made Sheriff of that County, and put into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Array;</hi> who raised great Forces to seize
upon the Magazine of that County. Against whom
the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> was sent by the Parliament, as
Lord Lieutenant, with a considerable strength: who
arriving there, did much curb the proceedings of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
HASTINGS, and took possession of the Town of
<hi>Leicester.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Great was the Contention about that time in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-shire,</hi>
between the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> for the
King, and the Lord BROOK for the Parliament, not
without sharp encounters, and slaughter on either
side. The Earl having seized the Ordnance at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
marched with great fury into <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi>
spoiling the Countrey as he went, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
opposition of the people, and the Lord BROOK'S
Forces; against whom he could not at all prevail.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> had setled the <hi>Militia</hi> in
<hi>Wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>shire</hi> with small ado, though it continued not
long so. And the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>Berk-shire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but saintly resisted by the Earl of <hi>Berk-shire,</hi> the
Lord LOVELACE, and others. For soon after, the Earl
of <hi>Berk-shire,</hi> together with Sir JOHN CURSON, Sir
ROBERT DORMER, and others for the Commission of
<hi>Array,</hi> who came to <hi>Watlington</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> to seize
the Magazine of that part of the County, which was
laid up in that Town, were there taken prisoners, and
sent up to the Parliament by Colonel HAMDEN and
Colonel GOODWIN, two Members of the House of
Commons, and Knights of the Shire for <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the further that this Discourse travels West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the greater and more remarkable you shall finde
such contestations; especially considering the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Lords and Gentlemen of great rank, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them Members of Parliament, who sided with
the King against the Parliament, and were therefore
afterward voted out of the House. One great Head
there was of all those Western Counties, WILLIAM
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96346:123"/>
Marquesse of <hi>Hartford,</hi> whom the King, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Array,</hi> had appointed Chief, and made
him Lord Lieutenant-General of <hi>Devon, Cornwal,
Somerset, Dorset, Wilts, Southampton, Gloucester,
Berks, Oxford, Hereford,</hi> and seven Counties within
the Principality of <hi>Wales:</hi> who, notwithstanding
his high Command, was never able to atchieve any
great matter for the King's side; so much were the
common people of the West at that time inclined to
the Parliament, and so active were those Gentlemen
who stood for it; such as were the sons of Sir FRANCIS
POPHAM, Master ALEXANDER POPHAM, HUGH, and ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD,
who were more animated by the example of
their aged father; Master STRODE a Deputy-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and others, against all those frequent attempts
which the Marquesse made.</p>
                     <p>Great was the number of considerable men in those
Countries, which took part with the Marquesse against
the Parliament, and very industrious in their several
Stations, to put in execution the Commission of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray;</hi>
as the Lord PAWLET, Sir RALPH HOPTON, and
Sir JOHN STOWEL, both Members of the House of
Commons, and for that reason put out of the House.
Sir RICHARD SLANY in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> another Member, put
out also for the same cause; as likwise were Sir ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD
RODNEY and Master COVENTRY, both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men,
who followed the Marquesse in some of
his actions. Sir BEVILE GREENVILE an active man,
another Member of Parliament, was very industrious
for the <hi>Array,</hi> both in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devon,</hi> joyning
himself with the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> who came for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to his house at <hi>Tastock</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and assisted
by many Gentlemen, as Master CULINS, Sheriff of that
County, M. BAMFIELD, M. ASHFORD, M. GIFFORD,
M. SAINTHIL, Baronet SEYMOUR, and M. COURTNEY;
to whose assistance Squire ROGERS came with Forces
out of <hi>Dorsetshire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Various were the Successes which Marquesse <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:96346:123"/>
assisted by so many of the Gentry, found in his
several Enterprises; sometimes prevailing, but more
often distressed. In one Skirmish, which about the
beginning of <hi>August,</hi> himself, the Lord PAWLET, Sir
RALPH HOPTON, Sir JOHN STOWEL, and M. SMITH,
another Member of the House of Commons, made
against the Deputy-Lieutenants in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> he
prevailed against them, and possessed himself of the
Town of <hi>Shepton-Mallet:</hi> Ten men were slain, and
many wounded. Going afterwards to <hi>Wells,</hi> he had
been besieged by many thousands of the People, who
arose against him; but that having timely notice of
their coming, he escaped a back-way out of the Town.
About which time, the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> was sent
down by the Parliament against him with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse: by whom the Lord Marquesse, the Lord
PAWLET, Sir RALPH HOPTON, Colonel
LUNSFORD, and many other considerable men,
were besieged in <hi>Sherburn.</hi> For great numbers out
of the Country came daily to the assistance of the
Earl of <hi>Bedford.</hi> Many weeks did that Siege conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;
many Sallies were made out, and sharp encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on both sides performed with great courage: the
Parliament side being in firm hope to have taken them
at last; which was conceived a thing of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and advantage to their affairs, if they could
have possessed the persons of so many men, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
both in their Fortunes and Valour; and who
proved afterwards very strong and cruel enemies. Yet
that hope was frustrate: for about the beginning of
October, they all escaped out of <hi>Sherburn:</hi> the Earl
neverthelesse pursued after them, and in the Chase
took M. PALLART, Sir HENRY, Sir JOHN, and Sir
CHARLES BARCLAY prisoners. Within a week after,
the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi> was apprehended, and brought up a
prisoner to the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be much wondered at, that Division was
found in Countrey-Towns and Villages so far remote
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96346:124"/>
from the Parliament, where the people were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wrought upon by perswasions or fears from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side: when <hi>London</hi> it self, the Seat of that great
Councel, and chiefest Bulwark of their defence, was
not without some taste of these Distractions. Which,
besides the actions of some private Citizens, too pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be here rehearsed, may appear to the Reader in
one thing, which cannot be omitted: The Lord
Major of <hi>London</hi> was at this time a prisoner in the
Tower, committed by the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Sir RICHARD GURNEY, Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> for
that yeer, was charged by the House of Commons on
the seventh of <hi>Iuly,</hi> for being a mover of Sedition in
the Kingdom, in causing the King's Proclamation
concerning the Commission of <hi>Array</hi> (which was
declared by both Houses to be illegal) to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in the City. And the Charge being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was sent up to the Lords, desiring that he might
forthwith be called to his Answer; which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
granted.</p>
                     <p>Four days after, while the Lord Maior was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Lords House upon this Charge, and additional
Impeachment was read against him in the House of
Commons, brought in by the Common-Councel of
<hi>London,</hi> for divers breaches of his Oath in execution
of his Office, for proclaiming divers illegal Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and contemning the Orders of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>This Impeachment was forthwith sent up, and read
in the Lords House. Upon the reading of which, it
was ordered that he should be sent to the Tower,
from thence to be brought to a legal Trial upon his
Impeachment.</p>
                     <p>Many days, during the space of a whole month,
was this Lord Maior brought from the Tower to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
to attend the Lords of Parliament, and many
times returned back without being heard, by reason
of so great a multiplicity of Businesses as the Houses
were then in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:96346:124"/>
At last, after some hearings, he was brought, on
the twelfth of <hi>August,</hi> to the House of Lords, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Censure: The effect whereof was, that he
should be put from his Majorality, never bear Office
in the City or Common-wealth, be uncapable of all
Honour or Dignity to be conferred on him by the
King, and stand committed prisoner to the Tower,
during the pleasure of both Houses.</p>
                     <p>During the time of these contentions between the
Ordinance of the <hi>Militia</hi> and Commission of <hi>Array,</hi>
which is briefly touched by it self; it will not be
amisse to return to the King's proceedings in his own
Person, by what degrees he came to encrease in
strength, and what contestations happened betwixt
Himself and the Parliament: wherein, that which
concerned the Pen, shall be first briefly touched, and
then his other actions. But those Declarations,
Petitions, and Proclamations, which upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were then published, are too many and too long
to be recited in a Story: in the Records, and printed
Books of Ordinances, they may be read. I shall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention some of the chief, and excerp the most
material contents of them.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament, about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> had petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the King to forbear all preparations of War, and
remove his Garisons. To which he gave Answer,
and upbraided them with their preparations of War,
for appointing the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> to be their General,
and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> Admiral. In that Answer,
he descants at large upon particulars, commanding his
said Answer and their Petition to be read in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
To which the Parliament reply, as they had
done before, that they cannot lay down Arms, nor
rejourn the Parliament to any other place, as he would
have them, unlesse he leave off those Warlike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and comply with that Councel, to which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he ought to adhere, by the Constitution of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
They likewise command the Petition,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96346:125"/>
Answer, and Reply to be read in all Churches.</p>
                     <p>But things proceeding still higher, the King, being
returned to the City of <hi>York,</hi> from thence sent forth
a Proclamation, to suppresse (as he there stileth it)
the present Rebellion under command of ROBERT
Earl of <hi>Essex;</hi> offering withal free pardon to him,
and all such as shall within six days after the date
thereof, being the ninth of <hi>August,</hi> lay down their
Arms. In which Proclamation also he commanded
the Marquesse <hi>Hartford</hi> to raise speedily what Forces
he could, within all those Counties whereof he had
made him Lieutenant-General in the Commission of
<hi>Array</hi> (of which before was spoken) and to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
destroy, or apprehend the said Earl of <hi>Essex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Parliament, upon this Proclamation, make a
Declaration, wherein they briefly recount all the
King's former proceedings against them and the
Kingdom: All which they attribute (after their
usual manner) to his wicked Councel; and promise
still to make him great and happie, if he will return
to his great Councel.</p>
                     <p>But the next day after his former Proclamation, the
King, continuing still at <hi>York,</hi> sent forth another, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
that no Papist should serve him in his Army,
and that his Souldiers should commit no rapine upon
the people. And within two days after that, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a Discourse, called <hi>A Declaration to all his loving
Subjects concerning the proceedings of this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
This Declaration was of a great length,
containing fifty pages in a large <hi>Quarto.</hi> In which
was comprised a kinde of History touching all former
passages betwixt himself and them, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these divisions: which is to be read in the
printed Book of Parliament-Ordinances. Toward
the end of that Declaration, he protesteth a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
love to Parliaments, and to the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Kingdom: but he requires that some
persons (as disturbers of the publike peace) may be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96346:125"/>
delivered into the hands of Justice, to be tried by their
Peers, naming the Lord of <hi>Kymbolton,</hi> and those five
Members of the House of Commons whom before he
came to surprise in that House, Master HOLLIS, Sir
ARTHUR HASLERIG, M. PYM, M. HAMBDEN, and
M. STRODE; as likewise M. HENRY MARTIN and Sir
HENRY LUDLOW, two Members also of the House of
Commons, for speaking some bold Speeches in that
House. He also desires to have delivered up to him
Alderman PENINGTON, who succeeded in the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
to the fore-named Sir KICHARD GURNEY, and
Captain VENN, one of the City-Captains: those two
last he accuses of bringing tumults from the City, to
terrifie the Parliament at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of the King's is, that Inditements of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
upon the Statute of the 23 yeer of King EDWARD
the third, may be drawn against the Earls of <hi>Essex,
Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Stamford,</hi> the Lord BROOK, Sir JOHN
HOTHAM, and Serjeant-Major-General SKIPPON, an
expert and religious Souldier, a man of high action
in the succeeding War, whom the City had employed
in exercising of their <hi>Militia;</hi> as likewise against all
those who shall hereafter exercise the <hi>Militia</hi> by vertue
of the Ordinance of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Pen was very quick upon all occasions: and
the King, the next day after the publication of this
long fore-mentioned Declaration, sent a Message to
the Parliament, upbraiding both Houses with an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they had then made, for the borrowing of
an hundred thousand pounds out of that money
which the Adventurers had raised for reducing of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and subduing the Rebels there; affirming, that
out of his Princely care and piety toward distressed
<hi>Ireland,</hi> he cannot but take notice of it; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them immediately to retract that mischievous and
unjust Order (for so he calls it) as they would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the contrary to Almighty God, himself, and
those that have trusted them: Wherein he expecteth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96346:126"/>
their speedie Answer and Obedience; and the rather,
that he may thereby be secured, that such part of the
four hundred thousand pounds as is or shall be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from his good Subjects of <hi>England</hi> by vertue of
the late Act of Parliament whereby the same is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may not likewise (under false pretences) be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from the proper use to which it was intended,
and misemployed to the disturbance of the Kingdoms
peace, in a War against him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lords and Commons in Parliament make An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this Message, expressing what caution there
was in the very Order (which upon that very occasion
was printed) for speedie repayment of that Sum, and
disposing of it to the right use. But first they tell
the King, that this very Message of his to them, is an
high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament: and
upon that occasion, they call to remembrance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
many particulars of their care for the relief of</hi>
Ireland, <hi>and the King's hindering of it. Those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
there expressed, are as followeth. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi>
that this bloodie Rebellion was first raised by the
same Counsels that had before brought two Armies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bowels of this Kingdom, and two Protestant Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ready to welter in each others blood, which were both
defrayed a long time at the charge of the poor Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> and quietly at last disbanded; by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon the Parliaments endeavours. That this designe
failing, the same wicked Councels who had caused that
impious War, raised this barbarous Rebellion in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and recommended the suppressing thereof (for the better
colour) to the Parliaments care: who out of a fellow-feeling
of the unspeakable miseries of their Protestant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
there (not suspecting this horrid Plot, now too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent)
did cheerfully undertake that great work, and
do really intend and endeavour to settle the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and a permanent Peace in that Realm, to the glory
of God, the honour and profit of his Majestie, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his three Kingdoms. But how they have been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96346:126"/>
discouraged, retarded, diverted in and from this pious
and glorious Work, by those traiterous Counsels about
his Majestie, will appear by many particulars.</p>
                     <p>They there mention the sending over at first of
twenty thousand pounds by the Parliament, and that
good way found out to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of private men, without charging the Subject in
general, which would probably have brought in a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of money, had the King continued in or neer <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and not, by leaving his Parliament, and making
War upon it, so intimidated and discouraged the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers,
and others who would have adventured,
that that good Bill is rendered in a manner ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>They mention, that when at the sole charge of the
Adventurers, five thousand Foot and five hundred
Horse were designed for the relief of <hi>Munster,</hi> under
the command of the Lord WHARTON, and nothing
was wanting but a Commission to enable that Lord
for the Service, such was the power of wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
that no Commission could be obtained from the
King; by reason whereof, <hi>Lymrick</hi> was wholly lost,
and the Province of <hi>Munster</hi> since in very great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.</p>
                     <p>That when well-affected persons, at their own
charge, by way of Adventure, had prepared twelve
Ships, and six Pinnaces, with a thousand Land-forces,
for the service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> desiring nothing but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from his Majestie; that Commission, after
twice sending to <hi>York</hi> for it, and the Ships lying ready
to set Sail, three weeks together, at the charge of neer
three hundred pounds a day, was likewise denied. And
those Adventurers (rather then lose their Expedition)
were constrained to go by vertue of an Ordinance of
both Houses of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>That, though the Lords Justices of <hi>Ireland</hi> earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired to have two Pieces of Battery sent over, as
necessary for that Service; yet such commands were
given to the Officers of the Tower, that none of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96346:127"/>
the King's Ordnance must be sent, to save his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>That CHARLES FLOYD, Engineer and Quarterma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-General
of the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in actual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
there against the Rebels, was called away
from that important Service, by expresse command
of the King.</p>
                     <p>That Captain GREEN, Controller of the Artillery,
a man in Pay, and principally employed and trusted
here by the Lord-Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> for providing
and ordering the Train of Artillery which was to be
sent to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and who had received great sums of
money for that purpose, was commanded from that
employment and trust, to serve the King in this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
War against his Parliament. And when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had provided six hundred suits of Clothes for
present relief of the poor Souldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and sent
them towards <hi>Chester,</hi> WILLIAM WHITAKER that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the carriage of them, was assaulted by the
King's souldiers lying about <hi>Coventry;</hi> who took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the six hundred suits of Clothes, and the poor
man, his Waggon and Horses, though they were told
that the Clothes were for the souldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
though the poor Carrier was five times with the Earl of
<hi>Northampton,</hi> to beg a release of his Waggon.</p>
                     <p>That three hundred suits of Clothes sent likewise
by the Parliament for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a Chirurgion's
Chest of Medicaments, towards <hi>Chester,</hi> were taken
all away by the King's Troopers under command of
one Captain MIDDLETON, together with the poor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier's
Horses and Waggon, for the King's service. As
likewise, that a great number of Draught-horses pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by the Parliament for the Artillery and Baggage
of the Irish Army, and sent to <hi>Chester</hi> for that purpose,
being there, attending a passage, are now required by
the King for his present service in <hi>England;</hi> whose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are so quartered about the Roads to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that no
Provision can passe thither by Land with any safety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:96346:127"/>
That Captain KETTLEBY and Sir HENRY STRAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING,
the Admiral and Vice-Admiral of the Ships ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to lie upon the coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to annoy the
Rebels, and to prevent the bringing of Ammunition
and relief from forraign parts, are both called away
from that employment by the King's command: and
by reason of their departure from the coast of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
to which they were designed, the Rebels there
have received Powder, Ammunition, and other relief
from forraign parts.</p>
                     <p>By which particulars (say they) it may seem that
those Rebels are countenanced there, upon designe to
assist the enemies of the Parliament here: especially
considering that those confident Rebels have presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
very lately, to send a Petition to the King, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling
themselves his Majesties Catholike Subjects of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and complaining of the Puritan Parliament
of <hi>England;</hi> and desiring, that since his Majestie
comes not thither, according to their expectation,
they may come into <hi>England</hi> to his Majestie.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament therefore, finding what danger both
Kingdoms are in, by the designes of cruel enemies,
thought fit to provide for the safety of both, by prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a competent Army for the defence of King and
Kingdom. But in regard that the Plate brought in

to suddenly as the service required; and well knowing
that one hundred thousand pounds might for a short
time be borrowed out of the Adventurers money for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> without any prejudice to the affairs of that
Kingdom, whose Subsistence depends upon the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of this, and resolving to make a speedie repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that money, made this Order: which that it
may appear (say they) to all the world to be neither
mischievous, illegal, nor unjust (as the King calls it)
the House of Commons thought fit to recite it <hi>in haec

duely and carefully within so short a time, that it shall

                     <p>During the time of these Paper-conflicts, the King
in person had often removed, and visited many places.
To the Gentry of <hi>Leicestershire</hi> he made a Speech on
the 20 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> after his usual manner, with Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his great love to the people, and care of the
Kingdom. And from thence removing Northward,
on the fourth of <hi>August</hi> he made a Speech after the
same manner to the Gentry of <hi>York-shire;</hi> from
whence he returned back to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there set
up his Standard Royal. Very few people resorted to
it. Nor had the King at this time a considerable
strength to guard his Person, if any attempts had been
to have seized upon him. From <hi>Nottingham,</hi> on the
25 of <hi>August,</hi> the King sent a Message to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dorset,</hi> and Sir
JOHN CULPEPER, one of the Members of the House

                     <p>We have with unspeakable grief of heart long beheld
the Distractions of this Our Kingdom. Our very Soul is
full of Anguish, until We may finde some Remedy to prevent
the Miseries which are ready to overwhelm this whole
Nation by a Civil War. And though all Our endeavours
tending to the composing of those unhappie Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Vs and Our two Houses of Parliament (though
pursued by Vs with all Zeal and Sincerity) have been
hitherto without that Successe we hoped for; yet such is
Our constant and earnest care to preserve the publike
Peace, that We shall not be discouraged from using any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
which by the blessing of the God of mercy may
lay a firm foundation of Peace and Happinesse to all Our
good Subjects. To this end observing that many Mistakes
have arisen by the Messages, Petitions and Answers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Vs and Our two Houses of Parliament; which
haply may be prevented by some other way of Treaty,
wherein the matters in difference may be more clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and more freely transacted: We have thought fit
to propound to you, That some fit persons may be by you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to treat with the like number to be authorized by
Vs, in such a manner, and with such freedom of Debate,
as may best tend to that happie Conclusion which all good
men desire, The Peace of the Kingdom. Wherein, as We
promise in the word of a King, all safety and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to such as shall be sent unto Vs, if you shall chuse the
place where We are for the Treaty, which we wholly leave
to you, presuming the like care of the safety of those We
shall employ, if you shall name another place: So We as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you and all Our good Subjects, that (to the best of
Our understanding) nothing shall be therein wanting on
our part, which may advance the true Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
oppose Popery and Superstition, secure the Law of
the Land (upon which is built as well Our just Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96346:129"/>
as the Propriety and Liberty of the Subject ) confirm
all just Power and Priviledges of Parliament, and render
Vs and Our people truely happie, by a true understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
betwixt Vs and Our two Houses of Parliament.
Bring with you as firm resolutions to do your duty, and let
all Our People joyn with Vs in Our prayers to Almighty
God for his blessing upon this Work.</p>
                     <p>If this Proposition shall be rejected by you, We have
done, Our duty so amply, that God will absolve Vs from
the guilt of any of that blood which must be spilt. And
what opinion soever other men may have of Our Power,
We assure you, nothing but Our Christian and pious care to
prevent the effusion of blood, hath begot this motion; Our
provision of Men, Arms and Money being such, as may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

                     <p>Within few days after, the King sent Instructions

Marquesse <hi>Hartford,</hi> whom the King had made Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General

                     <p>Immediately after, the King sent a Reply to that

the Kingdom, nor how those means have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,

former Bitternesse, that might make Our offer of

nor ever intended to declare both Our

Our Standard against them; and much lesse to

We utterly professe against it before
God and the world. And further, to remove all

The Parliament, immediately after, published a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
that the Arms which they were enforced to
take up for the preservation of the Kingdom, Laws and
Liberties, could not be laid down, until the King
should withdraw his Protection from such persons as
had been voted Delinquents by both Houses, and leave
them to the Justice of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The King, within few days after, made another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the last Answer of the Parliament. The substance
of it was, that he could neither do nor offer any more
then he had already: and that he should think himself
clear and innocent from any blood that might be spilt
in this Quarrel; praying God so to deal with him and
his posterity, as he desired to preserve Religion, Law,
and Liberty of the Subjects, and Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Parliament returned Answer, that while
the King thinks himself bound in Honour to protect
such Delinquents, in whose preservation the Kingdom
cannot be safe, nor the Rights of Parliament at all
maintained, but must needs fall into utter contempt;
they must needs think he hath not done what he can o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bleeding <hi>Ireland,</hi> when at the same time divers of the

for them, are admitted into his Presence with

Prince RUPERT, second Sonne to
FREDERICK Prince Elector Palatine
of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> who had long beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Prisoner of Warre by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and newly released, arrived in
<hi>England,</hi> to offer his Service to the King his Uncle
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96346:132"/>
in those Warres, which were now visibly begun in
this unhappy Kingdome; together with him came
his younger Brother Prince MAURICE, an addition
rather of Gallantry then strength to the Kings side,
being both young and unexperienced Souldiers. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed, though they were neere in birth to the
Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> were they neere enough to
adde any security to the King, by purchasing the
Peoples hatred to themselves; though that were ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
and talked of by many, as the cause why they
were sent for. Their elder Brother, CHARLES,
Prince Elector, might have served more fitly to play
that part: But he, having long remained in the Court
of <hi>England,</hi> had lately left the King, not above two
Moneths before the arrivall of his Brothers; The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why he went away were partly expressed by
himselfe afterward in a Message, which he sent out of
<hi>Holland</hi> to the Houses of Parliament, wherein he
professed sorrow for these distractions, and protested
that whilest he was in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> he had
by all meanes indeavoured to bring the King into a
good opinion of his Parliament; acknowledging that
his owne interest, and that of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Germany,</hi> did more depend upon the happinesse
of the English Parliament, then upon any thing else
under God. True it is, that this Prince left not the
King, untill he saw the rent betweene him and his
Parliament too great to close; and having before been
exposed by the King to some probability of envy, as
when he attended his Majesty to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for surprizall of the five Members; and with
him afterwards, when some things unpleasing to the
people had been done; he might in likelihood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that opinion that he was of this cause, thinke
it the wisest way to take a faire leave in time of the
King.</p>
                  <p>These two young Princes arrived in <hi>England,</hi> were
soone put into imployment and Command under the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96346:132"/>
King their Uncle, in which they shewed themselves
very forward and active, as will appeare afterward,
and if more hot and furious then the tender begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of a Civill Warre would seeme to require, it
may be imputed to the fervour of their youth, and
great desire which they had to ingratiate themselves
to the King; upon whom, as being no more then
Souldiers of fortune, their hopes of advancement
wholly depended.</p>
                  <p>Prince RUPERT, the elder brother, and most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of the two, within a fortnight after his arrivall,
commanded a small party of those Forces which the
King had at that time gathered together, which
were not of so great a body as to be tearmed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
with which he marched into divers Counties, to
roll himselfe like a snow ball, into a larger bulke, by
the accession of Forces in every place: Through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts of <hi>Warwick-shire, Nottingham-shire, Leicester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,
Worcester-shire,</hi> and <hi>Cheshire,</hi> did this young
Prince fly with those Troops which he had, not invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the people so much by faire demeanour (for
such was the report to the Houses of Parliament) as
compelling them by extreme rigour to follow that
side which he had taken. Many Townes and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he plundered, which is to say robb'd (for at
that time first was the word plunder used in <hi>England,</hi>
being borne in <hi>Germany,</hi> when that stately Country
was so miserably wasted and pillaged by forraigne
Armies) and committed other outrages upon those
who stood affected to the Parliament, executing some,
and hanging up servants at their Masters doores, for
not discovering of their Masters. Upon which newes,
the Houses of Parliament fell into a serious debate,
and agreed that a Charge of High Treason should be
drawne up against him, for indeavouring the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this State, which was voted a great breach of
the Kingdoms Lawes, and breach of the priviledge of
that great Councell, representing the whole state of it.</p>

Let it not seeme amisse in this place to insert a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
happening at the same time, which cannot be
omitted by reason of the eminence of that person
whom it concernes, in the succeeding Warres.</p>
                  <p>Colonell GORING, who was before spoken of to
keepe the Towne of <hi>Portsmouth</hi> against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being now no longer able to hold it out, was
permitted by Captaine MERRICK, not without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
from the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to leave the
place, and to be conveyed to the <hi>Brill</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne desire: This the Parliament were
contented with, because the Captaine was necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to agree to it, for preservation of that Towne,
and many persons therein well affected to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for GORING had threatned to destroy the
Towne with wilde-fire, if he might not preserve his
owne life by a peaceable surrender.</p>
                  <p>Whilest Prince RUPERT was thus active with a
flying Party, the King himselfe was moving with
those Forces which he had, but in a gentler and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
way; for the reverence which the people bare to
his Person, made him finde lesse resistance; as windes
lose their fury when they meet no opposition; but
howsoever, the King desired to go in such a way, as
to be taken for a Father of his Country, and a Prince
injur'd by the Parliament; professions of love, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
and Protestations of his affection to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
were the chiefe instruments which he used to
raise himselfe a strength, and complaints against the
proceedings and actions of the Parliament; as when
he was marching toward <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make his chiefe Rendezvouze, being a place
convenient to receive and entertaine such Forces as
should come to him out of <hi>Wales:</hi> Which place (as
will appeare afterward) failed not his expectation,
though it were more then the Parliament could sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
As he was marching thither with a small Army,
he made a Speech betweene <hi>Stafford</hi> and <hi>Wellington,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96346:133"/>
on the 19. of <hi>September,</hi> and caused his Protestation
to be then also read in the head of his Army; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
among other things, he tells them (for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and hope to prevaile) that they should meet no
Enemies but Traytors, most of them Brownists,
Anabaptists, and Atheists, who would destroy both
Church and Common-wealth. And in this Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with deepe vowes, and imprecations upon
himselfe and his posterity, he declares his whole
care and intentions to be for the maintenance of the
Protestant Religion, the Lawes and property of the
Subject, together with the Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as he was accustomed to do in his former
Speeches.</p>
                  <p>But the King not many daies before, had taken a
more harsh and coercive way; for marching thorow
<hi>Derbyshire, Leicestershire,</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamshire,</hi> he
commanded the Trayned Bands of those Counties
to attend and guard his Person; and when they were
met, disarmed the greatest part of them, taking as
many Armes as served for 2000. men, besides good
summes of Money, which, not without some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
he borrowed from them.</p>
                  <p>But to leave the Kings proceedings for a while,
it is time to returne to the Lord Generall for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the Army raised under his conduct,
which at that time, when Prince RUPERT began to
march, was growne to a considerable body, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4 thousand Horse and Foot; their
generall Rendezvouze was at <hi>Northampton,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the chiefe Commanders, as the Lord BROOKE,
Lord ROBERTS, Colonell HAMDEN, and others,
stayed with them, expecting the presence of his
Excellence, who on the ninth of <hi>September</hi> taking
his leave of the Parliament and City of <hi>London,</hi> bent
his journey toward <hi>Northampton,</hi> and was waited on
by the Trayned Bands, and a great number of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Gentlemen from <hi>Essex</hi> House to the end of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96346:134"/>
City with great solemnity. But the love and wishes
of the people that did attend him, were farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any outward signification could expresse:
To whom he seemed at that time, though going to
a Civill Warre, as much an English man, and as true
a Patriot, as if he had gone against a forraigne Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Great was the love and honour which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in generall bore to his Person, in regard of his
owne vertue, and honourable demeanour; and much
increased by the Memory of his noble Father, the
highest example that ever I yet read, of a Favourite
both to Prince and people; of whom that was most
true, which VELLEIUS PATERCULUS speaks with
flattery and falshood of SEJANUS, <hi>In quo cum judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
Principis certabant studia populi,</hi> The peoples love
strived to match the Prince his judgement. That
Cause, wherein the Earle of ESSEX had ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
seemed to them religious enough to require
their prayers for the successe of it: For the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though they raised an Army, expressed much
humility and reverence to the Kings Person; for not
many daies after the departure of the Lord Generall,
by consent of both Houses, a Petition to the King
was drawne up, to be carried by Sir PHILIP STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLETON,
a Member of the House of Commons,
often spoken of before, and at this time a Colonell
in the Lord Generals Army. This Petition he carried
to <hi>Northampton</hi> to the Generall, to be by him presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(according to the Parliaments desire) to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
in a safe and honourable way: In which Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nothing at all (according to their former Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations)
is charged upon the King himselfe, but only
upon his wicked Councell, and the former mis-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
briefly mentioned; and that this wicked
Councell have raised an horrid Rebellion and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ever since, by opposition against
the Parliament, hindered the reliefe of that Kingdom,
and at last drawne his Majesty to make a War upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96346:134"/>
his Parliament, leading an Army in Person, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of his people, depriving his good Subjects
of his Majesties protection, and protecting those
Traytors against the Justice and Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>WE the Lords and Commons assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
have (<hi>for these are the words of the
Petition</hi>) for the just and necessary defence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, of your Majesties Person, Crowne, and
Dignity, of the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdome,
and the Priviledges and power of Parliaments, taken
up Armes, appointed and authorized <hi>ROBERT</hi> Earle
of <hi>ESSEX,</hi> to be Captaine Generall of all the Forces by
us raised, to conduct the same against those Rebels and
Traytors, to subdue and bring them to condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And we do most humbly beseech your Majesty, to
withdraw your Royall Presence and Countenance from
these wicked persons; and if they shall stand out in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their rebellious and unlawfull attempts, that your
Majesty will leave them to be supprest by that Power
which we have sent against them; And that your Majesty
will not mix your owne dangers with theirs, but in peace
and safety, without your Forces, forthwith returne to
your Parliament, and by their faithfull advice compose
the present distempers and confusions abounding in both
your Kingdomes, and provide for the security and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of your selfe and Royall Posterity, and the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
estate of all your Subjects. Wherein if your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
please to yeeld to our most humble and earnest desires;
We do in the presence of Almighty God professe, That we
will receive your Majesty with all Honour, yeeld you all
due obedience and subjection, and faithfully indeavour
to secure your Person and Estate from all dangers; and
to the uttermost of our Power, to procure and establish to
your selfe, and to your People, all the blessings of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96346:135"/>
According to this Petition were those Directions
from the Parliament to the Lord Generall sent at the
same time; wherein the Lord Generall is required by
the Houses, to use his utmost indeavour by Battell
or otherwise, to rescue the Kings Person, the Persons
of the Prince, and Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> out of the hands
of those desperate persons now about them. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Direction was, That if his Majesty upon this
humble Petition, should be pleased to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the persons now about him, and returne
to the Parliament, that then the Lord Generall should
disband, and should serve and defend his Majesty
with a sufficient strength in his returne. Another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
was, That his Excellency should proclaime
pardon to all those who were at that time seduced
against their Parliament and Country, if within ten
daies after that Proclamation they would returne to
their duty, doing no hostile act within the time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited:
Provided that this should not extend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any man into either House of Parliament, who
stands suspended, without giving satisfaction to that
House whereof he was a Member; and excepting
all persons impeached for Delinquency by either
House, and those persons who have been eminent
Actors in these Treasons, and therefore impeached
in Parliament of High Treason; such as were at that
time declared, and there named; the Earles of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll,
Cumberland, Newcastle,</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> Secretary
NICHOLAS, Master ENDYMION PORTER, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
EDWARD HIDE, the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the
Earle of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> Viscount <hi>Newarke,</hi> and Viscount
<hi>Fawkland;</hi> These were the persons at that time voted
against, and declared Traytors, though afterwards
others were added to the number of them, and many
of these left out, as occasions altered.</p>
                  <p>Such Directions, and others for the advantage of
the Army, and behoose of the Countries, thorow
which he was to march, were given by the Parliament
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96346:135"/>
to his Excellency; but above all things to restraine
carefully all impieties, prophannesse, and disorders
in his Army.</p>
                  <p>The Generall arriving at <hi>Northampton,</hi> was there
possessed of a great and gallant Army, well furnished
at all points, consisting of about twenty thousand,
with those that within few daies were to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
An Army too great to finde resistance at that
time from any Forces a foot in <hi>England;</hi> for the
Kings side had then small strength: What they had,
consisted of Horse, who in small Parties roved up and
downe, to make Provision, and force Contribution in
severall places. Prince RUPERT especially, like a
perpetuall motion, with those Horse which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
was in short time heard of at many places
of great distance. The care therefore which his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
especially tooke, was so to divide his great
Army, as to make the severall parts of it usefull, both
to annoy the stragling Troops of the Enemy, and
ptotect those Counties that stood affected to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as also to possesse himselfe, either in his
owne Person, or by his Lieutenants, of such Towns
as he thought might be of best import, if this sad War
should happen to continue.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Northampton</hi> he marched to <hi>Coventry,</hi> to make
that considerable City a Garrison for the Parliament;
and from thence to <hi>Warwick;</hi> and having fortified
that Towne, marched away towards <hi>Worcester,</hi> upon
intelligence that the King himselfe intended to come
thither with his Forces; for his desire was to finde out
the King; and the Parliament, to whom he imparted
his designe by Letter, approved well of his advance
towards <hi>Worcester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Worcester,</hi> as well as the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
had beene in great distractions, by reason not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the dissenting affections of the Inhabitants, but
the frequent invitations from both sides; if we may
call that an invitation, which is made by armed force.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96346:136"/>
Sir JOHN BYRON had first entred <hi>Worcester</hi> for the
Kings side, whom Master FIENNES Sonne to the
Lord SAY, had opposed for the Parliament; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
Prince RUPERT with five hundred Horse,
not farre from the City, was encountred by Master
FIENNES, who commanded another Body about
that number; the skirmish was but small, and not
above twelve men slaine, as the report was made at
<hi>London.</hi> But before the Lord Generall could arrive
at <hi>Worcester,</hi> (who was marching thither from <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
as was before expressed) there happened a fight
there, not to be omitted, in regard of the persons that
were there slaine or wounded, though the number
of men in generall that fell were small. Prince RU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERT
was then at <hi>Worcester</hi> with twelve Troops of
Horse, when about that City divers of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Forces were, though not joyned in one Body,
but dispersed: The Prince marched out of the City
into a greene Meadow, and there set his men in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
Array, to encounter whom he could first light
upon. Within halfe a mile of that Field were the
Parliament Troops, Colonell SANDYS with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Horse, Captaine HALES, and Captaine
WINGATE, who made toward the Prince; but their
passage was very disadvantagious, as being thorow a
narrow Lane, where onely foure of a breast could
march: Colonell SANDYS, whose fault was too
much courage, charging with his owne Regiment
thorow that Lane, too soone, before the rest of the
Parliament Forces could come up (for besides the
forenamed Captains, HALES and WINGATE, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
FIENNES, and Captaine AUSTIN, were not
farre off, and marching apace to their assistance)
made notwithstanding some slaughter of the Prince
his men, and maintained the Fight untill the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Forces approached the place; but then the
Prince, the two sides growing into some equality of
number, fearing, perchance, to be too long ingaged
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96346:136"/>
in a Fight, untill the Lord Generals Army might
approach, some of the fore-runners not being farre
off, retreated back into the City of <hi>Worcester,</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
which he marched away with as much speed as
he could, the Parliament Forces following him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Towne, and so over a Bridge, about which
some of the Parliament Dragoneers were placed, who
cut off twenty of the Prince his Troopers, and tooke
thirty Prisoners. There were sound dead at the place
of their first incounter 13. men. There were slaine
of the Parliament side of note, Colonell SANDS his
Cornet, who first of all fell, and Serjeant Major
DOUGLAS; Colonell SANDS himselfe was despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
wounded, of which wounds he died about a
Moneth after. It was reported that Colonell WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOT,
of whom we have spoken before, and who was
afterward an eminent Champion on the Kings side,
was in this conflict runne thorow the body by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
SANDS.</p>
                  <p>His Excellency immediately after this fight, came
to <hi>Worcester</hi> with his Army, where he resolved to
quarter a while, as a place convenient to send out
Parties upon all occasions, and watch the motion of
the Kings Forces. This discourse shall here leave him,
and relate the passages of the other Armies.</p>
                  <p>Prince RUPERT having left <hi>Worcester,</hi> marched
with his Troops to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> twenty miles distant
thence; and the King with a small Body of Horse,
passed into <hi>Wales,</hi> and having made a Speech full of
Protestations, to the Inhabitants of <hi>Denbigh</hi> and <hi>Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and gained some Parties there, the next day he
marched to <hi>Shr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wsbury,</hi> where he intended to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a time, as a fit Rendezvouze for those Forces
expected from <hi>Wales,</hi> and other neere adjacent parts.
To <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> the King caused a Mint to be brought,
and there coyned all the Plate which he then had, or
was then and soone after presented to him; for many
Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, about that time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96346:137"/>
had furnished the King, not onely with Horses and
Armes, but Money and Plate, as the Citizens of
<hi>London,</hi> and other Gentlemen had done to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon their Publike Faith, as is before expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
It is a wonderfull thing, almost beyond what
himselfe could hope, or the Parliament suspect, how
much and how suddenly the King grew in strength,
in that little time that he quartered at <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi>
The King, within few daies after his coming thither,
had in publike, to the Gentry, Freeholders, and other
Inhabitants of that County, made an Oration full
of perswasive Art, and such winning expressions, as
fitted the purpose he had in hand, such as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him to the thoughts of those people, an injur'd
Prince, and move compassionate affections toward
him. Which Speech of his, as it was reported and
printed in <hi>London,</hi> I shall here insert.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen:</p>
                  <p>IT is some benefit to me, from the insolencies and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
which have driven me about, that they have
brought me to so good a part of my Kingdome, and to
so faithfull a part of my People: I hope neither you nor
I shall repent my coming hither; I will do my part that
you may not; and of you I was confident before I came.
The residence of an Army is not usually pleasant to any
place; and mine may carry more feare with it, since it
may be thought (being robb'd and spoiled of all mine
owne, and such terrour used to fright and keep all men
from supplying of me) I must onely live upon the aid
and reliefe of my people. But be not afraid; I would to
God my poore Subjects suffered no more by the insolence
and violence of that Army raised against me (though
they have made themselves wanton even with plenty) then
you shall do by mine; and yet I feare I cannot prevent all
disorders; I will do my best: And this I promise you,
No man shall be a looser by me, if I can help it.</p>
                  <p>I have sent hither for a Mint; I will melt downe all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96346:137"/>
my owne Plate, and expose all my Land to sale or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
that if it be possible, I may bring the least pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon you: In the meane time, I have summoned
you hither to do that for me and your selves, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of your Religion, and the Law of the Land (by
which you enjoy all that you have) which other men do
against us. Do not suffer so good a Cause to be lost, for
want of supplying me with that, which will be taken from
you by those who pursue me with this violence. And
whilest these ill men sacrifice their Money, Plate, and
utmost industry to destroy the Common-wealth, be you no
lesse liberall to preserve it. Assure your selves, if it please
God to blesse me with successe, I shall remember the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
that every particular man here gives me, to his
advantage. However, it will hereafter (how furiously
soever the minds of men are now possessed) be honour and
comfort to you, that with some charge and trouble to your
selves, you did your part to support your King, and
preserve the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But with such skill had the King managed his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
there, and so much had fortune crowned his
indeavours, that before the middle of <hi>October,</hi> which
was about three weekes after his first comming to
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> with an inconsiderable Body of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he was growne to a great strength, consisting of
about six thousand Foot, three thousand brave Horse,
and almost two thousand Dragoneers; And purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
about that time to remove from thence, he issued
out Warrants to the Inhabitants of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and
other adjacent Townes and Villages, to send Horses
and Carts for his removall.</p>
                  <p>The King marched a long within the view of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi>
but not intending to lose any time there in
sitting downe before it, unlesse the Towne had been
freely surrendred to him: But that was denyed,
though in a very humble Message, by the Governour
of it. Marching on, he came and lay at <hi>Southam,</hi> when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96346:138"/>
the Lord Generall <hi>Essex</hi> was not many miles distant
from him. So much was the King now growne in
strength, that he was able, at so great a distance, to
strike some terrour into the City of <hi>London</hi> it selfe,
and provoke their sedulous indeavour for a defence
against his feared approach, though the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Essex</hi> with as great an Army, were then abroad
to attend his Marches. The Parliament it selfe tooke
the businesse into their strict care: For both Houses
conceiving that the City was in imminent danger of
the Kings Forces, ordered, That the Trayned Bands
thereof should be speedily raised for a Guard; That
such Fortifications as could suddenly be made, should
not be wanting; That a Committee should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to consider of the present setting up Courts
of Guard, and raising Works, for planting of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in speciall places about the City and Suburbs.
According to which Order many hundreds of men
fell presently to worke, in digging of Trenches, and
other Bulwarks. It was Ordered likewise, That the
Trayned Bands of <hi>London, Middlesex,</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi>
should be put into a readinesse; And that the close
Committee, by help of the Lord Mayor, should with
all diligence search out, and secure the persons of all
the ill-affected Citizens, or the chiefe of them, that
were suspected to be most able, or active, to raise a
Party against the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Twelve Companies of <hi>London,</hi> were by Order
of Parliament sent to <hi>Windsor,</hi> to possesse and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that Castle; and many Seamen raised to guard the
passages of the River <hi>Thames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament about that time considering how
much these Civill distractions increased over the
whole Kingdome, passed a Vote, That it was and
should be lawfull for all Counties in <hi>England</hi> to enter
into an Association, for mutuall defence of each other,
of their Religion, Lawes, and Liberties. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
within a short time after, <hi>Buckingham, Hartford,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:96346:138"/>
and <hi>Nottinghamshire,</hi> began to associate after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
raised Forces for the Parliament, and advanced
both Plate and Money upon their Propositions.</p>
                  <p>The danger that seemed to threaten <hi>London</hi> at that
time, though distant in place, yet in reason was neer.
For the Kings Army was judged to be neerer to it,
then the Lord Generals was; and it was probable
enough, that his desires would rather lead him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the City, then to ingage against the Army;
and it was thought and spoken by some, that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was a place where he had many friends, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the approach of such an Army, would appeare for
him, and to facilitate his atchievements, would fill
the City with intestine tumults and seditions. That
<hi>London</hi> was the onely place where the Parliament was
to be totally suppressed, and his Army inriched to
the height of their desires. But others were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that such an attempt, as it was preposterous,
would prove frustrate, and that the City could not
be gained, unlesse the Army were first subdued. For
besides the consideration, that the supposed Party
for the King in <hi>London,</hi> were not in probability of
power enough to accomplish his ends, it might be
thought they were not so desperately inclined to him,
as to throw themselves and estates into such hazard,
as must be undergone in the confused rage of a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Army. The maine reason against it was, That
the Lord Generall <hi>Essex,</hi> with an Army as strong as
the Kings, would follow his March neere at hand,
and by the help of those Forces which the City of
<hi>London</hi> would power forth upon him, utterly ruine
his inclosed Army. But howsoever the counsels were,
it pleased God that it was brought to a Battell, to
which probably the King might be the more invited
by that advantage of the absence of a great part of
the Parliaments Army.</p>
                  <p>This famous Battell, called by some the Battell of
<hi>Edgehill,</hi> by others the Battell of <hi>Keynton</hi> (that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96346:139"/>
                     <hi>Keynton</hi> is a little Towne in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> almost in
the mid way betweene <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>)
was fought on a Sunday, being the 23. day of
<hi>October.</hi> The King on Saturday the 22. of <hi>October,</hi>
came within six miles of <hi>Keynton,</hi> and that night at
<hi>Cropredy,</hi> and <hi>Edgecot</hi> lodged his great Army, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of about 14000. Foot, and about 4000. Horse and
Dragoneers; a farre greater number then the Lord
Generall <hi>Essex</hi> had together at that time (though his
whole Army consisted of more,) for that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the King tooke of the absence of many Regiments
of the Parliament. The Lord Generall <hi>Essex</hi> on that
Saturday night quartered at <hi>Keynton</hi> with his Army,
consisting then but of 12. Regiments, and about 40.
Troops of Horse, little in all exceeding the number
of 10000. men; the reason why his Forces at that
time were no more in number, was, besides that by
reason of the suddennesse of his march, and diligence
to follow the Kings Army, he had left behinde two
Regiments of his Foot, one under the Command of
Colonell HAMDEN, the other of Colonell GRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAM,
together with 11. Troops of Horse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
but one daies March, and left to bring on the
Artillery, which was seven Peeces of Canon, with
great store of Ammunition, and came not to <hi>Keynton</hi>
till the Battell was quite ended; the Lord Generall
also had before left for preservation of the Countries
thereabout (and whom on such a sudden he could
not call together to his Assistance) one Regiment
of Foot, and two Troops of Horse, under command
of the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> at <hi>Hereford,</hi> that the power
of <hi>Wales</hi> might not fall into <hi>Glocestershire;</hi> another
Regiment was left at <hi>Worcester,</hi> another at <hi>Coventry,</hi>
for the safety of that Towne, and one Regiment
occasionally lodged then in <hi>Banbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Keynton</hi> the Lord Generall intended to rest Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to expect the residue of his Forces and Artillery,
but in the morning the Enemy was discovered not far
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96346:139"/>
off, which made him give present order for drawing
that Army which he had there into the field; the
Kings Forces had gotten the advantage of a very high
and steepe ascent, called <hi>Edgehill,</hi> from whence they
were discovered that morning; not farre from the
foot of that hill, was a broad Champion, called, <hi>The
vale of the red Horse,</hi> a name suitable to the colour
which that day was to bestow upon it, for there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the greatest part of the encounter. Into that
field the Lord Generall was forced presently to march,
making a stand about halfe a mile distant from the
foot of <hi>Edgehill,</hi> where he drew his Army into <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,</hi>
and saw the Kings Forces descending the Hill,
ready for their incounter; that Army at the first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
two advantages, of the hill, and of the winde;
it was full of skilfull Commanders, and well ordered;
their greatest Body of Horse was on the right wing,
on the left were some Horse and Dragoneers.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament Army was drawne up, and put
into <hi>Battalia</hi> upon a little rising ground in the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Vale, the Foot being, many of them, a good
space behind the Horse, when the Charge began.
Three Regiments of Horse were on the right wing,
the Lord Generals owne Regiment, commanded by
Sir PHILIP STAPLETON, Sir WILLIAM BA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORES
Regiment, who was Lieutenant Generall
of the Horse; and the Lord FIELDINGS Regiment,
which stood behinde the other two, in the way of a
Reserve, Sir JOHN MELDRUMS Brigado had the
Van; Colonell ESSEX was in the middle; the Lord
Generals Regiment, the Lord BROOKE, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
HOLLIS, were in the Reare; in the left wing
were about 20. Troops of Horse, commanded by
Sir JAMES RAMSEY their Commissary Generall.
In this posture they stood, when the other Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
toward them, the strength of their Horse
being (as aforesaid) on their right wing, opposite
to the left wing of the Parliament Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96346:140"/>
The Canon on both sides with a loud thunder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Fight, in which the successe was not equall,
the Parliaments Canon doing great execution upon
their Enemies, but theirs very little.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> Generall for the King, with
a Pike in his hand, led on the maine Body of that
Army, in which was the Kings owne Regiment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
by the Lord Generall <hi>Essex,</hi> who exposed
himselfe to all the danger that a Battell could make,
first leading on his Troope, then his owne Regiment
of Foot, and breathing courage into them, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disswaded by divers from ingaging himselfe too
farre, he returned to the rest of the Army, to draw
them on. The chiefe Regiments having begun the
Battell, Sir PHILIP STAPLETON, with a brave
Troope of Gentlemen (which were the Generals
Life Guard, and commanded by him) charged the
Kings Regiment on their right flanke within their
Pikes, and came off without any great hurt, though
those Pikemen stoutly defended themselves, and
the Musqueteers being good firemen, played fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon them. The Battell was hot at that place,
and so many of the Kings side slaine, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Army began to be victorious there; they tooke
the Standard Royall, the bearer thereof Sir EDMUND
VARNEY, being slaine, and the Generall the Earle of
<hi>Lindsey</hi> sore wounded, was taken Prisoner. But
the same fortune was not in every part; for the Kings
right wing, led by Prince RUPERT, charged fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the left wing of the other (consisting most
of Horse) and prevailed altogether, for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Troops ranne almost all away in that Wing,
and many of their Foot Companies, dismayed with
their flight, fled all away, before they had stood one
Charge; Colonell ESSEX being utterly forsaken by
that whole Brigade which he commanded, went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into the Van, where he performed excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
both by direction and execution, till at the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96346:140"/>
last he was shot in the thigh, of which he shortly
after died; (some part of their disheartning was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the revolt of their owne side; for Sir FAITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FULL
FORTESCUE, at the beginning of the Fight,
instead of charging the Enemy, discharged his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll
to the ground, and with his Troope, wheeling
about, ranne to the Kings Army, to whom he had
formerly given notice thereof by his Cornet.) The
Parliament Army had undoubtedly been ruined that
day, and an absolute Victory gained on the Kings
side, if Prince RUPERT, and his pursuing Troops
had been more temperate in plundering so untimely
as they did, and had wheeled about to assist their
distressed friends in other parts of the Army; for
Prince RUPERT followed the chase to <hi>Keynton</hi>
Towne, where the Carriages of the Army were,
which they presently pillaged, using great cruelty,
as was afterward related, to the unarmed Waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and labouring men; A great number of the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parliament Souldiers were slaine in that Chase,
which lasted two miles beyond <hi>Keynton;</hi> and so far,
till the Pursuers were forced to retire, having met with
Colonell HAMBDEN, who marched with the other
Brigado of the Army, that brought on the Artillery
and Ammunition, before spoken of, Colonell HAMB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN
discharged five Peeces of Canon against them,
some were slaine, and the rest ceasing the pursuit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
hastily to the field, where they found all their
Infantry, excepting two Regiments, quite defeated;
for in the meane time, Sir WILLIAM BALFORE,
Lieutenant Generall of the Horse, with a Regiment
of Horse, charged a Regiment of the Kings Foot,
before any Foot of his owne side could come up to
him, and breaking most bravely into it, had cut most
of them off; and afterward, by the assistance of some
Foot, who were come up to him, he defeated ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Regiment, and so got up to the greatest part of
the Kings Ordinance, taking some of them, cutting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96346:141"/>
off the Geeres of the Horses that drew them, and
killing the Gunners, but was inforced to leave them
without any Guard, by reason that he laboured most
to make good the day against severall Regiments of
the Kings Foot, who still fought with much resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
especially that which was of the Kings Guard,
where his Standard was; by which Sir WILLIAM
BALFORES Regiment rode, when they came back
from taking the Ordnance, and were by them mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for their owne side, passing without any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility,
was the cause, that immediately afterward,
Sir WILLIAM riding up toward the Lord Generall
ESSEX his Regiment of Horse, they gave fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sir WILLIAM BALFORES men, supposing
them to be Enemies, but soone discovering each other,
they joyned Companies, and were led up with halfe
the Lord Generals Regiment, by his Excellency him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
against the Kings maine strength, where a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and bloody incounter happened: At the same
time Colonell BALLARD, who led a Brigado there
of the Lord Generals Regiment, and the Lord
BROOKS his, forced a stand of the Kings Pikes, and
brooke thorow two of his Regiments.</p>
                  <p>In this great conflict the Standard Royall (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
was taken, and Sir EDMUND VARNEY slaine,
the Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> with his Sonne, taken Prisoners,
together with Colonell VAVASOR, Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
of that Regiment, Colonell MUNROE also
was there slaine.</p>
                  <p>The Standard thus taken, and put into the Lord
Generals hand, was by him delivered to his Secretary
Master CHAMBERS; but the Secretary, after he
had carried it some time in his hand, suffered it to be
taken from him by an unknowne person, and so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
it was conveyed away. There also was great
service performed by the Lord GRAY, Sonne to the
Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> and Sir ARTHUR HASLERIG,
and a considerable help given to the turning of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96346:141"/>
day, by defeating a Regiment of the Kings, called the
blew Regiment.</p>
                  <p>By this time all the Kings Foot, excepting two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
were dispersed, and the Parliamentarians had
gotten the advantage of the winde, and that ground
which their Enemies had fought upon. Those two
Regiments of the Kings, retiring themselves, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Ordnance behind them without any guard,
tooke stand there, and made use of their Canon, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
many shot against their Enemies. But at that
time the Parliament Foot began to want powder,
otherwise (as was observed by a Commander in that
Army) they had charged them both with Horse and
Foot; which in all probability would have utterly
ruined the Kings Infantry, consisting in a manner
but of two Regiments.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Parliament Army, partly for want of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
and partly being tired with so long a fight
(for the whole brunt of the Battell had been sustey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by two Regiments of their Horse, and foure or
five of their Foot) made no great haste to charge
any more.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Horse, who had been long pillaging
about <hi>Keynton,</hi> by this time had leisure to come about
on both hands, and joyne themselves to their Foot;
but as they came back on the left hand of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Sir PHILIP STAPLETON with his Horse, gave
them a terrible Charge, which they were not long able
to indure, but finding a gap in an hedge, got from
him upon the Spurre as fast as they could, to the rest
of their broken Troops, and so at last joyned with
their Foot that stood by the Ordinance. And now on
both sides the Horse were gathered to their own Foot,
and so stood together both Horse and Foot, one against
another, till it was night.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament Army being wholly possessed of
the ground which their Enemies had chosen to fight
upon, stood upon it all night, and in the morning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96346:142"/>
returned to a warmer place neere <hi>Keynton,</hi> where
they had quartered the night before; for they were
much pinched with cold, and the whole Army in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
want of Victuals.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Army had withdrawne to the top of the
hill, for their more security, where they made great
fires all the night long.</p>
                  <p>About nine of the clock the next morning the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Army drew out againe into Battalia, and so
stood about three houres, untill the other Army was
quite gone from the hill, and then they withdrew
themselves into their Quarter towards <hi>Keynton,</hi> and
to their other Brigado, Artillery, and Ammunition,
which being commanded by Colonell HAMBDEN
and Colonell GRANTHAM (as aforesaid) was now
come to <hi>Keynton,</hi> and lodged there. The King had
drawne out his Horse upon the further side of the hill,
where he stayed till toward night, whilest his Foot
were retiring behinde the Hill, and marching away.
A little before night, his Horse also withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and about an houre after, the Parliament
Horse marched quite away, and went with the rest
of the Army to <hi>Warwick</hi> to refresh themselves.</p>
                  <p>That going to <hi>Warwick</hi> was thought by a noble
Gentleman of the Parliament side to be ill designed,
For (saith he) had the Army, instead of going to
<hi>Warwick,</hi> marched toward <hi>Banbury,</hi> we should have
found more Victuals, and had, in probability, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
all the Foot of the Kings Army, taken his
Canons and Carriages, and sent his Horse farther off,
whereas now, because we did not follow them, though
they quitted the field whereon they fought, and
left their Quarter before us, yet they began soone
after to question who had the day. Howsoever it
were, true it is, that the King, no lesse then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
pretended to be victorious in that Battell;
and so farre ascribed the Victory to his owne side, that
a Prayer of thanksgiving to God was made at <hi>Oxford</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96346:142"/>
for it. A thanksgiving was also on the Parliament side
for the Victory of that day. And it is certaine, that
there were many markes of Victory on both Armies,
Colours and Canon were taken on both sides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great difference of the number of them And
though in Speeches made afterwards by either Party,
and Bookes printed, there is no consent at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the number of men slain, but so great a discrepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as it is almost a shame to insert into an History; yet
surely by the best account there were more slaine on
the Kings side, then on the other; Those of quality
that were lost on both Parties, were of the Kings, the
Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> Lord Generall of his Army, the
Lord AUBIGNY, brother to the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Sir
EDWARD VARNEY Standard-Bearer, Colonell Sir
EDMUND MONROY, a Scottish Gentleman, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
LUNSFORD his Brother, with other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Commanders, besides Common Souldiers,
whose number (as is before said) would not be
agreed upon; yet I have heard, that the Country
people thereabouts, by burying of the naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
found the number to be about six thousand that
fell on both sides, besides those which died afterwards
of their wounds. There were taken Prisoners of the
Kings side, the Lord WILLOUGHBY, Sonne and
Heire to the Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> Colonell VAVASOR,
Colonell LUNSFORD, Sir EDWARD STRADLING,
with others of lesse note; a George, the Badge of a
Knight of the Garter, was found in the field by a
Common Souldier (besides that which the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>Lindsey</hi> wore, and had about his neck when
he was slaine) and bought of him by a Captaine,
which was sent up to the Parliament, there viewed,
and restored againe to the Captaine.</p>
                  <p>On the Parliament side were slaine onely these of
marke and quality, the Lord St. JOHN, eldest
Sonne to the Earle of BULLENBROOKE, Colonell
CHARLES ESSEX, and Lieutenant Colonell RAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEY,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96346:143"/>
and none of any great note taken Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>The Battell was fought with great courage on both
sides, both by the Generals and other Commanders,
besides some particular Regiments of Souldiers, who
were observed to performe their parts with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and bravery, such as Colonell HOLLIS his
Regiment of Redcoats, and others, too many to be
all named in a short Discourse.</p>
                  <p>It could not but fall into the observation of many
men, that the yeare before, upon the same day of the
Moneth, namely, the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Battell of <hi>Keynton</hi> was fought, the bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of the Irish broke out, with that inhumane
Massacre of the English Protestants in that Kingdom,
where the English by their owne losse and bleeding,
were sadly put in minde, that they had too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the revenge of their butchered Brethren in
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was likewise observed by many men of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
side (who seemed to make no question but
that the Victory was on their side, as a further blessing
of God to the Protestant Cause) that on the very
same day that this Battell was wonne in <hi>England,</hi> the
Sweads obtained a very great and notable Victory
against the Imperialists, and those of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the King, supposing himselfe victorious at
<hi>Keynton</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ield, immediately published a Declaration,
<hi>To all his loving Subjects</hi> (for so it is stiled) <hi>after his
Victory against the Rebels.</hi> Wherein, though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation
be very bitter, yet he indeavoureth that
it should not seeme to be made against the Parliament
it selfe, but against some of them, whom he term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
malignant, malicious, with such like Epithites,
as have laboured to lay aspersions upon him of things,
whereof he professeth himselfe altogether innocent.
Those aspersions he makes of two sorts, the first is,
concerning his favouring of Popery, and imploying
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96346:143"/>
Papists in his Army; the second, of raising that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against the Parliament. Both which he labours to
wipe off, with a recrimination against the Parliament.
For the first, after a great Protestation of the truth
of his Religion, and his past, present, and future care
for the better establishing of it in his Dominions,
with the extirpation of Popery; though he cannot
but acknowledge, that some eminent men of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are armed in his Service, which he thinks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
in so gteat a necessity and danger as he was
in; yet he tells the Parliament, That in their Army
there are more Papists Commanders and others then
in his.</p>
                  <p>For the second, That he leavyed his Army against
the Parliament. He seemeth to hope, That none of
his good Subjects will beleeve it, unlesse they will
beleeve, that a dozen or twenty factious and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons be the high Court of Parliament, which
consists of King, Lords and Commons. For the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament, he averres, That whosoever
will not believe the raising of an Army to kill their
King; To alter the government and Lawes by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Votes of either or both Houses; To force
the Members to submit to their Faction, and take
away freedome of consultation from them, to be the
Priviledge, of Parliament; must confesse, That the
Army now raised by the King, is no lesse for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
and preservation of Parliaments, then for his
owne necessary defence.</p>
                  <p>The King chargeth them likewise with uncharity,
That they have indeavoured to raise an implacable
hatred betweene the Gentry and Commonalty of the
Kingdome, by rendring all persons of Honour odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Common People under the stile of Cavali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and to perswade the people, that there was an
intention by the Commission of Array, to take away
a part of their Estates from them. Which he denyes,
and concludes with Protestations to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96346:144"/>
The Parliament returned answer to this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not as being the Kings (according to their
oft mentioned custome) but comming from wicked
and malicious contrivers of falshood and scandals,
Who (say they) to our unspeakable sorrowes, have
gained so much power with his Majesty, as to vent
the same under the Title of his owne Royall
Name.</p>
                  <p>For the first objection; They do not affirme that
the King favours Popery himselfe, but justifie that
things have been carried in the favour of it by some
about him, according to the particular instances in
many of their former Declarations. They seeme to
be amazed at the strange boldnesse of the Contrivers
of that Declaration, in averring that there are more
Papists in their Army, then in the Kings; whereas
they cannot, or at least, do not name any one, which
they desire may be done, if there be any such, that
the Parliament may know how to displace them. But
the Parliament in their Answer name many of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
ranke and quality of that Religion in the Kings
Army, who have raised him in some Counties the
most considerable Forces which he hath; and many
Commissions granted by himselfe to Papists, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
so. That it were sencelesse to thinke that any
Papists favoured the Parliaments Cause at all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is certaine, that there are none of that Religion,
but are either openly or secretly assistant to that
cause which the King hath taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the second objection; That the Kings Forces
are not leavyed against the Parliament it selfe, but a
few seditious persons.</hi> They thinke it an impossible thing,
that twelve or twenty such persons (as they are termed)
should have power to compell the rest of that Body to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their Faction, and to have their freedome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
taken from them.</p>
                  <p>The truth is <hi>(say they)</hi> not a few persons, but the
Parliament it selfe, is the thorne that lyes in these mens
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96346:144"/>
sides; which heretofore, when it was wont to prick them,
was with much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ase, by a sudden dissolution, pulled out:
But now that it is more deeply fastened by an Act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
they would force it out by the power of an Army.</p>
                  <p>That whosoever will read the Speeches and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made upon the breaking up of all former Parliaments,
ever since the beginning of this Kings Reigne, will finde
the pretences of those unjust dissolutions, to be grounded
upon exceptions against particular Members, under the
name of a few factious and seditious persons; so that
the aspersing and wounding of the Parliament thorow the
sides of a few Members, is no new invention.</p>
                  <p>But (say they) those former Declarations in the
Kings name, being groundlesse invectives, not against
particular Members, but against the Votes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of both Houses; and declaring the Earle of
<hi>Essex,</hi> Generall of the Forces raised by them, to be a
Traytor; and that all those which assist him, thereby
comprehending both Houses of Parliament, by whose
Command and Authority he bears that place, to be
Rebels, and guilty of High Treason, is argument
sufficient (no groundlesse accusation) to prove the
Kings Army to be raised against the Parliament, or to
take away the Priviledges thereof.</p>
                  <p>Those Priviledges of Parliament, consisting in three
things: 1. As they are a Councell to advise. 2. A
Court to judge. 3. A representative body of the
Realme, to make, repeal, or alter Lawes. These
Priviledges have (say they) during the sitting of this
Parliament, been all apparently broken, to the view
of all men, by the Kings wicked Councell. Their
advice scarse at all hearkened unto by the King, but
other counsels of unknowne persons preferred before
them. For the second, as a Court to judge; The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
so pronounced by the Parliament, have bin

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ected by the King against them; of which they
give many particular instances. Touching the third,
for making Laws; They instance his refusall of many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96346:145"/>
wholsome Bils for Church and State, besides the
breaking of their Priviledges, they produce some
attempts utterly to subvert them, as the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
indeavour of bringing up the Northerne Army,
to force Conditions upon the Parliament; the Kings
Letters and Commands to Members of both Houses
to attend him at <hi>Yorke,</hi> leaving their true and legall
station; which when they obeyed, it was scandalously
alleadged that they were driven away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For any violence intended to the Kings Person, as
they utterly deny it, so they referre it to indifferent
men to judge, by all their long sufferings, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Petitions to him, to avoid those indangerings of
his Person. But for that imputation layed upon them,
of an indeavour to raise an implacable malice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
between the Gentry and Commonalty of the
Kingdome; They conceive it a Charge of a strange
nature, that they should indeavour to raise the hatred
of the Commonalty against themselves.</hi> For so it must
follow, unlesse the Contrivers of that Declaration will
deny the Parliament to be Gentlemen. But though we know
(say they) well, there are too many of the Gentry of this
Kingdome, who, to satisfie the lusts of their owne ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are content to sell their birth-right, to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their posterity to perpetuall slavery, and to
submit themselves to any arbitrary and unlimited power of
Government, so they may for their owne time pertake of
that Power, to trample and insult over others; Yet we are
certaine that there are many true hearted Gentlemen, who
are ready to lay downe their lives and fortunes (and of
late have given ample testimony thereof) for maintenance
of their Lawes, Liberties, and Religion, with whom,
and others of their resolution, we shall be ready to live
and dye.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they prove by particular instances, that in
the Kings Commission of Array, there is not onely an
intention to take away part of mens Estates, but that
it hath been put into reall execution; with many
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96346:145"/>
other things in justification of all their proceedings
and Declarations; which may be read more at large
in the Records. This was the effect of that verball
Skirmish, which immediately followed the great and
bloody Battell of <hi>Keynton.</hi>

to that side, where there seemed to be least
feares, and greatest hopes, which was the Kings
Party; for on the Parliament side the incouragements
were onely publike, and nothing promised but the
free injoyment of their native Liberty; no particular
honours, preferments, or Estates of Enemies; and on
the other side, no such totall ruine could be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Looke upon the Discourse of one Historian in that
subject, DION CASSIUS, a Writer of as little bias,
in the opinion of all Criticks, as any among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
when he relates the last Warre about Roman
Liberty, after which (as himselfe speaks) that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
never againe looked back toward it. Which was
the Warre of BRUTUS and CASSIUS against CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR
and ANTONY; <hi>Etsi ante hanc pugnam civilibus
bellis, &amp;c.</hi> Although (saith DION) before this War
they had many Civill Wars, yet in others they fought
who should oppresse the Roman Liberty; in this
War, one side fought to vindicate Liberty, the other
to bring in Tyranny, yet the side of Tyranny pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
and drew most to it: Of what quality they
were, the same Historian speaks also: The Armies of
BRUTUS and CASSIUS, that stood for Liberty,
consisted of the lower sort of people, and <hi>Ex sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis
Romanorum,</hi> the other that stood for Tyranny,
consisted (saith he) <hi>Ex Romanis Nobilibus, &amp; Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
BRUTUS and CASSIUS, two chiefe Souldiers,
before the Battell making Orations, incouraged them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96346:146"/>
to fight for their ancient freedome, and Roman Laws.
CAESAR and ANTONY promised to their Souldiers
the Estates of their Enemies, <hi>Et imperium in omnes
Gentiles suos,</hi> and power to rule over their owne
Countrymen; which proved, it seemes, better Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
then the other, and more perswasive. BRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS
and CASSIUS delayed the Battell, as loath
to waste so much blood, if by any other stratagem
they might have subdued; because they were (saith
DION) good men, and pittyed their Countrymen,
loving the safety, and striving for the Liberty even
of those men, who fought against them, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
that Liberty; Yet that delay proved ill, and
many Noblemen in that time forsooke them, and
turned to the other side, whither their private hopes
or feares led them. Whether the parrallel will in some
measure fit this occasion or not, I leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and returne to the Narration.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> the next day after <hi>Keynton</hi>
Battell, marched with his Army toward <hi>Warwick,</hi> to
which Towne he arrived safe, disposing of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
Waggons, and Ordnance, which he had taken,
into that Castle, with resolution after some short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
of his men there, to march neerer to the
King: But the King returned toward <hi>Oxford,</hi> seizing
by the way upon <hi>Banbury,</hi> from whence he tooke
1500. Armes, and turned out the Parliament Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that were quartered there.</p>
                  <p>His Army, consisting especially of Horse, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into severall Bodyes, and Prince RUPERT with
part of it, visited the Towns neere adjacent, as <hi>Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Henley,</hi> and other places; from whence he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with great booty.</p>
                  <p>Within few daies he made a neerer approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>London,</hi> but with a flying Army, resting in no
place, sometimes as farre as <hi>Stanes</hi> and <hi>Egham,</hi> which
made the City of <hi>London</hi> carefull to provide for their
safety against sudden incursions, and send Forces to
possesse and fortifie <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:96346:147"/>
In the meane time, to secure <hi>London,</hi> and free those
parts from greater feares, the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with his Army neerer to that City, and on the
seventh day of <hi>November</hi> came himselfe to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
(his Army being billitted about <hi>Acton,</hi> and other
neere places) and was welcomed by both Houses of
Parliament, who presented him with a gift of 5000 <hi>l.</hi>
as an acknowledgement of their thanks, in behalfe of
the Kingdome, for his care, paines, and valour, in
the actions already passed.</p>
                  <p>But before the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> departed from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
another bloody tragedy was acted, and the
scene no farther then <hi>Brainford,</hi> about eight miles
distance, the King himselfe being there, or not farre
off in Person. The manner and occasion of it shall
be in briefe related.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament expressing great griefe for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Warre and bloodshed, that this indangered
Kingdome might be saved from ruine, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meanes made to recover <hi>Ireland,</hi> had agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Petition for Accommodation, to be presented to
the King, then at <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> by the Earles of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
and <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> with foure Commons,
the Lord WAINMAN, Master PERPOINT, Sir
JOHN EVELIN, and Sir JOHN IPSLEY; Sir PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
KILLIGREW was sent before to procure a safe
Conduct. But the King refused to admit of Sir JOHN
EVELYN, because he was one whom himselfe had
named Traytor the day before. Which exception
of the Kings was extremely distasted by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet so great was their desire of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that although this excepting of Sir JOHN EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN,
were voted by them a breach of Priviledge, and
a flat denyall from the King, the Petition was sent
by the five forenamed Lords and Gentlemen, Sir
JOHN EVELIN being very willing to be left out.</p>
                  <p>The King being then at <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> fifteene miles
distant, seemed to receive the Petition with great
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96346:147"/>
willingnesse, and returned them a faire Answer, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
God to witnesse in many Protestations, that he
was tenderly compassionate of his bleeding people,
and more desirous of nothing, then a speedy peace;
to which purpose he was most willing, at any place
where he should reside, not farre from <hi>London,</hi> to
receive such Propositions of Peace as they should
send, and to treat with them.</p>
                  <p>As soone as the Parliament Lords returned with
this Answer, the Kings Artillery (according to all
relations) advanced forwards with divers Troops of
Horse, thorow that Towne of <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> after them
towards <hi>London;</hi> and taking advantage of a great mist
which happened that Friday night, they marched to
<hi>Brainford,</hi> and fell upon the Parliament Forces which
were there quartered, which were a broken Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Colonell HOLLIS, but stout men, who
had before done great service. Of them the Kings
Forces killed many, and had quite destroyed all in
probability, if the Lord BROOKS, and Colonell
HAM<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>DENS Regiments, billitted not farre off, had
not made haste to their reliefe, who comming in,
maintained a great and bloody fight against the Kings
Forces, where many were slaine on both sides, and
many taken Prisoners; both Parties, as before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
at <hi>Keynton</hi> Battell, esteeming themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
and so reporting afterwards. The newes
of this unexpected fight was soone brought to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
whither also the noise of the great Artillery was
easily heard.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Generall <hi>Essex,</hi> then sitting at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
in the House of Peeres, tooke Horse immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and with what strength he could call together
on such a sudden, came in to the rescue of his inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Regiments; but night had parted them, and the
King was retired to his best advantages; all that night
the City of <hi>London</hi> powred out men toward <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
who every houre marched thither, and all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96346:148"/>
Lords and Gentlemen that belonged to the Army,
were there ready on the Sunday morning, being the
14. of <hi>November,</hi> a force great enough to have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up a farre greater Army then the King had.
Besides, the Kings Forces were encompassed on every
side; insomuch as great hope was conceived by most
men, that the period of this sad Warre was now
come. But God was not yet appeased toward this
Nation; a fatall doore was opened to let out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
King: Three thousand of the Parliament Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were then at <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon Thames, a Towne
about ten miles distant from the City; which Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were all (as it happened) commanded to leave
that Towne, and march thorow <hi>Surrey,</hi> with what
speed they could, and over <hi>London</hi> Bridge, so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the City toward <hi>Brainford,</hi> to prevent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
passage to <hi>London.</hi> The reason of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was afterward given, for that the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
was not assured of strength enough to stop the
Enemy from <hi>London,</hi> nor could before hand be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of so great an Army, as came thither before
morning. But this was the event of it; and thorow
<hi>Kingstone</hi> thus abandoned the King retreated; and
leaving some Troops to face his Enemies, brought all
his Foot and Artillery over that Bridge, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up afterward, he had time enough securely to
plunder many places of that Country, and retire
safely to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he intended to take up his
winter Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament, upon this Action of the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be out of hope of doing any good by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
resolving that the Lord Generall, with all speed
that might be, should pursue the Kings Forces, and
fall upon them about <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> for newes
was daily brought them how active his Parties were
under the conduct of Prince RUPERT and others, in
plundering all the places thereabouts. And the City
of <hi>London,</hi> to incourage the Parliament with a free
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96346:148"/>
tender of their service, framed a Petition to them,
to intreat them, <hi>That they would proceed no further in
the businesse of Accommodation, because evill Counsell
was so prevalent with the King; That he would but
delude them; That they had heard his Forces are weake,
and that if his Excellency would follow and fall upon
them, and that no delayes be made for feare of forraigne
Forces comming over, the City, as heretofore; would
with all willingnesse spend their lives and fortunes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City was thanked for their Petition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
and the Lord Generall moved by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to advance, who, though the season of the
yeare were not very fit for so great a Body to march,
was very desirous to obey their Commands. The best
way was thought to divide his Army, and send se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
parties to severall places, to restraine the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
from annoying the Countries, as to <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Marlow, Reading,</hi> and other parts, untill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his whole force could be well accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to march from <hi>Windsor</hi> (where he lay that winter)
toward the King. But it so fell out, either by reason
of ill weather at some times, and at other for want
of Money or fit accommodation, that the Generall
himselfe, with his maine Army, marched not forth
untill the spring, whose first businesse was to lay
siege to <hi>Reading,</hi> which was fortified by the Kings
Forces, and maintained by a Garrison of 3000. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and 20. Peece of Ordnance; before which
Towne he sate downe upon the five and twentieth
day of <hi>April,</hi> 1643. with an Army of about 16000.
Foot, and 3000. Horse.</p>
                  <p>Now (leaving the Lord Generall before <hi>Reading</hi>
with his Army) in the meane time we will shew one
maine reason why he did no sooner advance; The
expectation of another Treaty, which the Parliament
had desired to have with the King, for setling of
the Kingdomes Peace, which proved fruitlesse, in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96346:149"/>
debate lasted a long time. Propositions were drawne
up by the Parliament, and sent to <hi>Oxford</hi> on the 31.
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1642. by foure Lords and eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,
the Earles of <hi>Northumberland, Pembrooke,

Sir JOHN HOLLAND, Sir WILLIAM
LITTON, Master PERPOINT, Master WALLER,
Master WHITLOCK, Master WINHOOD; the
Propositions were:

                        <item>1. That the King would passe those Bils which the
Houses had made ready.</item>
                        <item>2. To passe a Bill for setling Parliament Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

                        <item>3. For bringing to tryall those Delinquents whom

                  </p>
                  <p>The King not liking, nor yet utterly refusing these
Propositions, sent the Commissioners home to their
Parliament, within a weeke after they came, to carry
six Propositions from him to the Houses; which
were:
<list>
                        <item>1. That his Revenue, Magazines, Townes, Forts,

                        <item>2. That all Orders and Ordinances of Parliament
wanting his assent, may be recalled.</item>
                        <item>3. That all power exercised over his Subjects by
Assessements, and imprisoning their persons, may be
disclaimed.</item>
                        <item>4. That he will yeeld to the execution of the Laws
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96346:149"/>
against Papists, provided that the Booke of Common-Prayer
be confirmed.</item>
                        <item>5. That such persons as upon the Treaty shall be
excepted out of the generall Pardon, shall be tryed
by their Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>6. That there be a Cessation of Armes during the
Treaty.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Houses, upon receiving of these Propositions,
though at first it were the opinion of many, not to
send any Answer at all to them; yet at last, to shew
respect to the King, entred into a further debate
about treating with him concerning the Propositions
on both sides, and concerning the Cessation of Arms,
or disbanding; with such limitations and restrictions
touching the order of treating, as would perchance
seeme too tedious to be here related; and on the 20.
of <hi>March</hi> the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Sir JOHN
HOLLAND, Sir WILLIAM ARMINE, Master PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POINT,
and Master WHITLOCK (the Lord SAY
should have been one, but the King excepted against
him, as formely against Sir JOHN EVELIN, upon
the same ground, which though the Parliament tooke
ill at the first, yet they proceeded in the businesse)
were sent to <hi>Oxford</hi> as Treaters upon those Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
In vaine was this Treaty; so high the demands
were judged to be on both sides, that there seemed
no possibility of ever meeting; where the fault lay
I judge not; but the Parliament, after many Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> at last sent for their
Commissioners home againe; who returned to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
upon the 17. of <hi>April;</hi> upon which the Lord
Generall immediately advanced with his Army (as
aforesaid) to besiege <hi>Reading.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reading</hi> was not able to hold out long, but the
Lord Generall was loath to storme it for feare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
so many innocent people as remained in the
Towne; which compassion of his was well approved
of by the Parliament; therefore upon composition
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96346:150"/>
it was rendred within sixteene daies to his Excellency,
by the Deputy Governour Colonell FIELDING, for
the Governour Sir ARTHUR ASTON, was before
wounded by an accident, and could not performe the
Office: The Termes were easie, for they all marched
out with bagge and baggage. This siege had not at all
advantaged the Parliament, if another businesse had
not fallen out during that short siege; which may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be thought a reason, why the Towne was so soone
rendred. A good Body of the Kings Forces, both
Horse and Foot (the King himselfe in Person not farre
from them) came to relieve <hi>Reading,</hi> assaulting one
Quarter of the Parliament Army at <hi>Causum</hi> Bridge,
within a mile of the Towne, and were beaten back
with great slaughter, which fell especially upon Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of quality, of whom the King at that incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lost a considerable number; but how many they
were, or their particular names, I finde not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>The gaining of <hi>Reading</hi> might seeme an addition of
strength to the Parliament side; it proved otherwise:
Nothing was gotten but a bare Towne, which had
been happier, had it been onely so: The Towne was
infected, and caused afterwards a great mortality in
the Parliament Army. The Souldiers besides were
discontented, that being already much behinde in
pay, they were not suffered to plunder, or make any
benefit of their victory. For the Parliament, before
<hi>Reading</hi> was delivered up, had approved of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and promised to the Lord Generals Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to forbeare plundering, twelve shillings a man,
besides their pay. But neither of these were then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
money began already to be wanting, and
the great Magazine of Treasure in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> quite
consumed. While they stayed there, expecting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the sicknesse and mortality daily increased, and
the Lord Generall, by advice of his Councell of War,
intended to march thence for better ayre. But such a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96346:150"/>
generall mutiny was raised for want of Mone, that
his Excellency, though with much courage and just
severity he began to suppresse it, was advised by his
Councell of Warre to desist, for feare of a generall
defection, till money might come from the City.
Notwithstanding upon this discontent in the Army,
whilest his Excellency removed to <hi>Causum</hi> House,
to avoid the infection, many of the Souldiers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,
and went away. Then began a tide of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to flow in upon the Parliament side; and their
strength almost in every place to decrease at one
time; for during the time of these six mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eths, since
the Battell of <hi>Keynton,</hi> untill this present distresse
of the Lord Generals Army about <hi>Causum,</hi> which
was about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the Warre had gone
on with great sury and heat, almost thorow every
part of <hi>England;</hi> the particulars of which shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be related by themselves, to avoid confusion in
the Story: The Lord Generall had at that time intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
that Sir RALPH HOPTON had given a great
defeat to the Parliament Forces of <hi>Devonshire;</hi> and
that Prince MAURICE, and Marquesse HARTFORD
were designed that way, to possesse themselves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the West.</p>
                  <p>Leaving therefore the Lord Generall a while, I
shall proceed to speak of some things which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at other places in that Moneth of <hi>May.</hi> The Kings
Armies were then in faire possibility of gaining the
whole West; and seemed of strength enough to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
it by open Warre, without the assistance of
secret treacheries and conspiracies; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
were then in agitation, though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not successefull against the Parliament, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to the contrivers. As at <hi>Bristoll,</hi> a place of
great import, and much desired by the Kings Forces,
when the plot of betraying that City to Prince RU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERT,
was set on foot; which I here relate, as falling
out about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> 1643.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96346:151"/>
The City of <hi>Bristoll</hi> was then in the Parliaments
protection, and governed by Colonell NATHANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EL
FIENNES, second Sonne to the Viscount SAY
and SEALE, though many of the Inhabitants there,
as appeared by this designe, were dis-affected to the
Parliaments side.</p>
                  <p>This designe was very bloody, and many of that
City had perished in it, had not the Conspirators
been discovered and apprehended a Little before they
were to put it in execution.</p>
                  <p>ROBERT YEOMANS, late Sheriffe of <hi>Bristoll,</hi>
WILLIAM YEOMANS his brother, GEORGE
BOURCHIER, and EDWARD DACRES, were the
chiefe managers of this Designe; who, with many
others of that opinion, had secretly provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of Armes, intending to kill the Centinels by
night, and possesse the maine Guard, (with other
particulars, to be found in the Records of their exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and proofes against them) whereby to
master the greatest part of the other side within the
Towne, to kill the Mayor, and many others that
were knowne to stand affected to the Parliament; and
by that meanes to betray the City to the Kings For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
In expectation of which act, Prince RUPERT
with other Commanders, and about 4000 Horse, and
2000 Foot, stayed upon <hi>Durdam Downes,</hi> about two
miles from the City. But the Plot was discovered,
the Conspirators apprehended, and brought to triall
by a Councell of Warre, where the foure forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
were condemned, and two of them hanged at
<hi>Bristoll,</hi> namely, ROBERT YEOMANS, and GEORGE
BOURCHIER; although great meanes had been made
to save them, and Colonell FIENNES to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
had been threatned from <hi>Oxford,</hi> by Generall
RIVEN (created by the King Earle of <hi>Forth</hi>) in a
Letter unto him; which being of great consequence,
for the cleare understanding of this War, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

as in a faire and open way have alwaies prosecuted that

but the Law of nature among all men, and the law of

The King also at that time writ a very sharpe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to the Mayor and Citizens of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> to raise
what power they could to hinder the execution of
those men, which he termes the murder of his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Subjects: But nothing availed to save their lives,
for the forenamed ROBERT YEOMANS, and
GEORGE BOURCHIER, according to the sentence,
were both executed. The losse of <hi>Bristoll</hi> from the
Parliament, a place of great import, was thus by the
detection and prevention of this Conspiracy, respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a while onely. For not long after it was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to Prince RUPERT, and happier it was for
the Prince himselfe, to gaine that City in a more
honourable way, and lesse effusion of English
blood.</p>
                     <p>At the same time that these Conspirators against
<hi>Bristoll</hi> were by sentence of a Councell of Warre put
to death; another Plot of higher nature, and more
full of horrour, was detected at <hi>London;</hi> a Plot, which
if not discovered, had quite ruined the Parliament it
selfe, and strooke at the very head, and chiefe resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it, the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster;</hi>
which cannot be omitted in this Relation, though
with as much brevity as can be possible, it shall be
touched.</p>
                     <p>The scope of it was to have put in execution the
Commission of Array within <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi>
and so to have raised a sufficient force for the Kings
side to ruine the Parliament. Many Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
were in the Plot, together with some Gentlemen
besides, who had taken an Oath of secrecy among
themselves; and were the more animated in it, upon
promises; which Master WALLER, the chiefe man
in eminence among them (a Member of the House
of Commons) had made to some of the rest, that
many Members of both Houses of Parliament were
ingaged in the Plot, and would in due time be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
to it. Though it proved in conclusion, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96346:153"/>
Master WALLER was not able to make good so much
as he had promised. The Plot was horrid, and could
not possibly have been put in execution, without
great effusion of blood, as must needs appeare by
the particular branches of it, which were confessed
upon the Examinations of Master WALLER, Master
TOMKINS, Master CHALLENOR, Master HASELL
Master BLINKHORNE, Master WHITE, and others
the chiefe Actors in it.</p>
                     <p>That which appeared by the Narrative Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
published by Authority of Parliament, was to
this effect: That
<list>
                           <item>1. They should seize into their custody the Kings
Children.</item>
                           <item>2. To seize upon severall Members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament, upon the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi>
and the Committee of the Militia there, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of bringing them to legall tryall.</item>
                           <item>3. To seize upon all the Cities out-Works and
Forts, upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and all the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines,
Gates, and other places of importance in the
City.</item>
                           <item>4. To let in the Kings Forces, to surprize the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with their assistance; and to destroy all those, who
should by Authority of Parliament, be their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers;
and by force of Armes to resist all payments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the Authority of both Houses, for support
of those Armies imployed in their defence.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other particulars there were, too tedious
to relate at large, as what signals should have been
given to the Kings Forces of Horse, to invade the
City; what Colours for difference, those of the Plot
should weare, to be knowne to their fellowes, and
such like. Much heartened they were in this businesse
by a Commission of Array sent from <hi>Oxford</hi> at that
time, from the King to them, and brought secretly
to <hi>London</hi> by a Lady, the Lady AUBIGNY, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> a Widow ever since the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96346:153"/>
Battell of <hi>Keynton;</hi> where the Lord AUBIGNY her
husband was slaine.</p>
                     <p>That Commission of Array was directed from the
King to Sir NICHOLAS CRISPE, Sir GEORGE
STROUD Knights, to Sir THOMAS GARDINER
Knight, Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> Sir GEORGE BINION,
Knight, RICHARD EDES, and MARMADUKE ROY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN
Esquires, THOMAS BROWNE, PETER PAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GON,

ROBERT ABBOT, ANDREW KING, WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM
WHITE, STEVEN BOLTON, ROBERT
ALDEM, EDMUND FOSTER, THOMAS BLINK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HORNE,
of <hi>London</hi> Gentlemen; and to all such other
persons, as according to the true intent and purport
of that Commission, should be nominated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be Generals, Colonels, Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
Serjeant Majors, or other Officers of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Warre. The Commission it selfe is to be read
at large in the Parliament Records.</p>
                     <p>But this Conspiracy was prevented, and proved
fatall to some of the Contrivers; being detected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the last day of <hi>May</hi> (which happened at that time
to be the day of the Monethly Fast) and Master
WALLER, Master TOMKINS, with other of the
forenamed Conspirators, being apprehended, were
that night examined by divers grave Members of the
Parliament, of whom Master PYM was one; and
afterwards reserved in custody for a Tryall. They
were arraigned in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and Master WALLER,
Master TOMKINS, Master CHALLONER, Master
HASELL, Master WHITE, and Master BLINK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HORNE,
were all condemned; none were executed
but Master TOMKINS, and Master CHALLONER,
being both hanged, Master TOMKINS in <hi>Holborne,</hi>
and Master CHALLONER in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> both within
sight of their own dwelling houses; Master HASELL
dyed in Prison, BLINKHORNE, and the other, were
by the mercy of the Parliament, and the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96346:154"/>
                        <hi>Essex,</hi> reprived, and saved afterwards; Master
WALLER, the chiefe of them, was long detained
Prisoner in the Tower, and about a yeare after, upon
payment of a Fine of ten thousand pounds, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and released to go travell abroad. It was much
wondered at, and accordingly discoursed of by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at that time, what the reason should be, why Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
WALLER, being the principall Agent in that
Conspiracy, (where Master TOMKINS and Master
CHALLONER, who had been drawne in by him, as
their own Confessions, even at their deaths expressed,
were both executed) did escape with life. The onely
reason which I could ever heare given for it, was, That
<hi>Master</hi> WALLER had been so free in his Confessions
at the first, without which the Plot could not have
been clearly detected; That Master PYM, and other
of the Examiners, had ingaged their promise, to do
whatever they could to preserve his life. He seemed
also much smitten in conscience, and desired the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of godly Minister, being extremely penitent for
that soule offence; and afterwards in his Speech to
the House (when he came to be put out of it) much
be wailed his offence, thanking God that so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and bloody a Conspiracy was discovered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it could take effect.</p>

were closely working to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Parliament, and Warre was
raging in highest fury throughout the
Kingdome; many State-businesses of
an unusuall nature had been trans-act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Parliament sitting. For things were growne
beyond any president of former ages, and the very
foundations of Government were shaken; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the sense of that Vote, which the Lords and
Commons had passed a yeare before, <hi>That whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the King maketh Warre against the Parliament, it
tendeth to the dissolution of this Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three things of that unusuall nature fell into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
in one moneth, which was <hi>May,</hi> 1643. and were
then, or soone after fully passed; one was at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that moneth, concerning the Assembly of
Divines at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Among other Bils which had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96346:155"/>
passed both Houses, and wanted onely the Royall
Assent, that was one; That a Synod of Divines should
be chosen and established, for the good and right set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of Religion, with a fit Government for the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> This Bill was oft tendred to the
King to passe, but utterly refused by him: The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therefore was fully argued, what in such cases might
be done by Authority of Parliament, when the
Kingdomes good is so much concerned, when a
King refuseth, and wholly absenteth himselfe from
the Parliament. And at last it was brought to this
conclusion; That an Ordinance of Parliament, where
the King is so absent, and refusing, is by the Lawes
of the Land of as good Authority to binde the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for the time present, as an Act of Parliament it
selfe can be.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore Voted by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
That the Act for an Assembly of Divines, to
settle Religion, and a forme of Government for the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> (which the King had oft refused
to passe) should forthwith be turned into an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Parliament; and the Assembly thereby cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
debate such things for the settlement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as should be propounded to them by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
which not long after was accordingly put in
execution.</p>
                  <p>The case seemed of the same nature with that of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> in the yeare 1639. when the Scottish Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
(as is before mentioned in this History) upon
the Kings delay in calling their Nationall Synod, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a writing to that purpose; That the power of
calling a Synod, in case the Prince be an Enemy to
the truth, or negligent in promoting the Churches
good, is in the Church it selfe.</p>
                  <p>In the same moneth, and within few daies after,
another businesse of great consequence, was by the
Lords and Commons taken into consideration, which
was the making of a new Great Seale, to supply the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96346:155"/>
place of that which had been carried away from the
Parliament, as before is mentioned. This businesse
had been fully debated in the House of Commons,
and the Moneth following, at a Conference between
both Houses, the Commons declared to the Lords
what great prejudice the Parliament and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
suffered by the absence of the Great Seale;
and thereupon desired their speedy compliance in
Votes for the making of a new one.</p>
                  <p>The matter was debated in the House of Peeres,
put to Votes, and carried for the negative. The onely
reason which they alleadged against the making of a
new Seale; was this, That they have hitherto dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
all business since the absence of the Seale, by
vertue of Ordinances of Parliament, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the same course might still be kept in what
matters soever were necessary to be expedited for the
good of the Kingdome, without a Seale. Yet the
Lords gave a respective answer, That if the House
of Commons would informe them in any particular
cases, wherein the Kingdomes prejudice, by absence
of the Great Seale, could not be remedied by vertue
of an Ordinance, they would take it into further
consideration, to induce complyance accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it long before the Lords, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
shewed, concurred with the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
who about the beginning of <hi>Iuly,</hi> presented
to the Lords at a Conference the Votes, Which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passed in their House, together with the reasons
for making of a new Great Seale. The Votes were
these:</p>
                  <p>Resolved upon the Question. June 14. &amp; 26.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. THat the Great Seale of <hi>England</hi> ought to attend
the Parliament.</item>
                     <item>2. That the absence of it hath been a cause of great
mischiefe to the Common-wealth.</item>
                     <item>3. That a remedy ought to be provided for these mischiefs.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96346:156"/>
4. That the proper remedy is by making a new Great
Sale.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The reasons which they gave, were divided into
two branches; The first declaring those mischiefes
which were occasioned by conveying away the Great
Seale from the Parliament: The second expressing
those inconveniences and mischiefes which proceeded
from the want of the Great Seale with them. The
reasons of the first kinde were thus:</p>
                  <p>1. It was secretly and unlawfully carried away by
the Lord Keeper, contrary to the duty of his place,
who ought himselfe to have attended the Parliament,
and not to have departed without leave; nor should
have been suffered to convey away the Great Seale,
if his intentions had been discovered.</p>
                  <p>2. It hath been since taken away from him, and
put into the hands of other dangerous and ill-affected
persons; so as the Lord Keeper, being sent unto by
the Parliament, for the sealing of some Writs, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
answer, That he could not Seale the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had not the Seale in his keeping.</p>
                  <p>3. Those who have had the managing thereof,
have imployed it to the hurt and destruction of the
Kingdome many waies; as by making new Sheriffes
in an unusuall and unlawfull manner, to be as so
many Generals, or Commanders, of Forces raised
against the Parliament; by issuing out illegall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of Array, with other unlawfull Commissions
for the same purpose; By sending sorth Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against both Houses of Parliament, and severall
Members thereof, proclaiming them Traytors, against
the Priviledges of Parliament, and Laws of the Land,
By sealing Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against them, and other of His Majesties good
Subjects, adhering to the Parliament, as Traytors;
By sending Commissions into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to treat a peace
with the Rebels there, contrary to an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96346:156"/>
made this Session. Besides divers other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Acts passed under it, since it was secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
away from the Parliament; whereby great
calamities and mischiefes have ensued, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Mischiefes arising through want of the Great Seale.</p>
                  <p>1. The Termes have been adjourned; the course
of Justice obstructed.</p>
                  <p>2. No originall Writs can be sued forth without
going to <hi>Oxford;</hi> which none who holds with the
Parliament can do, without perill of his life or
Liberty.</p>
                  <p>3. Proclamations in Parliament cannot issue out,
for bringing in Delinquents impeached of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or other crimes; under paine of forfeiting their
Estates, according to the ancient course.</p>
                  <p>4. No Writs of Errour can be brought in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to reverse erroneous judgements; nor Writs
of Election sued out for chusing new Members up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
death, or removall of any; whereby the number
of the Members is much lessened, and the Houses in
time like to be dissolved, if speedy supply be not
had, contrary to the very Act for continuance of
this Parliament.</p>
                  <p>5. Every other Court of Justice hath a peculiar
Seale; and the Parliament, the Supreme Court of
<hi>England,</hi> hath no other but the Great Seale of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which being kept away from it, hath now no
Seale at all; and therefore a new Seale ought to be
made.</p>
                  <p>6. This Seale is <hi>Clavis Regni,</hi> and therefore ought
to be resident with the Parliament (which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
Body of the whole Kingdome) whilest
it continues sitting; the King, as well as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
being alwaies legally present in it, during the
Session thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Lords upon these reasons concurred with the
House of Commons, and order was given, that a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96346:157"/>
new Great Seale, should forthwith be made, which
was accordingly done.</p>
                  <p>It should seeme the King was not well pleased with
this action of the Parliament, as appeared by what
was done at <hi>Oxford</hi> above a yeare after, when the
King assembled together the Lords which were with
him, and all those Gentlemen that had been Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House of Commons, and had deserted
the Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> whom the King called
his Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and propounded many
things for them to debate upon; amongst which it
was taken into debate, and resolved upon the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
by that Assembly at <hi>Oxford,</hi> That this very acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which they stile counterfeiting the Great Seale)
was Treason, and the whole Parliament at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
eo facto,</hi> guilty of High Treason. But this was
passed at <hi>Oxford</hi> long after; of which occasion may
be to speak further hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But at the time when the Parliament made their
new Great Seale, the people stood at gaze, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wondered what might be the consequence of so
unusuall a thing. Some that wholly adhered to the
Parliament, and liked well, that an action so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and usefull to the present state, was done by
them, looked notwithstanding upon it, as a sad marke
of the Kingdomes distraction, and a signe how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
the difference might grow betweene the
Parliament and the Kings Person. For the legality
or justnesse of making of the Seale, there was little
dispute or argument among those who were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to the Parliament; and though there were
no direct or plaine precedent for it (for the case of a
Kings being personally in Warre against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sitting, was never before) yet by comparison
with other times, when the necessities of State have
required such a thing, it was not onely allowed, but
thought requisite. I do not know of any thing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
against it by any Lawyers, or other of the Kings
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96346:157"/>
Party; but Master PRYNNE, a learned Lawyer, and
great Antiquary, of the Parliament side, hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a copious discourse in justification of it, both
by arguments of reason, and many neere-resembling
precedents of former times) called, <hi>The opening of
the Great Seale of England,</hi> which is extant to be read
by any that would be satisfied, what power from
time to time Parliaments have challenged and been
allowed, over that Seale, both in making of it in
the infancy or absence of Princes, and disposing of
it in the dotage or wilfulnesse of others.</p>
                  <p>But before this businesse was fully concluded, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, which seemed as great a signe how wide
the rent was growne, fell into debate in the House
of Commons: Some time was spent in consultation
about it, and much arguing on both sides. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was about charging the Queene of High Treason.
To that purpose many Articles of an high nature
were drawne up against her; some of them were,
That she had pawned the Crowne Jewels in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
That she had raised the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
That she had indeavoured to raise a Party in <hi>Scotland</hi>
against the Parliament; That she had gone in the
head of a Popish Army in <hi>England:</hi> For not long
before this time, the Queene with Armes and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
from the Low-Countries, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Warre from thence, had landed in the North
of <hi>England,</hi> been entertained there by the Earle of
<hi>Newcastle,</hi> and by him and others, with strong Forces
conveyed to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whereof more
particulars will be related hereafter. Divers other
Articles were framed against the Queene, upon which
within few Moneths after, she was impeached of
High Treason by the House of Commons, and the
Impeachment carried up by Master PYMME to the
House of Peeres, where it stuck for many moneths,
but was afterward passed there also; and may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discoursed of in the due time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:96346:158"/>
It had been likewise before Ordered by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and was now accordingly put in execution,
that the King and Queenes Revenue comming into
the Exchequer, should be detained, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Publike Service of the Common-wealth;
a Committee was chosen of Lords and Commons to
dispose of it to the best uses. Divers necessary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the State were defrayed by it, and among
others (which seemed a kinde of just retalliation)
many Members of both Houses of Parliament, whose
whole Estates had been seized upon by the Kings
Armies, were in some measure relieved at <hi>London,</hi>
out of his Revenue, and thereby enabled to subsist
in that Publike Service, to which they had beene
called.</p>
                  <p>But so exceeding great by this time, were the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
growne for supportation of so spreading a Warre,
that no Contributions nor Taxes whatsoever, were
thought sufficient, unlesse an Excize were imposed
upon Commodities (according to the way of the
Netherlanders) such as Beere, Wine, Tobacco, and
Meat; which was taken into consideration by both
Houses, and this Summer agreed upon. But the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
was layed with much gentlenesse, especially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Victuals of most common and necessary use,
insomuch that it was little felt either by the rich, or
poore people, and yet amounted monethly to a very
considerable summe, though the Kings Quarters
were then the greatest part of <hi>England;</hi> for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London</hi> was within the Parliament Quarters.</p>
                  <p>To returne againe to the Lord Generall ESSEX;
His Excellency in <hi>May,</hi> 1643. having, as aforesaid,
received intelligence of the defeat given to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Army in the West, and in what condition
things there stood; not being able with his owne
Forces to give them reliefe, sent order to Sir WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM
WALLER (whose actions shall be anon men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in a Series by themselves) to march thither
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96346:158"/>
in assistance of the <hi>Devonshire</hi> Forces; and writ his
Command to the Governour of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> to aid him
with such Horse and Foot, as he could conveniently
spare out of his Garrison. But things could not at
that time be put in execution according to his desires;
and before Sir WILLIAM WALLER could get farre
into the West, Prince MAURICE, Marquesse HART<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD,
and Sir RALPH HOPTON were joyned all
together.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Generall, since it was much desired by
the City of <hi>London,</hi> from whom the supplies of
money were to come, that he should move with his
whole Army towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> was content, though
somewhat against his judgement, to proceed in that
Designe; and marched with the maine Body to <hi>Thame,</hi>
to meet there with the Forces sent from the associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Counties to his assistance; from whence (as a
person, whose care and Command extended over the
whole Kingdome, which was now overspread with
a generall Warre, and wasted by many Armies at
once) he granted a Commission, by direction of the
Parliament, to the Lord FIELDING, (now Earle
of <hi>Denbigh</hi> by the late death of his Father, who
was slaine in a Skirmish, fighting against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
to be Generall of foure Counties, <hi>Shropshire,
Worcester, Stafford,</hi> and <hi>Warwick-shire;</hi> to leavy
Forces there, and conduct them into any part of
the Kingdome, against the Kings Power, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to directions from the Parliament, or Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.
He granted also at the same time another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
in the like manner to Sir THOMAS MID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DLETON,
to raise Forces as Generall of all North
<hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Thame</hi> the hand of God, in an extreme increase
of sicknesse (hundreds in a day desperately ill) did
visite the Lord Generals Army; and by strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonablenesse
of weather, and great raine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
fourteene daies, the place being upon a flat,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96346:159"/>
moist, and clayie ground, made it impossible for him
to advance from that Quarter. In which time the
Army was by sicknesse, and departure of most of
the Auxiliary Forces, brought to a number utterly
unable to attempt the former designe, without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ruine, the situation of <hi>Oxford</hi> upon the River
of <hi>Thames</hi> considered; for the Lord Generall concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it impossible (as himselfe expressed) to block up
the Towne, without a double number to what he
then had.</p>
                  <p>But when the raine ceased, and the waters were
so much abated, as to make the waies passable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
was brought that Prince RUPERT had
drawne out his Horse and Foot toward <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
with his Canon also; and had called in the Country,
making open profession before them, that he would
give Battell to the Generall: The Generall marched
with some speed toward <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to fight with
him. When he came within two miles of that Towne,
he found the case farre otherwise, and had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that the Prince had quitted <hi>Buckingham</hi> in a
kinde of disorderly manner; that the night before,
he had horsed his Foot, and marched away, leaving
some of his Provisions behinde him.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Generall understood well, that it was
not possible for him with his Traine of Artillery
and Foot Companies, to follow the Enemy to any
advantage. For if he had been at that time strong
enough in Horse, his desire was to have hindered
Prince RUPERT from joyning with the Queene,
who then was marching with a good Convoy of
Horse from the Northerne parts of <hi>England,</hi> (where
she had arrived from the <hi>Netherlands</hi>) toward <hi>Oxford.</hi>
But being not able to follow that designe, he desisted
from his march to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> sending into the Town
a Party of his Horse, to quarter there that night, and
to bring away that Provision which the Enemy had
left there. He himselfe, with the rest of his Army,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96346:159"/>
marched to great <hi>Brickhill,</hi> a place most convenient
to lye betweene the Enemy and <hi>London,</hi> to defend
the Associated Counties, to assist or joyne with the
Forces of the Lord GRAY of <hi>Grooby,</hi> Sir JOHN MEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRUM,
and Colonell CROMWELL, to whom he
had before written, that if they could possibly,
they should fight with the Queens Forces, and stop
her passage to the King. But it seemed that the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
could not be done; that the Queene and Prince
RUPERT were suffered to joyne together with all
their Forces. Sir WILLIAM WALLER had beene
long victorious in the West, yet now the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
fortune, almost in every place, began to faile;
and intelligence was brought to the Lord Generall,
that Sir WILLIAM having almost gained the whole
West, and besieging Sir RALPH HOPTON in the
Devizes, a Towne of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> was on a sudden
by unexpected Forces from <hi>Oxford,</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Lord WILMOT, totally routed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into <hi>Bristoll.</hi> The Lord Generall intending at the
first report of this newes, to have marched himselfe
for relieving of the West; upon more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that Sir WILLIAM WALLERS Forces
were so farre broken, that no assistance at all could
be given by them, was inforced to desist from that
enterprize; considering also that his owne Army
was shrunke, through the continuall increase of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
sicknesse, want of pay, clothing, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
to a most unconsiderable number, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to proceed no further, nor to ingage that
weake Army to the ruine of it selfe, and danger of
the Kingdome; especially since the Forces of the
Associated Counties could not with safety be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
so farre from home. He therefore returned
toward <hi>London,</hi> quartering that poore remainder of
an Army at <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> and other places
neere adjacent. In this distressed condition I must
a while leave that great Generall, untill some few
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96346:160"/>
weekes time shall recruit his power, and enable him
to make that famous and honourable expedition to
the reliefe of <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So great at this time were the successes which in
all parts crowned the Kings Armies, that they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to possesse an absolute Victory, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in probability quite ruined; on one side the
Lord Generals Army mouldered away by long sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and other wants; the long successefull Sir
WILLIAM WALLER, quite broken in the West;
and about the same time the Lord FAIRFAX, and
his Sonne Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX (though reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by divine Providence for a transcendent height
of honour in the future) with all the Gentlemen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
which served the Parliament in those Northerne
parts, being defeated by the Earle of <hi>Newcastle;</hi>
and the Lord FAIRFAX, with his Sonne, driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Towne of <hi>Hull:</hi> On the other side, the Kings
Armies were full and strong; Sir RALPH HOPTON,
whom for his valour and industry the King had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with the Title of a Baron, was possessed of
a gallant Army in the West, and seemed to want
nothing so much as a considerable Enemy; the Kings
other Forces were free to chuse what stage they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to act their parts upon. Prince RUPERT was
sent to besiege <hi>Bristoll,</hi> where Colonell NATHANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EL
FIENNES, second Sonne to the Viscount SAY,
was Governour; which City in this low ebbe of the
Parliament, could not long hold out, but was soone
delivered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the Prince, a place of as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as any in the Kingdome. Prince MAURICE
with another Army came to besiege the City of
<hi>Excester,</hi> into which the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
after his defeat at <hi>Stretton</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
who had long strugled with various successe,
and in sharpe encounters against Sir RALPH HOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,
and other Commanders of the Kings side
in those Westerne Counties, ruined at last by the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96346:160"/>
treacherous revolt of some, who had taken the same
cause with him at the first. This City was likewise
after a long siege, for want of supplies, delivered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Articles to the Prince that besieged it.</p>
                  <p>But the great cloud, which not onely oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
the Parliament in the North, but threatned to
powre out stormes upon parts farre remote, was the
Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with his mighty Army, who was
growne formidable to the Associated Counties, and
many other places of the Kingdome. His Army was
at that time the greatest of any in <hi>England,</hi> which
he maintained in brave equipage, by large Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
inforced from the Country, and seemed of
strength enough, not onely to master any opposition
of English Forces, but to serve as a Bulwarke against
the greatest Army which the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi>
could be able to send in aid of the English Parliament.
For the Parliament had then sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> for
the brotherly assistance of that Kingdom, and agreed
upon entring into a Covenant with them for defence
of Religion, and the common Liberty of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>It pleased the Divine Providence (whose wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
are many times beyond the reach of humane
conjectures) that this strong Army, before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Scots, found an Enemy in <hi>England</hi>
worthy of their feare; and were by the personall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and successefull conduct of Sir THOMAS FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX,
who seemed lately in a low condition, so farre
broken (together with other defeats given to parts
of it sent abroad) that the passage for the Scots into
<hi>England</hi> was much facilitated, as shall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in more particular.</p>
                  <p>But it is worthy consideration (and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but deserve a mention) with what unwearied
constancy, and wondrous magnanimity, the two
FAIRFAXES, Father and Sonne, did labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those Northerne parts for the Parliament, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96346:161"/>
observing what great Enemies they dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
how many unexpected disadvantages happened
to them, and accessions of power to their Foes at
severall times; which, though it cannot be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with full circumstances or particulars, yet may
be touched in a generall way.</p>
                  <p>The Lord FAIRFAX, ever since that there was any
appearance of this unhappy Warre; and that the
Kings Commission of Array began to justle with the
Parliaments Ordinance of Militia, had been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
in raising strength; and joyned himselfe
most unanimously in that cause with Sir JOHN HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAM,
and his Sonne Master JOHN HOTHAM, a
Member also of the House of Commons, and a
Gentleman, not onely active but prosperous, whilest
he continued faithfull to that side which he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.
And since the Warre broke out into action, the
Lord FAIRFAX, either singly by himselfe, or some
times joyned with Master HOTHAM, had taken and
fortified many Townes and Forts for the Parliament,
and made many sharpe and fierce encounters against
potent Enemies. The Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who was
first made Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Yorkeshire</hi> by the King,
was not able to suppresse them, nor scarce main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Warre against that power which they had
raised: Maugre whose Forces, they tooke and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<hi>Cawood</hi> Castle, and the Towne of <hi>Selby,</hi> in
the Moneth of <hi>October,</hi> 1642. and surprised pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the Towne of <hi>Leedes,</hi> where part of
the Earles Forces were quartered, of whom they
tooke divers Prisoners, Knights and Gentlemen of
good quality, one of which was Sir GEORGE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERICK,
together with his whole Troope.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Cumberland</hi> himselfe, within few
daies after was driven into the City of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and
there besieged, and summoned by the Lord FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX
and Master HOTHAM; which happened about
the same time that the famous Battell between the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96346:161"/>
King and the Lord Generall <hi>Essex,</hi> was fought at
<hi>Keynton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Earle of <hi>Newcastle</hi> with a greater force,
entred into <hi>Yorke,</hi> whilest the Lord FAIRFAX
and Captaine HOTHAM, lay not farre off; who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his great strength when he marched out
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> was encountered by them at <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the 7. of <hi>December,</hi> the Fight or severall Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
continuing about five houres; in which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Forces did so well take their advantages, that
they slew (as was reported to the Parliament) 200 of
the Earles men, with the losse of eight Souldiers of
their owne, of whom Captaine LISTER was one,
whose death was much lamented in the Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
esteemed a brave and religious man. After seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Skirmishes, the Parliament Army had the fortune
to make a faire retreat to <hi>Cawood</hi> Castle, and <hi>Selby,</hi>
and leave all to the Earle, whose Forces were repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be about eight thousand Horse and Foot, the
Lord FAIRFAX and Captaine HOTHAM having
not above 2100. Foot, and seven Troops of Horse;
their number had bin greater, if Sir HUGH CHOLME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
and Colonell BAINTON, with their Regiments
of Foot, and two Troops of Horse (who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected)
had accordingly come in to them.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Newcastle</hi> was now growne, not only
master of the field there, but formidable to all the
adjacent Counties; who did therefore implore aid
from the Parliament. The Parliament upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
hastened the Association of those Counties
which lay neerer to them, that they might be the more
able to supply their remoter friends.</p>
                  <p>The Kings side received then an addition of strength
in the North, by the landing of Colonell GORING
at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with 200. Commanders from <hi>Holland,</hi>
and other Provisions for the Warre.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Newcastle</hi> marching from <hi>Tadcaster,</hi>
surprised <hi>Leedes,</hi> in which Towne he tooke many
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96346:162"/>
Gentlemen Prisoners, and forced them to ransome
themselves at high rates; whereby he was further
enabled to pay his great Army. Then also he gave
Commissions to Papists in that Country to arme
themselves in the Kings Service, which he justified
by writings published upon that occasion; and at the
same time proclaimed the Lord FAIRFAX Traytor.</p>
                  <p>The Lord FAIRFAX notwithstanding, marched
with such Forces as he had gotten together, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
successefull in divers attempts, against severall
parts of the Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Forces, one of them
happening at <hi>Sherburne,</hi> between <hi>Tadcaster</hi> and <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> and another at <hi>Bradford,</hi> against a party of the
Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Army, under the conduct of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
GORING, Colonell EVERS, Sir WILLIAM
SAVILE, and Sir JOHN GOTHERICK, who came
with a good strength of Horse and Dragoneers to
surprize on a sudden that Towne of <hi>Bradford;</hi> but
were by Forces timely sent to the reliefe of it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to retire with some losse; which, though it were
not a Victory against Colonell GORING and the rest,
may notwithstanding be termed a successefull Action,
in being able to repell an Enemy too potent for them
in all probability.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat were the atchievements of Sir
THOMAS FAIRFAX in that moneth
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and the following <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi>
for no season of the yeare, nor
stormes of winter, could quench the
rage of this Civill Fire. Sir THOMAS
FAIRFAX on the 23. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1642. marched
from <hi>Bradford</hi> (six miles distant from <hi>Loedes</hi>) with
six Troops of Horse, and three Companies of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones,
under the command of Sir HENRY FOULIS
Baronet, his Lieutenant Generall of his Horse, and
neere 1000. Musqueteers, with 2000. Clubmen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of Sir WILLIAM FAIRFAX
Colonell, and Lieutenant Generall of the Foot.
When Sir THOMAS approached the Town of <hi>Leeds,</hi>
he dispatched a Trumpeter to Sir WILLIAM SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILE,
Commander in chiefe there, under the Earle
of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> requiring the Towne to be delivered
to him for the King and Parliament. But receiving a
resolute, and seeming-scornefull answer from Sir
WILLIAM SAVILE, he drew neerer, and prepared
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96346:163"/>
to make an Assault, though there were great strength
in the Towne, namely, 1500 Foot, and 500. Horse
and Dragoones, with two Brasse Sakers. Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS
FAIRFAX drew out five Companies of his most
expert Souldiers, whom he disposed of at a fit side
of the Town, under the command of Major FORBES,
Captaines, BRIGGS, LEE, FRANKE, and PALMER.
Sir WILLIAM FAIRFAX, at the head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the face of the Enemy, stormed the Town
with great skill and courage, whilest Major FORBES
did the like in his place, and Sir THOMAS himselfe
every where encouraging, and teaching valour by his
owne example, brought on his men; so that after
two houres of hot fight, though the besieged beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themselves well, the Towne was entred by Sir
THOMAS FAIRFAX, Sir WILLIAM FAIRFAX,
and Sir HENRY FOWLES, on one side, and Major
FORBES, with his fellow Captaines, on the other.
They toooke within the Towne their two Brasse Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
with good store of Armes and Ammunition,
foure Colours, and 500. Prisoners, among whom were
six Commanders: The Common Souldiers, upon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of an Oath, never to fight in this cause against
the King and Parliament, were set at liberty, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to depart, but without their Arms. There were
slaine about forty men, of which number the besieged
lost the greater halfe. Serjeant Major BEAMONT,
indeavouring in the flight to save his life, by crossing
the River, so lost it, being drowned therein; and Sir
WILLIAM SAVILE himselfe, crossing in flight the
same River, hardly escaped the same fate. Publike
thanksgiving to Almighty God was given at <hi>London</hi>
for this Victory.</p>
                  <p>Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX with his victorious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
immediately marched to another Quarter of the
Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Army at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> from whence
the chiefe Commander, Sir GEORGE WENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTH
sled, and left it to him. Not long after, he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96346:163"/>
marched to <hi>Tadcaster;</hi> at whose approach the Earles
Forces, though a considerable number, fled away, and
forsooke their Workes.</p>
                  <p>From that time scarce any one fortnight of all the
following Spring, passed without some remarkable
addition of strength to the Kings side, in those Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
parts. In <hi>February</hi> Generall KING, a Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Commander, of great experience in Military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
came out of <hi>Holland,</hi> landed at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himselfe with the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and passed
to <hi>Yorke</hi> with 6000. Armes. In the same Moneth also
the Queene landing from <hi>Holland,</hi> neere to <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with great Provision of Armes and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and many Commanders of note in her Retinew,
was convoyed by the Earle of <hi>Newcastle</hi> to the City
of <hi>Yorke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Montrosse</hi> about the same time, a
young Lord of great esteeme in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Scottish Warre (as is there mentioned)
had shewed himselfe one of the most active and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Covenanters of that Nation, forsooke his Party
there, and with the Lord OGLESBY fled out
of <hi>Scotland</hi> with 120. Horse, to the Queene at <hi>Yorke.</hi>
Upon which both those Lords were proclaimed at
<hi>Edenburgh</hi> Traytors to their King and Country, for
that, contrary to their Covenant, they stole out of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to assist the Popish Army, (for so they called
that of the Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi>) against the Parliament
of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another great wound to the Parliament, not long
after, was the revolt of Sir HUGH CHOLMELY, a
Member of the House of Commons, and one that
had carried a good esteeme among them, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as is already mentioned) been imployed by the
Parliament, as a Commissioner in the North, together
with the Lord FAIRFAX, and Sir PHILIP STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLETON;
and was at this time highly intrusted by
them; for he was Governour of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> a place
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96346:164"/>
of great importance. He falsely betrayed his Trust,
and forsooke the Cause he had undertaken, going
to the Queene with 300. men. Upon which he was
impeached of High Treason by the Parliament; but
it was not his fortune to suffer for that offence, as
others did, who about the same time failed in their
Trusts. The Towne of <hi>Scarborough</hi> was left in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of a Parliament Captaine, who was usually
called <hi>Browne Bushell,</hi> a man that some thought would
have kept it to the Parliaments use; he likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted,
and delivered it to their Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Upon the landing of Generall KING, and the
Queene presently after, a suspition began to arise,
by some circumstances, that the two unfortunate HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAMS,
the father and the sonne, were false to the
Parliament. Which by the strict observation of some
vigilant men on that side, was further discovered, and
began at last to be discoursed of, with as little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
for a long time, as CASSANDRAES Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and when it came more plainly to appeare, with
as much, not onely wonder, but sorrow of honest
men, that so much unconstancy should be found.
The particulars of this discovery, and how much
the Parliament, if not timely prevented, had suffered
by it, there will be time hereafter to discourse of
more at large. But they were both accused to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
seized upon at <hi>Hull,</hi> and sent up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where they long remained Prisoners in the
Tower, before the time of their Tryall and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>Not all these disadvantages, by the growth of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and revolt of friends, could dishearten the Lord
FAIRFAX and his Sonne, who still persisted with
great courage, and raising the Clubmen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to piece up those small Forces which remained
with them, were able for a while to make conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
resistance, and performe divers services against
some parts of the Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi> vast Army. But
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96346:164"/>
one Victory was gained by Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX
at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> which may be termed rather miraculous
then strange; though I shall relate nothing save
knowne truth, such a Victory, against so much odds,
and so many disadvantages, as may serve to teach
how much successe may possibly crowne bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
and justifie that old saying, <hi>Audaces for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna
juvat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord FAIRFAX, Generall of the Parliaments
Forces in the North, on the 20. of <hi>May</hi> gave
Order for a Party to be drawne out from the Garrisons of
<hi>Leedes, Bradford, Halifax,</hi> and <hi>Howley:</hi> They mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
1000. Foot, three Companies of Dragoneers,
and eight Troops of Horse; Sir THOMAS FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX
commanded in Chiefe; the Foot were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Sir WILLIAM FAIRFAX, and Serjeant
Major Generall GIFFORD; the Horse divided into
two Bodies, foure Troops whereof were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX himselfe, the other
foure by Sir HENRY FOWLYS. From <hi>Howley,</hi> which
was their rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>zvouze, they marched away, and by
foure a clock in the morning came before <hi>Wakefield:</hi>
Those of the Towne were ready for them, and sent
out some of their Horse to encounter with theirs,
and Musqueteers to line some hedges, even to the
very Towne. There were in <hi>Wakefield</hi> 3000. Foot,
and seven Troops of Horse, besides Colonell LAMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONS
Regiment, which came into the Towne after
that the Parliaments Forces entred into it. But at the
first encounter the Parliaments Forces beat their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horse back; and their Foot also drove those
Musqueteers from the hedges, even into the Towne;
which they assaulted in two places, called <hi>Wrengate,</hi>
and <hi>Northgate.</hi> After an houre and an halfe fighting,
recovered one of their Enemies Peeces, and turned
it upon them; and withall entred the Town in both
places at the same time. When the Baracadoes were
opened, Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX with the Horse,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96346:165"/>
also fell into the Towne, and cleered the street, there
was a cruell and fierce encounter; in which place Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
GORING was taken Prisoner by Lieutenant
MATTHEW ALURED (brother to Captaine JOHN
ALURED, a Member of the House of Commons;)
yet in the Market place stood three Troops of Horse,
and Colonell LAMPTONS Regiment; to whom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Generall GIFFORD sent a Trumpet, with prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of Quarter, if they would lay down their Arms.
To which when they returned a scornfull Answer,
he fired a Peece of their owne Ordnance upon them,
and the Horse also falling in with great fury, soone
beat them out of the Towne, and tooke all their
Officers Prisoners. They tooke withall 27. Colours
of Foot, three Cornets of Horse, and about 1500.
Common Souldiers. They were likewise forced when
they fled, to leave behind them foure Peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
with Ammunition, which the Parliament
Forces carried away with them. For when they had
thus taken the Towne, they found their number and
strength too weake to keepe it, and their Prisoners
too. And therefore they quitted the place, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
away with this brave booty.</p>
                  <p>This great Victory at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> seemed (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the common saying) like a lightening before
death; for not long after, these Forces were quite bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Earle of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> whose greatnesse over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
those Countries, and was never incountered
by any Enemy, but in parts of his Army. He had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
the whole businesse, and attained his height
of power by great skill and policy; and now having
no neere Enemy in the field, was gone to besiege
the Lord FAIRFAX in <hi>Hull,</hi> which was by some tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of as an errour in him, no lesse then besieging
<hi>Gloucester</hi> soone after, by the King was censured.</p>
                  <p>Such a continuall and sad Warre had the Northerne
parts been forced to endure all the winter. Nor was
it their case alone; scarce any County of <hi>England</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:96346:165"/>
was free from it. The whole West, consisting of so
many rich and flourishing Shires, had been as sad a
stage of civill Tragedies. Many Armies and small
Parties of either side (too many for one History to
describe at large, or give particular due to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of every Gentleman) had been ingaged, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intermission in those parts.</p>
                  <p>Of all Commanders there, that sided with the King
against the Parliament, Sir RALPH HOPTON, by
his unwearied industry, and great reputation among
the people, had raised himselfe to the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
height, and continued the longest a Leader of
Armies, as the sequell of the Story will hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare:
But his successes, through the whole course of
his Actions, were very various, and many ebbs and
flowes were in his fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Marquesse HARTFORD, though farre high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Dignity, and greater by power of his large
Commission from the King (of which before is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
was not able to act so largely in the field as Sir
RALPH did, though he were seldome idle, but
busie about Townes, and in small Parties. They were
both opposed in their beginnings, not so much by any
Noblemen, or great Commanders imployed by the
Parliaments Commissions, as by private Gentlemen
of those Counties; the chiefe of which were Sir
FRANCIS POPHAM, and his Sons, Master STRODE
a Deputy Lieutenant there, with others before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
besides plaine Freeholders of the Country, who
seemed to understand their owne Liberties and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
which they had in the Common-wealth. Untill
at the last the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> a stout Gentleman,
(who had beene before imployed about <hi>Leicester,</hi>
against Master HASTINGS, with a Commission from
the Parliament, as Generall of Some Counties) was
sent into the West.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> was by the Parliament made
Lord Generall of all <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and the foure next
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96346:166"/>
adjacent Counties, as <hi>Glocester, Worcester, Hereford,</hi>
and <hi>Cheshire;</hi> with power to raise Forces in all those
Counties, to appoint Officers and Commanders over
them, to traine and exercise the men, and to fight
with all that should oppose him. The Lord GRAY,
Sonne and Heire to the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to succeed his Father, in his former Charge, and
made Lord Lieutenant of five Counties, <hi>Leicester,
Nottingham, Derby, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Lincolne,</hi> to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Warre against Master HASTINGS, the Earle
of <hi>Chesterfield,</hi> and others, who opposed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in those parts.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> at his first comming into
the West, was successefull against Sir RALPH HOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,
whom he raised from the siege of <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
but Sir RALPH HOPTON not long after, by a strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
of faining flight, entrapped many of the Earles
men, conducted by a Lieutenant of his, and gave
an overthrow to the Parliament Forces; betwixt
whom, and the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> upon the fifteenth
of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. a Truce was made for twenty daies.
The Earle, after the expiration of that Truce, againe
taking the field, with a competent Army, was a while
prosperous against Sir RALPH HOPTON; but not
long after overthrown by the revolt of young CHUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY,
Sonne to Sir JOHN CHUDLEY, by whose as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
before, those Parliament Forces had been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious.
The Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> was then inforced to
betake himselfe to the City of <hi>Excester,</hi> whither HOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON
and CHUDLEY followed him, to lay siege to
the place. But Prince MAURICE was soone after sent
thither to command in chiefe; to whom at last (as is
before expressed) it was upon faire Articles surrendred
by the Earle of <hi>Stamford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding so many misfortunes, as had then
fallen upon the Parliament side; about the end of
<hi>May,</hi> 1643. they did not despaire of regaining the
whole West, by the active valour of Sir WILLIAM
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96346:166"/>
WALLER, who about that time was very prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in those Counties, and some parts of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
of <hi>Wales,</hi> and whose name was growne to
be a great terrour to his Enemies. Of his actions,
and by what degrees he grew into esteeme and
strength, it will not be amisse to relate in a continued
Series, considering how great a Generall he became
afterwards in these Warres, and in what low Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he began. He was a Gentleman of faire expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in Military affaires by former travels, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
abroad, of good judgement, and great indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
of which he gave many testimonies to the
Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM WALLER, about the time of the
Battell of <hi>Keynton,</hi> received a Commission to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
of Horse; and moving that winter following,
as occasions of the present Warre required, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
many exploits; he tooke in <hi>Farnham</hi> Castle,
and passed Southward, after that <hi>Portsmouth</hi> by his
assistance had been taken from Colonell GORING,
and some other quick services at <hi>Winchester,</hi> and in
the Country thereabouts, which he had performed,
joyning himselfe with Colonell BROWNE, a Citizen
of <hi>London</hi> (who tooke up Armes at the beginning of
this Civill Warre, and continued till the very end, in
high Commands, and reputation as high; of whose
actions more must be delivered in the sequell of this
History.) Colonell HURREY, and some others, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
into the Westerne part of <hi>Sussex,</hi> he layed siege
to the City of <hi>Chichester;</hi> in that City many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of ranke and quality had fortified themselves,
and gathered together much Armes and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for service of the King against the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of <hi>December</hi> appearing before
<hi>Chichester,</hi> he was there met with some Forces, Troops
of Horse and Dragoniers, that came to his assistance
from <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> under the conduct of Colonell
MORLEY, a Member of the House of Commons, a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96346:167"/>
Gentleman of good ranke in <hi>Sussex,</hi> and great activity
in the Parliament Service, and Sir MICHAEL LE<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEY,
a Kentish Knight. The Battery was placed by Sir
WILLIAM at fit places, and all things ordered with
great skill; but before the battery began, to save effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of blood, Sir WILLIAM, by the consent of all his
Officers, summoned the Town by a Trumpet, with
such Conditions offered, which were judged too high
by the besieged, and therefore at first not accepted
of; yet after eight daies it was rendred to him upon
no other Conditions then onely Quarter and faire
usage. The Prisoners which were taken there of
note, were immediately sent toward <hi>London</hi> to the
Parliament, who were Sir EDWARD FORD, high
Sheriffe of <hi>Sussex,</hi> Sir JOHN MORLEY, Colonell
SHELLEY, Master LEAUKNER, Colonell LIND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEY,
Lieutenant Colonell PORTER, Major DAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON,
and Major GORDON, with Doctor KING,
then Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and many other Officers
and Commanders in Armes, to the number of 60.
about 400. Dragoniers, and almost as many Foot
Souldiers. In the <hi>March</hi> following, his imployment
was in the Westerne parts of <hi>England,</hi> where he
raised Forces. The next in command under him, who
continued with him in almost all his actions, was Sir
ARTHUR HASLERIG, another Member of the
House of Commons, serving as Knight for <hi>Leicester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
a man that in all Battels and Skirmishes gave
great proofes of his prowesse and personall valour.
Sir WILLIAM WALLER having now raised a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
force, and marching out of <hi>Bristoll</hi> on the
nineteenth of <hi>March,</hi> within two daies after approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<hi>Malmesbury.</hi> Colonell HERBERT LUNSFORD
a stout Gentleman, and a good Souldier, Brother
to Sir THOMAS LUNSFORD, that was taken at
<hi>Keynton</hi> Battell, was then Governour of <hi>Malmesbury;</hi>
who upon the first approach sent out seven Troops
of Horse, to begin an encounter with him; but they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96346:167"/>
were no waies able to indure the force of those Horse
which Sir WILLIAM had drawne out against them,
but fled immediately, some of them back into the
Towne; many of them conceiving that there was
small safety in the Towne for them, fled quite
away.</p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM assaulted the Towne the same day,
but not prevailing then, he lodged there all night,
preparing the next morning for another, and more
fierce assault. But the besieged conceiving the place
unteneble, desired a Parley, and yeelded upon Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
He tooke at <hi>Malmesbury</hi> one Peece of Ordnance,
about three hundred Prisoners, whereof Colonell
LUNSFORD, and Colonell COOKE were the chiefe,
with almost twenty Officers great and small; good
store of rich prize and Ammunition; the Conquest
was bloodlesse, and very few slaine on either side.</p>
                  <p>Within few daies after he obtained a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Victory neere to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> against the Lord
HERBERT of <hi>Ragland,</hi> Sonne to the Earle of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
who with a great Army of Welchmen lay
against that Towne; which, for the manner of it,
in briefe was thus: Sir WILLIAM with his Forces,
comming neere to <hi>Cirencester,</hi> made shew (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to conceale his purpose) as if he intended to fall
upon that Towne; but his designe was for <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
and had taken such provident care, that the men in
<hi>Gloucester</hi> had notice of his purpose; and that with
the help of his flat-bottomed Barges, which thence
were brought to him in the nature of Waggons (use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
both by land and water) he would transport his
Forces over the River <hi>Severne,</hi> beyond <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
and fall upon the Reare of the Lord HERBERTS
Welch Forces, when he was least feared or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
withall, he gave notice to the <hi>Gloucester</hi> Forces
to fall upon the Front of that Army, as he would
upon their Reare. The Plot, as it was wisely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
was successefull in the event, and tooke so good
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96346:168"/>
effect for him, that when the Lord HERBERT was
in skirmish with the Forces of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to cut them all off, being very few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his owne; Sir WILLIAM with his Army,
neere <hi>High<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>am</hi> their Quarter, fell suddenly upon the
Reare of the Lord HERBERTS men, with such
fury, that they were all routed, and would gladly
have fled, if they had knowne any way to escape.
There were slame of that Welch Army about 500.
upon the place, neere a thousand taken Prisoners,
with all their Armes and Ammunition, the rest whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispersed and scattered, the Lord HERBERT him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
escaped by flight, and got to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM WALLER, after this great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
marched from thence to <hi>Tewkesbury;</hi> at whose
approach, those of the Kings Souldiers, that were Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risoned
there, fled away, and left it to him; from
whence marching further into the Country, he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
divers stragling Troopers of the other side,
with some Armes, Pistols, and Carbines, together
with sixteene thousand pound in Money, and carried
away his booty to <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within as short a distance of time, he tooke <hi>Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow</hi>
in <hi>Monmouthshire,</hi> and seized upon divers of those
that were Conspirators for the betraying of <hi>Bristoll</hi>
(of which Treason I have spoken before) and who,
upon the discovery of it, had fled from thence. At
that place he tooke a Ship called the Dragon of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll,</hi>
and great store of wealth in her, belonging to
those who were his Enemies; which he seized, as
a just booty, and much to his advantage.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Chepstow</hi> he marched with a swift pace to
<hi>Monmouth;</hi> the Towne upon composition was soone
rendred to him; from whence, after he had put a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
into it, he marched to <hi>Vske,</hi> and summoned
the Country; where divers Forces came in to him;
among others Sir WILLIAM MORGAN his Sonne,
of <hi>Tredegan,</hi> brought him five hundred armed men,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96346:168"/>
and some Money; where also Master HERBERT of
<hi>Colebrooke</hi> raised a thousand men, and seized on <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine</hi>
for the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM WALLER in this high carriere of
his fortune, was commanded back from the West
by the Lord Generall <hi>Essex,</hi> to come to the chiefe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
Which being soone understood among those of
the Kings Army, he was way-layed by Prince MAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICE.
The intention of Sir WILLIAM WALLER
was to get to <hi>Gloucester</hi> with his Forces; having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent away his Ordnance and Baggage, with his
Foot to guard it over <hi>Wye</hi> to <hi>Aust;</hi> himselfe with his
Horse and Dragoones, resolved to fall upon Prince
MAURICE his Army, and force a passage thorow,
which he did with great successe, and small losse;
and as he marched afterward, cut down all the Bridges
behinde him; whereby he hindred Prince MAURICE
from marchimg after him. This course if the Prince
had taken before him, Sir WILLIAM WALLER
might have been kept in <hi>Wales</hi> to his great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
But by that meanes of cutting down the Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Prince MAURICE his pursuit being hindered,
Sir WILLIAM WALLER, by assistance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
MASSEY, regained many Townes possessed
by the Kings Forces, especially <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> Sir
MATTHEW CAREW being fled from thence. But
there he tooke many Prisoners, much Armes and
Riches; he placed a Garrison there; and from thence,
according to his first designe, arrived safe at the City
of <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM WALLER continued not long at
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> but (being now dispenced with for retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Lord Generall) according to his usuall
celerity, he flew to <hi>Hereford,</hi> before any feare or
expectation of his comming. He tooke that Towne
upon Quarter, and in it many Prisoners of great ranke
and quality, among whom was the Lord SCUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORE,
with five revolted Members of the House
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96346:169"/>
of Commons, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord SCUDMORES Sonne,
Colonell HERBERT PRICE, Sir RICHARD CAVE,
Lieutenant Colonell CONISBY, Master CONISBY,
and besides them, Sir WALTER PYE, Sir WILLIAM
CROFTS, Lieutenant Colonell THOMAS PRICE,
Serjeant Major MINTRIDGE, Sir SAMUEL AMBY,
Serjeant Major DALTON, Captaine SOMERSET,
Captaine SCLATER, Doctor ROGERS, Doctor
GOODWIN, Doctor EVANS, and divers others;
who were all carried away to <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within three daies after that service, he surprised
the Towne of <hi>Leinster</hi> in that County, twelve miles
distant from <hi>Hereford,</hi> where he tooke good prize,
disarmed many of the Kings Party there, and placed a
Garrison in the Towne.</p>
                  <p>It was feared at that time by those of the Kings
side, that Sir WILLIAM WALLER, going on in so
prosperous a way, might perchance surprize <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
and <hi>Ludlow:</hi> To prevent therefore his further
proceedings, Prince MAURICE, with a good strength
of Horse, was sent from <hi>Oxford,</hi> with whom also
the Marquesse of <hi>Hartford</hi> was joyned, to fall upon
him. But Sir WILLIAM scowring the Countries
thereabouts with his active Forces, and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
many of the other side in <hi>Wilts</hi> and <hi>Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
came to <hi>Bath</hi> with an Army much increased of
late both in number and reputation; at which place
Sir EDWARD HUNGERFORD, Sir JOHN HORNER,
and Master STRODE, joyned with him to oppose
Prince MAURICE and the Marquesse <hi>Hartford.</hi>
About that part of the Country were frequent and
fierce encounters, which lasted for a long time, and
many retreats with great skill and courage were made
on both sides, when night parted the fury of their
sights. But Sir WILLIAM WALLER proved for
the most part victorious (whose particular actions
there deserve a more peculiar relation) and at last
became Master of the field, chasing his Enemies so
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96346:169"/>
farre as a Towne called the <hi>Devizes,</hi> to which place
he followed and besieged them. The losses in all
those severall encounters were very uncertaine, and
variously reported, by reason that both Parties had
many times liberty to bury their dead; but on the
Parliament side were lost one Major, one Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and two Cornets. Sir ARTHUR HASLERIG
was there wounded, but the danger was not very
great. On the other side, besides the uncertaine
number of Common Souldiers, some of quality were
slaine, among whom was Sir BEVILE GREENVILE,
Lieutenant Colonell WARD, Major LOWRE, with
five or six Captains, Sir RALPH HOPTON, the Earle
of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> and the Lord MOHUN were reported
to be wounded.</p>
                  <p>Sir RALPH HOPTON was besieged in the <hi>Devizes</hi>
by Sir WILLIAM WALLER, and began to treat
about the surrender of it; for Prince MAURICE
and the Marquesse of <hi>Hartford</hi> were retired toward
<hi>Oxford,</hi> where suddenly the fortune of warre chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and Sir WILLIAM VVALLERS Army, by an
unexpected party of fresh Forces, which came from
<hi>Oxford</hi> (for the Lord Generall ESSEX his Army was
so much wasted by sicknesse, and other distresses,
that he could not at all straiten <hi>Oxford,</hi> nor hinder
any Forces from issuing thence) under the conduct
of the Lord VVILMOT, was utterly defeated, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and ruined, as was before mentioned. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for security at the present, retired into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> from whence within few daies he rode,
accompanied with some Gentlemen toward <hi>London,</hi>
and was there received with great affection, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
promises of their best indeavour to set him forth
with another Army.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Forces seemed now to have done the
greatest part of their worke, being in a manner sole
Masters of the VVest, and most Northerne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>England,</hi> and having ruined the Lord FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96346:170"/>
and Sir WILLIAM WALLERS Armies. Yet
in all Counties the fortune was not alike; in many
places those Gentlemen which adhered to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
were able not onely to guard themselves,
but get ground upon their enemies, though those
actions were for the most part performed in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
between small parties, in preserving their
owne strengths, or taking Townes from the other
side, such as had been in <hi>Cheshire, Lancashire, Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,
Derby, Leicester, Notingham,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which I shall briefly touch anon, after I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in how contrary a condition to the North
and West, which had beene the seat of a fierce warre,
and a prey to the greatest and most potent Armies of
either side; and how much happier then those other
Counties, which had beene alwayes molested with
Alarms and Skirmishes, and suffered by pillaging on
both Parties; the Easterne Counties of <hi>England</hi> had
remained all the foregoing VVinter, and continued
so during the whole progresse of this bloody VVarre,
which were the Counties of <hi>Suffolke, Norfolke, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
Essex, Hartford, Huntingdon. &amp;c.</hi> who never were
made the seat of any part of this civill VVarre. These
parts of the Kingdome had joyned themselves in an
Association by Authority of Parliament, with power
to defened each other, and leavy Forces against all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to that cause; this great happinesse of peace
and quiet that they enjoyed, may be supposed to
flow from the unanimity of their affections, which
carried them all the same way; and true it is, that
there was as much unanimity of opinion and affection
in those Counties among the people in generall, as
was to be found in any part of <hi>England,</hi> but it was
especially among the common people; for a great
and considerable number of the Gentry, and those of
highest ranke among them, were dis-affected to the
Parliament, and were not sparing in their utmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to promote the Kings Cause, and assist his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96346:170"/>
Force against it; which might have throwne those
Countries (if not wholly carried them to the other
side) into as much distraction, and sad calamity, as
any other part of the Land had felt; nor could that
Association have been possibly made, if those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
had not been curbed and suppressed by that
timely care which the Parliament tooke, and more
particularly by the successfull services of one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
Master OLIVER CROMWEL of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
a Member of the House of Commons; whose
wisdome, valour, and vigilancy, was no lesse availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in this important businesse, then remarkable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in the highest services, and greatest battels,
of the whole Warre. Of this mans Actions (because
it pleased God to raise him afterward into the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
commands, and prosper in so high a measure all
his undertakings, that he became within few yeares
one of the chiefe props, on which the Parliament
leaned, and greatest scourges of the other sid) let it
not seeme amisse if I discourse in a continued Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,
during those Moneths that intervened the Battell of
<hi>Keynton;</hi> and that low ebbe of the Parliament which
preceded the siege of <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Action that CROMWELL undertooke,
was to secure the Towne of <hi>Cambridge</hi> for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
about the middle of January. Universities
were of all places most apt to adhere to the Kings
party, esteeming Parliaments, and especially this,
the greatest depressors of that Ecclesiasticall Dignity,
in hope of which they are there nurtured.</p>
                  <p>Upon which reason they were packing up a large
quantity of the Plate that belonged to all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
to send it away to the King, which would
have made a considerable summe. This was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
by CROMWELL; who by a Commission from
the Parliament, and Lord Generall <hi>Essex</hi> had raised
a Troope of Horse, and came downe into that
Country, with authority to raise more Forces as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96346:171"/>
occasion served; he came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> soone enough
to seize upon that plate, which was going to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
but before his arrivall there, he performed by
the way another service: Sir THOMAS CONESBY,
lately made High Sheriffe of <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Proclamation from the King, to proclaime the
Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and all his adherents Traytors; and
was then at St. <hi>Albons</hi> upon a Market day, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same; CROMWELL with his Troope sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon him, and sent him up to the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Not long after he collected in convenient time
the Forces of that County, and invited the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Counties of <hi>Essex, Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Norfolke,</hi> to
their assistance, against an invasion of the Lord CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PELL,
who should have been seconded by Prince
RUPERT also, to invade that place, and hinder
the Association; which had been done, if that timely
prevention had not been used. This made them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
their intended invasion, and retire to other
parts.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of March CROMWELL ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
raised a Regiment of Horse, consisting of 1000.
marched into <hi>Suffolke</hi> with much celerity, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of a great and considerable confederacy
held among those Gentlemen which adhered to the
Kings Party, at a Towne in that County called
<hi>Lowerstost,</hi> a place of great consequence: He surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
them unawares, gained the Towne with small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and no shot at all. In which he tooke Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
Sir THOMAS BARKER, and his Brother Sir
JOHN PETTUS, Master THOMAS KNEVET, two
of the CATLINES, Captaine HAMMOND, Master
COREY, Master TURRILL, Master PRESTON,
and about 20. others of quality and substance. In
that Towne he gained good store of Ammunition,
Saddles, Pistols, Powder, Shot, and severall Engines
for Warre, enough to have served a considerable
Force. And certaine it was, that if CROMWELL
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96346:171"/>
had not surprized them in that nick of time, it had
proved a matter of great danger to the County; for
within one day after, as many more Knights and
Gentlemen, that were listed before, had met at the
same place. This was a timely service to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a great discouragement to all that Party in
<hi>Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Norfolke,</hi> which adhered to the Kings
side.</p>
                  <p>But when the Spring grew fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her on, and it was
seasonable to make longer Marches, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Aprill,</hi> CROMWELL having well setled
the businesses of those Associated Counties, for the
Parliaments use, and not confining his care and servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
within those parts onely, raised a greater Force,
of such as came freely and heartily in to him; with
whom he marched along towards <hi>Lincolneshire,</hi> with
purpose to assist those of his side, that warred against
<hi>Newarke. Newarke</hi> was one of the strongest Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which was then held of the Kings side, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with many Gentlemen of <hi>Lincolneshire,</hi> and
other Shires, and some expert Souldiers, who infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
large Contributions from the adjacent Country,
and made rodes often times even to the Walls of
<hi>Lincolne.</hi> Colonell CROMWELL in his March thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he passed thorow the County of <hi>Huming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
disarmed many that were ill affected to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and increased by that meanes his strength
so farre, that he was growne above two thousand
strong; and before he came to <hi>Newarke,</hi> receiving an
addition of Horse from Captaine HOTHAM, he also
joyned with some Forces of <hi>Lincolneshire.</hi> At his
first approach neere to <hi>Newarke,</hi> it was his fortune
to performe a good service for his side; for when
Captaine WRAY with his <hi>Lincolneshire</hi> Horse, had
too rashly quartered within a little of that Town, he
was set upon in the night time by a strong Party from
the Towne; where after some little bickering, nor
being able to resist so great a number, he was surprized
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96346:172"/>
with his whole Troope; but the Alarum comming to
CROMWELL, he advanced, and at ten a clock at
night fell upon the Newarkers, rescued Captaine
WRAYS Troope, and tooke three Troops of theirs,
with the slaughter of many of them.</p>
                  <p>After this, when he sate downe before the Town,
he was so vigilant upon all Sallyes that were made
out, and so successefull, that he tooke many men and
Colours at severall times; and with his Horse, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
all occasions, he once defeated a strong Party
of the Newarkers, neere to <hi>Grantham,</hi> where the odds
of number was so great on their side, that it seemed
almost a miraculous Victory. At another time he fell
upon a Party of the Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Army sent
toward <hi>Newarke,</hi> and quartering betweene that
Towne and <hi>Grantham,</hi> of whom he slew many, tooke
an hundred Horse, and forty Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>Such things as these were the beginnings of CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL,
at his first entrance into the Souldiery; those
that must be called his deeds; were in the following
yeares of this unhappy Warre, and will require a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and more full expression.</p>
                  <p>In those other Counties which were named before
this Discourse of the Association, the fortune of
Warre, during the aforesaid Moneths, had been very
various, and daily contestations happened, being for
the most part betwixt small Parties, and in besieging,
taking, and re-taking of Townes and Forts. In <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
Sir WILLIAM BRERETON, a wise and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
man, who from the beginning of these troubles
had taken charge of that County, serving in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as Knight thereof, had so well acted his part
against the Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> (made by the King Lord
Lieutenant of that County, as well as of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>)
that he was the chiefe instrument of delivering
<hi>Cheshire</hi> out of his hands, and preserving it for the
Parliament, though the greater part of Gentry there
adhered to the King: But it pleased God to give many
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96346:172"/>
Victories to Sir WILLIAM BRERETON against
them.</p>
                  <p>He obtained about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> a great
Victory against those of the Kings Party at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
in <hi>Cheshire;</hi> which Towne, after a sharp incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the fields before it, he finally tooke, with 500.
Prisoners, whereof many were Commanders and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of great worth; which Victory did much
advance the Parliaments Cause in those parts.</p>
                  <p>He resisted with great successe the Lord CHOLME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY,
and Sir THOMAS ASTON, two powerfull men,
and zealous for the Kings Party.</p>
                  <p>Having setled in some measure, by extraordinary
care and wisdome, his owne County for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and raised many stout and well armed men
there, he was forward to give assistance to other parts;
and advancing into <hi>Shropshire</hi> against the Lord CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PELL,
he surprised a Towne called <hi>Dreyton,</hi> in which
Sir VINCENT CORBET, a Commander of the
Kings side, was quartered: But Sir WILLIAM BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RETON
with small opposition entred the Town, and
tooke two compleat Troops of Horse, and six Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Dragoneers. Sir VINCENT CORBET esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by flight.</p>
                  <p>He marched thence along thorow those Counties,
and tooke some places of great import, as the affaires
of both Parties stood at that time.</p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM went on prosperously, and within
a short time after tooke <hi>Whitchurch,</hi> upon the edge
of <hi>Shropshire,</hi> with great store of Armes and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and many Prisoners of the Lord CAPELS
Forces.</p>
                  <p>But Sir WILLIAM BRERETON, when he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Forces with other men, or came in opportunely
to the reliefe or rescue of ingaged friends, performed
divers great and advantagious services to the side he
tooke, especially when he joyned in Action with
Sir JOHN GELL of <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> a constant and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96346:173"/>
Actor for the Parliament; of whom by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and together with Sir WILLIAM BRERETON,
I shall make a further mention.</p>
                  <p>The County of <hi>Derby,</hi> full of Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was much swayed, even from the beginning of
these distractions, against the Parliament; for scarce
did any Gentleman in all that County, but Sir JOHN
GELL, appeare for it at the first. He, with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and some of his kinred, by the help of those
Freeholders and Yeomen that inclined that way, made
a Party to resist those great ones, at such a time, as
must needs renowne his courage and constancy. And
it pleased God to make him prosperous in that great
and hazardous undertakings, and to carry it so du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Warre.</p>
                  <p>After the Battell at <hi>Keynton,</hi> he tooke a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> with great care and cost
he provided Arms, and timely seized upon the Town
of <hi>Derby;</hi> which Town he so well fortified, that it
proved a sufficient defence against the assaults of
potent Enemies, and a refuge upon all occasions to the
Parliaments friends; it was likewise, no doubt, a great
incouragement to many of the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to stand upon their guard in the like kinde.</p>
                  <p>But the Walls of <hi>Derby</hi> could not immure Sir
JOHN GELL, nor hinder him from acting his part
abroad. In many Services he joyned himselfe (not
without good successe) with Sir WILLIAM BRERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,
with Colonell CROMWELL, and marched
sometimes with the Lord GREY of <hi>Grooby</hi> (before
mentioned, Lord Lieutenant of those Counties)
against Master HASTINGS, and against the Towne
of <hi>Newarke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Moneth of <hi>February</hi> he marched with those
Forces which he had, under the conduct of the Lord
BROOKE, into <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> to take in <hi>Lichfield,</hi>
which was then possessed by a Garrison of the Kings
side. Having entered the Towne, they found hot
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96346:173"/>
and sharpe resistance, from a place of great strength,
called the Close, or Cathedrall yard, a place famous
in the succeeding Warre, as being often gained and
re-gained, with the losse of much blood on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile the Parliament Army continued
at the siege of <hi>Lichfield</hi> Close, their
Generall the Lord BROOKE, as he
looked out of a window, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
shot into the head, and
dyed immediately; a man as much
lamented by the Parliament, as any that ever fell on
that side, and as much honoured for his Piety, Valour,
and Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>After his death, Sir JOHN GELL succeeded in that
Command, and about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> took
the Close, with very little losse of blood, though
they had their Mynes ready prepared to blow up the
Walls of the Close, and had throwne Granadoes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; which made the besieged cry out for Quarter,
which they obtained; for the Souldiers thought it not
honourable (being in cold blood) to revenge their
Generals death, by putting them to the Sword. But
they tooke a good and rich booty of Money, Bagge,
and Baggage, about a thousand Armes, and very
considerable Prisoners, the Earle of <hi>Chesterfield,</hi> with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96346:174"/>
his Sonne, and divers other Gentlemen of Ranke.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of that <hi>March,</hi> Sir JOHN GELL
with an Army of fifteene hundred Horse and Foot,
advanced from <hi>Lichfield</hi> toward the Towne of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
where it was his fortune to meet with the Earle
of <hi>Northampton</hi> and his Forces, consisting of about
twelve hundred Horse, at a place called <hi>Cranock-Greene,</hi>
or <hi>Salt-Heath,</hi> almost foure miles from <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi>
The Earle gave a brave and furious Charge
upon them, and being stronger in Horse, made Sir
JOHN GELLS Horse to retreat and disorder at this
first Charge; in which he tooke divers of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and surprised two Drakes. After that, he
wheeled twice about their Foot, seeking his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
where to breake them: But Sir JOHN GELL,
and his Commanders, did so well order their Battalia,
that the Foot kept unbroken, and made good the
field againe together with their Horse, and re-saluted
their hot Assailants, fighting Pell mell for a long
time.</p>
                  <p>At this fierce incounter the Earle of <hi>Northampton</hi>
himselfe was slaine in the place, one Master LUCY
and Captaine BAGOT, with many more, about whose
number relations did not agree; a Cornet of the
Kings also was here slaine, and his Colours taken,
having on it a Crowne, and this Inscription, <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Rex.</hi> Two other Cornets were there taken, of
which one was the Princes, for the King, and Prince
his Troops were both there. They tooke Prisoner
one of the Earle of <hi>Chesterfields</hi> younger Sons; and
Sir JOHN GELL, by the timely comming in of Sir
WILLIAM BRERETON to his assistance, before the
sight was ended, obtained a great Victory, and drove
his Enemies quite out of the field. Among the rest,
Master HASTINGS (as was then reported) having
been once taken Prisoner, and rescued, fled away
wounded.</p>
                  <p>Thus it fell out, that these two Peeres, the Earle
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96346:174"/>
of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the Lord BROOKE, who first of
all the Nobility, at the breaking out of this Civill
Distraction, had personally contested in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
about the Parliament Ordinance of Militia, and
the Kings Commision of Array, within a small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
both of place and time, ended their daies by
this unhappy Warre. They were both much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their owne Parties, both men of worth and
courage, though much different in the manner of their
lives and conversations.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Cheshire,</hi> though a County where many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
inhabited, was by the successefull care of Sir
WILLIAM BRERETON and other Gentlemen,
kept from deserting the Parliament, and able to resist
the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant there: So
her sister <hi>Lancashire,</hi> more full of Papists, and more
fiercely assaulted by that Earle, under the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
being the place of his chiefe residence and
power, was able not onely to resist him, but final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beat him out of the Country by the courage and
industry of divers Protestant Gentlemen of that Shire;
of whom I have named many in the precedent Book.
But it is fit to give a little touch of the chiefe
actions.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament, in midst of winter, when that
County was in the greatest distraction, had sent down
Sir JOHN SEATON, a Scottish Knight, an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and stout Commander, as Major Generall of the
Forces in that Shire, that he might direct the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
valour of that people, though many of those
Gentlemen had done great services before, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at <hi>Manchester,</hi> and some other places.</p>
                  <p>One of his exploits was at <hi>Preston:</hi> Sir JOHN
SEATON having setled himselfe at <hi>Manchester,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
from thence about the beginning of <hi>February</hi>
toward <hi>Preston,</hi> with Major Generall SPARROW,
Colonell HOLLAND, Captaine BOOTH, Serjeant
Major BIRCH, Master NOWELL of <hi>Mearkley,</hi> and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96346:175"/>
some other, with about ten Companies, and almost
two thousand Clubmen, to take in <hi>Preston,</hi> a Town
well fortified, and very stoutly defended; but it was
so furiously assaulted (Captaine BOOTH in person
first sealing the Walls) by the Parliament Forces,
that after two houres of extreme hot fight, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Forces were Masters of it: The Town was
taken with small losse of the assailant side, which
was wonderfull; not one Officer, and not above se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight Common Souldiers. On the other side
many fell, the Mayor of the Town, ADAM MORTE,
with his Sonne, Sir GILBERT HOUGHTONS Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a Captaine of Horse, with divers others of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
Sir GILBERT himselfe fled to WIGHAM.
They tooke two hundred Prisoners, whereof many
were Gentlemen of good ranke in the Country.
They tooke three Peeces of Ordnance, many Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and other Armes, with two or three Colours.
The taking of this Town was of great consequence,
both toward the maintenance of the Parliament For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and also to stop the passage from <hi>Newcastle</hi> to
<hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shortly after Serjeant Major BIRCH was sent from
<hi>Preston</hi> to <hi>Lancaster</hi> Towne; who without any great
opposition (for he came suddenly and unexpected)
soone entred the Towne with his whole Company;
and being entered, the Townesmen assisted him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
freely to winne the Castle there; which he tooke
into his possession for the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiggon</hi> also in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> was taken in, with
great store of Armes and Prisoners, by Sir JOHN
SEATON, with those Gentlemen that followed him,
together with the Townesmen of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and
other Clubmen of the Country, whom they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
together.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> desisted not from his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to reduce that County; but marched with a
considerable strength to take in <hi>Whaley,</hi> which he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96346:175"/>
had almost accomplished, but was notwithstanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
from thence by the Forces of the Country.</p>
                  <p>The same Earle had likewise possessed himselfe of
<hi>Warrington,</hi> a considerable Towne in <hi>Lancashire;</hi>
and left a Garrison in it; but at the beginning of
<hi>Iune,</hi> that Towne was regained by the Forces of
<hi>Manchester,</hi> with eight Peeces of Ordnance, and five
or six hundred Prisoners; by which all <hi>Lancashire</hi>
seemed to be reduced to the obedience of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
scarce any place of considerable strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left in the power of the Early of <hi>Darby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord GRAY of <hi>Grooby,</hi> had been long pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of <hi>Leicester,</hi> as the chiefe quarter where he
resided; and besides his actions at other parts about
that place, with various fortunes had opposed the
Forces of Master HASTINGS, who kept a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
at <hi>Ashby de la zouch,</hi> and acted with great
fervour and constancy for the Kings Cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hampshire</hi> had been much distressed by both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but the Kings Garrison of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and that
of <hi>Basing-House,</hi> the dwelling place of Marquesse
<hi>Winchester,</hi> were there predominant, and at their
pleasure forced Contribution from the adjacent
Country; <hi>Wales</hi> was almost wholly at the Kings
dispose, except very few places, which with much
difficulty preserved themselves for the Parliament;
and some Gentlemen, who with much hazard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
their fidelity to that side, such as Colonell
GLYNN, Colonell MITTEN, and LAUGHERNE,
with other private Gentlemen. But indeed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was then in a low ebbe; and before the end
of that <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1643. they had no Forces at all to keep
the Field; their maine Armies (as is before touched)
being quite ruined, and no hope in appearance left,
but to preserve a while those Forts and Townes
which they then possessed; nor could they long hope
to preserve them, unlesse the fortune of the field
should change.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:96346:176"/>
Thus seemed the Parliament to be quite sunke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any hope of recovery, and was so believed
by many men. The King was possessed of all the
Westerne Countries, from the farthest part of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
and from thence Northward as farre as the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Armies were full and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
free to march whither they pleased, and
enough to be divided for severall exploits; one part
was sent to take in <hi>Exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was shut up, not able long to hold the place.
The King in Person with a gallant Army, designed
his March towards <hi>Gloucester,</hi> the onely considerable
Towne in those parts, which the Parliament held.
What the Kings Party conceived then of the other
side, was expressed in many Writings, one in the
nature of a jeering Epigram, was made at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
which I thought fit to insert, because of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
expressions of the Parliaments low Condition:
The thing is written in an odde manner, and the names
of the Parliament Commanders, FAIRFAX and
WALLER, expressed by a <hi>rebus</hi> way of Latine, as
likewise those of the Kings side, Marquesse of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and Earle of <hi>Newcastle.</hi> I leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <hi>London</hi> was then altogether unfortified, no Works
were raised; nor could they, if their Enemies, then
Masters of the field, had come upon them, have
opposed any Walls, but such as old SPARTA used
for their Guard, the hearts of couragious Citizens.
But at that time <hi>London</hi> began her large intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which incompassed not onely the City, but
the whole Suburbs on every side, containing about
twelve miles in circuit. That great worke was by many
hands compleated in a short time, it being then a
custome every day to go out by thousands to digge,
all Professions, Trades, and Occupations, taking their
turnes; and not onely inferiour Tradesmen, but
Gentlemen of the best quality, Knights, and Ladies
themselves, for the incouragement of others, resorted
daily to the Workes, not as spectators but assistors
in it; carrying themselves Spades, Mattoks, and other
instruments of digging, so that it became a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sight at <hi>London,</hi> to see them going out in such
order and numbers, with Drums beating before them;
and put life into the drooping people (being taken
for an happy Omen) that in so low a condition they
seemed not to despaire. But bootlesse in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had that labour proved, and not timely enough
to save <hi>London,</hi> if the King had marched thither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that storme of Fortune was strong enough to
shake off divers of the loose leaves, that seemed to
grow on the Parliament side, and unsettle the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of such, as were not enough rooted in that
Cause which they had chosen: For divers men of
great quality, and Members of both Houses, some
Lords, and many of the Commons, did at that time
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96346:177"/>
desert the Parliament, and fly to <hi>Oxford:</hi> Whose
names (though the Lords were named, who first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
it) are here spared, because this-latter revolt
must needs carry the face of a crime; as being no
matter of opinion or conscience, by which the first
justified themselves; but proceeding, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
from weaknesse, and feare for their private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
They therefore lost much of their esteeme on
both sides; becomming like a foile to set off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of those few Members who durst yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
there, and remaine firme to their first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and dangers, then any former Parliament had
been enforced to do.</p>
                  <p>But in the Parliament it selfe there appeared no
show of despaire, as they observed who were then
witnesses of their proceedings; and the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
expressed much forwardnesse and alacrity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting
the Lord Generall <hi>Essex</hi> both with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and purses; besides their great indeavour to raise
another Army for Sir WILLIAM WALLER, to be
as a Reserve to the other, upon the great occasion
then in hand.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Manchester,</hi> to his lasting Honour,
chose that very time to begin his Martiall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and raising Forces thorow the Easterne Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
Counties (of which he was then made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
by the Parliament, those Counties having been
before prepared for that Association, by the wisdom
and activity of the forementioned Colonell CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL)
performed that yeare and the next great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
for the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>While the Parliament and City of <hi>London</hi> were
thus busied in recruiting their decayed Armies, <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>
began to be made the chiefe Seene, on which
this Civill Tragedy was acted, and place of great
concernment in the Kingdome, where the first turne
of Fortune grew. The City of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96346:177"/>
governed by Colonell EDWARD MASSEY, a man
of excellent skill to defend it; of such a courage, as
no threats of a powerfull Enemy could shake; and
such a fidelity, as no promises of a King could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
This MASSEY was brought to <hi>Gloucester</hi> by
the Earle of <hi>Stamford,</hi> under whom he had served
as Lieutenant Colonell, and by deputation from that
Earle, had for many Moneths governed that City.</p>
                  <p>Now there was no more expectation of the Earls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
thither; and therefore MASSEY, as the fittest man,
by consent both of Citizens and Souldiers, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Governour, and made a Colonell by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from the Generall.</p>
                  <p>The surrender of <hi>Bristoll</hi> to the Kings Forces
(which was more sudden then could be feared, and
for which afterward the Governour Master FIEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES
was questioned, and condemned by a Councell
of Warre) must needs strike a great terrour, and
sad amazement into <hi>Gloucester,</hi> which now seemed
to stand forlorne, and without hope of any rescue,
in the midst of a large Country, possessed by their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
Enemies.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denyed, that the resolution which
this City had taken up, of resisting the King at such
a time, was very admirable, if a man consider the
small strength they had within; the many discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
round about them; the great distance of
any aid that could be sent to them. Their strength
within was very small; the whole number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
Horse, Foot, and Dragoones, together with
the Trayned Bands, aud those Horse and Dragoones,
which on a sudden they got from <hi>Barclay</hi> Castle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of few more then fifteene hundred; forty Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
of Powder was all their store, with a very meane
and slender Artillery for such a Service: The Works
were of a vast compasse, and little more then halfe
perfected, when this rough storme did first threaten
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:96346:178"/>
The whole Country round about them, instead
of incouraging this resolution of theirs, did rather
indeavour to shake and weaken it, by intimations of
the danger, and perswasions to make Peace with such
an Enemy: For they had revolted from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or resolved so to do; and wished, for their
owne private Interests, that the King were quietly
possessed of that City; for they conceived (not
without reason) that the standing out of <hi>Gloucester</hi>
would be unhappy for that Country; because by
the falling downe of a great Army, they could not
but expect a destruction of their Corne, Cattle, and
all other Provisions; and at the last, if it should so
fall out, that the King should faile of taking in that
Towne, they must be inforced to stoope perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
under two burdens, and be cast into a sadd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of povety and misery. Whereas if that Army
did prevaile, they were sure to rest in the heart of
the Kings Country, farre from spoile and plunder,
and for an easie Contribution, injoy free and ample
Trade.</p>
                  <p>The succour which the City could expect, was
as farre off as <hi>London,</hi> and in what condition the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Armies then were, is before related. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, the Citizens of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with examining what strength they had, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
also the grounds of their perseverance. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell
was held, where the Officers of the
Souldiery were present; their late Protestation was
called to remembrance, and read there; by which
they were all obliged, never to act or comply with
the adverse Faction. Upon which consideration they
heightened their courages, and unanimously resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to refuse the tender of peace. Privare cares were
then forgotten, and not onely men, but women and
children, acted their parts, in making up those defects
that were in the Fortifications.</p>
                  <p>In this condition stood <hi>Gloucester,</hi> when the King
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96346:178"/>
in Person attended with a great and gallant Army,
full of the flower of English Nobility and Gentry,
was come to besiege it, being the tenth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
1643.</p>
                  <p>Part of the Kings Forces, some daies before, had
been discerned hovering on the top of the hills; and
a Summons had been sent from Prince RUPERT to
the City: To which the Major gave answer, That
he kept the Towne for His Majesties behoofe, and
could not render it. Which Answer, though laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at by those of the Army, the Major conceived
very justifiable, and that he did truly hold it for the
use of His Majesty, but according to the sense of
both Houses of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The King was full of indignation, that such a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
City should stand out against him; yet he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to gaine it without blood, and losse of time,
which seemed then pretious in his full carriere of
Victory. To that purpose he came in Person before
it, that the reverence or terrour of his presence might
prevaile with them; and being come before the City,
he gave this honourable Summons by two Heraulds
of Armes.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES REX.</p>
                  <p>OVt of our tender compassion to our City of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
and that it may not receive prejudice by
our Army, which we cannot prevent, if we be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to assault it: We are Personally come before it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the same, and are gratiously pleased to let all the
Inhabitants of, and all other persons within that City, as
well Souldiers as others, know, That if they shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
submit themselves, and deliver this City to us,
we are contented freely and absolutely to pardon every
one of them without exception; and do assure them in the
word of a King, That they nor any of them, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the least dammage or prejudice by our Army, in
their Persons or Estates: But that we will appoint such
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96346:179"/>
a Governour, and a moderate Garrison to reside there,
as shall be both for the ease and security of that City,
and the whole Country. But if they shall neglect this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of Grace and Favour, and compell us by the power
of our Army to reduce that place (which by the help of
God we shall easily and shortly be able to do) they must
thank themselves for all the calamities and miseries which
shall befall them. To this Message we expect a cleare and
positive Answer, within two houres after the publishing
hereof; and by these Presents do give leave to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
safely to repaire to, and returne from us, whom
that City shall desire to imploy unto us in that businesse.
And we do require all the Officers and Souldiers of our
Army, quietly to suffer them to passe accordingly.</p>
                  <p>After some debate upon this Message, an Answer
was drawne and consented unto, both by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and the Souldiers; which was presented to the
King by Serjeant Major PUDSEY, and a Citizen; as
followeth:</p>
                  <p>WE the Inhabitants, Magistrates, Officers, and
Souldiers within this Garrison of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
unto his Majesties Gracious Message returne this humble
Answer, That we do keepe this City, according to our
Oath and Allegiance, to and for the use of his Majesty,
and his Royall Posterity; and do accordingly conceive
our selves wholly bound to obey the Commands of His
Majesty signified by both Houses of Parliament; and
are resolved, by Gods helpe, to keepe this City ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p>The King received this Answer to his Summons,
without any expression of choller or indignation,
seeming onely to wonder at their great confidence,
and from what hope of reliefe it should proceed,
using these words before the Messengers, WALLER
<hi>is extinct, and</hi> ESSEX <hi>cannot come.</hi> But by this time
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96346:179"/>
the Kings Army was drawne into the fields about
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> Prince RUPERT and Generall RIVEN
facing it on one side with about six thousand Horse
and Foot, and two thousand Horse on the other;
and immediately after this Answer, advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
into the Suburbs, on the East side of the City;
but were there entertained with an hot Skirmish, and
fired out. For upon the returne of the Messengers,
the Suburbs were set on fire, and flaming round about,
became an object of great terrour; by which the
Citizens seemed more ingaged to pursue their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the Kings Army to settle themselves for
gaining by force what they perceived would not be
yeelded on other termes.</p>
                  <p>That very night the Kings Army began their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
within Musket shot of the Walls, on two
sides of the City, taking advantage for their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
of the shadow and shelter of some few Houses
which the flames had not catched. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
the Musketeers plyed them from the Walls,
but could do little hurt so against the Pyoneers;
which caused the besieged to make severall Sallyes by
small Parties into those Trenches, and at some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
beat them out, gaining both Armes and Prisoners,
and retreating safe.</p>
                  <p>Sir WILLIAM VAVASOR had advanced with his
Welch Forces on the West side, and made neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
that way, intending to joyne with other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that came from <hi>Worcester,</hi> and had drawne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together on the North-West side. On the
South side Generall RIVEN placed his Leaguer, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage of a rising ground in the midst, to
shelter himselfe from the shot of the besieged. Sir
JACOB ASHLEY, who in the first Skirmishes had
received a wound, was quartered with a strong Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado
at the East side of the City.</p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Gloucester</hi> on all sides blocked up, and
nothing expected but a most furious and bloody bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96346:180"/>
The Kings Commanders, being many of them
Gentlemen of great skill, and experience of Conduct,
had made their approaches (by the confession of all)
with as much advantage as could be; and placed their
Batteries accordingly; the Souldiers on that side had
shewed themselves very swift and indefatigable in
their Intrenchments, and as bold in all attempts which
they made upon the Towne. Nor were the besieged
behind hand in courage, patience, and activity; as
appeared not onely in their defences, but frequent Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes;
the Governour MASSEY being admired by
his Enemies, for the great skill and dexterity which
he shewed upon all occasions: Of which I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> particularly and at large, by reason
of the great importance of this famous Siege; the
condition of the whole Kingdome depending so much
upon the successe of it.</p>
                  <p>Many strange and successefull Sallyes were made
by the besieged.</p>
                  <p>Three daies after the Siege was layed, an hundred
and fifty Musketeers, commanded by Captaine
GRAY, fallyed over the Workes, upon the <hi>Worcester</hi>
Forces, with whom the Welch had not yet joyned,
sell into their Quarters, marched up to their Maine
Guard, killed a Captaine, with eight or nine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers, tooke five Prisoners, divers Armes,
burnt their Guard, and retreated without the losse of
any. Captaine MALLERY, with the like number of
Musketeers, within a day after was commanded forth,
to surprize some Ordnance of their Enemies, which
were suspected to lye at a certaine place; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none, retreated without losse, having killed some,
taken a few Prisoners, and fired part of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Within a weeke after, another Party of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Musketeers, commanded by Captain
CRISPE, sallyed forth, and fell into their Enemies
Trenches under the Towne Wall, marched above
halfe way thorow them, performed strangely, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96346:180"/>
killed above an hundred men, as was confessed by
some of that side, and by the help of the Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
on the City Walls, retreated safe, without the
losse of any, only two wounded.</p>
                  <p>The Besiegers proceeded with great skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
in making their Batteries, and undermining
at severall places; which labour of undermining, at
some places was made frustrate by water springs,
and in others by the extreme hardnesse of rocky
ground; and where the businesse was more feasible,
the skill of the Governour prevented them by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining.
Many Granadoes were shot of great big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from their Morterpieces into the Towne, but
guided by a strange hand of providence into such by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,
that they did very little hurt. One thing is
worthy the relating; when the Welch and <hi>Worcester</hi>
Forces of the King came up, and foure Peeces of
Ordnance were drawne a good distance before the
place of their Leaguer, and one of them planted
for battery; a Party of about foure hundred Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers,
commanded by Major PUDSEY, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
GRAY, assisted by Captaine FAULKNER, and
Captaine MASSEY, fallied forth of one of the Gates;
meane while a Lieutenant with fifty Musketeers, was
sent over the Works to give them an Alarum, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
the greater Party got behind their Canon and
Breast-Works; fell upon their maine Guard, slew
many Officers, two Canoniers, slew, or mortally
wounded, about an hundred Common Souldiers;
tooke a Lieutenant, with foure more Prisoners, nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Canon; and retreated with the losse onely
of two slaine, and foure taken Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>Two Sallyes of such Parties were not long after
made, though not with the same successe altogether
(by reason of some mis-guidance) yet so much, as
that they retreated without any sensible losse; and
were enough to amaze their Enemies, that such small
Parties should runne up to their head Quarters, force
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96346:181"/>
their men, and be able in that manner to recover
back. And it was observed by those who well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Warre, that it was a more then ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which did preserve and bring off those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
severall Parties, when the vanquishing of any
one of them, must needs run the City into extreme
hazard; whose whole strength remained upon the
Workes day and night, except the reserve of an
hundred and twenty men at the maine Guard. One
rare and slender ranke were to receive all the storme
without seconds: Yet it was the opinion of best
Souldiers, that the safety of the whole did require
those frequent Sallyes, as the best remedies for so
desperate a disease: Which did not onely retard their
Enemies Preparations, but put them into an Amaze,
that the besieged should continue in such an height
of resolution; which resolution was to be kept up
by the heat of Action. And it was the Governours
care, to keep his Enemies waking by continuall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms,
to wast and weary them.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Army were still preparing for a generall
storme, and striving in the meane time to waste the
Magazine of the Town, which they hoped would
soone faile, they spent their owne store, and daily
acted to the terrour of the besieged; shooting Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes
and Fire-bals out of their Morter-Peeces; and
from one Battery which they had planted, shot in one
night above twenty fiery bullets, which flew thorow
the ayre like so many falling Stars, some eighteene
pound weight, others two and twenty; some of them
passing thorow Stables and Hay-ricks, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by their swift motion, faile of kindling;
and, which seemed strange, could not set one house
on fire. Many Mynes and Countermynes were every
day working with great industry on both sides, the
Governour MASSEY, striving to animate his men,
and prevent the Townes despairng, by shewing the
probability of a sudden reliefe; withall adding,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96346:181"/>
that their so late yeelding would not at all mollifie
the Kings Army. On the other side, the King see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
loath to invite them to yeeld solemnly by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Summons, least he should detract from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his enterprize. Yet many dealt with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand,
by advertisements of the Kings displeasure,
using also perswasions, and some intimations of the
possibility of Grace.</p>

and the Siege so straight, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
could possibly arrive at
it; the Parliament, who after seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
considerations and debates, had
for the present resolved upon the
reliefe of that City, as the onely meanes to preserve
the Kingdome; were as much straightned how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the businesse, with that expedition which
was required. To recruit an Army so much wasted
as the Lord Generals was, seemed too slow for this
Service; and therefore the Trayned Bands of <hi>London,</hi>
and their Auxiliaries, must of necessity be made use
of: Those that were well affected to the Parliament
incouraged each other to the Worke: The disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on the other side, laboured in all discourses to
breed despaire of the Atchievement, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Lord Generall from marching; false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
were every day raised in <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
was taken. The Lord Generall <hi>Essex</hi> was foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
miles off, with no present or visible Army at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96346:182"/>
that time; his March lying thorow those Countries
which were already harrowed by the Enemy: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that all considered, it was a question which
was more wonderfull, that he undertooke it, or
that he did it. The Parliament was at that time so
farre sunke, both in strength and reputation, and so
much forsaken by those who followed fortune, that
nothing but an extraordinary providence could make
it againe emergent. The Cause, and very being of
it, was now at stake; by the successe onely of this
Expedition to be redeemed or quite lost. But it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God, that according to that extremity, the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of men were fitted. The City Regiments
and Auxiliaries came cheerefully in, to performe the
Service; and that poore remainder of the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
old Army was with all speed recruited. An
Army was likewise intended to be speedily raised
for Sir WILLIAM WALLER to march after, as a
Reserve. But that was not so suddenly done as the
occasion required; if it had, and that Sir WILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AM
could (as was intended) have come in with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
at <hi>Newbury,</hi> it was the opinion of most men,
that the Kings side had received an irrecoverable
Defeat.</p>
                  <p>On the 24. of <hi>August</hi> the Lord Generall <hi>Essex</hi> on
<hi>Hownslow</hi> Heath, ten miles from <hi>London,</hi> mustered
his men; where almost all the Members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament rode with him to survey the Army;
and toward evening tooke leave of their Generall,
who marched on, and that night lodged at <hi>Colebrooke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon intelligence of this Armies advance, Prince
RUPERT, with the greatest part of the Kings Horse,
drew off from <hi>Gloucester,</hi> to oppose their March,
and take what advantages he could against it: But
the King with his maine Army continued the Siege,
resolving so to do till the last houre; hoping that
every moment might worke somewhat for his end;
either by failing of the Townes store of Ammunition,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96346:182"/>
or some other want that might happen. Neither
was that hope without reason. And so much more
wonderfull was the fortune of that Towne, to be
relieved at such a nick of time, when their Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
was so farre consumed, that but three sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Barrels of Powder were left in their Magazine.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday the 26. of <hi>August</hi> 1643. the Lord
Generall <hi>Essex</hi> began his March from <hi>Colebrooke</hi> to
<hi>Beckensfield,</hi> and so forward to <hi>Beerton,</hi> where he
cloathed his Army, and marched on. The City Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
and Auxiliaries joyned not with the Lord
Generals Army till the first of <hi>September,</hi> when the
generall Rendezvouze was on <hi>Brackley</hi> Heath. But
before the joyning of all their Forces, a small Party
of the Kings Army, consisting of 400. Horse, had
faced a part of the Parliament Army, and skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with them about <hi>Bicister,</hi> but soone retreated
upon the approach of greater numbers. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
taking up his Head Quarter at <hi>Aynow,</hi> sent a
Regiment to quarter that night at <hi>Deddington</hi> under
the Conduct of Colonell MIDDLETON; who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
there of two Regiments of the Kings Horse, sent
two Companies of Dragoones, and a Party of Horse
to approach the Towne. But the Kings Horse retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a passage toward <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the Lord WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOT
was with 50. Troops more. The next morning
two Parliament Regiments, conducted by MIDDLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON
and Sir JAMES RAMSEY advanced to that
passe; where their Enemies stood in two great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and after some Skirmish gained the passe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Dragoneers to maintaine it. But the Kings For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
drew up againe toward it, and were received
with a very hot Skirmish, which lasted many houres,
till at last the Kings Forces made a retreat; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that Colonell MIDDLETON marched back
toward the maine Army (which he did by the Lord
Generals Command) they sent a Party of Horse to
fall on his Reare, who followed them thorow <hi>Ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:96346:183"/>
but were beaten back thorow the Towne
in some confusion. The losse of men in these Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
was not much on either side; neither could
it certainly be knowne, but was imagined by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
side to be more on their Enemies Party then
on theirs.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Generall with his owne Regiment of
Horse, and the Lord GRAY, quartering at <hi>Adder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
upon intelligence that some of the Kings Horse
from <hi>Banbury</hi> were abroad, sent out a Party from
both Regiments, who beat them in againe, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
them into <hi>Banbury</hi> Towne, whence they tooke
divers Horses and Prisoners, those in the Castle not
daring to stirre out. The Generall marched from
thence to <hi>Chipping Norton,</hi> where some of the Kings
Forces appeared againe, but soone retreated, as
they did almost every day, during the March of that
Army.</p>
                  <p>On the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> when the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
marched toward <hi>Stow</hi> the old, he sent Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
HARVEY with his Regiment of Horse, and
two Regiments of Foot, to advance a little before
toward the right hand, and the City Regiments
upon the left, under the Conduct of Lieutenant
Colonell BAILY, Generall Adjutant of the Foot.
Prince RUPERT appeared with about 4000. Horse,
drawne up on the Hills, facing the Parliament For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and sent a strong Party of Horse into a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
neere <hi>Stow</hi> on the old, to incompasse Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
HARVEYS Regiments. Which being perceived,
three Regiments from the Vanne of the Parliament
Army advanced to his rescue, and made that Party
of the Kings Forces retreat to their maine Body:
Many Skirmishes there happened, but little losse on
either side.</p>
                  <p>From thence the Generall marched in the Foot of
his Infantry, Sir JAMES RAMSEY in the Reare,
and Sir PHILIP STAPLETON had the Van Guard.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96346:183"/>
When the Kings Horse againe appeared, and were
by Sir PHILIP STAPLETON, and others of that
Army encountered with divers Skirmishes; but they
retreated in a great Body, and still appeared before
the Parliament Army, as they marched on, for the
space of seven miles.</p>
                  <p>On the fifth of <hi>September</hi> the Lord Generall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and came to <hi>Presbury</hi> Hills; where he drew up
his whole Army in view of the City of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
and discharged foure Peeces of great Ordnance, to
give them notice of his approach. Soone after he
might discover the Kings Quarters on fire: For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord Generall his advance, they deserted the
Siege, and marched away all night. The Reere-Guard
of the Lord Generals Army, some Ordnance and
Ammunition, stayed on the top of the Hill, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the steepnesse thereof, darknesse of the night,
and tempestuousnes of the weather, whereby (besides
a famine of Victuals) the whole Army had for three
daies March before extremely suffered, through a
Country that their Enemies had already destroyed. But
the Lord Generall marched from thence to <hi>Chelten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
though during his March, the Kings Forces
skirmished with some Parts of his Army, and divers
times beat up his Quarters whilest he stayed at <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham,</hi>
which was two daies, till the eight of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
when he marched with his whole Army to
<hi>Gloucester;</hi> and was there with great expressions of
joy, and much honour, received by that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
and now rescued City; The Generall much
extolling the skilfull valour, and indefatigable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of Colonell MASSEY, and praising the patient
constancy of the City; They on the other side high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honouring his Excellency for bringing them this
reliefe, thorow so many difficulties, discouragements,
and disadvantages; both joyning in thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, for his divine providence over them, and
great mercy in sending so timely a deliverance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:96346:184"/>
The Lord Generall lodged two nights in <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
furnishing the City with Ammunition, Money,
and other necessaries; and from thence marched to
<hi>Tewksbury,</hi> staying betwixt the Kings Forces and
that Garrison foure daies, to give them more time
to furnish themselves better with Provision of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall;
which was to be brought from <hi>Herefordshire,</hi>
and parts beyond the <hi>Severne,</hi> since the other parts
had been before ransacked by the Kings Forces.</p>
                  <p>When the Generall with his whole Army arose
from <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> and intended to quarter at <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham,</hi>
he was advertised, that a Body of the
Kings Army were then in <hi>Cirencester</hi> (which were
reported to be Prince MAURICE his Forces) and
had there layed in great store of Provision for their
Army. Upon that advertisement the Generall, his
want of Victuals and necessaries still continuing, and
miserably increasing upon his whole Army, made
a long March with the Van-guard of his Army to
fall upon them, which he did about one of the clock
in the night, sending in a Party of Horse to seize
upon the Centinels and Guards, whilest himselfe,
with the rest of the Horse begirt the Towne; and a
Forlorne hope of Foot, with his owne Foot Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
entred the Towne, and surprized two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Horse (belonging to Sir NICHOLAS
CRISPE, and Colonell SPENCER) which were
by the confession of some Prisoners taken, intended
for raising a Commotion in <hi>Kent.</hi> The Lord Generall
at that Towne of <hi>Cirencester</hi> took forty Loads of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall,
which, under Gods providence, was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his Army, untill the day that the great
Battell of <hi>Nembury</hi> was fought. He tooke there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
six Standards, all the Officers, except the two
Colonels, which were absent, with divers other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of quality; above 300. Common Souldiers,
and 400. Horse.</p>
                  <p>The Generall from <hi>Cirencester,</hi> in short Marches,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96346:184"/>
not above five miles a day, went to <hi>Cricklade,</hi> and
to <hi>Swinden,</hi> from thence intending to passe to <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerford.</hi>

approached hard to the Reere-guard of his Army;
which not being a sufficient number to resist them,
indeavoured to make an orderly retreat to the Body
of their Army. But the Kings Horse pursued so hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both on Reere and Flanke, that those Horse Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of the Generals Reere-guard could not retreat
but with confusion, and some losse. But being come
to the Body of the Foot, they were drawn up againe
into order, and faced their Enemies, untill all the
Foot were marched. Neverthelesse the Kings Horse
againe advancing, put their Enemies the second time
into the like disorder; till some of the Generals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
facing about towards them, charged the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne

Horse, and put them wholly into disorder; and then
charging the two Regiments which seconded that
Forlorne Hope, they routed them likewise; but the
Kings Horse came on bravely with fresh Bodies, and
stopt their Enemies further pursuit. Immediately
followed a brave Charge, made by two of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Regiments, which was incountered with as
much Gallantry on the other side, so that they both
retreated at one time. Another Charge was made by
some Regiments of the Parliament Army, and so
answered by the other, that they were forced to
retreat to their maine Body; at which time S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Essex</hi> marched that night with his Army to <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
Sir PHILIP STAPLETON, who before had
the Van, bringing up the Reere.</p>
                  <p>The next day the famous Battell of <hi>Newbury</hi> was
fought; which Battell may deserve (because the
condition of the whole Kingdom so much depended
on the successe of it) to be related in a large and
particular manner. But because I have found nothing
written of it by those of the Kings Party; and that
there was a punctuall Narrative published by some
Colonels of the Parliament Army, Gentlemen of
great and unstained Reputation, concerning this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell;
which Narrative I have heard some of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
confesse to be full, not onely of modesty, but
truth in the Generall, or for the most part; let the
Reader be pleased to take it from their Relation. If
any thing may hereafter appeare of greater truth, it
will not trouble any honest man to see it published.
Neither is it a thing unheard of, for men to describe
their owne actions with impartiall truth; since JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIUS
CAESAR is acknowledged to have written his
owne Commentaries, not onely of the <hi>Gallike</hi> but
Civill Warre, with so much cleare integrity, that his
Enemies had nothing to blame in it. Take it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their Language.</p>
                  <p>On Tuesday the nineteenth of <hi>September,</hi> 1643.
we marched from <hi>Hungerford</hi> towards <hi>Newbury;</hi> and
when we approached within two miles of the Town,
we might discover the Enemies Forces upon an hill;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96346:185"/>
their whole Army having prevented us, were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to <hi>Newbury,</hi> and possest the Towne. But the
next morning, being Wednesday, by break of day
order was given for our March to an Hill called <hi>Biggs
Hill,</hi> neere to <hi>Newbury,</hi> and the onely convenient
place for us to gaine, that we might with better secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
force our passage. But when his Excellency per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the Enemies Forces had possest themselves
of that hill, marching himselfe upon the head of his
owne Regiment, Colonell BARCLAYS, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
HOLBOURNES Brigades, he charged so fiercely,
that he beat them from the hill, and kept it (rather
gaining then losing ground) the whole day. His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
Regiment, and those other Brigades, all
the while they continued there, were hotly charged
by the Enemies Horse and Foote, whilest much
prowesse was shewed on both sides. The Generall in
Person bestirred himselfe, giving directions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there was occasion, and present in all places of
danger, discharged the part of an excellent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
as the Enemies themselves witnessed. But he
considered not the danger of his Person, whilest he
laboured to maintaine that place, which of all others
was most advantagious for his prospect. By this time
came up the two Trayned Bands of <hi>London,</hi> who,
though they were often charged by the Horse and
Foot, stood to it with undaunted resolution.</p>
                  <p>The Battell thus begun by the Foot, Sir PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIP
STAPLETON, with his Excellency his Guard
and Regiment of Horse, advanced upon the plaine
of the Hill; when he had no sooner drawne up out
of the Lanes end, seconded by Colonell DAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEIRES
Regiment of Horse (no other Horse being
advanced to the place) but the Enemy perceiving
this advantage, being all drawne already in severall
great Bodies of Horse, part of them advanced im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and charged our Horse; whom we so well
received (giving no fire till we joyned close with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96346:186"/>
them) that the Enemy was wholly routed, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
with much execution neere to the place where
their whole Body of Horse stood. From thence by
order we drew back to our first ground; by occasion
whereof, opportunity was gained to bring up the
remainder of our Horse, which had the Van-guard
that day: whereupon the Enemy drew out some fresh
Regiments of his Horse, and with all possible speed
advanced againe upon Sir PHILIP, but received
no bettter entertainment then before, being againe
routed by him. By that time that he had drawne up
his Regiment againe into some order, the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
(RAMSEY, HARVEY, GOODWIN) were
come up to him, when the Enemy with their whole
Body charged upon them bravely, and were as well
received. Sir PHILIP STAPLETON was here char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
both in Front and Flanke, his whole Regiment
having spent both their Pistols, and was so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed,
that the Enemy and ours, with both our
whole Bodies, were all mixed together; and in this
confusion many were slaine on both sides, and our
men at last were forced towards the Lanes end, where
they first came in; which being neere our Foot, the
Enemies indeavoured to dis-ingage themselves, and
drew back to their owne Forces. Those that entred
the Lane with ours were most of them slaine.</p>
                  <p>We tooke three Colours of Horse compleat, and
a peece of another Colours. In the first Charge Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
DALBEIRE, and Commissary COPLEY,
charging stoutly, were both wounded. In the third
Charge Captain HAMOND, Captain FLEETWOOD,
Captaine PYM, and Cornet DOILY, were all woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Captaine DRAPER, who had a Forlorne Hope
of Sir PHILIP STAPLETONS men, did good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
as Captain ABERCROMY, and Captain SHIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BORNE
did with their Dragoones. The left wing of
our Horse, commanded by Colonell MIDDLETON,
and the right wing of the Enemies Horse, could
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96346:186"/>
not be ingaged, but in small Parties, by reason of
the hedges.</p>
                  <p>The actions of our Horse thus described wholly
(because we were loath to interupt the Series, for
the Readers clearer understanding) returne we to
the Foot. Major Generall SKIPPON in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when his Excellency (as aforesaid) was inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon the hill, hastened to the top of the hill,
where our Van-guard was in fight; having before
ordered the March of our Traine of Artillery, and
those that attended it (which were the Lord RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTS
his Brigade, and his owne, Sir WILLIAM
SPRINGERS, Colonell MANWARINGS, and the
red and blew Auxiliary Regiments) to be neere to
his Excellency. Looking from the Hill toward <hi>Newbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
he perceived a great strength of the Enemy,
both Horse and Foot, in divers great Bodies advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
directly toward the way which all our Traine
was of necessity to march. To prevent therefore what
he suspected, which was, that the Enemy would fall
upon our Traine, or upon the Reare of those that
fought on the hill, or gaine that hill behinde us, our
last nights Quarter, or all; he speedily disposed
(which his Excellency did also send him a Command
to do) Forces in places most convenient: Meane
while the Generall sending for more Foot, that Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
wherein his Regiment and SPRINGERS were,
with the red Auxiliaries, were sent up; placing the
Lord ROBERTS his Brigade, with foure small Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
just where the Enemy advanced, who gave them
so warme an entertainment, that they made them
run; and the Lord ROBERTS possest the ground,
which the Enemy came first up unto: His Lieutenant
Colonell was shot in the face.</p>
                  <p>That Forlorne Hope which he had commanded the
night before, being now strengthened with 300.
Musketeers, and led by Major FORTESCUE, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Generall SKIPPON placed on the left of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96346:187"/>
Lord ROBERTS his Brigade, upon the high way
that came from <hi>Newbury</hi> just upon us; upon which
way foure Drakes were likewise placed, and well
defended, though the Enemies came up so close, that
they tooke away a Limmer of one of our Peeces, but
it was with losse of many of their lives.</p>
                  <p>Colonell MANWARINGS Regiment was placed
on the right hand, betweene the hill and the Lord
ROBERTS his Brigade. This Regiment his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
a while after commanded away, to the reliefe
of his owne Regiment, Colonell BARCLAYS, and
Colonell HOLBORNES Brigades, which had been
foure houres upon very hot Service. It fortuned
that this Regiment was no sooner brought on, but
they were overcharged with two great Bodies of
Horse and Foot so, that they were forced to retreat,
and lose that ground which the forenamed Forces had
gotten; which Colonell HOLBORNE perceiving,
with his Brigade gave the Enemy a <hi>Round Salvo,</hi> and
instantly his owne, and Colonell BARCLAYS Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades,
and the Generals Regiment againe advancing,
beat back the Enemy, regained the ground, and made
good the place all the day after.</p>
                  <p>The blew Auxiliary Regiment was commanded to
relieve and assist the Forlorne Hope, which had been
three or foure times in their turnes at the point. The
Fight all along the Valley (more then half a mile in
lenth) was continued as long as in any other part of
the Army, which was till ten a clock at night; about
which time the Enemy gave a good <hi>Round Salvo</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Colonell BARCLAY, and Colonell HOLBORNS
Posts. These things ordered, the Major Generall rode
up to the top of the hill, where he espyed an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to bestow eitht or nine Demi-Culvering shot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enemy; who out of an house pelted the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Gentlemen at neere distance. Then he rallyed
the two Train-Band Regiments into one Body, drew
them up, and placed them before, where the Traine
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96346:187"/>
of Artillery did afterwards draw up to the top of the
hill, and desired Major BOTELER to draw the Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
of his Regiment on the right hand before the
two Demy-Culverings that were placed at the end
of the Lane, on the top of the Hill; and the red
Auxiliaries he placed on the left hand of those Peeces,
which before were slenderly guarded. The Artillery
was well ordered that day, by the skill and care of
Sir JOHN MERRICK.</p>
                  <p>While this was acting, two Peeces which belonged
to the Major Generals Regiment, and one Drake of
Sir WILLIAM BROOKES, were by the Generals
Regiment, under the Command of Major BOTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER,
with the assistance of 200. Musketeers recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and the Enemy drew away from their Pikes
(which with their Colours kept standing, with many
great Bodies of Horse to guard them) five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Musketeers, besides Dragoones, to encompasse
our men on the right hand among the hedges; just
at which time his Excellency sent to have 300. Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers
of the Forlorne Hope, to go to the reliefe of
Colonell BARCLAY, and Colonell HOLBORNES
Souldiers. But then the Enemy falling on upon our
right hand, diverted them, who with other of our
Musketeers thereabouts, beat the Enemy off, who
else had done us great mischief. This was about foure
a clock in the afternoone, when all our whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Foot was ingaged in the Fight. But then he
also caused some of the red Auxiliary Regiment to
draw neerer to Colonell BARCLAYS Post, as he
himselfe required. At length night drew on, when
the Enemy, both Horse and Foot, stood in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on the further side of the Greene, where we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
their stay till next morning, and that they
were working (as was reported) to place their Canon,
to make use of them against us when day should
breake: Against which supposed encounter we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
our Souldiers before hand, and resolved by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96346:188"/>
Gods help the next day to force our way thorow
them or dye. But it pleased God to make our passage
without blows; for the Enemy was gone by night;
so that the next morning we marched quietly over
the same ground where the Battell was fought, and
where the Enemy stood; for on Thursday early, his
Excellency gave Command for the Armies March
towards <hi>Reading;</hi> to which purpose it was all drawne
up upon the Heath, where the Battell was fought;
and after that his Excellency had given order for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the dead, about ten a clock we began to march.
Colonell MIDDLETON, with his owne, and three
Regiments more (Lord GREY, SHEFFIELD, MEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRUM)
and 400. commanded Musketeers under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
BARCLAY, had the Reere-guard: During
which March, the Enemy at a great distance shot from
severall hedges, but troubled us not. When we came
to a long Heath, we drew up the whole Army seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
times, and no Enemy appeared. But at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of a narrow Lane toward the evening, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
fell upon us with 800. commanded Musketeers,
and most of their Horse, who caused our Horse then
in the Reare, to make a very disorderly and confused
retreat But when Colonell MIDDLETON, with the
rest of the Commanders in the Reare, hasted to charge
the Enemy with our Foot, he made them retreat with
as much confusion over the Heath, as they had us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
the losse not great on either side. Lieutenant
BROWNE was taken Prisoner.</p>
                  <p>After this, the same evening the Lord Generall
drew up the Army to <hi>Theale,</hi> and taking some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
there, marched the next morning, being
Fryday, with the whole Army to <hi>Reading;</hi> where he
stayed till the Sabbath was past, and gave publike
thanks for the great Victory.</p>
                  <p>This was a Victory not denyed to the Parliament,
nor at all disputed; although the Lord Generall <hi>Essex,</hi>
for want of Victuals, marched away to the necessary
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96346:188"/>
reliefe of his Army, and could not stay to pursue the
Victory which he had gotten. The number of slaine
in that Battell, were judged to be, by those who
speak most moderately, foure times as many of the
Kings Party as of the Parliaments; but others have
spoken of a farre greater difference Divers Captains,
as Captaine MASSY, and Captaine HUNT, with
others, were slaine on the Parliament side; but scarce
any of higher ranke. Three of the Nobility fell on
the Kings side, the Earle of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> the Lord
SPENCER (newly made by the King Earle of <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland</hi>)
and the Lord Viscount <hi>Fawlkland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Victory, the Lord Generall was received
at <hi>London</hi> with great joy and Honour. The Trayned
Bands and Auxiliaries of <hi>London</hi> marched home in full
Companies, and were welcomed by their friends;
and met by the Lord May or and Aldermen at Temple
Barre: And now the face of things seemed much to
change, and the reputation of the Parliament rise
higher.</p>
                  <p>At the time of this Expedition for reliefe of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
a Cessation of Arms was made by the King with
the Irish Rebels; of which, together with the great
Victories which small numbers of the English Forces
obtained over great multitudes of those Irish Rebels,
before the time of that Cessation (which was here omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as not to interupt the Relation of proceedings in
the English Warres) there may be a larger Discourse
in the continuation of this History; as also of the
Covenant which the Parliament, and that part of the
Nation which adhered to them, about this time entred
into with their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for maintenance
of the Religion, Lawes and Liberties of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
