            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they would be ſoon able to ſay, that 'twas by ſome other <hi>power</hi> (and not by that of <hi>declaring</hi>) that they undertook thus to judge and puniſh: and let me add that although the power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> were acknowledged only to be a <hi>civil power,</hi> yet might <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Church</hi> ſet up an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical power</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to that, and imitate that in the <hi>ſacred,</hi> which they uſed onely in <hi>civil</hi> judicatures, as anon we ſhall have occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.

the <hi>air,</hi> had been excellent effectuall <hi>Phyſick</hi> for him, and in all probability, might have made a ſhift to have changed his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing, which, ſaith he, caſt him on thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>32</label> againſt <hi>Excommunication,</hi> was the unſeaſonableneſſe of the time for the adminiſtring of ſuch <hi>purging Phyſick. There was then</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a great paucity of Proteſtant Profeſſors, and the number of Papiſts extremely overtopt them in thoſe parts; and of the Proteſtants ſcarce the thirtieth part underſtood, and approved the doctrine</hi>; and therefore it muſt be, in his opinion, a ſtrange improper ſeaſon for the ſetting up this courſe of ſevere ruggid diſcipline, which would <hi>exclude from the Sacrament ſo many of the few Proteſtants,</hi> that it would both unpeople their aſſemblies, and neceſſarily cauſe <hi>a dangerous ſciſſure in the multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing was his having obſerv'd <hi>the unfitneſſe of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>33</label> perſons, that were imploy'd and preſided in this matter</hi> (their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Lay-Elders) <hi>fit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither for age, nor experience, nor wit, nor judgement, nor manners, nor authority,</hi> to be eſteem'd <hi>able to ſuſtain ſo great an office with dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing (and that which advanced him in his conceit <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>34</label> that he had faln upon the right ſenſe of the Scriptures produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and pleaded for this diſcipline) was, the conſideration of the <hi>ſtate of the Commonwealth and Church among the Jews, God having ſaid,</hi> Deut. 4. <hi>that that people had Laws and Statutes ſo juſt and wiſe, that the inſtitutions of no Nations, the ſanctions of no Commonwealth, no Ordinances, though never ſo wiſely thought on, could compare with them,</hi> and therefore that that <hi>Church</hi> muſt needs be beſt, and moſt wiſely diſpoſed, which came neareſt to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> form. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration indeed, that it ſeems, was of great weight with him, not obſerving that that compariſon in <hi>Deut.</hi> was made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and other heathen nations of the world at that time, and only in relation to their preſent ſtate, and not to the prejudice of <hi>Chriſts</hi> inſtitutions after, when that nation and religion was deſtroyed; and that if that argument were of weight, (beſides that he muſt be bound to prove his Modell out of the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Law) he muſt be obliged alſo to bring back all the <hi>Sacrifices, Paſſeover, Circumciſion, Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> into the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and turn both the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>

               <p>The fourth thing, ſaith he, and that which ſet him on wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was, an accident that he then obſerved, <hi>An Engliſh man which at that time had quitted this Kingdome on the diſlike of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and came to Geneva, and propoſed his Theſis there</hi> de adiaphoris &amp; veſtibus, <hi>of things indifferent, and of veſtments</hi>; particularly, <hi>the Surplice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he was,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not permitted to maintain them publickly,</hi> ne Anglos offenderent, <hi>that they might not offend the Engliſh; This man therefore changing his purpoſe, choſe a new Theſis, In quavis rectè inſtitutâ Eccleſiâ hanc ſervari procurationem, in quâ miniſtri c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſake, that the phraſe [<hi>an removendus ſit?</hi>] may have a little ambiguity in it, for perhaps it may (though leſſe properly) be ſet to ſignifie this, <hi>Whether it be lawfull to remove ſuch an one?</hi> (for if it be but ſo, then he that pretends to write againſt <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and to pretend it <hi>unlawfull,</hi> will be ſufficiently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and then I anſwer, that for any but for the <hi>Governor</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to whom the cognizance of his ill life belongs, and who hath had a legal cognizance of it, and proceeded legally by the ſeverall degrees of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> proceſſe againſt him, it is not lawfull: but for the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Praefect,</hi> or lawfull <hi>Governour</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to that power which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave his <hi>Apoſtles with the Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> it is lawfull, and by the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of [<hi>Ego dabo</hi>] and afterwards [<hi>ego mitto</hi>] they are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized to do this: and upon this iſſue, if this be it, we will joyn moſt willingly.

the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> then preſent ſhould be themſelves excluded.

               <p>Theſe are excellent profitable ſubjects, in which I deſire the Reader will ſatisfie himſelf out of thoſe <hi>judicious Collections</hi> of that very <hi>learned unhappy man.</hi> And if it be now demanded of me, whether <hi>private abſolution</hi> be not contained under the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe places?

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58619:69"/>
but requireth farther comfort or counſel, then let him come to me,</hi> (i. e. his lawful Paſtor) <hi>or ſome other diſcreet and learned Miniſter of Gods Word, and open his grief, that he may receive ſuch ghoſtly counſel, advice, and comfort, as his conſcience may be relieved, and that by the miniſtery of Gods Word he may receive comfort, and the benefit of abſolution, to the quieting of his conſcience, and avoiding all ſcruple and doubtfulneſſe.</hi> All which being an exhortation of the <hi>Church</hi> belonging to a particular caſe, [<hi>when a man by the uſe of all helps which are within his own reach, cannot attain to quiet of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or be ſatisfied that he is fit to receive the holy Communion</hi>;] as they do imply that thoſe foreſaid <hi>meanes</hi> may happily ſerve the turn, without opening his caſe to the Miniſter, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without receiving <hi>abſolution</hi>; ſo are they a <hi>fervent exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to all, in caſe thoſe means prove not ſucceſsfull, to ſeek out, &amp; make uſe of thoſe auxiliaries, which whoſoever in that caſe ſhall neglect, will be guilty of great unkindneſs to his own ſoul, and may well be thought to have betray'd it to great and needleſſe danger. And it is worthy our noting from hence, that receiving of <hi>comfort,</hi> &amp; the <hi>benefit of abſolution</hi> are by our Church here conjoyned, to ſignifie this abſolution to be beneficial to him that once <hi>wanted comfort,</hi> as a meanes of confirming that <hi>comfort</hi> which the Miniſter had now given him. To which end certainly 'tis very proper &amp; ſeaſonable: for when a diſcreet &amp; learned Miniſter, having had the ſurvey of my ſoul, (the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of my <hi>offence</hi> firſt, &amp; then of my <hi>repentance</hi>) ſhall from the word of God give me aſſurance, that (if I am what to him I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be) my eſtate is good, &amp; thereupon <hi>pronounce</hi> me <hi>abſolved,</hi> as a true penitent, from all my ſins; This will, 1. ſeal me a right of Gods promiſe of <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> in heaven, as it were <hi>ſolemnly</hi> and in the Court; and 2. extremely <hi>quiet me,</hi> and confirm to me that comfort, <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>comfortable opinion</hi> of my good eſtate, and hope of my future happineſs, which he had given me, when I ſee him who hath no reaſon to be partial to me, and whom I cannot ſuſpect of <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>paſſion</hi> in this particular, (both which perhaps I may upon enquiry diſcern in my ſelf) and beſide, who is ſet over me by Chriſt to this purpoſe, <hi>pronounce</hi> ſo clear a <hi>ſentence</hi> of me, and that (as the precedent words are) <hi>by the miniſtery of Gods word,</hi> i. by applying peculiar parts of that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58619:69"/>
infallible truth to the preſent condition of my ſoul, and from thence <hi>pronouncing my abſolution.</hi> And that this is the meaning of the <hi>abſolution</hi> there, it is evident by that which is the ſecond thing, which I thought worthy our obſerving from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> what is added in concluſion, as the ultimate <hi>end</hi> of that <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>abſolution, the quieting of conſcience, and avoiding of all ſcruple and doubtfulneſſe</hi>; which whether they be diſtinct, ſo that the <hi>quieting of conſcience</hi> may be the <hi>completion</hi> of the <hi>comfort,</hi> and the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all <hi>ſcruple</hi> and <hi>doubtfulneſſe,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> intended in, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>abſolution,</hi> or whether both together <hi>indiſcretè</hi> belong to both together, the product will be ſtill the ſame, that in caſe a man be not able to ſatisfie his own <hi>ſcruples</hi> and <hi>doubts</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, the Presbyter wil be able to ſtand him in good ſtead, by the <hi>Word of God</hi> applied to his caſe to <hi>give comfort,</hi> and by <hi>pronouncing abſolution</hi> to him to ſeal that <hi>comfort,</hi> and perſwade him to a greater <hi>confirmation</hi> of mind, that that comfort is not <hi>groundleſſe,</hi> and ſo take away <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>ſcruples</hi> concerning that matter which before moleſted him, and made him unfit for the <hi>Communion,</hi> which was the only occaſion of the <hi>exhortation.</hi>

Onely it may be objected, that that <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> was peculiar to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, and is not now in uſe, and conſequently that a great <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of Eccleſiaſtical cenſures is now loſt, and ſo now <hi>the weapons of our warfare</hi> may be <hi>carnal,</hi> our <hi>cenſures</hi> unſufficient to perform their task, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>impenitents,</hi> though theirs were not. To which I anſwer, by confeſſing the objection, that indeed it is ſo; and very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it ſhould, Chriſtian Princes having now taken the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church into their hands, and ſo thoſe keen wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in the ſpiritual hand not ſo neceſſary; as you know the <hi>Manna</hi> ceaſed to be rain'd from heaven, when the people were come into the <hi>promiſed land, flowing</hi> with <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>honey.</hi> Onely I ſhall then reply, that therefore it is more then fit, that ſome means ſhould be uſed, in caſe of any diſcernable defect, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe by way of ſupply, and adde the more then moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive power of ſome other fit engine beſide that of the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> eſpecially in caſes of enormous, infamous crimes, which may be done by the <hi>Secular arm,</hi> in ſuch caſes (when the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical cenſures</hi> perſwade not) the impreſſion of inflicting penalties, ſevere enough, as may be found expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, <hi>uſque ad reformationem,</hi> untill they make themſelves capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (by teſtimonies of amendment) to receive releaſe both from God and man; that ſo by that means, as <hi>God</hi> ſupplyed the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58619:84"/>
want of <hi>humane</hi> aid, by his extraordinary from heaven; and when the <hi>Secular Magiſtrates</hi> diſcharged not their duty, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the power given them to the purging of the <hi>Church</hi> from rotten, vicious, prophane, incorrigible members, <hi>God</hi> gave this power to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of inflicting <hi>diſeaſes</hi> on <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi>; ſo now that <hi>extraordinary</hi> power being withdrawn from the <hi>Church,</hi> the Magiſtrate ſhould think himſelf moſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>obliged</hi> to perform his <hi>duty,</hi> for which if it ſhould be required, that we produce the expreſſe commands or directions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or Primitive preſidents; I anſwer, That will be unjuſt to require of us, 1. Becauſe in <hi>Scripture times,</hi> there were other means to ſupply that want, the Devils corporal inflictions on them that were delivered to him, and ſo any other might be ſpared: 2. Becauſe this duty naturally belongs to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> who alone hath ordinarily <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>compulſive juriſdiction,</hi> which as it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Kings</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſo was it not interdicted by Chriſt in the <hi>New,</hi> but all left in that matter by him as he found it; which being granted, it may be ſaid, that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the Apoſtles give no directions for this, ſo they <hi>needed</hi> not to give any. 3. Becauſe both then, and in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, the Secular power was not Chriſtian, and therefore the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance could not be expected from them, which now moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably may, to awake, and <hi>hazen,</hi> and drive thoſe that will not be allured and drawn, that ſo even in this world, there may be no <hi>peace, quiet reſt, tranquility</hi>; or <hi>ſecurity to the wicked.</hi>
