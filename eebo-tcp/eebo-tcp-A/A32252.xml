            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y moſt worthy Fellows and Companions of this noble and renowned Society, the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs of my puiſne time is run, and I am now come to take poſſeſſion of your Readers place; wherein I muſt hazard to your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the fortunes of my inability: Theſe Twenty and ſix years compleat I have had continuance here, and in that time I have only taken the meaſure and length of your Hall: And herein I acknowledge <hi>Grayes-Inn</hi> to be the Patron of my beſt fortunes, and your ſelves the beſt Companions of my forepaſt and preſent life. I made a queſtion, when it came to my turn to reade, Whether I ſhould turn therefrom or not, being then troubled about Two things, <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> both which I put into a pair of Scales, wherein I thought <hi>Charge</hi> weighed heavy and ſolid (for <hi>ibi ponebantur ſolidi) Care</hi> notwithſtanding had his equal weight with the other, and poiſed the Scales even: Yet I conſidered the ſmall Subſtance I had got came by my Profeſſion, I therefore took my ſelf both in Credit and Conſcience bound to undertake this burthenſome place, for the maintenance and preſervation of the honor of this houſe; and with that I put <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> in one Scale, and <hi>Reſolution</hi> in the other, which ſcaled them both up. Twenty years likewiſe of my laſt paſt time, I have in the practiſe of my Profeſſion ſpent, but, I hope, little conſumed thereof; In which time I lanched forth my Ship <hi>(In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundum maris)</hi> for a Voyage to the Sea, and now ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to your Shores, furniſh'd and balliſt with Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40438:6"/>
of ſeveral eſtimates: By my Ship I mean my Statute which I read on, which be the Laws of Sewers; the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize be the weighty matters therein contained: By the Governors and Rulers of this Ship, I mean the grave and prudent Commiſſioners who are put in charge and truſt with the execution of theſe Laws: By the Mariners, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Officers of this Law; the Merchants place I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve unto my ſelf: The Wares brought home be of divers ſorts, ſome only fit for the Imperial Majeſty of a King, and theſe be Royal Prerogatives, ſhewing forth their ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor like the <hi>Flower de Lice</hi> in the Crown; others belong to high Nobility, and ſome be uſeful for the homely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty; the reſt which ſhall remain, I have caſt under Hatches for my laſt days Mart, when I mean to make chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on them all. But though I ſeem to make theſe Markets of my Legal Merchandize, yet I do not mean to ſet ſuch Rates upon them as Merchants uſe to do, which be all for <hi>(utile dulce)</hi> for I only ſet one price upon all, which is your kinde acceptance. Marvel not, I pray you, at theſe my Sea-like ſalutations, for this day I am become god <hi>Neptunes</hi> Orator, and I mean to diſplay the power of his Empire; for my Statute, my Caſes, and my Argument, will all depend upon the Element of Water, over which, as Poets feign, <hi>Neptune</hi> hath chief predominance. Well, now my Ship is at ſhore, and I have caſt Anchor there, and to my great comfort I ſee many Chapmen attending the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and therefore now preſently I will unlock, and ſet open the cloſet of my Store, which be contained in the fair Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of the Law, and eſpecially in that Law made and Enacted in the Parliament held in the 23. year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. Chapt. 5. which is <hi>A general Act concerning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners of Sewers for all the Realm of</hi> England.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>The cauſes wherefore I made choice to read upon this Law, be five in number; <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, For the Antiquity of theſe Laws of Sewers,  though this Statute bear date but 23. <hi>Henry</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, For the Largity and extent thereof, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40438:6"/>
appears in the ſtile of this Statute, and there termed, <hi>A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Act for all the Realm of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, For the neceſſary uſe thereof, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al  practiſe and daily experience teacheth us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I have had a more deſire to read upon theſe  Laws, becauſe never any Reader did heretofore under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſame; and upon peruſal of this Statute, and upon due conſideration taken of others, I thought I could not make my choice of a more fitting, and more neceſſary Law, nor more profitable for my Native Countrey of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and other Maritine places of this Kingdom, then this is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And Fifthly, His Majeſties general care, which theſe  Laws require at His hands, and his ſpecial care, by the which His Highneſs of late hath taken theſe Laws into His gracious and provident protection.</p>
               <p>And upon due conſideration taken of all theſe Caſes, I reſolved to proceed in the Expoſition of this Statute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perpetual by the Statute of 3. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>And to ſpeak ſomething of the three firſt cauſes, I am of <note place="margin">Antiquity of theſe Laws.</note> Opinion for the Reaſons and Authorities enſuing, That the Laws of Sewers have been and be of great Antiquity, and have told over as much time and as many years as any other Laws of this Realm have done: For as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> 
                  <hi>Britannia</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quod inſula Britannia avida in mare omni ex parte ſe projecit;</hi> Therefore this Realm adjoyning on every ſide upon the Sea, could not be ſafe without thoſe provident Laws made and uſed for the defence thereof.</p>
               <p>And although it is ſaid in Scripture, That Almighty God <note place="margin">In <hi>Manaſſes</hi> Prayer King of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </note> hath bound the Seas by the word of his Commandment, and had ſhut up the Deep, and ſealed it with his terrible and glorious Name; yet God, who beſtowed wiſedom on man, it was his pleaſure he ſhould providently uſe it over the reſt of the Creatures, not giving way that he ſhould be remiſs or preſumptuous in any thing, which by his foreſight or judgement might be prevented, helped and relieved.</p>
               <p>It is true, that at the Flood, <hi>Cum cateracta Coeli fuerint</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Geneſis cap. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40438:7"/>
                  <hi>operta,</hi> when the windows of Heaven were by Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate will ſet open, and that the Seas did <hi>Suum excedere modum,</hi> no power of mans hand could ſtay the ſwallowing and devouring ſurges of the Seas and Waters; yet then notwithſtanding had God appointed that his Servant <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, and ſuch Creatures as he appointed, ſhould be preſerved by the Ark, which was a work of their own hands; Therefore the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have appointed man to make proviſion for the neceſſary defence and ſafety of himſelf and of his Countrey; And the Laws of this Realm, moſt of which have received their <hi>primam eſſentiam</hi> from the Divine Laws of the Almighty, and have fetched their Pedigree from the Law of Nature, have a <hi>principio bene</hi> ſo predominant in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> that they have never been wanting at any time, to provide for the ſafety thereof.</p>
               <p>And if the Regiſter be ſo ancient a Book as Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in one of his Epiſtles hath there declared it to be, then it may give ſatisfaction in this kinde, that theſe Laws of Sewers were in theſe times of great iminency and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; For there I finde two ſeveral Writs or Commiſſions of that nature, The one authorizing certain perſons to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the defences in the parts of <hi>Holland</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> The other for the viewing and ſurveying of the <note place="margin">Regiſter in <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner.</hi>
                  </note> ſurrounded grounds lying between the two Rivers <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Auckholin</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> And the firſt of the ſaid Commiſſions is ſet down <hi>verbatim</hi> in <hi>Fitz. nat. bre. fo.</hi> 113. Yet the firſt Statute which appears to us <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fitz. Nat. bre.</hi> fol. 113.</note> in Print, wherein the frame of a Commiſſion of Sewers is ſet down, is the Statute of 6. <hi>Henry</hi> 6. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 5. Yet I make no queſtion but the ſaid Commiſſions expreſſed in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, <note place="margin">6. <hi>H.</hi> 6. cap. 5.</note> and <hi>Fitz. na. bre.</hi> were in their forms long before <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. time; and that the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. addes ſome more power and ſtrength thereto then was before, having backt them with the power of the Parliament; and it is ſomething additional in matter, as it was in power, as by both the Commiſſions compared together is apparent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40438:7"/>
I do likewiſe finde in the 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Lib. Aſſ. plac.</hi> 15. That <note place="margin">38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. lib. Aſſ. pl. 15.</note> a Commiſſion was awarded to inquire of Bridges, and of the repairs thereof, which is a branch of theſe Laws: And Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his 10. <hi>Report</hi> in the Caſe of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> ſaith, That the Kings of this Realm, before the making of any Statute of Sewers, might grant Commiſſions for the ſurveying and repairing of Walls, Banks and Rivers, and other defences. And of the ſame opinion is the books of Sir <hi>John Davies</hi> in his <hi>Iriſh Reports,</hi> in the Caſe of the Royal Piſchary of the <hi>Banne.</hi> And Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> hath in <note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Davies</hi> Reports.</note> his firſt Caſe ſet the firſt Statute of Sewers to be in time the 9. <hi>H.</hi> 3. which is in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> the firſt volumn of of Statutes, and the moſt ancient that be extant in our <note place="margin">9. <hi>H.</hi> 3.</note> Laws.</p>
               <p>By all which is manifeſt, that theſe Laws have been received into the government of this Realm, in time as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as any other were; And I am the rather herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, for that in the ancient Commiſſion expreſſed in the Regiſter aforeſaid, there be theſe words, That the King <hi>Ratione dignitatis ſuae regiae ad providendum ſalvationi regni ſui circumqua<expan>
                        <am>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> fuit aſtrictus:</hi> Wherein it is hereby made plain, That the King by the Tenure and Prerogative of His Crown, was bound to ſee and foreſee the ſafety of this Realm; and ſo this Law is a Prerogative Law, and ſeems to be as ancient as any Laws of this Realm, and all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives be without limitations of time; Neither can it be preſumed, that all or any Kings till the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. were ſo improvident as to want theſe Laws, without the which the Realm could not be defended from the violence of that unmerciful enemy the Sea; wherein I do conclude, That theſe Laws of Sewers be as ancient as any other Laws of this Kingdom be.</p>

               <head>The extent of this Law.</head>
               <p>For the extent of this Law, the Title of this Statute ſhews it, <hi>viz, A general Act for granting Commiſsions of Sewers within the Realm,</hi> without any word of Reſtraint, other then theſe <hi>(where need ſhould require)</hi> And although
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40438:8"/>
Expounders of the Laws be not tied to make the Title their Text, either for the body or the bounds of it, yet it may ſerve to give ſome direction in the Expoſition thereof: But to make the Title to be the ground in the material Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, may lead the Expoſitor many times into error: For in <hi>Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgans</hi> Caſe in <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgan.</hi>
                  </note> Title of the Statute was, <hi>For the true anſwering for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the King,</hi> and the words in the body did extend the ſame to the Receivers of Subjects; but there the Judges and Expounders of that Law went with the Title in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made in 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Title of the Statute was <hi>For Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">23. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Conſtitutions for the Navy;</hi> and in that Statute there was a new Fiſh day provided, which no man would have looked for under ſuch a Title.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Lucian</hi> an ancient Greek Poet compiled a Book, and in the Frontiſpiece thereof Intituled the ſame <hi>A Book of True Reports;</hi> where looking into it, there was not any thing true therein: So it appears though in Acts and Books the Titles and Stiles may give help in the Expoſition, and may ſerve as an Index or Table to finde out the matter, yet it is not fit to relye upon them, but that they may be uſed or refuſed as occaſion ſhall ſerve.</p>
               <p>Howſoever there is better concord betwixt the Title and the Body of my Statute, for the corps of the Act perform as much as the Title promiſed, whereby the Inland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Notingham, Northampton, Huntington, Bedford</hi> and the like, may have the uſe of this Statute as well as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine Countreys of <hi>Lincoln, York, Cambridge, Norfolk, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Kent, Suſſex, Hampſhire, Devon, Cornwal, Gloceſter, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> if not in all, yet in part, as hereafter I ſhall make it appear in my ſecond Lecture upon this Law.</p>
               <p>And although both the Statute of 6. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, and <hi>Fitz. Nat. Brev.</hi> make all of them mention in thoſe Commiſſions of the County of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and of no other County, yet doubtleſs the Lawmakers and Judges of this Realm, and the Expoſitors did intend then, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them to all the Parts and Counties of the Realm.

And yet I take it, that the firſt Original and the chief uſe of theſe Laws, was in the ſaid Maritine Countreys, which ſtood in moſt need thereof, and eſpecially <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where be the huge great and vaſt Fens and Mariſhes: But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they may ſerve generally for all the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as the extent of this Statute I read on hath bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
               <p>So herein my concluſion is, That the extent of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is as large as the Realm of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The neceſſary uſe of it.</head>
               <p>From the Title I am now come to the Preamble of this Statute, where the words be very ſolid and weighty; that is, <hi>That the King nothing earthly ſo highly weighing as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the common Profit, Wealth and Commodity of this Realm:</hi> By the which it may appear, That the making of this Law was of all other thought to be moſt neceſſary, and of greateſt conſequence, when the King preferred the ſame before any earthly thing: And the Kings care herein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Royal Perſon very worthily, becauſe by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Safety was brought to the Realm, and Wealth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the People thereof; greater and better fruits then which, no humane Law can produce: And the chief exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Law was moſt aptly left to the King, <hi>Ratione regiae dignitatis ſuae,</hi> whoſe Office doth, as the Philoſopher truly ſaith, contain in it great Vertue, high Underſtanding, and Divine Wiſedom, to whoſe high Government, as well our Perſons as our Laws be committed, and the defence thereof is applied to his grave foreſight.</p>
               <p>And truly I have taken upon me to reade on thoſe Laws of Sewers, as Mr. <hi>Marrow</hi> did in former times take upon him to Expound in his reading the Laws of the Juſtices of Peace, hoping this work of mine may prove as acceptable to the Commiſſioners of Sewers, as that of his was bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the Juſtices of Peace; the uſe whereof being no leſs commodious to the Commonwealth then that of the Peace, being both general Laws of great uſe and eſteem, and my ſelf being for many years paſt a Commiſſioner in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40438:9"/>
County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> I found that theſe Laws were dark and intricate, and came not uſually within the reach and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſuch as were not well ſeen and ſtudied in the Laws.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I found the uſe of them to be wondrous neceſſary, I did intend, when occaſion ſerved me, to break the Ice, and enter ſeriouſly into the Expoſition of them. And therefore ſeeing theſe Laws being in time moſt ancient, in extent moſt large, and for the uſe moſt neceſſary, I have, with your kinde favor, made choiſe of them to frame my Reading upon; wherein, if upon your peruſal you finde any ſcapes or errors, which may ſoon fall from Opinion, <hi>haec amice corrige,</hi> and ſuch of them as you ſhall beſtow your liking upon, <hi>hiis utere mecum;</hi> and this ſhall ſuffice touching my choiſe made of this Statute.</p>
               <p>And as I have formerly declared and delivered the cauſes which ſtirred me up, and the reaſons which confirmed me to read upon this Statute; Now I do intend to break it up, and I do divide it into theſe ſeveral branches or parts:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, to make proviſion to reſiſt the over flowing of the  Sea upon the large Marſh grounds lying in the Maritine Countreys, which commonly be the ſureſt for ſoundneſs, the greateſt for compaſs, and the beſt for profit of all the Sheep-walks and Commons of this Realm, which take prejudice and loſs only by the rage of the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to provide alſo that the great freſh Rivers and Streams may have their paſſages made clear, and that their  Walls, Banks and other Defences be repaired, kept and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, whereby the fair, delightful, pleaſant and fruitful Meadows and Paſture grounds which lie in the greateſt abundance upon or near the Rivers, Brooks and Streams may be preſerved from the inundation of freſh Waters, which many times annoy them, to the great and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damage of His Majeſties Subjects, which be Owners and Farmers thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, whereas Navigation, both for the Exporting of our Homebred Commodities, and for the Importing of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40438:9"/>
Foraign Merchandizes is the chief inriching of this Nation, therefore Ports, Havens, Rivers, and other Navigable Streams and their dependencies, be put within the defence of this Law, being <hi>Oſtia &amp; janua Regni,</hi> for that by the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of theſe the wealth of the Realm is increaſed, and the Inland Cities, Boroughs and Towns are made partakers with eaſe and ſmall coſt of the Seas Commodities.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, likewiſe this Law giveth redreſs and remedy  for the removing of ſuch lets and impediments as are either hinderances to Navigation, or ſtops whereby the abundant Waters cannot have their free paſſage to the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And fifthly, becauſe in the ſurrounded grounds there be  moſt commonly the greateſt uſe of Bridges, Calceys, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and Ways, therefore this Statute hath taken order for them alſo, whereby his Majeſties people may in thoſe places for their perſons and their goods have both <hi>Salvum &amp; ſecurum conductum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe five parts be all the whole materials of this great and worthy Law contained; and therefore according to the ſaid diviſion I have framed a Caſe for the firſt Lecture upon this Law.</p>

               <p>My Opinion is, That the King hath a part, the Prince a part, and the Subject a part of this ground; and that it is all within this Statute, but no part thereof within this Commiſſion.</p>

               <p>And as it comes to my turn, I intend to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Caſe: And firſt of the firſt Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> is one of the moſt ancient approved
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40438:10"/>
Ceremonies of the Law which hath been uſed for convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lands; and the Law hath a more reſpect thereto then to any other: And it cannot be denied, but that it is the moſt perfect form of any, by the which the Freehold and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Lands is transferred from one to another, and all Subjects may give and take Lands by this Ceremony; but the King only is excepted, whoſe Prerogative is ſuch, That as Lands cannot be taken from him, as King, but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; ſo Lands cannot be given or granted to him, as King, but by Record: And in the ſame degree is a County Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine in his County, becauſe he hath there <hi>Jura Regalis:</hi> And this <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> may be actually and really done and performed, or elſe it may be done within the view of the Lands intended to be conveyed.</p>
               <p>And as touching <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> to be actually effected if the Feoffment contain Lands in two ſeveral Counties, and <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> be made in one County in name of both, this will not paſs the Lands in another county, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Land paſſeth by the Livery, which is local, and not by the Deed.</p>
               <p>But in an exchange of Land in two ſeveral Counties by Deed, the ſame is good, for there the Land paſſeth by the Deed.</p>
               <p>But if one make a Feoffment of a Mannor lying in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſn in the County of <hi>L.</hi> and in ſervices in the County of <hi>M.</hi> theſe ſervices, and ſo Rents, will paſs by attornment of the Tenants, though they lye in a foraign County; and ſo of an Advowſon appendant, and ſuch like, becauſe thoſe rents and ſervices paſs not by the local ceremony of <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Seiſin,</hi> but by the ceremony of Attornment, which is perſonal, and depends upon the perſon which is tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; wherein I take this difference, That if a Feoffment be made of a Mannor by Parol, the Advowſon appendant, Villains Regardant, and Rents and Services by Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tenants, will not paſs to the Feoffee, till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſns and Lands be firſt conveyd.</p>
               <p>But if the Feoffment be by Deed, then the Rents and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40438:11"/>
will paſs by Attornment of the Tenants, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Deeds, before <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> be made to paſs the demeſns.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing that Land in one County will not paſs by Feoffment, by expreſs Livery made in an other County; if then the ſame may be paſſed and conveyed by Livery within the view, is the queſtion of our Caſe: And in my opinion they may, becauſe it is a ceremony performed by the eye, which is a member or inſtrument which hath his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by aſpect, <hi>Tam procùl quam propè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But expreſs <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin,</hi> which is done by the hand, cannot in reaſon be extended to another place then where the body is: And although the eye be fixed in the head, annexed to the body, yet like the Sun, his beams are carried afar of.</p>
               <p>And this Livery by the view, is not a Livery in the County where the body is, but properly in the County where the Land lay, which was the object of the eye; and in this caſe it is ſaid to be Livery onely, and not <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Seiſin,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Seiſin</hi> is properly when the party enters, and the entry of the party is that which perfects the work, which is in <hi>proprio commitatu.</hi> And for authority in the point, 28. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fo.</hi> 11. there is a Caſe according to my opinion, where the Husband at the Church door, when <note place="margin">18. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>fo.</hi> 11.</note> he was to take one to wife, he made a Deed of Feoffment of Lands lying in another County to the ſaid woman, and then delivered the Deed to her, and ſhewed her the Land, then they married, and he entred in claiming to her uſe; and theſe Lands were thereby well conveyed to the ſaid wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by this Livery within the veiw, in another County.</p>
               <p>Now it is fit to be declared, what view is ſufficient, for there be two maner of views, The one general, the other ſpecial: In the ſpecial view, every particular piece of ground is to be ſeen; but in the general view it ſufficeth to take notice of the grounds by the place they lie in: and in my opinion. The general view in my Caſe will ſuffice. For if one make a Feoffment in Fee of a whole Iſland, or of a whole Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40438:11"/>
or Town, and make Livery thereof within the view, this is good; and yet it is not poſſible to view every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar piece of ground at once, for Trees, Houſes and Hills might ſo be interpoſed, that the view could not be taken of ſome part thereof, yet notwithſtanding veiw of the reſt will paſs.</p>
               <p>Alſo if Lands be covered with Water, Ice or Snow, theſe will paſs well in a Feoffment or Livery in the veiw.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Brook Title View plac.</hi> 101. the Caſe there may give <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brook</hi> 101.</note> the rule to our Caſe; for there it is ſaid in a Writ of view, It is not neceſſary that all particulars in <hi>Specie</hi> ſhould be put in view, but to ſee the fields where the grounds lie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly it will ſuffice, and is a good and perfect veiw.</p>

               <p>And there be ſome perſons which can neither give nor take by Livery within the view, and that is where the Feoffor or Feoffee is blinde: So a Major and Commonalty, Dean
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40438:12"/>
and Chapter, or other corporate and politique capacities cannot give or take within the view. Some have held a difference, that a Parſon of a Church might not take by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very within the view to him and his Succeſſors, becauſe that came to him in his politique capacity, which had no Eyes; but if he were ſeized in the right of his Church, that he might infeoff <hi>I. S.</hi> thereof by Livery within the view, becauſe this was a wrong to the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">A Conceit.</note> was in the power of his natural capacity, which had Eyes.</p>
               <p>But the main Point in my Caſe is, Whether Livery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the view may be given and taken by Attorneys; and whether the view is ſo incident to the perſon, that it cannot be imparted to another.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the perſonal view cannot be lent to another, or divided from the perſon, no more can the perſonal touch or act of my hand be imparted to another; and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Livery, which is the deed and act of the hand, may be done <hi>per auter maine.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Englefields</hi> Caſe in the ſeventh <hi>Report</hi> of Sir <note place="margin">7. Reports. <hi>Englefields</hi> Caſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> gives us a pretty difference, where the act to be done is unſeparably tied to ones perſon, and where not; as in the Caſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of divers Mannors to <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> his Son, there was a Proviſo, That the Duke might revoke the ſame upon ſignifying of his minde under his own proper hand in writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This power of Revocation was not transferred to the Queen by the Attainder of the Duke, becauſe it was inſeparably tied to his own proper hand: But the principal Caſe there of <hi>Englefield,</hi> where the <note place="margin">Canc. in <hi>Combs</hi> Caſe.</note> Lands were ſetled upon his Kinſman, with power, That upon tender of a Ring by him he might revoke the uſes, and this was forfeit by his attainder, and the Queen by a Letter of Attorney made to two, did tender the Ring; for this was not preciſely or literally tied to <hi>Englefields</hi> perſon, no more then payment of Money, or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>And ſo in our Caſe, though by the Law I take it that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40438:12"/>
Livery within the view muſt be in the view of both the parties, yet this may be done by Attorneys; for as my own hand is not preciſely tied by the Law to an expreſs Livery, no more is my own eye expreſly tied to this view.</p>
               <p>And we ſee in views in an Aſſize, the under Sheriff, or <note place="margin">36. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dier.</hi>
                  </note> the Sheriffs Bailiffs, by his direction, may make the view; and yet the Writ is direct to the Sheriff to do the ſame; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Morſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningtons</hi> Caſe.</note> and in thoſe Caſes an intellectual view will ſerve, as if the Jurors know the Land; but ſuch an intellectual view will not ſerve in a Feoffment, but there the view muſt be actual.</p>
               <p>Yet I take this difference, that if a Letter of Attorney be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>A. B.</hi> to make <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin,</hi> he cannot do the ſame within the view, for therein he doth not purſue his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; but if the Letter of Attorney be ſpecial, to give or take Livery within the view, I am of Opinion, then the Livery may in ſuch a Caſe be given and taken by Attorneys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the view, as well as in <hi>Combes</hi> Caſe in Sir <hi>Edwards Cooks</hi> 9. <hi>Report,</hi> where it is affirmed that a ſurrender of a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold may be given and taken by Attorneys, which is as perſonal as this is in the taking part, becauſe Fealty ought to be made.</p>
               <p>Some things may in this Caſe be further aleaged in this third point, which I now have in hand, that is, Who muſt make the Letter of Attorney on the Feoffees part, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Leſſee for years, or he in the remainder, or both of them: For Leſſee for years, it is to be noted, that his Eſtate hath not any perfection thereby, and he ſeems himſelf but a Deputy, and if ſo, then a Deputy cannot make a Deputy; but yet he is not meerly a Deputy, for if there be two Leſſees, the Remainder in Fee to <hi>I. S.</hi> one of the Leſſees may take the <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin;</hi> yet if a letter of Attorney be made to two joyntly, one of them cannot take it; and if in our Caſe the Leſſee had dyed before entry, the Livery might have been made to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors, and powers and authorities cannot be apportioned and come to Executors in ſuch maner; <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is more

then a power of a Letter of Attorney for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and for theſe inſuing: For the Leſſee for years cannot be prohibited from taking his Livery by the Leſſor, but a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Attorney may be countermanded; yet the Leſſee alone cannot make this Letter of Attorney, neither can he in the remainder make the ſame, becauſe he could not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accept of the preſent Livery, neither can he meddle with the preſent poſſeſſion which a <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Sciſin</hi> yields.</p>

               <p>Therefore my concluſion is, that they ſhall joyn in this Letter of Attorney; and hereby I ſuppoſe I have conveyed a good Eſtate in the maner to <hi>I.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40438:14"/>
the ſame words; which is a ſtrong proof that the Sea is <hi>infra Regnum Angliae,</hi> and that the King Governs there by his Common Laws of <hi>England;</hi> for that preſcription is a main and material point of the Common Law: And the like is alleaged in Sir <hi>Henry Conſtables</hi> Caſe by way of Cuſtome in the Citizens, as of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to have <hi>Flotſan</hi> on the Seas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the high water and the low water marks.</p>
               <p>So I take it I have proved the King full Lord and owner of the Seas, and that the Seas be within the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that I have alſo proved it by Ancient Books and Authorities of the Laws, and by Charters, Statutes, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and Preſcriptions, that the Government therein is by the Common Laws of this Realm.</p>

                     <hi>Lacies</hi> Caſe.</note> and that is <hi>Lacyes</hi> Caſe, where one was ſtricken on the Seas, and dyed on the Land, that the Common Law could not try this murther: It is true, becauſe that tryal was to be by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which muſt come out of a proper county, which could not in this caſe, becauſe the Sea was not within county ground, and ſo no Jury could be ſummoned there.</p>
               <p>And I acknowledge that the King ruleth on the Sea by the Laws Imperial, as by the Roll of <hi>Oleron</hi> and other; but that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Le Roll de Oleron.</hi>
                  </note> is only in the particular Caſe of Shipping, and for Merchants and Mariners: But the King hath neither the properties of the Sea, nor the real and perſonal profits there ariſing, but by the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and in proof thereof the Book 15. and 16. <hi>Eliz. in Dyer,</hi> where the grounds gained from the Sea pertained to the Queen, which muſt <note place="margin">15. 16. <hi>Eliz.

                  </note> needs be by the Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> for no Law gives the King any ſoil but only the Common Laws of <hi>England;</hi> ſo this is ſufficient proof for the real profits, and for the perſonal profit the Charter of the Admiralty and other Caſes aforeſaid make it manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And there is a Statute made in 1. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Chapt.</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains <note place="margin">1 R. 2. <hi>Raſt.</hi> Admiralty.</note> the Admiral that he do not meddle with any thing done within the Realm but on the Seas; by which it may be collected, that the Seas be not within the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>

But in my opinion the intent of that Statute did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther limit the Admiral how far he ſhould extend his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, then any way to ſet forth the bounds of this Realm: wherein my concluſion herein is, That my Statute hath his extent within all the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> and that Engliſh Seas being within the Realm, be within the bounds of my ſaid Statute of Sewers, and that Statute Law is in full power on the Seas, as by the Caſes and Statutes mentioned former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth appear.</p>

               <p>But whether the Laws of this Realm be of force in the ſaid new ſprung up Sea Iſlands, or not, is a queſtion: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe, and in the Caſe of the Taniſtry in the <hi>Iriſh Reports,</hi> That if the King conquer an Iſland or Nation, the ſame is no part of <hi>England,</hi> nor the Laws of <hi>England</hi> there in force, till the King ſhall ſo declare the ſame, but the own proper Laws ſeem to be in force there; but if the King conquer a Nation from an Infidel, there the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Laws of that Nation upon the conqueſt are extinct; but the Law is not ſo of another Chriſtian Region, as <hi>Callis,</hi>

clear that a general Law unſtinted and unbounded ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>Wales</hi> as well as to <hi>England;</hi> but our Law grants Commiſſions within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely preſcribes it to bounds, and it may ſeem that the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament took it ſo in 1. <hi>Mar.

               <p>Now occaſion and time gives me fit opportunity to treat of Grounds which be newly gained from the Seas. If as I have formerly declared, the Grounds be the Kings when they be covered with Waters, it muſt needs be held an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground, that they be alſo the Kings when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have left them dry; and when the Waters had their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40438:17"/>
being on the ſame, the whole Profit there ariſing did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the King; yet I have known in ſome Countries where the Frontagers have claimed thoſe grounds ſo left, by a pretended Cuſtome of Frontagers, and ſome probable reaſon might be ſhown, wherefore they ſhould have the ſame, for as their grounds was neareſt the Sea, and ſo next to the charge to repair the defence, and next to the loſs where any overflow happened, it might therefore ſeem reaſonable, that as they were put to the greateſt charge, and in peril of the loſs of their Lands, that ſo if Lands were left by the Sea affront them, that theſe Lands might accrew unto them as a reciprocal conſideration for their charge and loſs; but I take it that of late the Law hath in theſe Caſes been often-times ruled for the King againſt the Subject; for at <hi>Croſt</hi> in the county of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> 1600. Acres were gained from the Sea, affront the Mannor of ſir <hi>Valentine Brown</hi> there, yet he was put to obtain a grant from the King thereof: and one <hi>Buſhey</hi> of St. <hi>Kegneys</hi> claimed grounds left by the Sea, by the ſaid pretended Cuſtome of Frontage, but they were decreed againſt him in the Court of Wards, in 12. <hi>Jac. R.</hi> in which Caſe I was of Counſel: For it were inconvenient that the ſubject ſhould have Frontage, and yet no bounds preſcribed thereto; ſo that Ten thouſand Acres might be left affront a mans Mannor, which were not fit a ſubject ſhould have this large Inheritance by pretence of ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Cuſtome; and I ſuppoſe I may herein ſay in this Caſe, as Mr. <hi>Plowden</hi> doth of his ſilver Mines, That it is inconvenient a ſubject ſhould have the ſilver Mines in his grounds, for ſo might he become richer then the King.</p>
               <p>So it is not fitting that a ſubject ſhould have the grounds left by the Sea, when ſo much may happen to be left as the Kings own Lands in the Realm come to; and ſo becauſe <hi>nimium ſe exaltat in prerogativam Regis,</hi> I am of opinion the new gained grounds from the Sea appertain to the King as a Royal Eſcheat, and not to the ſubject; but in my Caſe here is a preſcription where the owner of the Mannor hath <hi>Incrementum &amp; decrementum Maris;</hi> of what force this is of,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40438:18"/>
is now to be argued; therefore I will now declare what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt a ſubject can or may challenge in the ſeas, in grounds gained therefrom.</p>
               <p>Perſonal profits ariſing on the ſea, ſubjects may have and challenge by cuſtom and preſcription, as to have free Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary on the ſea; and a Parſon had Tythes of Fiſh gotten in the ſea by the inhabitants of his pariſh; &amp; yet the ſea, nor any part thereof is not in any Pariſh, but it followed the perſon.</p>
               <p>In Sir <hi>Henry Conſtables</hi> Caſe, the Citizens of <hi>Briſtol</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Henry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables</hi> Caſe.</note> claimed Flotſan (which be goods floating in the ſea) by cuſtom, in <hi>Bracton Chap.</hi> 12. one aleaged to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged <note place="margin">Bracton.</note> of Toll or Cuſtom on the ſeas by preſcription, in the Caſe of the Swans; in Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> 7. <hi>Report,</hi> one preſcribed to have a game of wilde Swans at <hi>Abbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> in a Creek of the ſea, which is a member or arm of <note place="margin">Caſe of Swans.</note> the ſea: and in Sir <hi>Henry Conſtables</hi> aforeſaid, it is taken and received for Law, that a Subjects Mannor may extend to the low water-mark by preſcription; and ſeeing all theſe a ſubject may have in and on the Sea, wherefore then ſhould he not have all the grounds left by the Sea by preſcription? To that I anſwer, That he cannot have claim in any thing by preſcription and cuſtome, but that which lyeth in uſe, which is the life of them both; but lands and grounds which have always been Sea, could not be nor lye in uſe, and therefore they cannot be claimed, nor the ſame can be bounded out by preſcription or cuſtome; yet lands between the high-water mark and low-water mark the bounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be preſcribed to belong to, or to be parcel of the Mannor, becauſe in every twelve hours, or in every day they lie dry, and ſo a Subject all that time may have uſe of them, and ſo of all the reſt of the ſaid things, but in that which never lay in uſe, no cuſtom or preſcription could take hold on, inſomuch that in my Opinion, no preſcription or cuſtome can fetch lands further then the low water-mark.</p>

               <p>But now what grounds ſhall be ſaid a leaving by the Sea, is a point in my Caſe alſo, for it is certain that at ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides the Sea uſeth to overflow the <hi>Marſhes</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and returneth within a ſhort ſpace again; theſe being uſual and annual, be not accounted grounds left or gained from the ſea; ſo becauſe the Marſhes in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and the Sands in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> be overflown every twelve hours, and then dry again, are not accounted grounds left or gained from the ſea, becauſe the ſea hath daily her recourſe thereon: and therefore in 15 and 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Dier fo.</hi> 326. <note place="margin">15. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>Firſt, That if by little the Sea ſometimes decreaſe and leave ſome parcel to the Land, and ſome other times run over the ſame again, this ground belongs not to the King; for theſe be grounds whereto the ſubject may have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as in the grounds of the ſhore, but otherwiſe it is where great quantity of ground which had always been drowned before is left, that belongs to the King.</p>
               <p>Alſo by this preſident the Law was taken to be, that theſe grounds left by the Sea to the Land, were in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40438:19"/>
of <hi>Norffolk,</hi> whereto they did adjoyn, and in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within that Pariſh whereto they lay; for there was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, which was by a Jury of <hi>Nofolk,</hi> and the Jury taken to try an Iſſue muſt be <hi>de viceneto ejuſdem commitatus:</hi> but note there, the Preſentment was by a Jury <hi>de Corpore Commitatus,</hi> in 22. <hi>lib.

there, like an Appeal to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then he is Lord of thoſe Laws by which the Freehold and Inheritance of thoſe lands be ruled, wherefore then ſhould not theſe lands belong to his Grace?

               <p>After all theſe difinitions and diſtinctions, I have now prepared my Caſe ready to receive his cenſure upon the laſt concluſion; that is, That all the ſaid grounds were within this Statute, but no part thereof within this Commiſſion of Sewers: and therefore it is firſt to be noted, That theſe grounds were left by the ſea ſince the awarding of this Commiſſion, and the words of the Preamble of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſpeaks of grounds heretofore won; which word <hi>(Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore won)</hi> ſeemeth to tie the Statute and Commiſſion, both to grounds left or won before the ſaid Statute, and not ſuch as be won after, like to the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis conditionalibus quod ad dona prius facta non extenditur,</hi> which excludeth out of that Statute all gifts made before. And the words <hi>(Heretofore and hereafter)</hi> are words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in point of time; and whereſoever they are ſpoken, they come with an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> as if they required expreſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance; and ſo is the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. of Leaſes, that Statute is of all Leaſes hereafter to be made by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail, with ſuch cautions and proviſo's as be limited and ſet down in that Statute, ſhould be good Leaſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made, though all the proviſo's in the ſaid Statute were obſerved, were notwithſtanding by reaſon of the ſaid word <hi>Hereafter</hi> out of the relief of that Statute.</p>
               <p>And ſo in the Statute of <hi>Wills</hi> 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. which had theſe words in it, <hi>All perſons having Lands, or which hereafter ſhould have, might deviſe;</hi> this did not make good any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes of Lands made before: but if this ſhould paſs for currant, then I ſhould not perform my word in my concluſion, which puts it all within the Statute; and this exception, if it were material, would not put it onely out of

               <p>The ſecond cauſe wherefore theſe new grounds ſhould not be within this Law, is, Becauſe theſe Lands be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed beyond the bounds ſince the making of theſe Laws, and ſo it may be alleaged that they cannot extend to the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement: for Mr. <hi>Plow.</hi> in his <hi>Com. fol.</hi> 129. ſaith, <hi>That Laws</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40438:23"/>
a day and a year in <hi>London,</hi> the Lord might not ſeize him; and the Villain pleaded that he had remained a year and a day there, and ſo took himſelf to be within that priviledge; but becauſe ſince the ſaid liberty granted the bounds of <hi>London</hi> were much increaſed, therefore it was there held, that the ſaid liberty and priviledge did not extend to the new inlargement. And the Caſe is alſo put in the ſaid <hi>Coment.</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> had divers liberties in his Lands lying between the two Rivers of <hi>Tyne</hi> and <hi>Teſe,</hi> and after he purchaſed other Lands there, the ſaid liberties did not extend to the ſaid new purchaſed Lands; and the like Law is if one have a Warren in his Mannor and Lands in <hi>Dale,</hi> after he purchaſe more grounds there, his Warren doth not extend unto them. And ſo where one had by Charter the Lands of perſons forfeited for Treaſon, he could not have by the ſaid ancient Charter, Lands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for Treaſon by Tenants in Tail, becauſe the forfeiture of them was given by a late Statute ſince the Charter, but <hi>his non obſtantibus:</hi> I am of Opinion, That this Statute I now treat on extendeth to theſe new gained grounds: and I take a difference between a ſpecial Law of Priviledges, and Liberties which is ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or bounded either by Statute, Charter or Cuſtom, the ſame can by no conſtruction be made to exceed the bounds; but the general Law of this Kingdom, as this Law of ours is, the extents thereof be as large as the whole Realm is, and they be not tied to ſtinted limits, as particular private Charters and Cuſtoms be; and ſo I conclude, That in point of extent, this Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is tied to no other bounds then to the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THe third matter is that which I have grounded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Caſe upon, and that is, Whether the grounds in my Caſe newly left by the ſea to the ſhore, and the ſhore be ſuch grounds as be within this Commiſſion?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40438:24"/>
And in my opinion they be not: And therefore to maintain my opinion herein, I take a difference between grounds left by the Sea, and grounds gained from the ſea; for grounds left are of no value, and bring forth no fruit or encreaſe at all, but the uppermoſt part thereof are ſand, which theſe Laws take no hold of; for the Commiſſion extends only to grounds won and made profitable for the Commonwealth of this Realm, which <hi>Terra relicta</hi> yield not, for no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit at all thereof ariſeth, till the ſand be inned and gained; and theſe Laws made the Commiſſioners <hi>Savers</hi> and not <hi>Gainers,</hi> and therefore did extend the Commiſſion but to the utttermoſt banks and walls, and left the ſhore as grounds poſſeſſed by the ſea, and ſo be put <hi>pro in defenſo</hi> by this Law; and therefore I do make my concluſion as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That the Seas, Creeks and Bays are all within this  Statute in point of extent; but that they and the ſhores, and the relinquiſh'd grounds, be all of them out of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sewers to be dealt withal thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That Ports and Havens are totally the waters,  as well as the walls and banks thereof, within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sewers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The ſhore and grounds left by the ſea when they are put as in Gainage, are then and not before within the  power of the Commiſſion of Sewers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, although the grounds left by the ſea are not  in point of defence within the Commiſſion of Sewers, yet a wall or bank may be thereon raiſed for the aid and ſuccor of the countrey, but not for any cauſe where the defence extends but to themſelves. And although the grounds that have been gained from the ſea in the county of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and elſwhere in this Realm, yet that was done at the labor of private men, and not by the Commiſſion of Sewers, which aims at the general good, and not at private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Super totam materiam,</hi> I am of opinion with the concluſion of my Caſe, that is, That the ſaid new Iſland is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40438:24"/>
the Kings, the grounds left to the ſhore pertains to <hi>C.</hi> the ſubject; and that becauſe they are all of them within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> they are therefore within the extent of this Statute: But in regard they are grounds left only, and not gained nor made profitable for the Commonwealth of this Realm, they are not therefore within this Commiſſion. And ſo I conclude my Argument as I did my Caſe: in which, I hope, I have neither injured the Subject in his private Inheritance, nor wronged Prerogative in any point.</p>

of <hi>Cheddingtons</hi> Caſe in Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> firſt <hi>Report;</hi> where it ſaid, <hi>That one contingent cannot depend upon another:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed. Cooks</hi> 1 Report.</note> But more ſtrictly it is called to an accompt in the Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Caſe in Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> eighth <hi>Report;</hi> for there it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cook,</hi> Rep. 8.</note> held, <hi>That one poſsibility cannot depend upon another poſsibility;</hi> and this Caſe is there put, <hi>That if</hi> A. <hi>let Lands to</hi> B. <hi>for years, upon condition to have it for life, and upon condition to have Fee, that the Fee ſimple can never increaſe by the ſecond condition;</hi> but as he ſaith in another Caſe, <hi>Amicus Plato Amicus Socrates ſed magis amica veritas,</hi> his rule taken in the firſt Caſe is very general, and the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Caſe admits diſtinctions, which in my Argument I ſhall apply my ſelf unto.</p>
               <p>And ſome differences I ſhall take in this Point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; therefore I ſhall thus diſtinguiſh, That if upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the firſt Condition, the Original Eſtate be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon which both the firſt and ſecond Condition were built and grounded, the ſecond Condition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereupon is utterly void; but if the firſt Eſtate be not deſtroyed nor confounded upon the firſt Condition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the ſecond Condition and Eſtate thereof which ſhall be gotten thereby, may then well grow upon the old ſtock. To explain this by Example, If <hi>A.</hi> give Land to <hi>B.</hi> in Fee ſimple, upon condition to have the Land in Tail, upon condition to have for Life; here becauſe the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Livery by the firſt Condition is not deſtroyed, therefore the ſecond Condition ſhould well ſtand in force. So I do make a Leaſe to <hi>A.</hi> for twenty years, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have the Land for forty years, upon condition to have Fee; this firſt Condition and ſecond Condition may have both their full operations: for by the performance of the firſt Condition, the leaſe of twenty years is not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſtands on foot; and therefore the original Eſtate remaining unconfounded, the Fee ſimple may well increaſe by the performance of the ſecond Condition: But if a Leaſe be made to <hi>A.</hi> for his life, upon condition to have in Tail, upon condition to have Fee; the ſecond Condition
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40438:27"/>
here is utterly void, becauſe by the performance of the firſt Condition, <hi>A.</hi> had an Eſtate in Tail, which drowned and deſtroyed his Eſtate for life; and ſo becauſe every decreaſing and increaſing Eſtate is to depend upon the firſt Eſtate which receives the Livery, which is the life of all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecond Eſtate can never accrew in this caſe: and this is true reaſon, as I take it, of the ſaid Caſe put in the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Caſe; for there the Caſe for years was deſtroyed by the Leaſe for life, which came by the firſt <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Caſe.</note> Condition, and ſo the Fee ſimple there could never accrew by the ſecond Condition. And in anſwer to the ſaid general ground taken in the Rector of <hi>Cheddingtons</hi> Caſe, <hi>That one</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rector <hi>de Cheddingtons</hi> Caſe.</note> 
                  <hi>contingent or poſsibility cannot depend upon another;</hi> under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor I take it, not that I am bound thereby, neither was it the meaning of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> as I take it, to extend the ſame ſo largely as they are there put, becauſe I finde many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of great account which are againſt the ſaid general poſition.</p>
               <p>And firſt in the 38 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br. Feoffments, pl.</hi> 71. a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">38 <hi>H. S.</hi>
                  </note> was made to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> and his heirs, until <hi>I. S.</hi> paid him Ten pounds, and then to <hi>I. S.</hi> and his heirs, and ſo to the third perſon; and what is this but one condition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent and poſſibility to depend upon another, for theſe contingents there were held good, and were built upon a ſure foundation.</p>
               <p>And ſo in <hi>Digs</hi> Caſe in Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> Reports, where a Feoffment is made to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> and his heirs, with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Digs</hi> Caſe.</note> power of Revocation, and after of new Limitation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; theſe be alſo contingents and poſſibilities depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon others, and many ſuch double contingents may be put.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> put in the end of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Cheddingtons</hi> Caſe out of 12 <hi>Lib. Aſſ. pl.</hi> 5. in my <note place="margin">12 <hi>lib. Aſſize</hi>
                  </note> opinion doth not diſalow the ſecond Condition; for there the Caſe is, <hi>That</hi> A. <hi>Leaſed to</hi> B. <hi>upon condition, That if</hi> A. <hi>or his heirs pay to</hi> B. <hi>Ten pounds within a certain day, that they might re-enter; and if</hi> A. <hi>nor his heirs ſhould not pay the Ten</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:40438:28"/>
                  <hi>pounds within the time; Then if</hi> B. <hi>paid to</hi> A. <hi>Ten pounds at another day, that he ſhould have Fee: Both</hi> A. <hi>and</hi> B. <hi>failed in payment, and</hi> A. <hi>entred, and being put out, brought an Aſsize, and</hi> nihil Caepit per breve; this doth not prove that one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot depend upon another, neither can I ſee well what Expoſition to make of ſo uncertain a Caſe, ſo that I take this Caſe to be no evidence againſt mine.</p>
               <p>But in the 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 15. there is a Caſe which in my <note place="margin">14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 15.</note> opinion makes more againſt my double condition then any other, which is put by <hi>Brudnel</hi> Chief Juſtice; that is, If <hi>A.</hi> be bound in an Obligation to <hi>B.</hi> upon condition to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoff <hi>I. S.</hi> before Eaſter enſuing, then the Obligation to be void; and if he do not infeoff him, then to pay Ten pounds at Pentecoſt, then the Obligation to be void: The Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not made before Eaſter, therefore <hi>Brudnel</hi> held the Obligation was forfeit, and that the ſecond Condition was not good: But there is a <hi>(Quaere)</hi> ſet upon that Caſe, and ſo it may well be, for I ſee it commonly done, that if a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſans be made of a Statute which is broken, and ſo the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute becomes forfeit, yet a new defeſans may defeat it; and ſo in my opinion may the ſecond Condition in this Caſe avoid the Obligation, if the firſt concluſion had not been in the Caſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>I ſhall adde this Caſe alſo as a conceit; that is, <hi>A.</hi> infeoffs <hi>B.</hi> upon condition, if <hi>A.</hi> go to <hi>Lincoln</hi> he ſhall have the <note place="margin">A Conceit.</note> Lands to him and the heirs of his body, and if he go to <hi>Boſton</hi> he ſhall have it for Ten years; and he goes firſt to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do here hold theſe Conditions being put promiſcuouſly, without diſtinction of the times of the Conditions which ſhall be firſt performed, and which the ſecond, that the Fee is decreaſed into an Eſtate for years, and can never increaſe into an Eſtate in tail by performing of the ſecond Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the Livery out of which it ſhould grow was quite deſtroyed by the firſt decreaſer. So that my intent <note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ond Point.</note> appears, that one Condition may depend upon another upon the ſaid diſtinction; but whether by the performance
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40438:28"/>
of the firſt Condition in my Caſe there will an Eſtate come to <hi>B.</hi> or not, I meant it for a queſtion: for <hi>B.</hi> had before an Eſtate for his own life; then is it not poſſible that his Eſtate can hereby be increaſed by having the Land alſo for the life of <hi>C.</hi> if it be admitted <hi>argumenti gratia,</hi> that <hi>B.</hi> ſhall or may have both theſe Eſtates ſtand in him both at one time: for if <hi>C.</hi> dyed firſt, then is <hi>B.</hi> never like to have any benefit thereof: And if <hi>B.</hi> himſelf ſhould dye before <hi>C.</hi> then alſo were it impoſſible for <hi>B.</hi> to make any uſe of this Eſtate for the life of <hi>C.</hi> unleſs it were in him to grant away to another, as in the Caſe of the Office in the 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. where an Office <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>Crofts</hi> Caſe.</note> is granted to the King, the King could not have the Office himſelf; and ſo in that point for the King to take by the grant, he could not, yet by that book it was in him to grant over to another which might have it. And like to this is the Caſe where <hi>I. S.</hi> is Parſon of the Church of <hi>Dale,</hi> and the Patron grants the next avoidance, this grant can he himſelf take no benefit by, unleſs he reſign, yet if he dye it ſhall come to his Executors.</p>
               <p>But I take the Law to be in my Caſe, that <hi>B.</hi> ſhall not by the firſt Condition have both the Eſtates in him at once, that is, for his own life, and after for the life of <hi>C.</hi> but that the Eſtate of <hi>B.</hi> by the firſt Condition, ſhall be decreaſed or changed from his own life into the life of <hi>C.</hi> and ſhall be melted and newly molded by this Condition; for an Eſtate may as well decreaſe as increaſe by a Condition: and yet the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> principal Caſe was, <hi>That Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth <hi>did grant the Mannor to</hi> Tindal <hi>and the heirs of his body, upon condition upon payment of Twenty ſhillings to her by</hi> Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, <hi>that he ſhould have the Reverſion to him and his heirs;</hi> and there it is holden for Law, that by the payment of Twenty ſhillings, the Reverſion in Fee ſimple ſhall increaſe to <hi>Tindal,</hi> and ſhall not alter or drown the Eſtate Tail, which is an excellent Caſe, but alter the putting of that Caſe, and then it may alter the Law alſo; that is, I give Land to <hi>I. S.</hi> and the heirs of his body, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">A Conceit.</note> if he pay me Twenty ſhillings, that he ſhall have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40438:29"/>
the ſaid Lands to him and his heirs: In my conceit by the performance of this condition, the Eſtate Tail, is by increaſe changed into a Fee ſimple; in which, note the difference between <hi>Tindals</hi> Caſe and this, where upon payment of 20. s. the reverſion is granted to him and his heirs: and where the words be, <hi>That upon payment of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings he ſhal have the Lands to him and his heirs:</hi> In the firſt Caſe, the Fee-ſimple accrewing ſhall not alter the Eſtate Tail, but in the ſecond Caſe, by the Fee increaſing, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Tail is determined and changed into a Fee ſimple, <hi>quod quaere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Admitting the firſt condition did increaſe the Eſtate of <hi>B.</hi> from his own life to the life of <hi>C.</hi> and the ſecond condition is performed, by the which another Eſtate will accrew to <hi>B.</hi> as I take it will, becauſe an Eſtate decreaſed, is parcel of the firſt Eſtate; then what Eſtate <hi>B.</hi> hath got by this new Limitation, is the queſtion: And in my Opinion, he hath at the moſt but gotten an Eſtate again for his own life, and that the Limitation to the heirs of the body of his father is utterly void, be his father dead or alive; for if his father be dead, his elder brother is the heir of his body, within theſe words of Limitation, who cannot take the Lands by deſcent <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Littleton</hi> eſtate Tail.</note> from <hi>B.</hi> his Brother, or from his Father; but as the Caſe is put in <hi>Littletons</hi> Title <hi>Tail,</hi> and in the 4 and 5 <hi>Ma.</hi> in <hi>Dier Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwoulds</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 &amp; 5 <hi>Ma. Dier.</hi>
                  </note> Caſe, where Lands were given to the eldeſt ſon, and the heirs of the body of his father; this is a good Eſtate in Tail, being made to the eldeſt ſon, becauſe he is capable to take the Lands in both degrees. And in 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Caſe <note place="margin">2 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note> is famous, and is known by the name of <hi>Roberges</hi> Caſe, where Lands were given to her and to the heirs of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of her body begotten; and it was there held, That if her husband were then dead, and left any heir which he had by her, they might take joyntly with her; for that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to take by deſcent from the ſaid <hi>Roberges,</hi> becauſe he which takes it muſt not be heir to her, but to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who never held any Eſtate therein: And ſo to be ſhort, I am of Opinion, That no eſtate of inheritance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40438:29"/>
be gained by <hi>B.</hi> by theſe words, <hi>The heirs of the body of his father.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>I am determined before I enter into the diſcourſe of new defences in my Caſe, to deliver my Opinion touching the Walls, Banks and other ancient defences, which have had their being time out of memory, and in truth be the very materials and memorials of Antiquity: And becauſe Banks and Walls be the firſt named in the Commiſſion, they ſhall therefore have the firſt place in my argument, being the moſt ancient and approved defences, as well againſt the rage of the Seas, as againſt the violence of freſh waters, that either Art or Nature have produced.</p>

               <p>A Wall doth differ in point of ownerſhhip from a Bank, firſt, in reſpect of the materials the ſame is made on, for a Bank is made <hi>Ex ſolo &amp; fundo qua ex ſuis propriis naturis ſunt cadem cum terra ſuper qua edificatur,</hi> but ſo is not a Wall, for it is an artificial edifice, not of the materials ariſing of the place where it ſtandeth, but which be brought thither and built there, <hi>ad propria onera &amp; coſtagia partis;</hi> ſo that the ownerſhip &amp; property of a Wall doth appertain to him who is bound to repair the ſame, though his ground lye not next thereto; but of a Bank the property and ownerſhip is his whoſe grounds adjoyn thereto: And this ſhall, I hope, ſuffice to have ſaid of Banks and Walls, the two firſt defences nominated in the Commiſſion of Sewers.</p>
               <p>The letter of this Statute and Commiſſion, ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to Banks, Walls, and other defences ſtanding and being by the coaſts of the ſea and Mariſh grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adjoyning; but whether the Banks and Walls of freſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which have their courſes to the ſea be within this ſtatute or not, hath heretofore bred ſome queſtion; but for my own part, I am cleer of opinion that they be within the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of theſe Laws, for there be two miſchiefs recited in the Statute; the firſt is, for not maintaining the Walls and Banks againſt the ſea, by reaſon whereof great hurt hath happened thereby, by the overflowing thereof: and the other, by the inundation of freſh water-courſes through Landfloods, which have done ſome damage to the grounds next adjoyning; and theſe Laws apply a remedy to both
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40438:31"/>
theſe grievances, that is, by repairing the Walls and Banks next the ſea, and by maintaining of the defences of the freſh Inland Rivers, to cauſe them keep their waters within their Channels. And I take it there be words in the Statute that will bear this conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the rage of the ſea, flowing and reflowing, and by means of the Trenches of freſh waters deſcending, and having their courſes to the ſea, by divers ways be ſo dirupt, lacerate and broken, &amp;c. And alſo in the preamble of the Statute the words there be, that by reaſon of the outragious flowing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp; courſe of the ſea in &amp; upon Marſh grounds, and other low places heretofore through politique wiſdom won and made profitable for the great Common-wealth of this Realm, as alſo by occaſion of Lands, waters, and other outragious ſprings, in and upon Meadows, Paſtures and low grounds adjoyning to Rivers, Streams, and Currents, wherein the waters are to have their courſes. And what keeps the freſh waters within this Channel but good and ſerviceable Walls and Banks, and what things doth this Law intend to be dirupt, lacerate and broken, but the Walls, Banks and other defences which pent up their waters; and theſe words extend more properly to the Walls and Banks of freſh Inland Rivers then to ſea coaſts. And I do finde ſome ancient Authority in the point out of the Charter of <hi>Romney</hi> Marſh, <hi>pag.</hi> where the words be, <hi>Ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction'</hi>

                  <hi>acra terrae Cu' aqua Cooperta.</hi> In my conceit the Civil Law makes prettier and neater diſtinctions of theſe then our Common Law doth; for there it is ſaid, That <hi>naturali ratione quaedam ſunt Communia ut Aer.

Our Common Law, which of all others is the moſt certain, did not ſet his property upon a Dear in Parks, Conneys or Hares in Warrens, nor on Fiſhes in running Streams; all which be more permanent then running waters be: And therefore I am of opinion, that taking this word <hi>Aqua</hi> for the bare running water, there can be no property therein, but as the ſame is incident to the ſoil, taking them two for one, it is drawn with the property thereof: and this difference is apparant by 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. aforeſaid; And Mr. <hi>Lyu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> puts a difference <hi>inter Fluvium &amp; flumen;</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>Eſt perennis decurſus aquar' ſed flumen eſt propria ipſa aqua.</hi>

               <p>Let it not be held Queſtionable, whether Rivers of both kindes be within theſe Laws or not, though they be not put among the defences which this Statute ſpeaketh of; for that expreſly thoſe things which are termed Lets and Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are commanded by this Statute to be removed out of the Rivers and Streams for hindring the waters; and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation being ſo carefully provided for cannot be ſupported, unleſs Rivers Navigable be maintained: and theſe Rivers are like the veins of a mans body, by means whereof the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the grounds near thereunto adjoyning are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

And the word <hi>Springs</hi> of it ſelf is both in appellation and operation, very beneficial for the Commonwealth: for I may juſtly term them the vital Spirits of many the great and Royal Rivers of this Kingdom, as of <hi>Thames, Trent,</hi> and ſuch like: And therefore I am willing to let ſuch of them as be not outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and hurtful, to take up a place of defence within theſe Laws; for the Trent at the head is derived from Springs, as many other Rivers be: and I give both the eſſence and aſſiſtance to them, and ſo in my opinion they are worthy the protection of theſe Laws: and I doubt not but the waters iſſuing and guſhing from the outragious Springs, may by the provident &amp; diſcreet care of the Commiſſioners be ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the ſame may be applyed &amp; imployed to neceſſary uſes.</p>
               <p>So now I have run through, like a ſwift ſtream, the qualities of theſe Rivers, Gutters, Sewers and Ditches, and of all their dependancies, and wherein they are to have aid and aſſiſtance of theſe Laws of Sewers, being in truth the very materials of theſe Laws: yet for a little better explanation of their ſeveral natures and kindes, I ſhall therefore put theſe Caſes;</p>

But if two towns do adjoyn, and in either of them there is a River Navigable, and by accident one of them is dried up, and the other aboundeth with waters, more perhaps then there is neceſſary uſe of; I am in the caſe of opinion, that the Commiſſioners of Sewers have power by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to make a Law or Ordinance to relieve the River which wants waters, out of the abundance of waters which the other River hath, in help and ſupply of Navigation.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The Statute of 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. extends not to Bridges lying out <note place="margin">22 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> of highways; but the Statute of Sewers doth extend to ſuch alſo: And therefore if a Bridge ſtand on a common Sewer, Ditch or Gutter which hath his current to the Sea, or to ſome River, the Commiſſioners of Sewers hath power over ſuch, either to repair the ſame, or to extirp it, as juſt cauſe and occaſion ſhall require.</p>
               <p>Alſo private Bridges are within theſe Laws, as if <hi>I.

of Bridges onely, but if it be fit to take an Arch away, or to adde a new Arch thereto, or to erect and build a new Bridge where none was before, this is moſt fit to be done by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, whoſe power may be extended thereto.</p>
               <p>All Bridges ſet upon Rivers by perſons without authority, may be pulled down by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, and the parties puniſhed; for no man ought of his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be ſo bold with the common and high ways or ſtreams, as to erect Bridges or other Engines thereon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawful Warrant.</p>
               <p>Bridges in highways, where there is no ſtream under, but onely ſome petty Land ſtream at rain and wet ſeaſons, theſe be dry Bridges, and be not within this Statute of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but yet they be within the Statute of 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. if they ſtand on highways: In 14 <hi>Jacobi Regis</hi> it was found by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition taken at the city of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in the Guild-Hall there, <note place="margin">14 <hi>Jac.</hi>

And theſe grounds which have been ſo won, could not be ſo kept and preſerved, but by banking and new fencing in; which proves directly, that the ſaid new Banks and new fencing might be made for the inning and keeping of the ſaid new won grounds: And alſo the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <note place="margin">The expired Law of <hi>H.</hi> 6. giveth aid to this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. gave the Commiſſioners of Sewers power to repair the ancient Banks, and Walls and fences <hi>&amp; eadem, &amp; alia de novo conſtruere;</hi> by which words the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners which had their power from that Statute, might make new defences, as Banks, Walls and ſuch like: And ſo is the opinion of Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> delivered upon the ſaid Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 6. in his Caſe of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> which being obſerved and granted, makes ſtrongly for this part; for that the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not only confirm all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statutes of the Sewers then in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> but alſo gives autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Commiſſioners to do after the Tenure and effect of all and ſingular the Statutes and Ordinances before that time made: And although the ſaid Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 6. was in time then expired, yet the form and effect of it may be followed and obſerved: And to that end I take this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity between a Law repealed and a Law expired, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed Law is made void and fruſtrate, as either unworthy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40438:40"/>
or unneceſſary for ſome reſpects to be any longer continued or put in execution, and therefore was forbidden to be uſed or practiſed; but a Law expired in time, though it hath loſt his vigor and force, yet it is like a vertuous man deceaſed, his life and actions may be worthy imitation, though the date of days be at an end; but a Law repealed is like a man condemned for ſome offence, whoſe life and actions are neither of them worthy imitation, unleſs it be to do the contrary: And the ſaid Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 6. was a worthy Law, which this Statute intended not to come ſhort on, but to extend further then the Limits of that Law did reach unto: alſo the ſaid Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 6. is uſed by Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in the pleading of <hi>Rooks</hi> Caſe in his 15. Rep. where he could <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rooks</hi> Caſe.</note> make there no other uſe of it, ſeeing it was in time expired, then only by way of imitation.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we muſt conceive, that theſe Laws of Sewers are of great and urgent neceſſity and uſe for the good of the whole <note place="margin">The equity of this Law will help this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> Commonwealth of the Realm, and therefore the intent thereof may be extended in expoſition beyond the letter of the words; for the words be <hi>(and the ſame to make new)</hi> which according to the bare words in a literal conſtruction, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend to new ones where none was before, but to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying of the decayed old ones; but the learned expoſitor, whoſe conſtructions be not ſo much grounded upon the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as upon the ſence, may in equal juſtice extend the ſence to new making, as wel as to renewing of defences; for Mr. <hi>Bract.</hi>

Com.</hi> in <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Granges</hi> Caſe, <hi>fol.</hi> 178. and in many other authorities <hi>à forciori</hi> ſhall this Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <note place="margin">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40438:41"/>
                     <hi>Et qui heret in littera heret in corticè.</hi> And if the makers of the Law, when this Statute was put into the frame, had been demanded, whether their meaning was to have it extended to the making of theſe new defences where either juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or neceſſity did inforce it; they would have anſwered, That they ſo intended it; for the ſoul and life of the Law lieth in the ſenſible expoſition thereof, and not in the bare letter, as Mr. <hi>Plow.</hi> alſo fully demonſtrates in his <hi>Com.</hi> in <hi>Eaſton</hi> and <hi>Studs</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is formerly alleaged, that the warineſs of the Common Law was ſuch in theſe Caſes, that it admitted not one ſuch new Trench, River or new cut to be made, without the awarding out of the writ of <hi>Ad quod dam'</hi> directed to the Eſcheator, an Officer ſworn to enquire, firſt, what damage it might be if ſuch a new cut or drain were made? and then upon his inquiſition returned, there might be one made, if by the inquiſition it were found convenient, elſe not to be proceeded further in: But in anſwer thereto, being the argument ſet down in the ſaid Caſe of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> I am of Opinion, That there may be more wary and circumſpect proceedings by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, then in the <hi>Ad quod damn'</hi> by the Eſcheator; for there be many Commiſſioners which be all ſworn, and in the <hi>Ad quod damn'</hi> there is but one, the Eſcheator, <hi>plus vident oculi quam oculus &amp; tutius eſt rem' committere pluribus, quam uni,</hi> and in my Opinion, it is much better to commit this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſs to many Commiſſioners of great gravity, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rince, learning, wiſdom and integrity, then to one Eſchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who may perhaps want all thoſe vertues: And further, whereas in the ſaid Caſe of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> it is inferred, or rather feared, that by giving this power to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of Sewers, they may thereby ſtop up the havens of this Kingdom; that fear is needles, for I finde, that neither by the letter nor the ſence of theſe Laws, any ſuch expoſition can be made, either to the ſtopping up or hindring of their currents and paſſages. But to proceed in my former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in making new defences: I know that in the 43,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40438:41"/>
and 44 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a great controverſie did ariſe in the county of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> about the building and erecting of two new Goats at <note place="margin">43 &amp; 44 <hi>Eliz.</hi>

And a like great controverſie did ariſe in 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> in the counties of <hi>Cambridge, Huntington</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> about the making of new cuts and drains in the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> by the power of the Commiſſioners of Sewers, which being much oppoſed, the ſame came in the end to be heard before the King and Councel, wherein this Order was conceived as followeth.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40438:42"/>
Kings learned Councel; and taking Information of ſuch Complaints as were firſt exhibited unto this Board, touching ſundry Suits and Vexations moved of late by certain obſtinate and ill-diſpoſed perſons, againſt His Majeſties Commiſsioners of Sewers, for the counties of <hi>Lincoln, Huntington, Northampton</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and their Officers and Miniſters, for executing the Orders and Decrees of the Commiſsioners, to the manifeſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and inundations of many large Levels and parts of the ſaid counties: And having by their Lordſhips like Directions, upon adviſed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, weighed and compared the ſaid late and undue proceeding with ancient Laws of this Realm, appearing in divers notable Records in the point now queſtioned, with the continual and concurrent practiſe of ancient and later times; and alſo the Opinions of the Lord <hi>Popham,</hi> late Chief Juſtice, delivered in writing very exactly and fully upon the ſaid Queſtions, touching the Power and Authority of the ſaid Commiſsion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon making Report at large unto their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips this day in full Counſel, of the whole ſtate of the cauſe; Foraſmuch as thereby it appeared, That theſe Inventions and Diſturbances conſiſt upon Four heads, wherein the extent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion was queſtioned, upon pretext and conceit of Law: Firſt, that the Commiſsioners of Sewers had not Authority to cauſe new Banks, Drains or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40438:42"/>
Sluces to be made where there had not been any before. Secondly, that they might not lay the Tax or Rate upon Hundreds, Towns or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof in general, but upon the firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment or Judgement to charge every man in particular, according to the quantity of his Land or Common. Thirdly, that they had not power ſufficient to commit to priſon perſons refractory and diſobedient to their Orders, Warrants and Decrees. And laſtly, that Actions of Treſpaſs, Falſe Impriſonment, and other Proces at the Common Law, have been brought againſt ſome of their Officers and Miniſters for executing their Decrees and Warrants; Their Lordſhips finding in their wiſdoms, that it can neither ſtand with Law, nor with common Senſe or Reaſon, that in a cauſe of ſo great conſequent the Law can be ſo void of Providence, as to reſtrain the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Sewers from making new works to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the fury of the Waters, aſwel as to repair the old where neceſsity doth require it for the ſafety of the country, or to cauſe a charge upon the Towns or Hundreds in general that are intereſſed in the benefit or loſs, without attending particular Survey or Admeaſurement of Acres, when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is to have ſpeedy and ſudden execution, or that a Commiſsion of ſo high a nature, and of ſo great uſe to the Commonwealth, and evident ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, and of ſo ancient juriſdiction, both before

may ſtand for a preſident of State; and it thereby plainly appeareth, that the Kings learned Counſel were of Opinion, That the ſaid new works might be Ordered and Decreed to be done by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, and that the ſame had warrant from former preſidents.</p>
               <p>But the laſt allegation on the contrary party is very forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt this argument, That by the making and erecting of theſe new Defences, the inheritance of private perſons are thereby prejudiced whereon they be built; yet as <hi>Cato</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vix ulla Lex fieri poteſt quae omnibus utilis ſit ſed ſi majori</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cato.</note> 
                  <hi>parti proficiat ſufficit;</hi> and therefore this Objection I thus Anſwer, That theſe new works are not to be undertaken but upon urgent neceſſity in defence of the countrey, or for the ſafety thereof, ſo that the Commonwealth be therein deeply intereſſed and ingaged; and things which concern the Commonweal are of greater accompt in the Law, then the intereſt of private perſons.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is 13 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 16. That the Commonwealth <note place="margin">13. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> ſhall be preferred before the private Eſtate, and for the good of the Commonwealth a private perſon ſhall receive da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, if otherwiſe it cannot be eſchewed; as a private mans houſe ſhall be pulled down, if the next houſe thereto be on fire to ſave the Town; and the Suburbs of a City may be pulled down in time of War, to ſave the City; and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks may be raiſed on private mens grounds for defence of the Realm: And what greater enemy can there be then the Sea, who threatens with his mercileſs waves to ſwallow up all before it, but that the hand of the Almighty hath tied <note place="margin">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40438:44"/>
other neceſſary Defences againſt the overflowing of the Sea; For <hi>Ubi nova fit maris incurſio ibi novum est apponendum remedium,</hi> with this caution, That under the pretence of the Commonweal a private mans welfare be not intended to the charge, trouble and burthen of the countrey: And with this alſo, That where any mans particular intereſt and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is prejudiced for the Commonwealths cauſe, by any ſuch new erected works, That that part of the countrey be ordered to recompence the ſame which have good thereby, according as is wiſely and diſcreetly Ordered by two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Statutes, the one made in <hi>Anno</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 22. <note place="margin">27 <hi>El. c.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Raſtal</hi> Havens and Rivers, is where the Commiſſioners have power to compound and agree with the Lords and owners of the grounds through which the new cuts are to be made; And the other 3 <hi>Jac.

                  </note> to <hi>London:</hi> and although theſe Statutes hold not in the general Caſes of Sewers, but are applied to the ſaid particular matters therein expreſſed, yet they may ſerve as good Rules to direct our Commiſſioners to imitate upon like occaſion happening.</p>

               <head>The ſecond Point upon this Statute.</head>
               <p>It appeareth by my Caſe, That the Commiſſioners of Sewers did decree a new Bank to be raiſed, and a new River to be caſt, and an old Sewer to be repaired upon their view, ſurvey and diſcretion.

               <p>BUt it hath been uſed, that Surveyors of the Sewers have made preſentments of defaults of things governed by theſe Laws; but whether ſuch a preſentment be binding or not, is a good point.

They cannot preſent that <hi>I. S.</hi> is bound by preſcription, cuſtom, covenant or otherwiſe, to repair ſuch a Wall, Bank or Sewer, for this is not within their Office. In <hi>Kelloways Reports fol.</hi> 141. there is a cuſtom alleaged, that <note place="margin">

               <p>I Now intend to declare where uſe ſhall tie one to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of the defences mentioned in this Law (I do not hereby mean that uſe which I have formerly mentioned in Preſcription and Cuſtom, which is uſe to repair) but the uſe I intend in this place, is, the uſe which one is to have of the defence or thing which is to be repaired: As where one and his Anceſtors have uſed to have the uſe of the River or waters by ſailing up and down the ſame, or have uſed to have a Ferry on or over them, or a Staith to go up and down, or a Crane to draw up waters, or ſome other Engine to draw up the waters for the uſe of their houſes; Theſe uſes which men have of theſe things may be cauſes and conſiderations ſufficient to tie them to the repairs of the Walls, Banks and Rivers: <note place="margin">37 <hi>lib. Aſſiz.</hi>
                  </note> And for warrant in this learning is the Book of 37 <hi>lib. Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 10. for there were ſome perſons which were bound to repair the River, becauſe they had paſſage on it with their boats, and others were charged becauſe they had free fiſhing in the River; and in my opinion it ſtands with good reaſon, and agreeable to Law, That thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, before others, ſhould be bound and tied to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of ſuch things whereof they have peculiar and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral profits and uſe of more then others have: And it is manifeſt, that this very Statute aims full at this point, when it directed that ſuch perſons ſhould be rated, taxed and ſeſſed towards the repairs, which had profit of fiſhing and other commodities in the Rivers.</p>
               <p>But leaſt ſome may miſtake my meaning and learning alſo in the ſaid former Caſes, I will therefore make the ſame plain by diſtinction, which is this, That Frontage, Owner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and this uſe I laſt ſpake of, do not binde any to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing and maintaining of Walls, Banks, Bridges, Sewers or other Defences, when and where any other man or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40438:51"/>
be bound to do the ſame by Preſcription, Cuſtom, Tenure or Covenant: For the ſaid three parts, Frontage, Ownerſhip and <hi>Uſus rei,</hi> be but implicite ties onely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Laws, and ſerve the turn onely when no other perſon or perſons are bound expreſly thereunto; and this diſtinction may be maintained by the Book of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <note place="margin">8. <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>fol.</hi> 5. and other Books, where it is ſaid, <hi>That he whoſe grounds is next adjoyning is bound to repair, unleſs ſome other be bound to do the ſame by Tenure or Preſcription:</hi> Whereby it followeth, that if one be bound to do the ſame by ſpecial Tenure or Preſcription, it freeth the Frontager.</p>
               <p>Note alſo another difference, that in caſes where a Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager and one who hath <hi>liberum paſſagium</hi> on the River, and a man which hath a free Piſchary there, are not any one of them bound to make the repairs alone, but all alike to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and ſo is the Book of 37 <hi>Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 10. and I ſuppoſe the Book of 38 <hi>Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 15. maintains this point with me; for there the Law is declared to be, <hi>That he which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">37, 38 <hi>Aſſiz.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is bound by preſcription to repair, is bound peremptorily alone to do the work, and not any other; and if no ſuch perſon can be found, then the parties whoſe grounds do adjoyn, and thoſe which have free fiſhing in the River, and free paſſage thereon, be all of them to do and perform the ſame joyntly, and no one of them is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for the other, becauſe they ſhall be in</hi> conſimili caſu. So by this which hath been ſaid touching theſe matters, the Commiſſioners may ſee and behold how carefully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly the Laws of this Realm have indeavored to do equal Juſtice; and my deſire is, that they would as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put them in execution.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But on the other part I finde by many ancient Book; and Authorities of the Law, that Taxations and Charges have been generally laid upon Townſhips and Hundreds in matters of this kinde, as in the 37 <hi>lib. Aſsize plac.</hi> 10. Four ſeveral Townſhips were charged with the repairs of a River, becauſe they had paſſage thereon with Boats; and in 38 <hi>lib.

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40438:52"/>
                  <hi>qui ab antiquo facere conſueverunt;</hi> ſo that if <hi>ab antiquo</hi> a Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had uſed to repair Bridges, it was tyed thereunto by the implyed conſtruction of this Statute: And the Statute of 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. gave authority to Iuſtices of Peace to charge a County, Hundred or Town with the repair of Bridges, if no certain perſon were ſpecially tyed to the repair thereof: and many times in ancient Statutes and Books of our Law, we ſhall finde Townſhips and Hundreds charged generally, as in <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student, fol.</hi> 74. a Townſhip was amerced; and by the ancient and famous Statute of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> a Townſhip ſhall be amerced for the eſcape of a Robber by the highway: And 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Title <hi>Corone</hi> in <hi>Fitz. pl.</hi> 293. a Townſhip was amerced for the eſcape of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer; and in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Brook</hi> 94. a Town was ſeſſed for the expences for the Knight of the Parliament and might be levied on any perſons goods of the town; and this was for the uncertainty of the perſons, and for the infiniteneſs of the number of them, as it is ſaid in <hi>Richard Godfreys</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>But it may haps be objected on the other part, That if a Town or Hundred may be joyntly taxed, then it might ſo come to paſs, that one mans goods which had no grounds ſubject to the charge, and which could reap nor take any hurt thereby, might come to be diſtrained for the whole tax, rate or ſeſs of the Town; and another man which had great quantities of grounds there ſubject to danger might eſcape free; and therefore ſuch expoſition to be made of the ſaid Law, were not within the rule and compaſs of equality.</p>
               <p>And another objection may alſo be made, That it is true, that by an expreſs Statute or Cuſtom, an aſſeſs, rate or tax may be laid upon a Town or Hundred, as was done by the ſaid Statute of the 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and others formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; but ſuch expoſition were contrary to the letter of this Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Sewers.</p>
               <p>I do confeſs, that if theſe two objections could not be anſwered, I ſhould change my opinion: It is true, That if a tax or ſeſs had been ſet upon a Hundred by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40438:52"/>
of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> for the eſcape of a Robber, and that charge had been levied upon one mans goods of the Town, as it might have been, he had had no remedy to cauſe his fellow Townſmen to be contributers to him to bear equal ſhare with him; and ſo if the party robbed had recovered by Action againſt the Hundred, and the goods of one in the Hundred had been taken in execution, he had no means to get contribution: And yet that Law carried that defect with it Three hundred years, or thereabouts, till in the 27 year of Queen <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 13. wherein Order was taken, that if ſome one or few mens goods were taken in execution upon the Recovery in an Action taken againſt the Hundred by the party Robbed, he or they ſhould have contribution, which before that Statute of 27 of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could not be had.</p>
               <p>But to give anſwer to the two objections: Firſt, if in our caſe of the Sewers, a Townſhip ſhould be Taxed, yet this Tax could not be taken or Levied, but only of ſuch as had grounds within the charge, which had good by the repair, or might have hurt by the neglect thereof; for in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 35. it is ſaid for Law, <hi>That if a town be aſſeſſed in the Tax, and the Collector doth diſtrain the goods of a man of the town who was not chargeable thereto, that party may have and take his Action of Treſpaſs againſt the Diſtrainer and Collector, for that he at his peril muſt look well to it, that he whoſe goods were taken were ſubject to the charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in our caſe of the Sewers, if the goods of one which was not ſubject to the Tax or Aſſeſs impoſed were taken, he might have his Action of Treſpaſs againſt the diſtrainer, and ſhould recover his damages thereby; ſo this ſalve cures one of the ſaid maladies.</p>
               <p>But then the caſe goes further, <hi>That if the goods of one man of the town ſhould be taken for the whole Seſſe of the Town, and he is ſuch a perſon as in truth is chargeable thereunto, he can have no Action againſt the diſtrainer for taking his Cattle, for he is ſuch a perſon as cannot excuſe himſelf but that he is chargeable:</hi> This indeed draws the Caſe to a deſperate iſſue, for this
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40438:53"/>
ſeems to be as great a miſchief as ever the Statute of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> did ever ſuffer, which was remedied by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> but our Caſe hath not ſuch a Cure provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Therefore it puts me to the old adage of Law, <hi>Better it is to ſuffer a miſchief to one or moe particular perſons, then to permit an inconvenience to the whole Commonwealth which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns a multitude:</hi> But yet I ſhall give this objection a better anſwer, I hope, then with an old adage; for in our Caſe the party whoſe goods are taken for the whole town, is not without a fitting and convenient remedy; for when his goods be taken and he is conſtrained to pay the whoſe ſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Town, he may make his complaint to the Commiſſioners of Sewers, and may give in the particular names of every Townſman, and the quantity of each mans Eſtate which be charged thereto, or the true value of their Lands, and may crave of the Commiſſioners of Sewers for to make a Law to make them all to contribute, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to his portion of Land: And in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Commiſſioners of Sewers have power to impoſe a proportionable rate upon every of them, according to the quantity and quality of his ground, by way of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may award Proceſs to force and compel them to pay the ſame to the ſaid party; whereby it plainly appears, that the party ſo diſtrained hath a direct remedy to come by his loſſes. In <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student</hi> a whole town was amerced, and they met together by common conſent, and Aſſeſſed and Rated every man equally according to his ability, and alowed of as a good cauſe.</p>
               <p>But Commiſſioners of Sewers may if they can come to the knowledge of the certainty of every mans Eſtate, rate in the primary and original Seſſe every perſon according to his ſeveral quantity of Eſtate, which may be done in this maner, when the Commiſsioners be agreed how much to lay upon ſuch a town, then to ſend for three or four of the Inhabitants, and cauſe them to give in every mans Eſtate; and to make and appoint them Seſſors to rate every man, or elſe the Commiſſioners themſelves, having true intelligence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40438:53"/>
of every mans Land, may eaſily ſet the rate and charge upon every particular perſon in an even and proportionable ſum; and thus every man at the firſt ſhall know his own rate, as in the aſſeſſing of the Subſidy, and no man ſhall be burthened with his Neighbors charge; and theſe were good courſes to be uſed within both the letter and ſence of theſe Laws: And this courſe was uſed by the Four and twenty Jurators in <hi>Kent</hi> in <hi>Rumney Marſh,</hi> who always upon their Oaths ſet <note place="margin">Chart. of Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> down every particular mans ground in certain, and their juſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 50.</note> quantities, and accordingly were the parties ſeverally taxed.</p>
               <p>Howſoever the Tax in my opinion generally impoſed upon the town is good, as appears by many Authorities and Books before remembred, even by this Statute, as well as by Cuſtom; for in the ſaid Book of the 37 and 38 <hi>lib. Aſsiz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">37 <hi>and</hi> 31 <hi>lib. Aſſiz.</hi>
                  </note> it doth not appear that the Townſhips there rated were ſo taxed by any Cuſtom, but meerly by the Law of the Land; and ſo is the learning delivered to be in the Councels Order aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And I do remember, that at the Aſſizes held at <hi>Lincoln</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 12. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> in a Tryal before Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> then Judge of Aſſize, in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Philip Conisby</hi> Knight, the town of <hi>Mauton</hi> was aſſeſſed five pounds, and <hi>Twigmore</hi> as much, and a diſtreſs was taken for non-payment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and was juſtified in a Replevin, and the verdict paſſed for the diſtrainer, and no great ſcruple was then made of the ſaid Aſſeſs laid and impoſed generally upon the towns; which Caſe I ſpecially noted, becauſe it was tryed and paſſed for current before the ſaid Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> who had the year before reported the Law in his <hi>Tenth Report</hi> to the contrary. And I am alſo of Opinion, that if a new defence be agreed to be made, as a Wall, Bank, Sewer or any other, and a Seſſe is appointed for this work, and laid upon a town, That the ſame is a good Seſſe and well laid, as well as in the Caſe of old repairs, where Cuſtom may give Warrant unto it, and the Commiſſioners in their diſcretion may ſo do in imitation of the ſaid former rules and preſidents, and it ſtands with good wiſdom and diſcretion to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40438:54"/>
imitate and follow ancient and approved Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made in Parliament, which are done by the wiſdom of the whole Realm: And in my conceit a decree made which hath no reference or dependency to former preſidents, may be doubted whether it be legitimate or not, having no ancient Laws to patronize it. And thus I conclude my third point of my Caſe, That a Townſhip may be taxed by the Laws of Sewers.</p>

               <head>Tythes.</head>
               <p>HEre is likewiſe in my Caſe a Parſon Rated and Seſſed for his Tythes, and is now to be put to the queſtion, whether by theſe Laws he may be taxed for them, or not. The ancient Commiſſions of this kinde have very ſtrict words in them to tie every one to the charge of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, being for the preſervation of the Commonweal; and this Statute extends it ſelf with a long and large arme to fetch and reach every man that hath grounds lying within the Level, and which partake of the good which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences brings to them, to be contributory to the charge.</p>
               <p>It is true that Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual perſons, as Parſons &amp; Vicars hold their Eccleſiaſtical living exempt <hi>ab omni one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſeculari,</hi> for they do not hold their Churches of any Lord, but of the Lord of Heaven, in reſpect of the ſpiritual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they do therefore: And I take it, that Parſons and Vicars hold not their Churches in free alms, for then the Founder ſhould be their Lord in point of Tenure and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which I have not obſerved to be ſo in any: And in our Law Books it appears, that Spiritual perſons were exempted from Lay and Temporal charges, as in <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 14. <hi>A Spiritual perſon ſhall not be amerced according to his Spiritual living:</hi> In <hi>Fitz.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40438:54"/>

                  <hi>the Tenth in Iſrael for an Inheritance;</hi> and yet the <hi>Levites</hi> paid a Tenth thereout to the Prieſts; and ſo Clergymen in times paſt paid a Tenth to the Pope; and in imitation, or rather in reformation thereof by the Statute of 26 <hi>H. cap.</hi> 3. the <note place="margin">26 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> like is now paid to the King, as Supreme head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Church here on earth: So here be charges paid out of the Tythes, but they be Spiritual charges. And in Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Hiſtory of Tythe <hi>pag.</hi> 13. it appears by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Connexion of Stories divine, That the firſt or <note place="margin">Selden.</note> the firſt year Tythe was paid to the <hi>Levite,</hi> The ſecond to Feaſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the third to the Poor: And had not the Statute of 43 of <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. made the Parſon and the Vicar liable and chargeable to the relief of the Poor, which was in imitation as it ſeemeth of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, they had not been bound or tyed to do the ſame; for it is held to be more charity to relieve the Church then the Poor: And in payment of Taxes and Subſidies they are granted in their Convocation houſe, a Councel meerly conſiſting of the Clergy, and then are confirmed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40438:55"/>
of which houſe alſo they are a Member. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my opinion, ſeeing Tythes are ſo ſacred a duty, that a Lay-man could not have any help for at the Common Law, and were exempt from temporal and prophane uſes, I am therefore of opinion, That they are not to be rated or tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the general words of theſe Laws; Yet I am of opinion, that Tythes in the hand of a Temporal or Lay-man are to be rated by theſe Laws, for when they are come into his hands <hi>Tunc res ſpirituales fiunt temporales &amp; tranſeunt decimae in Catalla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I muſt here leave theſe Eccleſiaſtical perſons and their Church livings: There is another point of this Law will reach unto ſome of their poſſeſſions, as to their Gleab Lands which belong to their Churches, and their Meadow and Paſture grounds, for theſe be not ſacred, as Tythes be, But came to them by the benevolent gifts of Laymen, and not <hi>ex duo dei &amp; evangelii</hi> as Tythes did; and ſo they took that burthen with them from the Lay-donor, which after may be impoſed upon them: And therefore ſuch Parſons, Vicars or other Spiritual perſons which hold a plough Land in <hi>Culture,</hi> are chargable by the Statute of 2 <hi>Mar.</hi> towards the repair of the highways, as other Lay men be: But in that Statute there be Eccleſiaſtical Officers uſed, as Churchwardens, whereby it was conceived, that that Statute had an eye to bring Eccleſiaſtical perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of it: And ſo for their houſes and grounds I take them to be within theſe Laws of the Sewers, for the own Lands are alſo chargeable thereunto, and yet on earth within His Dominions He is ſaid to be <hi>caput Eccleſiae,</hi> and as much reaſon were it to exempt His poſſeſſions as theris, if the reſpect of the perſon ſhould bear any ſuch ſway in the Caſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo I do finde by divers ancient Records, That Abbeys, Priories, and other Spiritual poſſeſſions, have been charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the repair of Bridges, Calceys, Banks and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, by Cuſtom and Preſcription,, as appeareth alſo by the Books of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 82, 83. <hi>and</hi> 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz.</hi>

Title <hi>Bar. pl.</hi> 301. and I take it, that by a very expreſs and ſpecial Cuſtom or Preſcription, a portion of Tythes in a Clergy mans hand may be charged with the the repairs of Bridges, Ways, Walls or Sea Banks, but not without a direct affirmative Cuſtom; for I ſuppoſe that they may as well indure a charge in this kinde, as a charge in a <hi>Modus decimandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo I conclude this part of the Caſe, That the perſon was not to be ſeſſed for his Tythes by the general words of of this Law.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>A Copyholder.</head>
               <p>HEre is alſo a Copyholder taxed within my Caſe for his Copyhold Land, and whether he for his Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the Lord for the Freehold of that ſoil, ſhall be aſſeſſed therefore, is another queſtion.</p>
               <p>A Copyhold by the Cuſtom of the Manor yieldeth and affordeth to the Lord Seigniory Rent, Fines due upon admittances, and ſuch like duties; but the Copyholder hath the real and viſible profits of the ſoil, &amp; therefore both Lord &amp; Copyholder receive <hi>Et commodum &amp; ſalvationem,</hi> by the ſaid defences: And therefore the words of this Law be exceeding copious and full in this point of ſeſſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> To inquire who hath and holdeth any Lands or Tenements, or Common of paſture, or fiſhing, or hath or may have any hurt, or damage or loſſe by any means, in or near the ſaid places; and in this caſe the Lord holdeth the ſaid Land in Tenure, though not in <hi>Culture,</hi> and many ways may have hurt and damage; As if the Copyhold were overflowed by the Sea, the Lord ſhould loſe his Freehold of the ſoil, his Seigniory, yearly Rents and Fines for admittances, and all other <hi>perqueſites:</hi> So that the ſaid words of this Stature beat mainly upon him. But as there be reaſons to be urged againſt him, ſo there be matters to exempt him from this charge, and to lay the burthen on the Copyholder.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, though he be Lord of the Copyhold, yet he is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40438:56"/>
ſeized of the Freehold thereof, but in Imagination and conſtruction of the Law, for the Copyholder is pernor and taker of the viſible and ſubſtantial profits.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the charge of repairs reſpect the poſſeſſioner <hi>in preſenti,</hi> which is eaſie to be found out, and not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary  owners as the Lord is.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>But for the Copyholder it may be objected, that he is not within this Statute; for in <hi>Heidons</hi> Caſe in Sir <hi>Edward</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hcidons</hi> Caſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Cooks</hi> 3 <hi>Report,</hi> it is truly ſaid, <hi>That a Copyholder is not within the Laws and Statutes which alter the Service, Tenure, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Land, or other thing in prejudice of the Lord;</hi> and this is the cauſe that a Copyholders Lands cannot be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or put in execution upon the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter the Second,</hi> nor in extent upon the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel</hi> and <hi>De mercatoribus,</hi> for if they ſhould, then might the Sheriff make the Lord new Tenants, without ſurrender and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittances, which is contrary to Cuſtom, the life and eſſence of all Copyholds; yet there is another good rule put in the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Heidon,</hi> that is, <hi>That where a Statute is made for the general good and wealth of the Realm, and that no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice can come to the Lord by alteration of Tenure, Service, Eſtate or Cuſtom, there Copyholds may well be within thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;</hi> Therefore now it is to be conſidered, whether this Statute of Sewers will in any ſort hurt or prejudice the Lord or no; for it is certain, that theſe Laws tend as much to the wealth and welfare of this Realm, as any can do; and in rating and aſſeſſing theſe Copyholds to the repairs of Banks, Walls and Sewers, &amp;c. it alters
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40438:56"/>
neither the Copyholders intereſt, nor the Lords Tenure, nor doth it in any ſort prejudice the cuſtom of the Manor.</p>
               <p>But then it may be objected, That if ſeſſe be impoſed upon a Copyholder for his Land, and be not paid, theſe Laws gives ſale of Lands, which indeed is the onely clauſe of this Statute which is material, to exempt a Copyholder out of theſe Laws; for clearly I take it, That Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Sewers have no power to decree the Copyhold Land away for non-payment of the ſeſſe: Yet I am of opinion, that a Copyholder, though he be not within that part of the Statute which giveth ſale of Lands, yet he is within the other part thereof, for divers Reaſons.</p>
               <p>One I finde by experience, and in divers preſidents, that many Copyholds have been and be charged with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of Bridges and other defences in divers parts of this Realm by cuſtoms: Alſo if a Lord grant a Copyhold to <hi>I.S.</hi> and his heir by Copy <hi>Tenendum</hi> by the repairs of ſuch a Wall, Bank or Bridge, this bindes this Copyhold thereto in point of charge.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, this Statute bindes ſuch to the repairs which may have good by the doing, or hurt by the neglect: And it is apparant, that by over flowing or inundation, a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders Land ſuſtains equal damage with other Lands; and for theſe Reaſons I reſolve that a Copyhold is within theſe Laws: And ſhortly touching Copyholds, I do confine them to theſe four heads.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the Lord of the Copyhold is not to be  taxed for the Soil of the Copyhold; for although he might come to it by forfeiture committed, yet that is a forain poſſibility: and although he be ſeized in Law of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, yet becauſe the Iſſues and Profits go with the Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, this Law therefore will not charge him for the Soil.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in reſpect the Copyhold rent is a rent of Aſſize,

and rents be within the expreſs letter of this Statute, and becauſe his rents by the overflowing of the Sea be loſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſhall be aſſeſſed for it if it be of value.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I am of opinion, that a Copyhold may not  be ſold by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, and yet Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders be within other parts of this Law.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it is a high point in this Statute, in what maner to rate, tax and aſſeſſe by the judicious power of theſe Laws: and in regard my Caſe toucheth all maner of Seſſes and Rates which be or may be impoſed by theſe Laws, I will therefore ſpread it abroad: and I do intend to treat of what Lands and other things are to be aſſeſſed, towards the repairs in my Caſe, and what perſons to be aſſeſſed, and in what degree.</p>

               <p>The Caſe of the Proxies in the <hi>Iriſh Reports</hi> doth in my Opinion in reaſon reſemble this Caſe; for the Caſe was <note place="margin">Caſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies.</note> there, <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Meath <hi>in</hi> Ireland <hi>had a Proxy of fifteen ſhillings payable out of the Commandry of</hi> Kells, <hi>then parcell of the poſſeſsions of St.</hi> Johns, <hi>all which came to the Crown by the diſſolution of Monaſteries in that Kingdom; and after the ſaid Biſhop granted the ſaid Proxies to Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and after Q.</hi> Elizabeth <hi>made a Leaſe of the Commandry to Dr.</hi> Forth, <hi>reſerving a yearly Rent, without mentioning the Proxy;</hi> And it was there reſolved, <hi>That Doctor</hi> Forth <hi>the Leſſee for years ſhould be at the charge to pay the ſaid Proxy, with all the arrera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof which did incur in his time:</hi> And ſo in the caſe of a Rent charge, the Leſſee is chargeable, and he is to pay the Tythes, and the Compoſition money due therefore: So that theſe Caſes ſway ſtrongly againſt the Leſſee for years,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40438:60"/>
to lay the whole charge upon him, and to exempt the Leſſor.</p>
               <p>But yet we muſt here diſtinguiſh and make a difference between Annual repairs in ordinary things, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary repairs for to furniſh the defence with petty reparations, they ſhall be laid only upon the Leſſee for years or for life; but if a new Wall, Bank or Goat, or Sewer be to be built new, and erected; or if the ancient defences be decayed in the main timber, or in the principal parts thereof, here as well the Leſſor as the Leſſee ſhall be put to the charge, for theſe things be not ordinary and annual charges, but do reach from the beginning of the Leaſe to the top of the Inheritance: as for petty reparations they are by intendment to continue but for a ſhort time, which are likely to be ſpent during the term and leaſe; but theſe new defences are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly done to ſave the Inheritance: And this difference holds good correſpondency with other Caſes in our Law, as in 49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 1. and 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Dyer fol.</hi> 198. and in <note place="margin">49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 3 <hi>Eliz. Dier.</hi>
                  </note> that Book again <hi>fol.</hi> 134. and in divers other Books it is holden for Law, That if a houſe in Leaſe decay in the Groundſels, Poſt or Balk, in the great timber, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect wearing by tract of time, and not in default of the Leſſee; the Leſſee may take and cut up timber growing on the grounds leaſed to repair the ſame, and the Leſſee ſhall be at charges of workmanſhip, for the repairs are in matter of right, and do the Leſſee good during his Leaſe, and the Leſſor after the expiration thereof: And becauſe theſe great repairs extend to both their goods, therefore they ſhall both be contributory thereto: But if a houſe be decayed in ſplinting, thack, walling, or in ſuch petty matters, the Leſſee for years ſhall be at the ſole charge, for theſe may be ſpent in his own time.</p>
               <p>So I ſuppoſe my meaning is herein well perceived, which is, That in petty, annual and ordinary repairs, the Leſſee alone ſhall do the ſame; but where the ſame wants in great timber, or when a new defence is to be built, they ſhall both be at the charge: And with this the Statute of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40438:60"/>
7 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 20. doth directly in reaſon agree withal; out of <note place="margin">7 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 20.</note> which Statute it is plainly to be obſerved, that in the great repairs, as alſo in the new building, as well the Leſſor as the Leſſee ſhall be both at the charge: Yet in the Statute of 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. there is a clauſe in effect, <hi>That all Lots, Scots and ſums of money hereafter to be rated by the Commiſsioners of Sewers upon the Kings Lands, ſhall be gathered or levied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs on thoſe grounds as in caſe of other perſons; and that all Bills of acquittance ſigned with the hand of ſuch Receiver or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, ſhall be a ſufficient Warrant to the Auditors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and other the Kings Officers, for allowance to the Farmer or Tenant to the Kings Majeſty;</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the Farmer of the King ſhall not be at the charge, but His Majeſty; yet by the Statute 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 9. it may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that the Leſſor for years ſhall be charged, but all <note place="margin">13 <hi>Eliz cap.</hi> 9.</note> theſe are to be reconciled with my ſaid diverſity.</p>
               <p>But now it may be objected to me; <hi>Sir do you think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or poſsible for Commiſsioners of Sewers to take notice at the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nota.</note> 
                  <hi>firſt of every private mans inheritance, and the ſeveral Eſtates which the parties have therein, when it will ſcarce be poſsible by private ſearch to finde them out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That it is not reaſonable to tie the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to ſuch difficult and obſcure buſineſſes; but it is ſufficient for the Commiſſioners to impoſe or lay the rate, tax or ſeſſe on the grounds, or on the viſible poſſeſſors thereof: and if the money ſo rated be demanded on the Leſſee for years, or for life; or if the goods be diſtrained therefore, or they be compelled to pay the ſame, then they may come before the Commiſſioners, and ſhew forth their leaſe, and make it appear, that <hi>I. S.</hi> hath the Reverſion, and as the caſe is, to be charged as well as himſelf; and upon due proof thereon made, the Commiſſioners upon hearing the parties on both ſides may apportion the tax on either of them, as in Juſtice, Diſcretion and true Judgement is requiſite. And ſo if a tax be ſet upon Land, the owner may come in before the Commiſſioners, and make it to appear before them, that <hi>I. D.</hi> hath a common, and Rent thereout; and upon proof
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40438:61"/>
thereof made, the Commiſſioners are to lay the charge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: And ſo it ſhall not tie the Commiſſioners at the firſt to lay the charge upon every particular perſon, for that were <hi>opus in finitum &amp; impoſsibile,</hi> but to relieve the parties upon their complaint; and this may be eaſily done, and it ſtands with the Juſtice of theſe Laws ſo to do: And if the parties grieved will not complain for relief, let it be juſtly accompted their own folly, and no injuſtice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; for the very Statute directs, that ſuch as are <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 12.</note> grieved ſhall have relief upon their complaints, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my opinion in this point.</p>

               <head>Taxes, Rates and Seſſments impoſed meerly by the Laws of Sewers.</head>
               <p>I Have formerly put nine ſeveral matters to tie men to the repairs, and this, by the Laws of Sewers is the laſt, but not the leaſt of them: I propoſe theſe to be by the Laws of Sewers, becauſe they be not backed, helped, aided or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by Cuſtoms, Preſcriptions Common right, or by any other Rule of the Common Law, or by Tenure or Covenant, or any act of the party, as all the reſt be, but are only compoſed, made, ordered and directed by the ſole power and authority of theſe Laws of Sewers: and theſe are ſuch as fall out of all the fomer rules, and therefore <hi>in nova cauſa novum remedium eſt adhibendum:</hi> But yet before I enter into my own works, I will ſet down and declare the opinions delivered in <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Keighleys</hi> Caſe, which ſeemed one of them oppoſite to the other: for in <hi>Rooks</hi> Caſe it is ſaid, <hi>That if one be bound in reſpect of his Lands to repair a Wall or Bank by Tenure, Preſcription or otherwiſe, that yet the Commiſsioners of Sewers could not aſſeſs the ſaid party alone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the ſame; and ſaid, that the Commiſsioners were not tied to the Rules of Preſcription, Tenure, Cuſtom or otherwiſe, but ought to aſſeſs all the Level to do the ſame, which are to have good thereby:</hi> But this being miſtaken, is very juſtly and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered in the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Keighley</hi> by the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40438:61"/>
for how could it be preſumed, that the learned makers of this worthy Law would have ſtricken down at one blow ſo many thouſand Preſcriptions, Cuſtoms, Tenures, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and uſes, as be within this Realm, which be tied and bound to do and make the repairs in this kinde, ſome in conſideration of houſes and land, others for yearly Rents, and for other cauſes, which to have ſet at liberty, and to have impoſed the charge on the Levellers, would have wrought and brought a wondrous innovation, change and alteration in theſe works; all which by this expoſition are freed and ſaved: But yet there be certain Caſes which of meer neceſſity lay the charge upon the Level, which are as follows:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The charge upon the Level.</head>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> FIrſt, if any grounds were heretofore by Cuſtom, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, Tenure or otherwiſe obliged and bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair any  Wall, Bank, River, Sewer, Goat, Sluce, Jetty, or other Defence, which grounds ſo charged have been of late devoured and overflown by the Sea, and ſo remain; The Commiſſioners of Sewers are in that caſe tied to lay the charge now upon the Level, which ſtand in danger of taking hurt by the not making the repairs, or which are to receive good by the doing thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, alſo if <hi>A. B.</hi> be bound by the Tenure of his land to repair a Bridge, Calcey or Bank, and he dieth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out  heirs, whereby the Land eſcheateth to the Lord of the Fee, in this Caſe the Tenure is ended, and the chief Lord is not bound to the repairs, and therefore now the charge muſt lie on the the Level, and ſo is the Law if this Tenure had been in other ſort extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, where no perſons or grounds can be known, which ought to make the repairs by Tenure, Preſcription,  Cuſtom, Covenant or otherwiſe, then the Commiſſioners of Sewers are to lay the charge on the Level.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, if <hi>John à Stile</hi> be chargeable to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40438:62"/>
and be not able to do the ſame, here the Level are to be charged to aſſiſt him therein, as appears in <hi>Keighleys</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, if <hi>I. S.</hi> by reaſon of his Lands or otherwiſe be tied to repair the Sea bank, but the hazard is ſo apparant dangerous to the country, that <hi>I. S.</hi> in all likelihood cannot  repair the ſame: and ſo the country might be in danger to be overflown ere <hi>I. S.</hi> alone could do it, here alſo the country on that Level are to be rated and taxed towards the ſame: <hi>Keighleys</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, if the Sea at the Spring tides, or at extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſual ſwelling Tides or Floods, have broke down the fences, and overthrown the Banks, and drowned the  country without any default in the party who was tied to have repaired the ſame; the Level ſhall in this caſe make up the breach, for things which happen extraordinarily by the Sea or great waters, which neither policy of man could prevent, nor induſtry or force could reſiſt, are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed irevitable and undefenceable, and ſo is the Law in the Caſe of Leſſee for years or for life if they ſuffer by neglect their Banks or Walls to be broken down, and their grounds ſurrounded, they be puniſhable in an Action of Waſte: But if thoſe grounds by the extraordinary rage and violence of the Sea or waters be born down, and their grounds ſurrounded thereby, they are in this caſe freed from all Waſtes; and in proof thereof the Caſe in 28 and 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dier fol.</hi> 33. is much to this purpoſe, where one <note place="margin">28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dier.</hi>
                  </note> made a Leaſe for years of grounds to <hi>I. S.</hi> lying near the River of <hi>Eye,</hi> and the Leſſee covenanted to repair the Banks of the River to preſerve the Meadow from ſurrounder; yet after an extraordinary flood, the Banks were broken down, and the Meadows were ſurrounded, and it was there holden to be no breach of Covenant. <hi>Nota,</hi> this was in <note place="margin">☞</note> the Caſe of a freſh River, whereby in this Caſe the Law muſt lay the charge of the Level, if any danger be likely to enſue by the protracting of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, if one do hold his Land by the yearly pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ten ſhillings towards the repair of a Wall, if this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40438:62"/>
money will not defray the charge, the reſt muſt be laid on the Level.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, if a new Wall or Bank be to be erected, or a  new Sewer, Trench or River to be caſt, or Sluce or new Goat to be built, in theſe caſes the Commiſſioners muſt lay the charge on the Level which are to take benefit thereby, as well for new building thereof, as with the maintaining of them: for in the Caſe of new defences there can be no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, Cuſtom or Tenure bound to do the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And laſtly, In caſe there be a great Port in the country, by the which the whole country hath benefit; for the Ports  and Havens as hath been ſaid, be <hi>Oſtia &amp; januae Regni,</hi> and are the defences to the whole country <hi>tempore pacis &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore belli,</hi> and are theſe places, by means whereof the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land countreys be made partakers of the ſea Commodities; therefore in my opinion, the extraordinary repairs of theſe be not altogether tyed to the Level, as in other caſes, nor to Preſcription or Cuſtom of repairing, which extends but to ordinary defects, but upon great and urgent neceſſities: for the ſafety of the Port, upon the welfare whereof the ſafety of the country doth depend, the whole country are obliged and bound to contribute towards the repairs, for theſe reaſons following:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for that in time of peace it is the Gate which  openeth it ſelf to let in from Foraign parts the Ships and Barques, which bring hither to this Iſland ſuch Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, Wares and Commodities, both for our profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as we have need to uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, at theſe Ports we ſhip out to Foraign Nations  our exceſs of Corn, Cloth, Skins, Lead and other Wares, wherewithal we do abound, and receive in truck therefore other things more uſeful and neceſſary for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in time of War we have ſhipping here for our Soldiers, and means at the eaſieſt charge to Tranſport them  to ſuch places as the King and Councel ſhall direct.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, in thoſe Ports are commonly great Havens, which are the chief receptacles of all our freſh waters, into
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40438:63"/>
which the waters which drown the grounds of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys adjoyning are conveyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And laſtly, it appears by divers Authors, that a country well furniſhed with Ports and Havens, is not more ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned  then honored thereby; and if it be as lawful as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to put a caſe of Chronicle Law upon it, in the 28 year <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Holingſhead</hi> Chronicles, it appeareth what great care the Queen and the Lords of the Privy Counſel, and the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hol.</hi> Cron.</note> Knights and Gentlemen of <hi>Kent</hi> took for the repairing of <hi>Dover</hi> Haven, what preparation was made for it, what moneys Levied, and how forward all the country was to effect that work, may be a Spectacle to others for to lend their helping hands to the maintaining of ſuch worthy works, being of all other the moſt Honorable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the moſt uſeful to the inriching thereof; for which cauſes in my opinion, becauſe the Mountains as well as the Valleys have both <hi>Salvationem defentionem &amp; commodum</hi> thereby, therefore in time of need the one as well as the other ſhould be charged by the power of this Commiſſion, to contribute to the extraordinary repairing of the ſame.</p>
               <p>I have now proceeded in this point of Seſs ſo far, that I take it, I may juſtly here make my full period of this days exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; and I have taken up the more time herein, becauſe thereupon a main part and ſtrength of this Law conſiſts: And therefore I will now apply my ſelf to my concluſion, in the which I have already proceeded ſo far, that I have made it in ſome ſort to appear, that ſome of the Seſſes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular are not well impoſed, as the Leſſee in caſe of the new defences was not alone chargeable, for that he in the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to contribute thereto, and that no impoſition ought to have been laid upon, the Parſon for his Tythes, but the owner of the Soil was to be charged for all; ſo that theſe two be already ruled for me: But yet if any of the Seſſes ſhould be good, then I ſhould fail in my concluſion; I ſhall therefore ſet forth in few words, that all the Seſſes are void.</p>
               <p>And the cauſe is this, That the draining of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40438:63"/>
waters in <hi>S.</hi> appeareth by my Caſe to be only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for <hi>S.</hi> and that <hi>D.</hi> the other town had no good thereby: And it appears alſo, that by the repairing of the ancient Sewer in <hi>D.</hi> that town only had benefit thereby, therefore to aſſeſs <hi>S.</hi> to repair in <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> to contribute to <hi>S.</hi> where in thoſe Caſes there could be no benefit, is directly againſt the letter and ſence of theſe Laws; but herein either of them ought to have been at charge with that, by the which it took benefit, and that not otherwiſe; and therefore the mixture marred all the matter: And ſo upon all this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my Arguments as I did my Caſe, that the new Bank, new River, and old Sewer were well decreed, but that the aſſeſs is void <hi>in toto &amp; in qualibet parte.</hi>

               <p>The true and due execution of all theſe in a juſt, legal, equal and qualified decree, requireth of all other parts of Law this greateſt and trueſt diſcretion, conſideration, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and judgement of the Commiſſioners: And I take it, it may ſtand as a ground infallible, that there be as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of puniſhments, as there be offences; It behooveth therefore the Commiſſioners to be circumſpect, that they apply to every offence his due puniſhment; for it is injuſtice to puniſh the offence committed in a wrong degree, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a Traytors judgement upon a Fellon, or a Fellons judgement upon a Traytor, is grand miſpriſion; to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the body, or to fine the perſon, where an Amerciament is onely due, is not onely injuſtice in the Commiſſioners, but thereby alſo their diſcretions are to be drawn in queſtion and cenſured.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the Statute doth ſo much lie upon diſcretion of the Commiſſioners, as in many parts of this Law it is mentioned; It ſeemeth the Parliament did give them to underſtand, That ſuch as were to meddle in thoſe affairs, ſhould be both diſcreet and wiſe, and ſhould ſtrive to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come learned in thoſe affairs.</p>
               <p>And therefore for the better furniſhing of them with the true underſtanding of the ſaid parts of this Statute, I have framed a Caſe thereupon, which doth give juſt occaſion to treat fully of them all.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Firſt Point.</head>
               <p>I did not intend it a point of any importance in my Caſe, Whether Land might belong to an Office; for that in the 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 28. in Sir <hi>Robert Crofts</hi> Caſe, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it might: For there Land did belong to the Office <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> of a Foreſter, and might belong to the Office of the Warden of the Fleet, and alſo to a Corody which was no Office, and theſe, as well as to a ſpiritual Office, Parſon, Vicar, Prebend or ſuch like; but whether or no theſe Lands might be parted from the office by alienation, I thought that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentable point: in 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer f.</hi> 2. <hi>Empſons</hi> caſe it is ſaid, <note place="margin">6 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> if the King create a Duke, &amp; grant to him an anuity to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Dignity, that Annuity was ſo incident to his Dignity as it could not be ſevered therefrom; and ſo of Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40438:66"/>
to a Parſon, Vicar, Biſhop or ſuch like, becauſe they were given to the maintenance of them in their places, and therefore if theſe were ſevered, they might be recontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to their Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>And in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Henry Nevil</hi> in <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> an Office of a Parker was granted to two, and an Annuity for the exerciſe of it; and it is there reſolved, that the Annuity might not be ſevered from the Office: and ſo it might be ſaid in my Caſe, That the Mannor which belongs to the Office was at the firſt laid thereto, or given therewithal for the maintenance of the Officer in his place by the Founder, and ſo may not be ſevered therefrom without his conſent. And touching the intailing of the Office of the Ranger of a Foreſt, it is held in <hi>Mancels</hi> Caſe in the Comment of Mr. <hi>Plowden,</hi> that the Office of a Bayliff or Receiver of the Rents of a Mannor may be intailed; So an uſe and a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, becauſe theſe concerned and depended upon Land. But the Office of the Maſter of the Hawks, or the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Horſe could not be given in Tail within the Statute of Weſt. 2. <hi>de donis conditionalibus,</hi> nor an Annuity which chargeth the perſon; Yet all theſe may be given or granted within theſe intailed limitations, but yet they are no intails within that Statute.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, That the Office of a Ranger of a Foreſt cannot of it ſelf be given in Tail, but having a Mannor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, make the queſtion of more moment; For as the Office <hi>Deſe</hi> is not intailable, ſo the Land <hi>per ſe</hi> may be intail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But Land in our caſe is not the principal, but the acceſſary <hi>&amp; acceſſorium ſequitur ſuum principale;</hi> and therefore ſeeing the Land follows the Office, as the ſhadow doth the body, and paſſeth out of his own kinde by the ceremony belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Office, and not by the ceremony by which Land is transferred and paſſed, I ſhould therefore take it, that the Eſtate of the Land ſhould be ſuch as the Office of it ſelf might bear, which could not be intailed; yet becauſe in the ſaid Caſe of the Foreſter, with Land belonging to it, is taken to be in Tail in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. aforeſaid, with a remainder <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:40438:67"/>
thereof over in Fee, I am therefore concluded to make any further queſtion of it, and ſo I leave it as I found it, and do paſſe to the argument of the other points.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Second Point.</head>
               <p>The ſecond Common Law Point is, Whether this gift in my Caſe be a Frank-mariage or another intail; I have obſerved in Books that there be five things incident to a gift in Frank-mariage <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it muſt be to or with a Coſin within the four  degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the word <hi>Frank-mariage</hi> muſt be literally expreſſed. </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Reverſion muſt be left at the time of the gift in the donor; and then there be two other things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low  as conſequents.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, acquital of payment of Rents and ſervices. </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And Fiftly, warranty to ſecure the Eſtate. </p>
               <p>And the want of theſe or any of theſe in the creation doth deſtroy that Eſtate in the conception.</p>
               <p>Here ſeems to be two Impediments in my Caſe to hinder this gift to take root as a Frank mariage; It is made <hi>abnepti,</hi> which is the Coſin in the fourth degree, and the laſt in thoſe gifts, whereby the gift that way cannot have his full opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that the firſt Heir of their bodies is out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer priviledges: But in regard I take it that a Frank mariage doth more reſpect his original creation <hi>In incepto</hi> then the deſcent of the priviledges to the Heirs <hi>In ſuo progreſſu,</hi> I take this to be no impediment to hinder this from being a gift in Frank mariage. But here the words in the gift preceding the words <hi>Frank mariage</hi> do differ much from it, for by the ſpecial limitation the Heirs Females ſhall inherit with the Heirs Males, <hi>Simul &amp; Semel</hi> as Heirs in common; But in the Caſe of the Frank mariage Heirs Males ſhall firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit ſingle, and for want of them then the Females.</p>
               <p>I do agree the Law, that in caſes where the ſpecial words of limitation may in conſtruction be made to agree with the word, and limitation of Art contained in Frank mariage,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40438:67"/>
the gift ſhall be taken a Frank mariage, as in the Caſe of 2<hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>It. ſuff. Fitz. Mordanc. plac.</hi> 52. where Lands were given <note place="margin">2 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</note> in Frank mariage to <hi>R. S. cum Alicia ſorore le donor it a quod poſt mortem dictae Aliciae &amp; puerorum ſuorum,</hi> the Land ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the donor; and this was adjudged a Gift in Frank mariage, and the words <hi>It a quod</hi> were holden of no validity; neither will the words of <hi>Reſervandum Redendum Tenendum</hi> or <hi>Warrantizandum;</hi> though they vary from the nature of a Frank mariage, yet they ſhall not deſtroy the ſame as an <hi>Habendum</hi> may do, which is the word whoſe proper place is to create the Eſtate: and therefore if any thing come therein, which is repugnant thereunto, the ſame will alter the quality of the gift: And with this agreeth the Caſe in 45 <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. Title <hi>Tail</hi> 14 and 31. where Lands were given to <hi>I. S.</hi> in Frank mariage with <hi>B.</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">45 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note> of the donor <hi>Habendum</hi> to them and their heirs, and this was held a Fee ſimple, and no Frank mariage. And the like Law is where Lands are granted in Frank mariage, the remainder in Fee to <hi>I. S.</hi> and his heirs; the Frank mariage is defeated by the opinion in <hi>Br.</hi> Caſes and ſo in my Caſe, becauſe there can be no reconciliation between the ſpecial words of limitation in my Caſe, and the word Frank mariage: I am therefore of opinion, that this gift is an Eſtate in Tail, according to the ſpecial limitation, and no Frank mariage.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Third Point.</head>
               <p>Whether the Baſtard ſhall inherit to have an Eſtate in Tail, is the third Common Law queſtion; for I am clear of opinion, that a Baſtard cannot inherit to a gift in Frank mariage, becauſe adultery and fornication, which is the ſeed of every Baſtard is oppoſite to mariage, and in breach of that powerful link and knot of Matrimony, which is an Ordinance derived from the Divine power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: And therefore ſeeing mariage is the material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſuch a gift, Baſtardy the oppoſite can never (being out of the conſideration) come within the priviledges to inherit this Eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:40438:68"/>
So if I give Lands to <hi>I.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> and to the heirs of their two bodies lawfully begotten, their Baſtard cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to this gift, becauſe he is not heir of their two bodies lawfully begotten; But if the word <hi>Lawfully</hi> had been out of the limitation, then I ſee no reaſon but that a Baſtard may inherit to an Eſtate in Tail, as to a Fee ſimple condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, which he might have done at the Common Law, ſeeing an Eſtate Tail may be made before mariage, as expecting to be confirmed thereby; and ſo a Baſtard born before mariage is by the conſummation of a ſucceeding Mariage made capable to inherit to them, if his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion continue without diſturbance to his death: Yet in <hi>Plow. Com. fol.</hi> 57. in <hi>Winbiſh</hi> and <hi>Tailboys</hi> Caſe, it is ſaid, <hi>That if there be a Baſtard, Eigne and Mulier puiſne, and the Baſtard after the death of the Anceſtor entreth into intailed Lands, and dyeth ſeized, this doth not binde the Mulier in caſe of Eſtates Tail, as it doth in an Eſtate of Fee ſimple:</hi> and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Authority in the point, 39 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>plac. ultimo,</hi> where the Caſe is, <hi>That Lands were given in Tail to</hi> I. S. <hi>the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">39 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>in Tail to</hi> C. <hi>and</hi> I. S. <hi>hath Iſſue by a woman a Baſtard, and dyeth ſeized, and then the Baſtard dyeth ſeized, having Iſſue, he in the Remainder may recover the Land againſt the Iſſue of the Baſtard;</hi> affirming, <hi>That the continuance of poſſeſsion in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſhall not be prejudicial to him in Remainder:</hi> To which Opinion I do ſubſcribe, becauſe he in the Remainder is a ſtranger in blood, and ſo cannot be concluded as the Mulier ſhall be; for a Mulier indeed is like a graft drawn out of both the bloods of Father and Mother: ſo the Baſtard is a ſlip which is derived from the ſame Stock, and had his being therefrom.</p>
               <p>And for my own Opinion, conſidering the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>de Donis</hi> doth accept of Gifts in Tail made before Mariage, upon the hope and expectation of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Mariage to perfect the ſame, even ſo the Mariage ſucceeding to a Baſtards birth gives him and his Iſſue a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in theſe caſes of deſcent, which is denied to other Baſtards or meer Strangers. And I ſee no reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40438:68"/>
that maxime and principle of Law ſhould be altered by the ſaid Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. but becauſe <hi>Mountagues</hi> Opinion in Mr. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> ſways the other way; I will therefore ſubmit this Point to men of greater judgement then my own: So that if the Law fall out for the Baſtard Iſſue, then ſhe ſhould have title to the half part belonging to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and to no part belonging to the heirs Males: And with this Concluſion I do here end my Common Law Points, and will now reſort to the handling of my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Points.</p>

               <head>The Sewers are a Court of Iuſtice.</head>
               <p>I Am deſirous to attribute to this Law all the honor and dignity which may in any ſort belong to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am unwilling to forget any thing which may mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially tend to the upholding and maintaining thereof: wherein amongſt the reſt, and the chiefeſt of them all, it is, To prove the Commiſſioners of Sewers a Court of Juſtice: I know ſome Opinion hath been to the contrary, and held, That the Commiſſioners had only the power of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and not any Court; and I ſuppoſe much may be ſaid to maintain that opinion,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe in <hi>expreſsis terminis</hi> there is no Court or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained  by this Statute, or by any other, and without words expreſs in the point, they can have no Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, by preſidents in the like caſe it hath been held  no Court, as in the Caſe of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cooks</hi> 8 <hi>Report,</hi> The King granted to the Major and Commonalty <hi>Plenum &amp; integrum ſcrutinium gubernationem</hi>

And ſo if a Commiſſion iſſue out of the Chancery to examine matters in a Suit there depending, and to <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> the ſame, yet hereby theſe Commiſſioners have not any Court; for in that caſe the Commiſſion is derived out of the proper power of the Chancery, which is the Court, for that cauſe <hi>eo inſtante</hi> when it is in Commiſſion: And one Cauſe cannot <hi>uno eodem<expan>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, the chief reaſon wherefore I take it that  Commiſſioners of Sewers have a Court, is, Becauſe the Commiſſion of Sewers is a member of the ancient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Court of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> which was and is a Court of great eſteem, power and authority; and ſo it was needleſs to erect a new Court in this caſe, as it was needful to erect and found the Court of Wards and firſt Fruits, the firſt would elſe have remained in the Chancery, to the which primarily it did belong, and the other was a new reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and wanted a Court to direct or diſpoſe of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Commiſſioners have a Clerk proper to  themſelves to Regiſter their Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, the Commiſſioners have power to make Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Decrees, which are Judgements in effect, and  ſome of them cannot be reverſed but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And laſtly, Writs of Error have been brought to reverſe  Judgement given in that Court.</p>
               <p>For all which cauſes I do conclude, That the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Sewers have a Court of Record, although it be not holden <hi>in aliquo loco certo:</hi> So was the Kings Bench a Court of more Eminency then this; But <hi>ubicunque fueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Angliae,</hi> and for expreſs Authority in the point of

               <p>IT is a point of high conſequence, whether Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers have power by theſe Laws to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the body of a man for any thing touching the ſame, for that Impriſonment of the body ſeemeth to ſway ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt the grand Charter of <hi>England,</hi> and againſt the liberty of a free-born Subject; and it is ſaid in <hi>Bonhams</hi> caſe, 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>in Dyer,</hi> that liberty is a thing which the Law much favoreth: and I finde in our Books of Law, That the Judges have been very careful and curious, in not extending words contained in Charters to the Impriſonment of mens bodies, unleſs they were expreſs in the point: And therefore in <hi>Clerks</hi> caſe in Sir <hi>Ed.

               <p>In <hi>Godfreys</hi> Caſe in the 11 <hi>Report,</hi> there is a diſcourſe what <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Godfreys</hi> Caſe.</note> Courts have power to Impriſon, and which not, and there it is ſaid, Some Courts may Fine, but not Impriſon, as the Courts Leet and Sheriff turn; ſome others could neither Fine nor Impriſon, as Courts Baron and County Courts; and ſome could neither Fine, Impriſon nor Amerce, as Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts; And ſome may Impriſon and not Fine, as chief Conſtables at their Petty Seſſions for an affray done in diſturbance of them; And other Courts there were which might Fine, Impriſon and Amerce, as the eminent Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Impriſonment is not incident to every Court, nor to every offence; Yet I am of opinion that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers may Impriſon the body, for it is not only a Court of Record, but is authorized by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and I ſuppoſe that there be words in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Statute which will bear this conſtruction, which are as follow, <hi>viz.

               <p>And I have known the words of a Statute generally and promiſcuouſly put together, have been marſhalled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their diſtributive operations, as the Statute of 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. which is, <hi>That all Feoffments, Gifts, Grants, Releaſes and Confirmations of Lands made by</hi> Ceſtui que uſe <hi>ſhould be good;</hi> Yet though theſe words were generally put together, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the wiſe and diſcreet Sages and Expoſitors of our Laws have ſo Marſhalled the words of this Statute, that they made conſtruction thereof according to the Rules and reaſon of the Laws, That is, That <hi>Ceſtui que uſe</hi> in Poſſeſſion might make a Feoffment; and that <hi>Ceſtui que uſe</hi> in Reverſion or Remainder might grant the Land, and <hi>Ceſtui que uſe</hi> of a diſcontinued Eſtate might releaſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm: and yet the words of this Statute were general, howſoever Reaſon muſt be the Expoſitor, that every thing be done in due form of Law, and not in prepoſterous maner.</p>

               <p>If one oppoſe againſt a Law of Sewers not legally in queſtioning the ſame, but refractory contemning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or by diſſwading perſons aſſeſſed not to pay ſuch, or not to obey the Law, I am of opinion that a perſon is both Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Impriſonable; and if this be done <hi>in facie Curiae,</hi> it aggravates the contempt; and this is the Rebelling which this Statute ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>If one do refuſe to obey the Decree, Rule, Order of the Court, eſpecially if it be done in affront of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when they be in execution of their Commiſſion, This is a contempt, and he is to be impriſoned for ſuch his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and this agreeth with 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Termino Paſche</hi> 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> in the Kings Bench, the Caſe <note place="margin">37. <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note> there was in debate between <hi>Hitley</hi> and <hi>Carier,</hi> where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">12 <hi>Jac.</hi>
                  </note> Commiſſioners of Sewers in the counties of <hi>Huntington</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi> made a Law, That certain Townſhips in thoſe counties were aſſeſſed to a work of Sewers, and one town was rated to Five pounds; and becauſe the ſame was not paid, the Commiſſioners cauſed a Warrant to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the ſaid <hi>Carier,</hi> to diſtrain for it, and he diſtrained the cattel of <hi>Hetley</hi> one of the Inhabitants, and <hi>Hetley</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:40438:72"/>
brought an Action of Treſpaſs in the Kings Bench againſt <hi>Carier</hi> and arreſted him thereupon, and upon complaint made to Sir <hi>Anthony Mildmay,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Boyer</hi> Knights, and other the Commiſſioners of Sewers, they cauſed <hi>Hetley</hi> to be attached by their Warrant, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him till he ſhould releaſe his Actions brought againſt <hi>Carier,</hi> and until he ſhould be delivered out of the Priſon by Warrant to be granted by them: But afterwards <hi>Hetley</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a <hi>Habeas corpus cum cauſa</hi> out of the Kings Bench, and was removed, where all the ſaid matter appeared; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Attachments were awarded againſt the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; and Sir <hi>John Boyer</hi> appearing, was by <hi>Cook</hi> chief Juſtice, <hi>Crook, Dodderidg</hi> and <hi>Houghton,</hi> Juſtices, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Kings Bench Priſon, and was fined Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; but was after delivered <hi>Ex favore Regis ſed non ex Rigore Legis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in my opinion, The ſaid Commiſſioners in this caſe in making a Warrant to attache <hi>Hetley,</hi> and in impriſoning of him for the ſaid cauſes did exceedingly erre, and the rather, becauſe they took upon them to overrule the Juſtices of the Kings Bench, being of a higher and greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then they were of; But this is no preſident to impeach the power of the Commiſſioners of Sewers for committing perſons offending their authorities to Priſon, if their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings therein be conſonant to the Laws of this Realm; but they were puniſhed in this Caſe, not for executing their power, but for exceeding their limits, and the bounds of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>If a Collector, or Expenditor, or other Officer of Sewers have been negligent in the execution of his Office and place, he his fineable therefore, though his offence be but neglect, becauſe he was an Officer, and was alſo ſworn to execute the ſame duly.</p>
               <p>But I take it, a neglect in another ordinary perſon is not to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>And if one be rated to pay towards repairs, and he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to pay the ſame at the days and times appointed, he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40438:72"/>
is not fineable therefore, but is to be Amerced in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>If a Collector or Officer of Sewers do diſtrain a man, or do any other act contrary to an Inhibition of Sewers to him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, he may be fined and impriſoned <hi>&amp; ſimile factum fuit</hi> in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 33. <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note>

               <p>And a Purpreſture is taken to be an offence done to the King imediately, or to His poſſeſſions; But if the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <note place="margin">Purpreſture.</note> be done to a Subject or to his Lands, it is termed a <hi>Nuſans.</hi>

               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Mellefont</hi> was fined for erecting a Were in the royal River of <hi>Boyne</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is expreſſed in the <hi>Iriſh Reports</hi> in the Caſe of the Royal Piſchary of the Ban in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and this was a Purpreſture.</p>
               <p>If one do refuſe to accept an Office of Sewers, being thereto duly elected by the Commiſſioners, he is fineable therefore, for in <hi>Greſlies</hi> Caſe 8. <hi>Report,</hi> One being elected <note place="margin">

               <p>And if an Officer do miſdemean himſelf in his Office he is fineable, for in 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 6. A Tythingman did refuſe <note place="margin">10. <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note> to make Preſentment being thereto required, and he was fined therefore. So in caſe of the Sewers, if one of the Jury,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40438:73"/>
or which is a Surveyor, refuſe to make Preſentment when he is required by the Commiſſioners, he is to be fined. So if a Juror depart after he is ſworn on the Jury, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be ſworn, after his appearance be recorded, he is to be fined; And if an Expenditor or Collector, Officers of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, be required by the Court to accompt for the moneys received and laid out by them, and they refuſe, they may be puniſhed by fines.</p>
               <p>And if the Sheriff upon Writ or Warrant directed to him to return a Jury before the Commiſſioners, and he make no return thereof, nor doth not attend when he is required, he is to be fined by the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>Alſo an Officer of this Court is fineable for falſities done by him in his Office, for theſe are a violation of his Oath, and is a breach of that truſt which the Court repoſed in him at his election and entrance into his Office, and therefore the Offence is greater in him then in another man.</p>
               <p>I have learned in Books that a Fine hath theſe qualities with it:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the party in that caſe is impriſonable. </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the cauſe for which it is impoſed is not traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, being meerly the Act of the Court, but if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed  upon a preſentment found by Jury, then the cauſe is traverſable.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, all fines ought to be aſſeſſed, abated or increaſed  in <hi>Plena curia,</hi> and not elſwhere.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, every Fine ought to be reaſonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And therefore I ſhall put the Commiſſioners of Sewers  in minde as the Statute of 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap</hi> 1. did the Juſtices of Peace, that thoſe Fines that they ſhould impoſe for any <note place="margin">34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> offence coming before them ſhould be reaſonable, having reſpect to the quantity and quallity of the offence, for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſus in re qualibit jure reprobatur communi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe in <hi>Godfries</hi> Caſe it is ſaid, that <hi>Commitment of the body to Priſon is incident to a Fine, as by</hi> a Gapias pro Fine <hi>alſo may be collected;</hi> Yet I hold it queſtionable, whether the Fine ſhall precede the commitment, or the commitment the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40438:73"/>
Fine. But for my own opinion, I hold that this lyeth much in the diſcretion of the Juſtices, and I finde caſes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents both ways; for in 41 <hi>Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 12. an Officer was impriſoned <hi>quouſ<expan>
                        <am>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> finem fecerit,</hi> where the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preceded the fine: and with this agreeth 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 25. <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note> and in 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 21. one was fined, and after Impriſoned for it, and there the fine did precede the Impriſonment. <note place="margin">33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But upon all theſe I take the Law to be, that if one be fined, and this Fine may be levied by the Juſtices, as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace may do (but not Juſtices of Sewers) there the Impriſonment may be <hi>quouſ<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> finem fecit,</hi> becauſe the Fine is leviable by them: But the Law is not ſo of Commiſſioners of Sewers, becauſe they have no power to Levy but to extreat the Fines into the Kings Exchequer. Howſoever one before them may be both impriſoned and fined <hi>Diverſis tamen reſpectibus,</hi> The one for the wrong done, the other for the contempt or diſobedience to the Court; As for example, if one refuſe to be a Collector, he is finable to the King, becauſe hereby the Commonweal is without an Officer; and he may alſo be impriſoned for diſobeying the Juſtices command: and yet in my opinion it lieth much, if not altogether in the diſcretion of the Commiſſioners to impoſe or inflict both the ſaid puniſhments, or one of them, at their pleaſures, being not therein preciſely limited by this Statute.</p>

               <p>By which authorities it plainly appeareth, that Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be impoſed by a Jury, or by the Oaths of good and lawful men; and therefore I have heretofore much marvelled, when ſometimes I have ſeen Juſtices of Sewers take upon them to ſet down Amerciaments, without aſsiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Jury, which act of theirs was directly againſt the ſaid great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> and contrary to the ſaid authorities of Law.</p>
               <p>So that there is a difference between the impoſing of Fines which are done by the Juſtices, and Amerciaments which be by Jury, or otherwiſe, <hi>per ſacramentum parium:</hi> So is there great diverſity between the offences of the one kinde, and the other; For if one do ſuffer a Wall, Bank, or other work of Sewers to fall into decay for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, which he was bound to maintain by Frontage, Tenure, Cuſtom or Covenant, he is in this caſe to be Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therefore: And ſo if one be bound by any of the ſaid tyes to repair a Bridge, Calcey, Goat, Getty, Sluce, or to Cleanſe a River, if the ſame by his neglect be left undone or unrepaired, he is therefore amerceable. So if one be preſented for caſting Dirt, Sand, Ballaſt, or other anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into the Rivers or Streams, or for digging down the Banks, or for pulling down the Walls thereof; if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment do not expreſs the ſame to be done with force, or therein be wanting the word <hi>Purpreſture,</hi> the party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented is then but amerceable therefore: So when one is tyed to cleanſe the Rivers for paſſage of Boats and Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or for the draining of the waters, if he ſuffer Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds to lye and choak up the Channel, he is Amerceable, and not Fineable therefore; for no permiſſion, ſufferance, neglect or Nonfeaſans can be found to be by force, becauſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40438:74"/>
they conſiſt not <hi>in Agendo, &amp; ſic in ſimilibus caſibus;</hi> Yet ſome caſes following fall out of theſe rules <hi>pro ut ſequuntur.</hi> As if the violence of waters was ſo great, either by breaking in of the ſea in an extraordinary maner, or by a ſudden flood or inundation of freſh waters after a Rain, that thereby the defences are broken down, or cauſed Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds or other Nuſances to be, theſe being preſented, no man is Amerceable therefore, becauſe the ſame could not have been prevented by policy, nor reſiſted by ſtrength.</p>
               <p>In 42 <hi>lib. Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 15. a Preſentment was, <hi>That</hi> I. S. <note place="margin">42 <hi>lib. Aſſ.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>had ſuffered trees to grow into the water, and lay in the Stream, by reaſon whereof ſhips were hindred in their paſſage; and there was a Writ awarded directed to the Sheriff to remove the Nuſans:</hi> but <hi>Knivet</hi> Juſtice ſaid there, <hi>That</hi> I. S. <hi>ſhould not be Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe the Nuſans was no act of his, but the Trees grew ſo naturally of themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps it will be objected to me, Can no Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be ſet but by a Jury, or by the Oathes of twelve men?</p>
               <p>Yes, I am opinion it may be done by the preſentment of the Surveyors of the Sewers, for that is <hi>per Sacramentum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> as the Law appoints; and in a <hi>Nonſuit</hi> we ſee daily that in ſuch caſe the Plaintiff is to be amerced, and this Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be aſſeſſed by the Coroners of the county, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Greiſleys</hi> caſe; and ſo the words of the Statute and of the Law may herein be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Now I hope I have fully inſtructed the Commiſsioners, wherein they may learn whom to Impriſon, when to Fine, and how to Amerce in a legal and orderly ſort, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient and approved Rules of Law, and of the grand Charter; for in thoſe things they are to direct their diſcretions by the ſaid Rules, and they are to be guided thereby, and are not to proceed therein according to their own wills.</p>
               <p>And herein I ſhall conclude the ſecond point of this part of the Law, that is, That Commiſsioners of Sewers have power to Impriſon, to Fine, and to Amerce; And
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40438:75"/>
that <hi>B.</hi> for refuſing to obey their Order was juſtly impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>C.</hi> was as juſtly fined: And for the reaſons and cauſes aforeſaid, the Commiſsioners in their diſcretions, though the offences of both were alike, yet they had power to impriſon the one and to fine the other. And now I do intend to proceed to the fourth point of my Caſe, and the third point I intend to handle in a more convenient place.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Miniſterial, and ſuch Diſtreſſe is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Officers of theſe Laws, without any judgement directing the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and there is a Diſtreſs of Common right, not given nor awarded by Judgement in Court, or by Warrant of the Commiſſioners, but incident to the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of the Iudicial Diſtreſs which is awarded by the Court upon a preſentment found of a Nuſans, or in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of an aſſize of Nuſans, or in an Action of the caſe, as it appears by the 42 <hi>Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 15. 32 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 23. and 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 8. there a <hi>Diſtringas ad Amovendum</hi> ſhall be <note place="margin">32 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note> awarded to remove the Nuſans; and ſo in caſe of a decay preſented; As if <hi>I.

                  <p>Secondly, a Diſtreſs Miniſterial is where one is aſſeſſed or rated to pay a certain ſum of mony towards the repairing

of a Wall, Bank, Sewer or Goat; here upon Warrant from the Commiſſioners of Sewers, the Officer expreſſed in that Warrant may diſtrain the cattel of the party which ought to pay the ſaid Rate and Seſs, and which did neglect to pay the ſame: And yet where there is a Rate and Seſs impoſed upon one by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Collector or Officer may diſtrain therefore without any expreſs Warrant from the Commiſſioners ſo to do; and my reaſon is grounded upon the Statute, which is this, becauſe the Statute and Commiſſion which be the general Laws, do of themſelves in this caſe give a diſtreſs. And therefore in theſe caſes, the Warrant of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners is ſuperfluous, like to the Caſe in 20 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> 
                     <hi>that Caſe gave a diſtreſs.</hi> Upon which Statute the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance was grounded. So if their be two coparceners to whom Land doth deſcend, and they make partition, and for more equality ſhe that hath the better part doth grant to the other and her Heirs a yearly Rent out of her Land, but limits no clauſe or power of diſtreſs, ſhe to whom this yearly Rent is granted may diſtrain therefore; And ſo may a Bailiff diſtrain for an Amerciament in a Leet without a Warrant, becauſe the general Law gives a Diſtreſs in theſe caſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and as touching a Diſtreſs of common right, It is in caſe where one doth hold his Land of his Lord as of his Mannor, to repair a Bank, Wall or other work of Sewers; the Lord of whom theſe Lands be holden may diſtrain his Tenant of common right to compel him to make theſe repairs; and the Diſtreſs given in the ſaid Caſe of the coparceners, and in the ſaid Caſe of Amerciament in a Court of Leet, ſeem both to be Diſtreſſes of Common

               <p>NOw touching the place where theſe diſtreſſes are to be taken, comes next into our conſideration, wherein the quality of the matter diſtrained for, and the power from whence the diſtreſſes are derived, are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
               <p>And therefore if a Lord do diſtrain his Tenant <hi>Ratione tenurae,</hi> for to repair a Wall, Bank or other defence, this Diſtreſs muſt be taken on the Ground holden by this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and not elſewhere, for theſe grounds are chargeable therewithal, as the opinion of Iuſtice <hi>Sylliard</hi> is 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 38. But, not as that Caſe is, but in point of Tenure; <note place="margin">21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.</note> for there the Caſe was, That a preſentment was found <hi>in hec verba videlicet Iuratores preſent' quod eſt communis Regia via in Parochia Sancti Martini in Campis in Com' Middleſex inter Hoſpitia Epiſ' Dunelmenſis &amp; Epiſ' Norwich totalitur ſuperundat' aquis &amp; quod tam domini ſpirituales quam temporales &amp; Juſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii domini Regis &amp; Servientes ad legem &amp; omnes alii Legis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtri &amp; omnes alii per viam illam verſus Weſtmonaſter' itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes pro legibus domini Regis ibidem miniſtrandis &amp; obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis ſepius impediuntur per quod via illa totalliter ſuperinundata exiſtit exceſſu emanationis aquae pluvialis ibidem remanent' quam quidem aquam Epiſcopus Norwicenſis rationae tenurae ſuae ibidem evacuaere debuit &amp; quod ipſe &amp; omnes predeceſſores ſui ratione Tenurae ſuae ibidem evacuaere debent:</hi> And in this caſe I take it the Land was charged, not as in reſpect the Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> did hold the ſame of ſome Lord by the Tenure, to repair the Sewer to avoid the water; but his Land ſtood charged with the ſame as a charge impoſed thereon by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom or Preſcription, as by the preſident it ſelf appeareth; for if the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> had been by the Tenure
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40438:76"/>
of his houſe or lands bound to avoid the waters, there needed no Preſcription to have been alleaged.</p>
               <p>Alſo in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 3. there is a like Preſentment made <note place="margin">5 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> againſt an Abbot, <hi>Quod ipſe &amp; predeceſſores ſui,</hi> ought to repair a gutter <hi>ratione tenurae terrar' ſuar';</hi> but becauſe in that caſe the Preſentment did not ſet forth where thoſe Lands lay which were charged, the Preſentment for that cauſe was holden to be void: So that there is a great difference between a Tenure charge, and a charge impoſed upon Land by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; For in the caſe where a Tenant holdeth his Land to repair a Bridge, Wall or Bank of the Lord of the Fee, The Lord in this caſe may diſtrain the Tenant of Common right by the Common Laws of <hi>England:</hi> But where ones Land is charged by Preſcription and Cuſtom, there is no remedy to force and compel the Tenant to do the repairs but by Preſentment, and upon a Preſentment proceſs may be awarded againſt him to diſtrain him to make the repairs.</p>
               <p>And if upon a Preſentment made by the Laws of Sewers, <hi>I. S.</hi> is charged to repair a Sewer, and a <hi>Diſtringas ad repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> be awarded againſt him, the Sheriff may diſtrain the party in any place within the power of the Commiſſion of Sewers. But this being a judicial Diſtreſs which iſſueth out of the Rolls, the Juſtices are tied to the limits and bounds of the Commiſſion; Yet in 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 7. the <note place="margin">19 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note> Caſe was, <hi>That the Admiral of</hi> England <hi>hath juriſdiction in cauſes ariſing onely on the Seas, and he hath no juriſdiction or power to meddle with any thing done upon the Land:</hi> Yet upon a Preſentment made in the Admiral Court one was Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Amerced, and a Diſtreſs for this Amerciament was taken on the Land, and exception was thereto taken, that the Diſtreſs was taken out of the juriſdiction of that Court: But there <hi>Newton</hi> chief Juſtice and the reſt of the Iuſtices ſaid, <hi>That the power of the Admiral to hold plea was reſtrained by Statute to matters ariſing on the Seas, but Executions were not ſo.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Avoury</hi> 253. that where no place is certainly preſcribed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40438:77"/>
to diſtrain in, that in ſuch a caſe the Diſtreſs may be taken in any place within the power and juriſdiction of the Court, out of which the Writ or Warrant of Diſtreſs doth iſſue: As if one be amerced in a Court Leet or in a Court Baron, he may be diſtrained for theſe Amerciaments in any place within the juriſdiction of theſe Courts; and for an Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſet and impoſed in the Sheriffs Turn a Diſtreſs may be taken for it in any place of the county; for ſo far the power of that Court doth extend it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But in the caſe of a ſeſs, rate or tax impoſed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers, a Diſtreſs for any of thoſe may be taken in any place within the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> for in this caſe the Diſtreſs is meerly grounded upon the Statute, and is bounded by the ſame limits, which is as large as the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> And hereupon by this conſtruction made in this legal maner, all the words in the ſaid clauſe of this Statute have their full operation.</p>
               <p>And although in <hi>Rooks</hi> caſe the Diſtreſs was there taken on the ground charged, yet that doth not prove but that a Diſtreſs might have been taken in any other place; for I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily take it, that the place where the diſtreſs was taken, in that caſe was not intended any material point, though in my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding argument for another purpoſe I ſhall make it one. So that my opinion touching diſtreſſes to be taken in caſes of Sewers, appears to ſtand upon theſe three diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that the Lord of whom the grounds be holden to  make the repairs, muſt diſtrain on the the grounds ſo holden, and not elſwhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that upon a <hi>Diſtringas ad reparandum</hi> or <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendum</hi>  upon a Preſentment, which iſſueth out of the Rolls of that Court, and is a judicial proceſs, a Diſtreſs muſt thereupon be taken within the bounds of the Commiſſion of Sewers <hi>Ex congruitate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, a Diſtreſs for a rate, or ſeſſe, or tax aſſeſſed and impoſed by the Commiſsioners of Sewers may be taken in any part or place within the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> for this is  a Diſtreſs grounded upon the Statute, and is as large as the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40438:77"/>
extent thereof. And ſo the difference appears where the Diſtreſs is guided by the Commiſsion, and where by the Statute.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Whoſe goods may be diſtrained.</head>
               <p>IT comes now in turn to be handled, whoſe goods may be diſtrained and taken within theſe Laws; For the words of Diſtreſs be put ſo generally in this Statute, that they muſt receive their expoſition by the Rules of the Common Law, in regard theſe Laws do give no ſpecial direction therein; and therefore the Diſtreſs mentioned in <hi>Rooks</hi> caſe may in this place be queſtioned: For there <hi>Carter</hi> was aſſeſſed, but the goods of <hi>Rooks</hi> were diſtrained and taken for the ſaid Aſſeſs, and no challenge or exception was there made of it; and no marvel, for it was ſpecially found that the goods were taken and diſtrained on the grounds char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for otherwiſe that Diſtreſs had been tortious; wherein I take this diverſity, That where grounds are chargeable to repairs of defences, and a Seſs is thereon impoſed by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, the goods of a Stranger may be taken therefore on the grounds Seſſed; and this is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by <hi>Rooks</hi> Caſe. But <hi>Rooks</hi> being a Stranger, his goods could not in any ſort have been taken for the Seſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon <hi>Carter,</hi> but on the grounds charged: and the like Law for Rents and Services iſſuing out of Lands, the goods of a Stranger Levant and Couchant on the grounds ſo holden may be diſtrained for Rents and Services, by 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. and 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But put the caſe a little further, that in the Seſſions Court of the Sewers, <hi>A. B.</hi> is amerced for Non-payment of his Seſſe towards the repairs of a work of Sewers; and in this caſe I am of opinion, that the proper goods of <hi>A. B.</hi> are to be diſtrained for this Amerciament, and not the goods of a ſtranger going on his grounds charged to the ſaid aſſeſs, becauſe this Amerciament is a collateral charge, which falls on the perſon of the offendor who was to pay the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40438:78"/>
Aſſels, and doth not in any ſort charge the grounds: and this opinion hath warrant from the Caſe in 41 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 26. <hi>Br. Leet</hi> 4. for there <hi>A. B.</hi> was amerced in a <note place="margin">41 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> Court of Leet, for receiving and keeping one in his houſe which was not ſworn to the King; in which Caſe it was holden, that no goods could be diſtrained for this Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only the proper goods of the party amerced, although the goods of others were Levant and Couchant on his ground: And further in proof of my ſaid opinion, the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> in 15 <hi>El.</hi> in <hi>Dier, fol.</hi> 322. doth come fully thereto, which is, That a Replevin in an Avowry was made for a pain and forfeiture of Ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, due for the breach of a By-law, <hi>Contra ordinem Curiae,</hi> and alleaged to make By-laws within the Manor by the Cuſtom thereof: In which Caſe it is apparant, that the proper goods of the party are to be diſtrained therefore, and not the goods of a Stranger Levant and Couchant on the grounds.</p>
               <p>And in the 47 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 12. the Prior of <hi>Tindals</hi> Caſe, <note place="margin">47 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> where the Prior was amerced, and another mans goods were taken and diſtrained on the grounds of the Prior for the ſaid Amerciament, and the Diſtreſs was not well taken; and ſo my opinion may be conceived, that for an aſſeſs the goods of a Stranger may be diſtrained on the grounds charged, but may not there be taken for a Fine or Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciament, which be collateral duties, and attends upon the perſon and do not charge the Soil.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe being thus ended, I ſhall now enter into a matter of greater moment; and yet becauſe theſe matters be frequent in buſineſſes of the Sewers, that which I ſhall here pretermit I will in ſome other place more fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Statute of 7 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Raſtal Marſhes</hi>  and <hi>Fens</hi> doth enact, that a Commiſſion in the nature of this of ours ſhould be directed to the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and others for the Recovery of Fen-grounds; where for an aſſeſs impoſed, and for Fines and Amerciaments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe power is given by that Statute to ſell the parties goods which doth refuſe to pay, <hi>Ergo,</hi> without ſuch an expreſſe clauſe a ſale of goods could not have been lawful.</p>
               <p>And by the Statute of 1 and 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> the forfeitures of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſekeepers <note place="margin">1 &amp; 3 <hi>Jac.</hi>
                  </note> may be levied by ſale of their goods, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe letter of theſe Laws: and ſo it may be inferred, that our Statute wanting ſuch an expreſs clauſe to authorize a ſale, therefore no ſale can be.</p>
               <p>But much may be ſaid to the contrary; for although in caſes of ſale the Laws be tender, yet it is plain, that both our Common Law, Cuſtoms and Courts of Juſtice daily uſe them, and are frequent in thoſe ſales: And we know that a Diſtreſſe is properly a pledge to be detained till ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be made, and then to be reſtored, and is not to be ſold: Yet in 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 4. a Diſtreſſe taken for an Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciament <note place="margin">3. <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> in a Leet or Law-day may be ſold as well in the caſe where the Subject hath by Charter or Preſcription the profits of the ſaid Courts, as where the King himſelf hath them; and all the reaſon which that Book yieldeth for it, is, becauſe they be the Kings Courts: But a Diſtreſs taken for an Americament in a Court Baron cannot be ſold, and in 22 <hi>Aſſiz. plac.</hi> 72. it is ſaid, <hi>That if one recover a Debt in a Court Baron, the goods of the Debtor could not be ſold therefore:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">22 <hi>Aſſiz.</hi>
                  </note> Yet I have ſeen always in practiſe, that for Debts and Damages recovered in the County Courts, the goods of the Debtors have and be uſually ſold for them by <hi>Levarifacias;</hi> and in my opinion this is uſed <hi>per totam Angliam:</hi> and a ſale in ſuch a caſe in a Court Baron by Cuſtom is good; and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40438:79"/>
with this agreeth the Book of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 27. and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fo.</hi> 40. in a Leet Court one preſcribed and alleaged a Cuſtom to <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> have of every one which made an affray within his Liberty, a certain ſum of money, and preſcribed alſo to diſtrain for it, and to ſell the Diſtreſſe: and with this agreeth 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 14. and 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 2. A Diſtreſſe taken for the Knights Fees of the Parliament was ſold. Therefore now let us ſee and examine well by what authority our Officers of Sewers may ſell the Diſtreſſes taken. The words in our Statute which are moſt powerful in this point, be theſe <hi>(viz.) To depute and aſsign diligent, faithful and true Keepers, Bailiffs, Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Collectors, Expenditors, and other Officers for the ſafety, conſervation, reparation, and making, repairing, reforming and amending of the Premiſes and every of them, and to hear the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the Collectors and other Miniſters, of and for the receipt and laying out of the money that ſhall be levied and paid in and about the ſame:</hi> Here is the word <hi>(Levy)</hi> uſed, and money levied is properly upon a Sale, Execution or Forfeiture; And the words of our Statute go furthet <hi>(viz.) And to diſtrain, or otherwiſe to puniſh the debtors and diſtrainers of the ſame by Fines, Amerciaments, Pains, or other like means after their good diſcretious;</hi> and no likelier means to theſe is there any, then to make ſale of the debtors goods for non-payment of his ſeſſe, and it is conſonant to other Laws: alſo in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of this Statute are uſed theſe words, <hi>And the Clerk by the Commiſsioners to be aſsigned to have Two ſhillings</hi> per diem <hi>of the Rates, Taxes, Lots and Waives as ſhall be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed or loſt by authority of the ſaid Commiſsion, to be levied or paid by their diſcretions:</hi> And ſo it ſeemeth by the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe letter of this Law, the Taxes, Seſſes and Rates may be levied by the diſcretion of the Commiſſioners, which if they pleaſe may be by ſale of the offendors goods: And in many parts of this Starute, the Juſtices of Sewers have power to make Laws, Ordinances and Decrees, which being done according to reaſon, ſhall be held for firm and inviolable: And therefore upon juſt cauſe in my opinion, the Commiſſioners may make a Law or Ordinance for the ſale
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40438:80"/>
of goods in furtherance of this ſervice; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Law which tendeth ſo much to the ſervice of the Commonwealth, and is ſo profitable and commodious for the ſame, it is therefore good reaſon to extend the ſame, and the expoſition thereof, as far as the letter and intent of the letter ſhall reach; which may be as far as ſhall ſtand with reaſon, and rules of other Laws, Statutes, Cuſtoms and Uſages of other Courts which have power in ſale of goods in cauſes of this nature, is not altogether without preſident: For in the Charter of <hi>Romney Marſh, pag.</hi> 36 &amp; 37. <note place="margin">Ch. <hi>Romney Marſh.</hi>
                  </note> It is ſaid in theſe words in a debate between <hi>Hamo</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, Et predictus Hamo conceſsit proſe &amp; aliis quod computabit cor' vigint' quatuor Jurat' elect' de patria ſuper diſtrictionibus &amp; averiis capt' predicti Godfredi pro predict' Walliis &amp; water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gangiis repar' ab initio iſtius placiti uſ<expan>

               <p>But now herein follows a matter of ſome conſequence, and worthy the handling, That if by the Laws of Sewers goods may be ſold towards the repairs of theſe works, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40438:80"/>
in my opinion they may, Then whoſe goods may be ſold is the queſtion next to be decided; wherein to be brief, I am firm of opinion, That no goods can or ought to be ſold by the power of theſe Laws of Sewers, but only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods of the party Seſſed and Taxed, though the goods and chattels of other men be Levant and Couchant on the grounds Seſſed to the repairs: For I hold it not conſonant to reaſon, nor that it ſtands with any rule of Law, That the goods and chattels of a ſtranger ſhould be abſolutely taken away from him, and ſold for the debt and default of another man. And to this purpoſe the Caſe put in the 3 <hi>Eliz. Dier fol.</hi> 199. may fitly be applied to this point, where <note place="margin">3 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  </note> a Cuſtom is alleaged for a Lord of a Manor to have and take the beſt which his Tenant had at his death; and if ſuch beſt beaſt ſhould be eſloyned, that then he might have and take the beſt beaſt of any other Levant and Couchant upon the Land; and this was adjudged a void cuſtom, as to the goods of a ſtranger to be made ſubject to ſuch a forfeiture.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have purſued my Argument in diſcourſing upon theſe Diſtreſſes, and touching ſuch matters as do depend thereon, becauſe in my experience I have found them the readieſt part of the execution of theſe Laws; and I have heretofore beheld much enormious proceedings therein, both in the Commiſſioners and in their Officers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it very needful to have treated thereon for their better directions in theſe affairs hereafter.</p>

               <p>YEt as I finde Diſtreſſe to be the moſt uſeful execution of theſe Laws of Sewers, ſo I have ſeen the proceedings therein much ſtayed and interrupted by the uſual ſuing of <hi>Replevins,</hi> by which means the ſaid Diſtreſſes taken by the authority of theſe Laws have been ſet at liberty, and the works of Sewers have been much letted and hindred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: And therefore the fifth point in my Caſe doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a good occaſion to enter into the ſerious examination of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:40438:81"/>
And now my intent is, to declare in what caſe a Replevin doth lie, and where not; and ſurely this point hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been much ſtirred in, and not without ſome cauſe, for the very Statute ſeemeth to allow of Replevins in theſe words, <hi>(viz.) That if any Action of Treſpaſs, or any other Action ſhalbe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt any perſon for taking any Diſtreſs, or for any other thing concerning the Law of Sewers, that the Defendant in ſuch Action may make Avowry, cogniſance or juſtification, for the taking of the ſaid Diſtreſs, Treſpaſs or other Act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Plaintiff complained was done by the authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of Sewers, for a Lot or Tax aſſeſſed by the ſaid Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or for other ſuch act or cauſe as the Defendant did by the ſaid Commiſsion:</hi> And in what action can a man ſo properly make his Avowry, Cogniſance or Juſtification as in a Replevin, being a word only apt for that action; and a Diſtreſſe is <hi>de ſua natura,</hi> properly repleviſable by the Common Law: and for direct authority in the point, it appears in <hi>Rooks</hi> Caſe, that a Replevin was there ſued for the delivery of the Diſtreſſe taken by the power of theſe Laws of Sewers: But I muſt here diſtinguiſh, for I am of opinion a Replevin doth not lie, nor ought not to be granted from the Sheriff, or any of his Deputies, for that the Sewer is a Judicial Court of Record, &amp; of greater authority then the power of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, which in theſe caſes was but Miniſterial; and the higheſt authority that he hath is but vicontiel, which is much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the power of this Commiſſion; and therefore the Sheriff is not of ſufficient power to ſupercede a Court of higher power. Yet if one ſue a Replevin, which afterward in Bank was abated, and a return of the Cattel there award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, another Replevin did lie by the opinion of the Book of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 37. and ſo it appeareth by the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter, cap.</hi> 2. but theſe new Replevins came out of the <note place="margin">34 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note> ſaid Courts where the former was, for it is not likely, that the Sheriff could make deliverance by his warrant of Cattel, contrary to the award and return of a Court of Juſtice in a <hi>Retorno habendo;</hi> and therefore by the ſame Statute of <hi>Secunda deliberatione,</hi> is now to be awarded out of the Rolls
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40438:81"/>
of the Court whence the <hi>Retorno habendo</hi> came: And if one would reſemble this caſe with other authorities, and with the reaſon of other Book caſes of the Law, it will be made thereby apparant, that the higher Court may take or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a cauſe out of the inferior Court, but not <hi>Econtra,</hi> neither can the inferior Court ſuperſede the ſuperior: For if one be impleaded in the Kings Court at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and in coming towards <hi>London</hi> he is arreſted in a Corporation Court, he may be delivered thence by the power of the ſuperior Court to the which he was attendant, &amp; the power of the inferior Court ſhall be ſuperceded thereby, as the Law is declared in divers of our Books; By the which it is plain, that ones perſon being in the priviledge and protection of the Kings Court, could not juſtly be Impriſoned by the power of an inferior Court: And in <hi>Stringfellows</hi> Caſe in 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Dier fol.</hi> 67. The goods of one were ſeized by the <note place="margin">3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.</note> Sheriff by proceſſe out of the Chancery for a Subject, and after ſeiſure, and before delivery thereof was made, a Writ of Prerogative came out of the Exchequer, rehearſing thereby, that the King was to be ſerved before any other, and command the Sheriff to levy the ſame on the goods of the ſame Debtor; And whether theſe goods that lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of a Proceſſe in one Court might be taken from thence by the power of another Court, was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and the better opinion therein, as I take it was, that they could not, for that by the former Proceſſe they were priviledged from all other Juriſdictions, Powers and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, eſpecially if they were of an inferior degree: Yet there be two caſes which not being curiouſly looked into make ſhew as if the Law were otherwiſe; the one is in the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 2. where the goods of <hi>I. S.</hi> were taken in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by the Sheriff by a <hi>fieri facias</hi> which came out of <note place="margin">11 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note> the Kings Court of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Sheriff ſold them to <hi>I. D.</hi> and there was a Replevin ſued in that caſe, but no deliverance made of the Cattel in Court: and the other caſe is in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 28. goods were taken by a Levy which iſſued out of a Court Baron, and they were ſold by the <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:40438:82"/>
Bailiff, &amp; there was alſo a Replevin ſued, but no deliverance made of the Cattel in Court, neither would the Court order the Defendant to gage deliverance: ſo that by theſe two caſes it may ſeem what a Replevin did lie though another Court had formerly the Juriſdiction of the Cattel taken by the Diſtreſſe: But, under favor, I hope I ſhall eaſily reconcile theſe books, and ſhall make it to appear that they do not make againſt my opinion formerly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this diverſity, That when the goods were ſeized or taken by Proceſſe, and remained by the vertue thereof in the hands of the Sheriff or of his Bailiffs, during that time no Replevin did lie in the Caſe; but after ſuch time as the goods or cattel were ſold away, as in the ſaid two Caſes formerly alleaged they were, then againſt the party that bought them, or any other, a Replevin did lie in the Caſe; for after the ſale they were out of the protection of the former parties, and then a Replevin might well take hold of them, being out of all other Juriſdiction. And the ſame difference I take in this Caſe of the Sewers, that is, That ſo long as goods diſtrained by Warrant and Proceſs out of this Court of Sewers remain in the cuſtody thereof, they be not repleviſable by the Warrant of the Sheriff or of his Deputies, but after they be ſold away, then by the ſale thereof they are out of the protection and priviledge of the Court of Sewers, and then the Sheriff may cauſe them to be delivered by Replevin. Yet it may be objected unto me, that in <hi>Rooks</hi> caſe a Replevin was taken againſt him which detained the diſtreſſe by Warrant of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Sewers; it is true, the Book is ſo, which caſe I admit, and that the Replevin was well granted there; yet I take it, it doth not contradict my ſaid opinion, becauſe there <hi>Carter</hi> was aſſeſſed, but the goods of <hi>Rooks</hi> were taken and detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Seſſe, and <hi>Rooks</hi> did ſue the Replevin, which he might well do, becauſe againſt him or his goods there was not any Law of Sewers extant or in force, neither was he or his goods within the priviledge or juriſdiction of theſe Laws of Sewers: But if <hi>Carters</hi> Cattel had been taken, who
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40438:82"/>
was the very party ſeſſed, he could have had no Replevin from the Sheriff or his Deputies to deliver his Cattel.</p>
               <p>But although a Replevin doth not lie in the caſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid from the Sheriff or his Deputies, <hi>Ex officio</hi> to deliver a Diſtreſſe of Sewers, yet out of the Kings Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> a Replevin doth lie in thoſe caſes: And the Charter of <hi>Romney Marſh pag.</hi> 18. doth afford us in this <note place="margin">Ch <hi>Romney Marſh.</hi>
                  </note> caſe a very good preſident; for there complaint was made to the King, ſetting forth thereby, That whereas his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had appointed and authorized <hi>Henry de Bathonia</hi> to be his Juſtice, and to determine the differences depending and touching the repairing of the defences of the ſaid <hi>Marſh,</hi> he had ordained, that Diſtreſſes might be taken according to the 24. Jurators, <hi>It a quod nullus vicecomes aut alius balivus noſter intromittat in diſtrictionibus illis, tu tamen</hi> (meaning the Sheriff of <hi>Kent) nihilominus diſtrictiones illas propter hoc factum per vigint quatuor Juratores in prejudicio conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis eorundem reluxaſti, tibi igitur precipimus quod diſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus illis in nullo te intromittas;</hi> and in the ſame Charter the like matter is there alſo ſo determined of, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. By the which may be collected, that the Sheriff <hi>Ex officio</hi> might not meddle with ſuch Diſtreſſes: and in the ſame Charter, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. the words be further, <hi>Quod ſiquis de conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione predict' diſtrictionis ſe injuſte gravat' ſentiret &amp; inde conqueri vellet ad ipſum Dominum Regem querelam ſuam defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret &amp; ipſe in Curia ſua juſticiam fieri facere reſervaſſet;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſt, that a Replevin lay for a Diſtreſſe taken in the Kings Court, for that they be of a ſuperior authority and juriſdiction to theſe inferior Courts of Sewers: And therefore the Replevins which our Statute aims to give way to, are intended to be taken out of the Kings Courts, which in Law and Juſtice ought to be obeyed, and not from the Sheriff or his Officers by vertue of their Office only.</p>
               <p>But in my caſe the Commiſſioners made a Law, that the goods of <hi>A.</hi> ſhould be ſold without allowance of Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, which is a good Law upon the diſtinctions and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aforeſaid; that is, that <hi>A.</hi> who was the perſon aſſeſſed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40438:83"/>
might not have or take a Replevin becauſe he was a perſon bound expreſly by the Law, nor that the Sheriff or his Officers <hi>Ex Officio</hi> might grant a Replevin to deliver the ſame, being under the power of this Law of Sewers.</p>
               <p>But the Kings Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> may in thoſe caſes of Sewers deliver the Diſtreſſes; and this conſtruction made of this Statute, as I take it, ſtands with Law and reaſon: And in the 31 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Brook, Replevin, plac.</hi> 60. the Caſe is put, a man did grant to <hi>A. B.</hi> a rent out of his grounds, <note place="margin">13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> with power that if it were behinde that he might diſtrain therefore, and detain the Diſtreſſe againſt gages and pledges; and yes it was adjudged, that if the Rent were behinde and the grantor diſtrained, he could not detain this Diſtreſſe againſt the Replevin: Yet here were the direct words of the party himſelf to the contrary, but his words could not overrule the Law: So that upon all theſe matters, I hold theſe Tenents following:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> To make a general Law to reſtrain all Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,  granted either from the Sheriff or the Kings Courts, is no good Law or Ordinance of Sewers; for that Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins <hi>de jure</hi> are in ſuch caſes grantable out of the Kings Courts, and ſuch a general Law ſavors too much of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſtopping up the Gates of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, for a Sheriff or his Deputy to grant and award  Warrants of Replevin <hi>Ex officio,</hi> to deliver goods or cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtrained, and detained for a Tax and Law of Sewers, is in my opinion againſt Law, and need not to be obeyed, for that the Diſtres was <hi>Sub protectione ſuperioris Curiae,</hi> which is of a higher degree then a Sheriffs Miniſterial Warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if a Diſtreſſe be taken and ſold for a Seſſe of  Sewers, a Replevin lyeth againſt the buyer, for by the ſale the goods and cattel were put out of the protection of the Court of Sewers.</p>
               <p>

               <p>SO now I have fully and: at large declared my opinion touching Diſtreſſes and Replevins; wherein, I hope, I have fully ſatisfied the firſt point of my Caſe: I intend therefore now to proceed to the ſixth point, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns charges and ſales of Lands to be made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers by the power and authority of this Law.</p>
               <p>And, firſt I ſuppoſe the queſtion may be extended to this, that is, Whether the Commiſſioners of Sewers can impoſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40438:84"/>
a perpetual charge upon Land to repair a work of Sewers for ever by the power of theſe Laws.</p>
               <p>I do here acknowledge, that this is a knotty Point, yet ſomething may be alleaged in maintenance of this Opinion Affirmatively: For in the parts of <hi>Holland</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> almoſt every one knows which part he is to repair and maintain in perpetuity; And <hi>Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia eſt optima interpres rerum;</hi> And it appeareth by the Charter of <hi>Romney Marſh, pag.</hi> 12. That the uſe there was to impoſe perpetual charges on ſingular perſons; <note place="margin">Char. <hi>Romney Marſh, pag.</hi> 12.</note> For the words there be theſe, <hi>Juratores per eor' ſacrament' menſur abunt per perticam omnes terr as &amp; Tenementa quae infra dictum Mariſcum periculo ſubiacent quibus menſueration' factis viginti quatuor per communitatem prius electi &amp; jurati habito reſpectu ad quantitatem Walliar' terrar' &amp; Tenement' quae pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculo ſubiacent per eor' Sacramentum ordinabunt quantum ad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictarum Walliar' ſuſtentationem &amp; reperationem faciend' &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinend' ad quemlibet pertineat, ita quod proportion' acrar' terrar' periculo ſubiacent' ſingulis aſsignetur ſua portio perticar' &amp; predict' aſsignatio fiat per locos certos ita ut ſcietur ubi &amp; per quae loca; ad quantum, ſinguli defendere teneantur.</hi> Theſe words in this Charter ſeem to be plain, That by the Laws eſtabliſhed in <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> the Commiſſioners had power to aſſign to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his portion to repair in perpetuity; but I finde no ſuch words in our Statute: And whereas it may be ſaid, that our Commiſſioners have power to make ſale of the Lands; <hi>Ergo,</hi> They may charge them perpetually; but this is a <hi>non ſequitur</hi> for that, for the ſale they have expreſſe War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but not ſo for the charge: And powers and authorities muſt be duly purſued, and are not to be taken by equitable or argumentable collections or implications, ſo that it may ſeem the Laws of Sewers were never held ſo perdurable as to binde mens Lands with perpetual charges: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this difference I take, That by the Cuſtom of a town or country, every one may know his particular portion, which the owners of grounds are obliged and bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair perpetually; but without ſuch a Cuſtom it hath been
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40438:84"/>
held, That the Commiſſioners of Sewers cannot binde any mans inheritance to a perpetual charge, by any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given by this Statute; but in the ſaid caſe of <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> the Cuſtom there maintained this point: yet <hi>Not a bene verba hujus Statuti,</hi> which be theſe <hi>(viz.) And to make and ordain Statutes, Ordinances and Proviſions from time to time as the caſe ſhall require, for the ſafegard, conſervation, redreſſe, correction or reformation of the Premiſes and every of them, and the parties liable to the ſame, neceſſary and behoofful after the Laws &amp; Cuſtoms of</hi> Romney Marſh <hi>in the county of</hi> Kent, <hi>or otherwiſe, by any ways or means after their own wiſdoms and diſcretions:</hi> Theſe be the words, and this is the clauſe which muſt make good this perpetual charge, for that it doth formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that ſuch like Laws and Cuſtoms there were in <hi>Romney Marſh</hi> as this is; and therefore I may conclude this point, that the Commiſſioners in imitation of the ſaid Ordinance of <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> may make Decrees to binde Lands to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual charges: Yet Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in <hi>Keighlies</hi> caſe ſets it down as reſolved, <hi>That the ſeveral Commiſsioners of Sewers throughout all</hi> England, <hi>are not bound to purſue the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of</hi> Romney Marſh; but in caſe where ſome particular place within their Commiſſion have ſuch Laws &amp; Cuſtoms as <hi>Romney Marſh</hi> hath, there they might purſue them. But in my own opinion, the Commiſſioners may, if they pleaſe, make Ordinances and Laws like to thoſe of <hi>Romney Marſh,</hi> where there hath not been any ſuch uſe; and the words of the Statute, as I take it, will bear that conſtruction; and the ſaid opinion of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> is not directly againſt this. And upon Decrees for ſales of Land, it is uſual in theſe Decrees to binde thoſe Lands to the perpetual repairs.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> for what cauſe Lands may be ſold by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners  of Sewers.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:40438:85"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Thirdly, what perſons, what Eſtates and Intereſts are to be bound thereby. </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, to what perſons theſe Lands may be ſold or decreed. </p>
               <p>The Statute is, <hi>If any perſon ſeſſed do not pay;</hi> whereby it is manifeſt, that the Lands are to be ſold for ſeſſes and charges impoſed by the Commiſſioners which lyeth in payment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they may not be decreed away for any other cauſe or matter: And therefore if one hold his Land to repair a Wall, Bank, Sewers or other work of Sewers, and he neglect to repair the ſame, the Commiſſioners of Sewers cannot for this cauſe decree the Lands away from the owner, becauſe this charge lay not in payment: And I cannot gather out of the words of this Statute, that Lands can be decreed for any cauſe then for Non-payment of a Lot, Seſs or Charge, by reaſon this word <hi>Payment</hi> is reiterated three or four times in this branch of the Statute, and no other words be coupled with it to infer any other or larger expoſition.</p>
               <p>If <hi>I. S.</hi> do hold his Lands of the Lord of a Manor by the payment of Twenty ſhillings yearly or other ſum, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the repairs of a work of Sewers, and he do neglect to pay the ſame, whereby the work is unrepaired, although this is a charge which lyeth in payment, yet becauſe it grows due by Tenure by the Common Law, and was not impoſed by the force of this Statute, therefore the Lands of <hi>I. S.</hi> cannot be decreed from him by the Non-payment thereof, by the tenor and vertue of this Law of Sewers.</p>
               <p>But if the Lands of one be generally charged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair ſuch a Wall or other work of Sewers by Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Covenant or otherwiſe, and the Commiſſioners im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſeſſe and rate upon him to repair it, and he do not, there in this caſe, although the charge was by the rules of the Common Laws, yet becauſe the ſeſſe and rate was ſet upon him by the power of this Statute, I am of opinion, that for neglect of payment the ſaid Lands may be ſold by the decree of the Commiſſioners of Sewers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:40438:86"/>
So if one do hold his Lands for the payment of Twenty ſhillings to repair a Bank, and the Commiſſioners of Sewers do order the party to pay the Twenty ſhillings at a time by them preſcribed (not being contrary to the uſual days of payment) and he do neglect to pay, The Commiſſioners may decree his Lands from him, becauſe this charge, by reaſon of the ſaid Order, had got the force and power of this Statute.</p>
               <p>If a charge be generally laid upon a Townſhip, Hundred or Rape, which is not paid according to the Commiſſioners Order, no Lands can be decreed in this caſe, becauſe no perſons or Lands be in this caſe particularly charged, and the decree of the ſale muſt be directed by, and depend upon the ſeſſe: But if after the general ſeſſe be laid, the ſame be after aſſeſſed upon particular perſons by particular ſums by the ſaid Commiſſioners, then upon default of payment, their Lands making default may be decreed from them by the power of this Statute.</p>
               <p>If an aſſeſſe or charge of payment be laid upon certain Lands without mentioning the Owner, the Lands cannot be decreed from him by this Law; for the words of the Statute be <hi>(That if any perſon or perſons aſſeſſed to any Lot or Charge do not pay)</hi> So that I ſhall take it, that no decree for ſale of Land can be made but where there is a perſon certainly aſſeſſed by name.</p>
               <p>Lands cannot be decreed away from the owners for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of payment of Fines, Amerciaments or Pains; for though theſe be ſums of money or charges impoſed by the Commiſſioners of Sewers of perſons certain for matters touching theſe Laws, yet becauſe they were not ſeſſed or rated towards the repairs of any works of Sewers, but be ſet upon the parties as mulcts and puniſhments, and be due to the King, therefore no decree of Lands can be made for any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now the ſecond part of this clauſe is, what Lands may  be decreed by the authority of the ſaid Statute; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears they muſt be ſuch Lands as lie and be within
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40438:86"/>
the power of this Commiſſion of Sewers; and herein reſts a difference between the caſe of a Diſtreſſe for a ſeſſe which may be taken in any place within this Realm, and the decree of ſale of Lands for Non-payment of a ſeſſe which muſt lie within the bounds and extent of the Commiſſion; for this Diſtreſſe is circumſcribed to the extent of the Statute, which is over the whole Realm, and the ſale is tyed to the limits of the Commiſſion: And I am alſo of opinion, that no Land can be ſold away by the decree of the Commiſſioners of Sewers, but ſuch as were charged with the ſeſſe.</p>
               <p>If one hold his Lands in <hi>Comitat' Eborum</hi> to repair a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and the Owner is aſſeſſed therefore, and makes default of payment, the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Sewers in the county of <hi>Lincoln</hi> may give warrant to diſtrain for this ſeſſe in the county of <hi>York;</hi> but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not decree away by ſale thoſe Lands lying there which were charged with the ſeſſe.</p>
               <p>A Copyholders Land cannot be decreed againſt him by this Law, for if it might, then theſe cuſtomary Lands ſhould be transferred from one to another, contrary to the Cuſtoms of the Manors whereof they be parcel; and it would infringe that rule which is delivered in <hi>Heidons</hi> Caſe <note place="margin">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40438:87"/>
all other Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments decreed, in reſpect whereof one is ſeſſable and ſeſſed by the Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Branch of this clauſe is the direct point in my caſe <hi>(viz.) What perſons &amp; what eſtates be bound by theſe decrees?</hi>  And firſt of the Heirs in Tail, whether they be bound by a decree made againſt the Donees in Tail their Anceſtors, is the queſtion; In the handling whereof I hold it ſitting, to ſhew in what caſes the Heirs in Tail have been bound by the act of their Anceſtors, and the reaſons and cauſes thereof.</p>
               <p>And therefore if a Diſſeiſor make a Gift in Tail, and the Donee in Tail grant a Rent to the Diſſeſſee for releaſe of his right, this will binde the Heir in Tail, for that by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe his Eſtate which before was defeiſable is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as by the Books of 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 22. and 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 13. <note place="margin">44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> appeareth: and ſo in 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. a gift in Tail was made <hi>Ita quod</hi> the Donee might alien to the benefit of the Heirs in Tail; and and this by Judge <hi>Welbey</hi> was held a condition which bound the Heir in Tail for his benefit: And in 12. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Tregouſe</hi> and <hi>Taltarms</hi> Caſe was, That a recovery againſt Tenant <note place="margin">12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.</note> in Tail, with a Voucher by him over, did binde the heirs in Tail, by the Common Law, by reaſon of the intended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which was to come to him by the Voucher; and ſo a lineal warranty with aſſets, and a collateral warranty without aſſets, were and be both of them bars to the Iſſues, by reaſon alſo of the intended recompences; and theſe are things which were originally tied to thoſe Eſtates, and were incidents to them <hi>ab initio:</hi> And therefore this ſhall ſuffice to treat of bars to the Iſſues in Tail by the Common Laws; and now I ſhall proceed to ſhew in what caſes they were barred of their Eſtates by the Statutes of this Realm.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.

it is there ſaid to be reſolved, that the general words of that Statute did not repeal the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. of Intails, and ſo the forfeiture was there reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for the life of <hi>Trudgin,</hi> and did not binde the Iſſues in Tail.</p>
               <p>A Judgement in Debt againſt Tenant in Tail, or if he be bound in a Statute or in a Recognizance in the nature of a Statute, the Lands Intailed were not extendable nor to be held in extent by the Statutes of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>Acton Burnel,</hi> or by the Statute <hi>de Mercatoribus</hi> by any of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words of theſe Laws; but the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. by expreſſe words bindeth the heir in Tail, for their Lands <note place="margin">23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> whoſe Anceſtors ſtood indebted to the King by Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Recognizance, Obligation or other ſpecialty.</p>
               <p>But the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. Enacts, <hi>That every</hi>

                  <hi>one which ſhall be attainted of Treaſon, ſhall forfeit the Lands whereof he is ſeized of any Eſtate of Inheritance;</hi> and by this Statute Intailed Lands were forfeited; and the words <hi>(Of any Eſtate of Inheritance)</hi> were the words which gave that forfeiture, the one in Fee ſimple, the other in Fee tail; and the word <hi>(any)</hi> preſuppoſeth more Eſtates of Inheritance then one.</p>
               <p>But whether a Decree of ſale of Lands made by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers ſhall binde the heirs in Tail, is the point of my caſe; and in my opinion I think they ſhall be barred, for the cauſes and reaſons following:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the words of the Statute of Sewers be, <hi>That ſuch a Decree ſhall binde all and every perſon and perſons that at the making of the ſame Decree had any intereſt in ſuch Lands, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements &amp; Hereditaments in Uſo, Poſſeſsion, Remainder or Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their heirs and aſsigns:</hi> So that by expreſſe words it bindes the heirs; and it would have bound the heirs of a Tenant in Fee ſimple, without the word <hi>(Heirs)</hi> expreſſed in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; therefore the word <hi>(Heirs)</hi> needed not, but onely for the binding of the heirs in Tail.</p>
               <p>Alſo if theſe Lands were charged by Preſcription, as many Lands be, then were the Lands originally bound,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40438:88"/>
and the heirs in Tail ſtand charged with theſe ſeſſes, as well as Land in Fee ſimple.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, this is a Law enacted for the preſervation of the Commonweal, and is more to be favored then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtates of heirs in Tail: But the caſe of the Premunire was penal in point of a forfeiture, which is to be ſtrictly taken for the King, and favorably for the ſubject; and therefore in my opinion, the heirs in Tail ſhall be bound in theſe caſes of ſale, and the rather becauſe they be within the words of the Statute, <hi>videlicet,</hi> Heirs generally put, which extends to heirs in Tail, as well as to heirs in Fee ſimple; and becauſe the ſeſſe and charge ſhall binde both alike, ſo in my opinion the ſale ſhall binde both, in regard the ſale depends upon the charge and ſeſſe.</p>
               <p>If a Prebend, Parſon or Vicar, Dean, Biſhop or ſuch like, which be ſeized of Lands in their politique capacity be ſeſſed to repairs of works of Sewers, their Lands can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be decreed away from them in ſuch ſort as to binde their ſucceſſors; for as this Statute of Sewers extend to binde Lands by decrees in perpetuity, ſo the Statute of 1 and 13 and 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> reſtrain Alienations, and where thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes reſtrain them, I am of opinion, that this general Statute of Sewers doth not diſpence with thoſe Statutes.

But I will here make a diſtinction; I am notwithſtanding of opinion, That the Parſons, Vicars, Prebends, and ſuch like, for their own neglect, are bound during their times, but not their ſucceſſors after them; And note, this Statute though it mention heirs, yet it doth not at all mention ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,

which is worthy of conſideration alſo: And in my opinion this Statute as to Decrees to be made of Lands will binde women, Covert Baron, Infants, perſons that be <hi>non ſanae mentis</hi> and ſuch like, becauſe it is a Law made for the ſafety of the Commonwealth: And ſo it is held in <hi>Zouches</hi> caſe in the <hi>Com.</hi> That the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. of fines had bound Infants, Ideots and Women Court Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, had they not been excepted in that Statute; <hi>A forciori</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zouches</hi> Caſe.</note> ſhall they be compriſed in this Statute, for the Statute of fines was made for the peace of the Weal-publique, but the Statute of Sewers was made for the ſafety thereof.</p>
               <p>If there be two Tenants in Common which be ſeſſed towards the repairs of a Wall, Bank or ſuch like work of Sewers, and one of them do neglect to pay his proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part, Whether Commiſſioners may decree a moyety without partition both of the ſeſſe and Land, is a queſtion; for their Eſtates are ſeveral, though there be a community in taking of the profits: And therefore the matter is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the aſſeſſe ſhall attend upon the poſſeſſion which is in Common, or upon their Eſtates which be ſeveral: And although Commiſſioners in aſſeſſe be not bound to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Eſtate, yet if they take upon them to decree a mans Lands from him, they are then to take notice of his Eſtate, and of all other circumſtances neceſſarily depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon: In 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 12. if a Treſpaſſe be done upon Lands which are held in Common, they are to joyn in an Action, but if one of them die that Action ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, for though they were joynt in the perſonalty, yet they disjoyned in the realty; And if two Tenants in Common of Land joyn in a grant of Ten pounds rent charge out of their Lands, the Grantee ſhall have Ten pounds yearly of either by the opinion of Mr. <hi>Perkins:</hi> But if a ſeſſe of Ten pounds be laid and impoſed upon them by this Law of Sewers, this ſeſſe ſhall not double as the Rent ſhould; yet in this caſe of a joynt aſſeſs impoſed upon Tenants in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and one would pay his moyety, and his companion refuſeth, the Commiſſioners of Sewers cannot ſell a moye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40438:89"/>
of the Land, for that it is a joynt ſeſs, and was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by moyeties, and the ſale doth depend upon the ſeſs, and all may not be ſold; for that one Tenant in Common cannot prejudice his companion in things of Realty.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth matter is to whom Lands may be decreed by this Law; for by the words of the Statute it appeareth, That  the Commiſſioners have power to decree Lands for default of payment for years, for life, in Tail, or in Fee ſimple; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Law intended they ſhould make their decrees for ſale, according to the quantity of the ſeſs, and ſo ſhould uſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the Eſtates they made or ſold therefore; and it was not intended they ſhould ſel the Feeſimple away for ſeſs which might be ſatisfied with the making of a leſs Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And I am of opinion, that this decree doth make the Eſtate, with the help of this Statute, according to the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which ſhould therein be declared, and that the party ſhall have Eſtate according as the ſame is thereby limited unto him; and this is no equitable decree which bindes the perſon onely, as Chancery decrees be, but it bindes the Land; and therefore the Commiſſioners may not decree Lands to a Corporation, as to a Major and Commonalty, Dean and Chapter or ſuch like, which be Mortmain, for the general words of this Statute do not repeal the Statute of Mortmain in my opinion.</p>
               <p>And herein I ſhall end my Argument touching decrees; and I take it, though the intereſt of <hi>E.</hi> was intail, yet the ſale thereof might be made by this Statute for the cauſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid: And now only remains under my cenſure to declare my opinion, whether the Commiſſioners of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers did Juſtice, in refuſing to admit of Pleas of diſcharge which were tendred to them by <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> wherein may come juſtly into our conſiderations theſe things, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Whether Traverſes, Pleas of Exemptions, and other legal proceedings, may be had in this Court of Sewers, or not; ſaving I adde this, that theſe decrees of ſale being binding, muſt be certified into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, with the Kings Royal aſſent had thereto.</p>

                  <p>TO enter into theſe parts of my Law, I think it fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Traverſe,</hi> and to deliver my opinion, whether ſuch Pleas and Proceedings are to be admitted into this Court; for a Traverſe is a Plea of the party, containing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the contrary of that that the party ſtands accuſed of, or which is laid to his charge: And in ſome caſes our books and authorities of Law admit the party to a Traverſe, and in other caſes the ſame is to be denyed; for in the 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 9. &amp; 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> &amp; 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>Dier, fol.</hi> 13. if one be preſented in a Leet Court for a Blowipe or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal <note place="margin">5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> wrong, this Preſentment is not Traverſable, but the party is without remedy therein, though the Preſentment be falſe and the matter of it untrue; and the Law is ſo alſo of ſuch a Preſentment made in a Sheriffs Turn: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall agreeth the books of 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 11. and 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 11. <note place="margin">2 <hi>R.</hi> 3 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.</note>

this agreeth <hi>Stanford, fol.</hi> 183. and in other Courts of Law there oftentimes fall out matters which one ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take a Traverſe unto, and in ſome other caſes he ſhall, as by theſe ſucceeding authorities may appear. In the 37 <hi>Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 7. a Preſentment was taken before <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Ingham,</hi> Juſtices of the Kings Bench, That <hi>I. S.</hi> who had killed <hi>A.</hi> had goods to the value of Eighty pounds in the hands of one <hi>John Lombard;</hi> and upon this Preſentment a <hi>Scire-facias</hi> was awarded againſt <hi>John Lombard,</hi> to ſhew cauſe wherefore theſe goods ſhould not be ſeized to the Kings uſe: <hi>John Lombard</hi> came in and tendred a Plea to the Preſentment, that theſe goods were not the felons, but that they were delivered to him to keep to the uſe of a Cardinal of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he was there admitted to this Plea; and with this agreeth 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 26. expreſly: Yet in that book and Mr. <hi>Stanford, fol.</hi> 185. it is holden for Law, That if it be preſented before a Coroner that <hi>I.

The difference in which two caſes is this in my opinion, that a ſtranger, as <hi>Iohn Lombard</hi> was, in the the firſt Caſe, ſhall not be perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concluded; for it were no reaſon one mans goods ſhould be forfeited in another mans default, and he ſhould have no anſwer thereunto: But in the other Caſe, in Terror of Felons, though he be acquitted of the Felony, yet he is not acquitted of the flying, and he may be guilty notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his acquittal.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T appeareth by this Statute I read on, that the Law makers made it not the leaſt part of their care to have ſuch perſons put in truſt with the execution thereof, as ſhould be of great wiſdom and approved experience. And becauſe that perſons of profound wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, deep Experience, tryed Learning, generous Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and of good Eſtate, ſhould be put into theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Sewers, the Statute did make choice of four Honorable perſons to have and take the nomination of ſuch as ſhould for their Integrity, Learning, Wealth, Wiſdom and Experience, be worthy to be put into this Commiſſion. And therefore the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treaſurer, and the two Lord chief Juſtices for the time being, have by this Statute the nomination of our Commiſſioners; But as theſe great perſons of Honor by their high places are moſt commonly buſied in matters of great importance, they many times refer theſe matters to others, by means whereof divers perſons in ſome countreys have of late years crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Commiſsion, which this Statute doth not allow of, which do not only want knowledge and experience, but which are alſo tranſported and carried away with ſelfwill, and ſerve moſt commonly to make a faction of the greater number to carry away buſineſſes, when the graver and wiſer ſort are forced (being overladen with popular voices) to give way to run into contrary courſes, and are made to ſurceaſe from making good and wholſom Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſometimes are as it were forced to agree to thoſe

which are whoſe; even as the Roman Dictator <hi>Fabius</hi> having joyned to him the froward <hi>Minutius,</hi> was by the violent ſtream of his colleague ſo croſſed and overſwayed, not out of judgement, but ſelfwill, that he was forced to give way to <hi>Minutius</hi> frowardneſs, though it tended almoſt to the hazard and the overthrow of the whole Roman Army: And becauſe the Commiſſioners are the perſons through whoſe hands the execution of all theſe Laws muſt paſſe, I thought it therefore very convenient to take into examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this part of the Statute which touch and concern them: And I intend to purge the Commiſſion of ſuch of them as theſe Laws have diſalowed, and to that purpoſe I have framed this inſuing caſe, which I take it will give us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to call them all into queſtion, and to ſever the juſt from the unjuſt, the ſufficient from the unſufficient, and the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the illiterate.</p>

                  <p>There be two Joyntenants, and one of them and an eſtranger do diſſeiſe the other; what intereſt the ſtranger gaineth thereby is the queſtion.</p>

That he in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder and a ſtranger may diſſeiſe Tenant for life, and ſhall be both diſſeiſors; but in that caſe they were both ſtrangers to the particular Eſtate: Alſo it is manifeſt that one Ioyntenancy may be built upon another, As if two Joyntenants be diſſeiſed by other two Joyntenants of the right <hi>ſemel,</hi> but not <hi>ſimul:</hi> But in our principal caſe, Whether one Ioyntenant might hold the poſſeſsion of a Moyety with his firſt companion in Ioynture, with his moyety in right, and can alſo <hi>uno tempore</hi> hold Ioyntenancy in poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a ſtranger, of the moyety upon which the diſſeiſin was committed, I ſuppoſe he cannot, becauſe then he ſhould hold partnerſhip with both of one thing: And therefore in my opinion the ſtranger getteth nothing in my caſe, but is onely a Coadjutor, and no Diſſeiſor, which gets the Tenancy.</p>

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>But admit the ſtranger did get a moyety of a moyety by joyning in the diſſeiſin, then what alteration this releaſe will work in my caſe is the next queſtion.</p>
                  <p>It is true as Mr. <hi>Littelton</hi> ſaith, That if there be two <note place="margin">Littleton.</note> Diſſeiſors, and the Diſſeiſee releaſe to one of them, he ſhall hold his companion out of all; the like Law is in my caſe of two abaters and two intruders: but if two diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors be, and they make a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, and then the Diſſeiſee releaſeth to one of the Diſſeiſors; I ſuppoſe this releaſe ſhall inure to both, becauſe the Leſſee for years, whoſe Eſtate ſhall be ſtrengthned by this releaſe, is in by the Title under both of them, and now they are Tenants of a Reverſion onely, and of a Rent thereto inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which was not got by the diſſeiſin, but was compoſed by the Legal contract of the parties.</p>
                  <p>So if two be admitted to a Copyhold by Tort, or to an Office in a Court of Juſtice unlawfully, though their entry be unlawful, yet becauſe they came in by admittance, which is at the door of Juſtice; I ſuppoſe therefore, that if a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe be made to one of them by the diſſeiſee, it ſhall inure to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40438:97"/>
both, becauſe they had ſome colour and countenance to enter, more then expreſſe diſſeiſors or intrudors have.</p>
                  <p>But if a Son and a Stranger diſſeiſe the Father, and after the Father dyeth, and the right deſcend to the ſon, by this releaſe in Law, and by the acceſſion of the right by deſcent to the tortious poſſeſſion, it doth inure only to the ſon; and although this releaſe was upon condition, which by the breach thereof ſeemeth to ſet the Releſſor in the ſame ſtate he was before, yet it doth not admit the Joynt diſſeiſor which was expelled thereby to become a copartner again with his fellow: As if the ſon and a ſtranger diſſeiſe the father, and the father dyeth, the ſtranger hereby is expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the deſcent of this right to the ſon; yet if after a more near Heir is born, as the Elder brother dyed his wife Einſent with a ſon, which after the deceaſe of the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father is born, whereby the Inheritance of this Land is his; yet the other Joynt diſſeiſor which was expelled by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the right of his fellow diſſeiſor, by the departure of the right with the poſſeſſion, cannot enter upon his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low diſſeiſor, in my opinion.</p>
                  <p>But now the queſtion is further, what is reduced by this condition, the right only which was releaſed, or the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion together with this right; for if but a right be reduced, then a deſcent hapning may perchance Toll the entry of the Releſſor, and ſo he may be put to his Writ of right in Fee: And if it be a right of an inferior degree; as in our caſe it was but for life, then he ſhould be with out remedy.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40438:100"/>
the Freedom of the ſon was forfeit, by reaſon he was by this Exilement become no free Citizen. But in anſwer thereunto I ſay briefly, That if theſon had attained this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the death of his father, as a thing deſcendible, then it had been forfeit by his fathers Baniſhment, but the ſon had this Freedom by his own birth, as a purchaſe, and not by the death of his father by deſcent, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by his fathers Exilement. Like to the caſe where <hi>I. S.</hi> hath many children, and then he confeſſeth himſelf Villain to <hi>I. D.</hi> in a Court of Record, yet his children formerly born are Freemen and no Villains, becauſe they were free by their own births, but the Inheritance is inthralled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is to come to the Heir by deſcent: So that I am of opinion, that if <hi>E.</hi> had otherwiſe been a competent Freeman, as he was not, then the Exilement of his father could not have diſabled him.</p>

If a Biſhop, Dean, Chancellor, Archdeacon, Prebend, Parſon or Vicar be ſeiſed of Lands in <hi>Jure Eccleſiae</hi> of the clear yearly value of Forty Marks, I ſuppoſe theſe may ſit Commiſſioners by this Statute, for they have theſe Lands in <hi>eorum uſu</hi> during the time they continue in their places, which in intendment of Law is for their lives; but yet by the intendment of Law they are not to ſit in the execution of any humane affairs, and therefore ſeeing their perſons are out of the intendment of this Law, ſo likewiſe ſhould their Church livings be: but this is but a conceit, for although they be not perſons <hi>having</hi> theſe Lands within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Wills, which is a having to diſpoſe, yet they may be within our Statute, which is a having to retain.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But yet in the cloſing up of that Statute of 13 <hi>El.</hi> there is a Proviſo to this effect, <hi>Provided always, that it ſhall be lawful for any Commiſsioner, being alſo a Farmer, and not having Lands or Tenements to the clear yearly value of Forty pounds of Freehold, to ſit by vertue of the ſaid Commiſsion, and have his voice and full authority with others to make and eſtabliſh Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for Sewers, according to the Tenure of the Commiſsion touching and concerning all Lands and Tenements within the Precinct of every ſuch Commiſsion, other then ſuch Lands and Tenements as he or they for the time hold and enjoy as Farmer, as he or they might have done before the making of that Statute;</hi> but he could not have ſitten in execution of this Commiſſion before the making of this Statute, unleſs he had beſides his leaſe Lands to the value of Forty Marks <hi>per annum:</hi> And therefore a Leaſe for years is no inablement at all, but a diſablement, as this Statute declares.</p>
               <p>But the times when this having of Lands, &amp;c. will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to qualifie a Commiſſioner to ſit within this Law, is now to be conſidered of, wherein I am opinion, that the <hi>When having</hi> muſt be referred to the <hi>Then ſitting:</hi> For the words of the Statute be, <hi>That none take upon him to ſit, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lands to the yearly value of Forty Marks;</hi> ſo that if he have not Lands of that value when he is firſt made a Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

yet if he have ſo much when he ſitteth upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it will ſatisfie this Law; and if once he have Land of that value and ſitteth, and after ſell the Land away, or if they be evicted from him, he is then diſabled to ſit as a Commiſſioner by this Statute: And ſo if he were but Tenant for the life of <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>And if <hi>A.</hi> do bargain and ſell his Lands to <hi>B.</hi> by Deed intended of that value, and before the Inrolment of the Deed <hi>B.</hi> do ſit as Commiſſioner, and after the Deed is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, yet this doth not qualifie his offence, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the working of this Deed doth not aſſiſt him to take off the penalty of this Law.</p>
               <p>Alſo a man diſſeiſed is during the Diſſeiſin diſabled to ſit, for he had not then power to deviſe the Lands by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Wills, for that Statute doth as ours doth, uſe the word <hi>Having</hi> in <hi>preſenti,</hi> and not in <hi>futuro.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſaid firſt Statute is general, that all Weres ſhould be put down but by the Seacoſts, yet this word <hi>(All)</hi> are intended of ſuch only as were erected without lawful War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and the ſaid Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. doth explain the generality of the ſaid former Statute; For thereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That Weres erected in Navigable Rivers where Ships and Boats were wont to ſail, ſhould be extirped, becauſe they were a hinderance to Navigation; but this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40438:108"/>
extends only to Navigable Streams which have been Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable by uſe and Cuſtom; and it is manifeſt by this Statute, that theſe Weres which were ſo to be put down muſt be only ſuch as were erected in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt and ſithence, becauſe thoſe ſeemed to be erected without lawful authority, and being but erected in thoſe times, they had not the countenance of Cuſtom and Preſcription to ſtrengthen them.</p>
               <p>The next Statute in time is that of 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. which confirms the ſaid Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and then adding thereto, that if any ſuch annoyance be done, it ſhall be pulled down, and that he which ſhall relevy ſuch annoyance, and be thereof duly attainted, he ſhall incur the penalty of One hundred Marks to the King, to be levied by the Eſtreats of the Exchequer; and the penalty is thereby given for the inhauncing of ſuch Weres, Mills, Stanks, Stakes and Kiddels: This Statute is in part a confirmation of the ſaid Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and in other part thereof it is a new <note place="margin">45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> Act in theſe points.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And Thirdly, it gives the like penalty againſt him which  ſhall relevy the annoyance, as againſt the inhauncer: And becauſe this Statute depends upon the ſaid Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. it extendeth therefore but to Navigable Streams.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. is a Statute in theſe points of great conſequence, and it doth alſo confirm the ſaid two former Statutes of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and doth thereto alſo make additions in theſe inſuing points:</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If Weres, Mills, Stanks, Stakes or Kiddels  have ſtood and been time out of memory in Rivers or Streams, and ſo have Warrant from Cuſtom and Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, theſe may not be cut up or pulled down by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers, becauſe long uſe and Cuſtom, which is a Law of this Kingdom, hath eſtabliſhed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If there have been Weres, Mills, Stanks,  Stakes or Kiddels time out of memory in Rivers or Streams, which of late years have been inhaunced, inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or otherwiſe exceeded the ancient ſize and accuſtomed compaſſe, the exceſſe in thoſe caſes is only to be abated and pulled down; but ſo far as the ancient Size did extend to is not to be impeached: For the words of the ſaid Statute
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40438:109"/>
be, <hi>That there be reſerved always the reaſonable ſubſtance thereof in old times accuſtomed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in my opinion the generality of the ſaid Statute of <hi>Magna Chart. cap.</hi> 23. is reſtrained by the ſucceeding Statutes, if the expoſition ſhould have been as large as the letter is.</p>
               <p>And theſe three diſtinctions do fully declare the true effect of the ſaid preceding Statutes.</p>
               <p>Then next in Order of time is the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">4 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 11. which reciteth, <hi>That by Weres, Stakes and Kiddels in the water of Thames, and in other great Rivers through the Realm, the common paſſage of Ships and Boats be diſturbed, and much people periſhed; and alſo the yong fry of fiſh deſtroyed, and againſt reaſon waſted and given to ſwine to eat;</hi> Therefore this Statute Enacts, <hi>That all former Statutes thereof made be holden, kept and put in execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here be two things which none of the former Statutes took order for;</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The one is the periſhing of the Kings people; </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other the deſtroying of the Fry of Fiſh which were occaſioned by the erecting of theſe Weres, Mills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>  Yet theſe are buſineſſes which are otherwiſe provided for, and be not pertinent to theſe Laws of Sewers: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall paſſe them over without any other further expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. doth confirm all the ſaid former Statutes made againſt Lets, Impediments and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances; <note place="margin">12 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note> And doth further Enact, <hi>That if contrary to the Award, Rule or Judgement of the Commiſsioners made according to the Statute of</hi> 1 H. 4. <hi>it be found, that any Weres, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garths, Mills, Mildams, Locks, Hebbingweres, Stakes, Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Hecks or Floodgates be made, levied, inhaunced, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or inlarged againſt the ſaid Statute, the offendors therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the aforeſaid Award, Rule and Judgement being warned by the Sheriff or under Sheriff of the County upon a</hi> Scire faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>to that purpoſe directed where thoſe annoyances be, and within three Moneths after ſuch garniſhment do not wholly amend, break down and avoid the ſaid making, levying and inhauncing,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:40438:110"/>
                  <hi>ſtraitning or inlarging, That the party being defective in that behalf ſhall forfeit One hundred Marks to the King, to be levied by Eſtreats out of the Exchequer; and if the Offendor, his Heirs, Aſſignee or Aſſigns, or any of them do defer or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame default, contrary to the Award, Rule and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commiſſioners, he or they ſhall forfeit One hundred Marks, the one moyety to the King, the other moyety to the party that will ſue for the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And alſo it was further enacted, <hi>That if any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, other then ſuch againſt whom ſuch Award, Rule or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made, or any of them, do preſume to occupy or continue any of the Weres, Fiſhgarths and Impediments aforeſaid, or other incumbrances, he ſhall forfeit for every default for every Moneth One hundred Marks, the one half to the King, the other half to the party that will ſue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appeareth, that this Statute ſpeaketh of Milldams, Locks, Hebbingweres, Hecks and Floodgates, which the other Statute never ſpeaketh of; ſo in extent thereof it hath more inlargement: And in my opinion all the foreſaid Statutes did extend only to Navigable Streams and Rivers, with ſhips and Boats.</p>
               <p>In the Tenth <hi>Report</hi> of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> the caſe of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Mills upon the River of <hi>Dee,</hi> was as inſueth, <hi>That a Cauſey or Milſtank of ſtone in the River of</hi> Dee, <hi>in the City of</hi> Cheſter, <hi>was made and erected for the neceſſary maintenance of certain Mills, ſome of the Kings, others of the Subjects, which ſtood at the end of the Cauſey;</hi> were of late by the Decree of the Commiſsioners of Sewers Ordered, That a breach therein of ten Roods or Pearches ſhould be made, which Cauſey or Milſtank was by the agreement of all parties erected before the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, and ſo had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance without any inhauncing or exaltation: And whether this Decree was warranted by any of the ſaid Statutes or not, was the queſtion, which was referred by the Lords of the Counſel to the two Chief Juſtices, <hi>Fleming</hi> and <hi>Cook,</hi> and to <hi>Tanfield</hi> the Lord Cheif Baron, to be conſidered on; and the ſaid Chief Juſtices and chief Baron declared their
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40438:110"/>
opinion, That the ſaid decree was not warranted by any of the ſaid Statutes; for they ſaid that the two Statutes of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. &amp; 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. extended but to ſuch impediments as were ſet up and erected in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and after; and that the generality of the Statute of <hi>Mag.

               <p>And the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which I now read on, did not alter the former Statutes in theſe points; But provided, That all and every Statute, Act and Ordinance heretofore made concerning the Premiſes in that Act recited, not being contrary nor before then repealed, ſhould ſtand then in force: But the ſaid Judges did hold opinion, that all the ſaid Statutes ſtood unrepealed, and acordingly made their Report to the Lords of the Councel.</p>
               <p>There be many private Statutes made for the abating pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Weres in ſome Streams which are not within my intent to recite, further then by naming of them, becauſe I take it they are not confirmed by the Statute I read on; As 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Southampton:</hi> 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Havens:</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>for killing Fry of Salmons,</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Raſtal Havens</hi> 9, 10, 11.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40438:111"/>
in that Court, whereby it appeared, that the ancient Were there had been letten to Farm by the Earls and Dukes of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and by the Kings and Dukes for a long time for yearly Rents: So that it was manifeſt that it was an ancient Were time out of memory: And this Were and Fiſhyard, and the Profits of Fiſhing were letten by the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty that now is, under the Seal of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> in the Tenth year of his Raign, to one <hi>Iohn Abrahall</hi> Eſquire, for One and thirty years, for and under the yearly Rent of Six pounds thirteen ſhillings and four pence payable to his Majeſty his Heirs and Succeſſors; And the ſaid <hi>Abrahal</hi> being ſo thereof poſſeſſed, did afterwards in the Tenth year aſſign the ſame to one <hi>William Hall</hi> Eſquire, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſaid <hi>William Hall</hi> was thereof poſſeſſed; and in the 12. year of this King, made his laſt Will and Teſtament, and did thereby ordain the complainant his Executor, and after dyed; by and after whoſe deceaſe the Complainant came to be poſſeſſed of the ſaid Leaſe and Term therein to come; and in the Nineteenth <hi>Jacobi Regis,</hi> the Commiſſioners of Sewers in thoſe parts cauſed a Jury to be impanelled and ſworn; touching this Were &amp; Fiſhyard, and gave therein a Verdict to this effect; that is, <hi>That</hi> Benedict Hall <hi>the complainant was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the ſaid Were, called</hi> Monmouth <hi>Were, upon the River of</hi> Wye, <hi>which was exceſſive high and hurtful, and was an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the common paſſage of Boats, Barks and Ballangers up and down the ſaid River, and by means thereof they could not paſſe but in great danger, which if the ſaid Were were not, Boats of two or three Tuns might paſſe the River; and that the ſaid Were had been the death &amp; drowning of one of the Kings Subjects, and is the cauſe of the ſcarcity, dearneſs and want of Salmons, and other fiſh within the ſaid River, by reaſon many of them were taken in gins of the ſaid Were, when they were out of ſeaſon, and that the ſame was a great abuſe, wrong, enormity and annoyance to the whole Country.</hi>

                  <hi>that the ſaid Were was a great let and hinderance to the common paſſage of Boats and Ballangers up and down the River, indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of the lives of the Kings Subjects, and to the deſtruction of Fiſh, as the Salmons and Fry thereof; They therefore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That the ſaid Were ſhould be overthrown, and that the Timber and Stone thereof ſhould be removed, whereby the Channel ſhould be cleared for paſſage of Boats;</hi> And accordingly did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Warrant under their Hands and Seals to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, Authorizing them thereby to overthrow the ſaid Were, which they performed accordingly: And all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the verdict of the Jury, and Decree of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ſet forth at large in the Defendants anſwers; and after examination and publication of witneſſes, the Cauſe came to be heard in the ſaid Dutchy Court before Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey May</hi> Knight, Chancellor of the Dutchy, Sir <hi>John Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Knight, one of his Highneſs Barons of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, an aſſiſtant to that Court, and Sir <hi>Tho: Chamber lain</hi> Knight, one of the Kings Juſtices of his Bench, another aſſiſtant of the ſaid Court, and Sir <hi>Edward Moſley</hi> Knight, Attorney of the ſaid Court, who were of opinion, That the ſaid Were being an anclent Were by Preſcription and Cuſtom, it ought not to have been overthrown by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Commiſsioners of Sewers, and that the ſaid verdict of the Jurors was defective, becauſe though they preſented the ſaid Were to be over high and inhaunced, yet in regard they did not preſent in <hi>quanto</hi> nor in <hi>qua parte,</hi> the ſaid Were was inhaunced above the ancient aſsize, therefore they eſteemed the ſaid Verdict of no validity.</p>
               <p>But now it comes next in time and turn to declare my opinion touching and concerning Bridges, Mills, Mil-Dams, Milſtanks, Floodgates, Hecks, Locks and Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingweres, which in the ſaid Statutes be ſet forth for Lets, Impediments and Annoyances, wherein they are to receive their expoſition according to the ſaid caſes of Weres, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other diſtinctions; for if they have had continuance time out of memory, then are they the proper and peculiar inheritances of the King, or of his Subjects, allowed by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40438:112"/>
ancient Cuſtom, confirmed by long uſe, and to remain eſtabliſhed without overthrowing or deſtroying: But if they have been inhaunced or inlarged over their ancient and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed aſsize, then the inlargement and exceſs is onely to be abated, and no more; for the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. ſaith, <hi>That there muſt be left ſufficient ſubſtance of the ancient:</hi> And if any new Were, Stank, Stake, Floodgate, Kiddel, or other thing have of late been erected on the Rivers, which is an annoyance or hurtful, then the ſame may be ordered by the Commiſsioners to be abated, overthrown, deſtroyed and pulled down, becauſe the ſame was erected without lawful warrant or authority: And ſo as I take it, theſe few diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do fully declare my opinion touching thoſe matters.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which I read on touching and concerning Lets, Impediments and Annoyances, hath theſe words in it in effect, <hi>And the Commiſsion giveth Authority to</hi> Edmond <hi>Lord</hi> Sheffield, <hi>Sir</hi> Philip Tyrwhit, <hi>Sir</hi> Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Sanderſon, <hi>Knights and Baronets, Sir</hi> Richard Aurcots, <hi>Sir</hi> John Thorold, <hi>Sir</hi> John Read, <hi>Sir</hi> Charls Bouls, <hi>Sir</hi> Ralph Maddiſon, <hi>Sir</hi> William Hanſord, <hi>Sir</hi> Francis South, <hi>Knights,</hi> Thomas Tyrwhit, John Bolles, <hi>and</hi> Nicholas Hamerton, <hi>Eſquires, whereof the ſaid Baronet and Baronets were of the</hi> Quorum, <hi>to ſurvey the Walls, Streams, Ditches, Banks, Gutters, Sewers, Goats, Calceys, Bridges, Trenches, Mills, Mildams, Floodgates, Ponds, Locks, Hebbingweres, and other Impediments, Lets and Annoyances, and the ſame to cauſe to be made, corrected, repaired, amended, put down or reformed, as cauſe ſhall require, after their wiſdoms and diſcretions; and therein to ordain and do after the form, tenor and effect of all and ſingular the Statutes or Ordinances made before the firſt day of</hi> March, <hi>in the</hi> 23 <hi>year of</hi> H 8. <hi>touching the Premiſes, or any of them; as alſo to inquire by the Oaths of honeſt and lawful men of the ſaid ſhire or ſhires, place or places, where ſuch defaults or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances be, as well within liberties as without, by whom the truth may rather be known through whoſe default the ſaid hurt and damages have happened; and who hath or holdeth any Lands or Tenements, or Common of Paſture, or profit of fiſhing, or hath</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In a former clauſe of this Statute, the Commiſsion giveth power to ſurvey the Walls, Banks, Ditches, Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sewers, Goats, Calceys, Bridges, Streams; In which clauſe theſe as neceſſary Defences are ordered to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
               <p>Then comes another clauſe, wherein theſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited as Lets and Impediments, <hi>videlicet,</hi> Streams, Mills, Bridges, Ponds, Fiſhgarths Mildams, Locks, Hebbing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weres, Hecks and Floodgates; So that by theſe two clauſes, the firſt ſort were to be maintained and not deſtroyed, and the ſecond ſort ſhould have been deſtroyed and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
               <p>And if theſe two firſt clauſes had been alone, then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners had been bound to maintain the one and deſtroy the other, without any toleration; but then came in the ſaid third clauſe, which is the clauſe of moderation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as well the Defences, as the Lets and Impediments, come all in one clauſe promiſcuouſly put together; and ſo the words <hi>(amend, correct, repair and put down)</hi> is therein referred to them all: ſo as in my opinion all defences, as Walls, Banks, Sewers, Calceys, Goats, &amp;c. be not to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, becauſe in tract of time ſome may prove unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unuſeful, which for that cauſe may be pulled down: ſo all Mills, Mildams, Floodgates, Weres, Stanks, Stakes, Kiddels, and ſuch like, are not to be put down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, but ſuch as are ancient and are thereby grown to be the proper inheritances of men, and ſuch alſo which are uſeful and neceſſary are to be maintained, kept and repaired; for in ſome great Havens and Ports, great abundance of Piles and Timberpoſts are ſet in the waters to ſtay the rage, force and violence of the waters for the ſafegard of the Port and Haven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:40438:113"/>
It were a very ridiculous expoſition of this Law, to urge the Commiſsioners to overthrow thoſe things which are helpful; and not hurful; for this Statute did foreſee, that theſe Mildams, Stakes, Stanks, Floodgates, Weres, &amp;c. were not at all times and in all places hurtful, and therefore was the ſaid clauſe of the Statute inſerted, which gave the Commiſsioners power to put down ſuch as were Lets and Annoyances in truth, and where they were uſed for ſtrengths and were of good uſe to maintain the ſame: And this conſtruction I take it is fully maintained by this Statute, but more eſpecially by the Statute of 7 <hi>Jacobi, cap.</hi> 20. where Peres, Piles, Jetties, and the like, ſet for fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">7 <hi>Jac. Reg. cap</hi> 20.</note> and ſtrengths, are expreſly ordered to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>And upon this part of this Law I do collect theſe inſuing matters:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that if one do erect and build a Were, Mill, Mildam, or other thing on a River Navigable, to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance  of Navigation; or if there was an ancient Were which was inhaunced of late years, the Commiſsioners of Sewers are to order him that did erect the one, and he which did inhaunce the other, to pull down the firſt, and to abate the exceſs of the other at the Coſts and charges of the owner: and if he or his Aſſigns or Heir, ſhall contrary to the Decree, Order or Judgement of the Commiſſioners, after the ſame hath been reformed, relevy the ſame again, or do continue the ſame contrary to order, the puniſhment of One hundred Marks is to be impoſed upon the offendors, as by the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4. formerly appeareth.</p>
               <p>And if one which is a ſtranger of his meer malice or own <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note> wrong doth pitch down Piles, or ſet down Stakes in the Rivers and Streams, he is to be fined or amerced for this offence, as the caſe ſhall require, and he is to be ordered to remove the Nuſans at his own coſts and charges; and if it cannot be found out who did the Nuſans, then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Sewers are to order thoſe to remove that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance which in all likelyhood are to ſuſtain moſt damage
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40438:113"/>
thereby, <hi>Et ita factum fuit,</hi> in 42 <hi>lib. Aſsiz. plac.</hi> 15. and <note place="margin">42 <hi>lib. Aſſiz.</hi>
                  </note> this Statute extendeth to Rivers and Streams Navigable, as well as to ſuch as be not Navigable.</p>
               <p>And touching the removing of Nuſances, I ſhall put the Commiſſioners ſome preſidents ruled and adjudged in our Books of Law which come fully to the purpoſe of the matters and things I now treat of.</p>
               <p>In 32 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 8. an aſſize of Nuſans was brought by <hi>A.</hi> againſt <hi>B.</hi> for that <hi>B.</hi> had made a Trench over a River, <note place="margin">32 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> and drew away thereby part of the waters and ſtream an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way then that which it did formerly uſe to run, and thereby ſurrounded the grounds of <hi>A.</hi> and the aſſize paſſed for the Plaintiff; &amp; it was adjudged, that the waters ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the ancient current &amp; channel at the coſts of the Defendant, and the Plaintiff recovered his damages <hi>Et quod defendens capiatur;</hi> out of which caſe I obſerve theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, though an aſſize was a private Action, yet the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans was <hi>tam querenti quam populo</hi> to the Plaintiff, for drowning and ſurrounding of his grounds; to the people, in changing or diverting the ancient courſe of the waters, ſo that for the people the offendor was ordered to reform the Nuſans, to the King he was fined, and the Plaintiff for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wrong recovered his damages.</p>
               <p>In 19 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>lib. Aſsize, plac.</hi> 6. A preſentment was found by Jury before Commiſsioners, that certain perſons by <note place="margin">19 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> name had turned the courſe of the River of <hi>Lee,</hi> which is there termed the Kings Stream, and runs from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>Waltham,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London,</hi> and had fixed and pitched Piles and Stakes therein, by means whereof Boats and Ballangers were hindred in their paſſages up and down the River, and upon this Preſentment it was awarded, that thoſe perſons which were preſented by name, and which had done part of the Nuſans, ſhould reform the ſame; and becauſe ſome of the parties names could not be diſcovered which had done other part of the ſaid Nuſans, It was Ordered, That the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff ſhould be commanded by Writ to him to be directed to reform that part of the Nuſans, taking therein to his aſſiſtance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40438:114"/>
thoſe perſons who had grounds next adjoyning; And <hi>quod defendentes ſint in miſerecordia dom' Regit,</hi> becauſe the Nuſans was not found to be done by force.</p>
               <p>In 19<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 23. in the Action upon the Caſe for a Nuſans done, the judgement in part was, That the Nuſans ſhould be removed <hi>&amp; cum hoc concordat,</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 8. upon theſe three caſes I obſerve, <note place="margin">7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That be the Action private or popular, always one part of Judgement was, That the Nuſans ſhould be removed at the coſts and charges of him or them which did it.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe caſes do fully maintain my opinion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered: And although in all the ſaid caſes it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there was a legal courſe taken to remove the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances, yet there is another courſe alowed of by the Law, and that is by abating of the Nuſans, in pulling or cutting the ſame down; and the Law is expreſſe ſo in the point in 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 35. as if it be a Nuſans done to <hi>I. S.</hi> he or ſome <note place="margin">9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.</note> other by his directions may overthrow the Nuſans; but if it be done <hi>ad nocumentum populi,</hi> as in the high or royal ſtreams, then any perſon prejudiced thereby may abate the ſame.</p>

               <p>BUt it hath been objected to me by way of Interogation, Can the Commiſſioners of Sewers make an unnavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable River or Stream to become or to be made Navigable by theſe Laws of Sewers, yea or no? Touching which I ſhall deliver my opinion as followeth:</p>
               <p>If this could have been done by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, then what ſhould it have needed to have procured Acts of Parliament for the doing thereof, as 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. to make the River of <hi>Lee</hi> Navigable, and 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. a Statute to make the River at <hi>Canterbury</hi> Navigable; and and in 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. to make the River of <hi>Ex</hi> near <hi>Exeter</hi> Navigable: and 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 20. to make a River Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and in 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> for making <hi>Thames</hi>

Navigable in the Counties of <hi>Oxford, Berks, Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter:</hi> Theſe in truth are good Arguments, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proofs; for I am of opinion, that if Streams can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made Navigable unleſs there were certain Mills, Weres, Stanks or Kiddels removed which be the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of private perſons, and have had continuance time out of memory, then directly the Commiſſioners of Sewers have not power to raze or impair theſe by the removing thereof, to make the Stream Navigable: But in theſe caſes a new private Act of Parliament muſt be obtained for the effecting thereof, which was the occaſion many of the ſaid private Statutes were obtained: But if none of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable incumbrances ſtand in the way, but that by the cleanſing or deeper caſting of the Channel the ſame may be made Navigable, Then I am of opinion, the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Sewers have power to do the ſame, and there be words in our Statute will bear this Expoſition <hi>(videlicet) And to cleanſe and purge the Trenches, Streams, Sewers, Gutters and Ditches, in all places neceſſary.</hi>

                  <p>I made it to appear, that the Dominion and Empire of theſe ſeas, The legal power of Adminiſtration of Juſtice, The property, profit and poſſeſſion thereof, doth appertain to the King.</p>

                  <p>And theſe were her friends <hi>(viz.)</hi> Banks, Sewers, Goats, Calceys and Bridges; theſe are to be maintained and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are the Defences which I fully treated of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:40438:117"/>
And theſe were the enemies, Streams, Mills, Ponds, Fiſhgarths, Mildams, Locks, Hebbingweres, Hecks and Floodgates.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are Lets and Impediments which this Statute ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, and are to be corrected, reformed or put down as cauſe ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>I ſhewed then that Rivers were of two kindes, Royal and Common Rivers; That there were other inferior kindes of thoſe watery inſtruments which might take place after Rivers, as Ditches, Gutters, Sewers, Pools, Ponds, Springs.</p>
                  <p>That water is the ſubſtantive of all theſe, and if it be a running water at random, then it is a ſtream; if it be a running water, and pent within Walls or Banks, then it is a River, Gutter, Ditch or Sewer; Theſe in their ſeveral kindes I did diſtinguiſh; And Springs I held to be the vital ſpirit of them all.</p>
                  <p>I then deſcribed the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners maner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which might be three maner of ways;<list>
                        <item>By view and ſurvey, and wherein they conſiſted.</item>
                        <item>By Jury, and on what parts that ſtood.</item>
                        <item>By diſcretion, and the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and definition thereof.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe I took upon me, by how many ſeveral ways the defences might be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which were nine in in number,<list>
                        <item>1. Frontage.</item>
                        <item>2. Ownerſhip.</item>

                        <item>9. By the Laws of Sewers.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe I proved by Reaſons, Preſidents and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and did at large diſcourſe of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:40438:117"/>
Then I came by the courſe of this Caſe to treat of Seſſes, Taxes and Lays ſet by Commiſſioners of Sewers, whereby I found ſome Inheritances there were which were ſubject to theſe ſeſſes; as thoſe that follow Houſes, Land, Meadow, Paſture, Woods, Heaths, Furs, Moors, Mariſhes, Rents, Ferries, Piſcharies, Commons, Free paſſage, Parks, Warrens.</p>
                  <p>And many Inheritances I found in reaſon freed from theſe Taxes and Lays, as Tythes in Spiritual hands, Annuities, Chaſes, Penſions, Proxies, Portions, Marts, Fairs, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Offices, things in Action, Conditions, Contingents, Uſes, Preſentations, Founderſhips.</p>
                  <p>I alſo found theſe Seſſes of three kindes, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>Cuſtomary, and then they may binde the Mountains as well as the Valleys.</item>
                        <item>Hereditary, and then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tenant and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion muſt both contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</item>

                  <p>MY third Lecture I did diſtribute into three general heads, which were meerly the grounds of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Laws.</p>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And under theſe general Rules I compriſed theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which follow:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the Honor of this Commiſſion, and for the more neceſſary execution of theſe Laws, I found them out a Court, wherein I ſet forth in what caſes Commiſſioners might Impriſon the Bodies of Delinquents, and in what caſes they might impoſe a fine, and when Amerciaments be due; and then I ſhewed that for ſome tranſgreſſions neither Impriſonment, Fine nor Amerciament was to be impoſed.</p>
                  <p>I then came to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and held a treble diſtinction of them <hi>(videlicet)</hi> that ſome were <list>
                        <item>1. Judicial, and iſſued out of the Judicial Records of this Court.</item>
                        <item>2. Other Miniſterial.</item>
                        <item>3. The third Legal; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all theſe Diverſities I ſcrewed out by proved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I ſhewed in what places theſe Diſtreſſes might be taken, when upon the Land charged, when within any place within the extent of this Commiſſion, and ſometimes within any place of this Realm; And when the proper goods of the party might be taken, and when the goods of ſtrangers, and when goods may be ſold by this Law.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards according to the order preſcribed me by my Caſe, I declared that there were ſome Interrupters to the Execution of theſe Diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>The one was by ſuing Replevins, wherein I took theſe diverſities:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:40438:118"/>
That a Sheriff being an inferior Officer could not of his own power deliver a diſtreſs taken by warrant of Sewers; But that the Commiſſioners of Sewers are bound to obey a Replevin coming out of the Kings Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter, Quia de altiori natura;</hi> Thus yet notwithſtanding goods taken by a Judgement were exempted from that Replevin.</p>
                  <p>Then I proceeded to the charge of Lands, whether a perpetual charge might be impoſed, or not.</p>
                  <p>And from thence I came to Sales, and thoſe I diſtributed into four points; <list>
                        <item>Firſt, for what cauſe.</item>
                        <item>2. What Lands.</item>

                        <item>4. To whom theſe Lands might be ſold.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>I after came into the Tractate of Legal proceedings, which may be uſed in our Court of Sewers; and firſt when and which preſentments of Sewers are traverſable, and which not.</p>
                  <p>And then wherein a party wronged may have his juſtice in this Court, and in what caſes not.</p>
                  <p>And whether the ſtrict words of the Statute would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Exemptions, and the difference of them, that ſome were general, others ſpecial; and therein I ended the Third days Exerciſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="summary_of_lecture">
                  <head>The fourth Lecture.</head>
                  <p>THe fourth day I treated of the Ability and Non-ability of the Commiſſioners, either by reaſon of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal defect, whether it conſiſted in Sex, Exile or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment that way.</p>
                  <p>And what Eſtate and value of Lands made one a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Commiſſioner, and what did the contrary; and the times when the Commiſſioner muſt have this Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Then I delivered my opinion upon the words of the Statute, which be valuable Hereditaments to inable a Commiſſioner, and which were not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:40438:119"/>
Then I proceeded to intreat of a Commiſſioners Ability in goods and moveable ſubſtance, and which were moveable ſubſtances within this Statute, and which not.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe in the Citizen-Commiſſioner Three things were required to make him able <hi>(viz.)</hi> Freedom, Eſtate in goods, and Reſciancy, I therefore handled fully all theſe parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>After all which, becauſe I had before this time no fitting opportunity to treat of Lets and Impediments, I therefore in this Lecture diſpoſed my caſe in ſuch ſort as it took hold of them all.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, becauſe the Statute I read on confirmed all other former Laws concerning the ſame, I therefore repeated them all from <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to this very time, and gave an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or declaration of them all.</p>
                  <p>I then diſtributed the learning of theſe Laws into 3 heads:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that theſe which had the ſtrength of a Cuſtom, and were grown to be particular Inheritances of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,  could not be extirped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, and whereas ſome were newly erected without Authority, they might be overthrown. </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, and whereas ſome were ancient, and were exalted  above or beyond the ancient aſsize, the exceſſe might only be abated; with theſe differences I ſatisfied theſe Statutes.</p>
                  <p>Then came I to our Statute I read on, &amp; therein I took new diverſities that was upon the Three Clauſes of my Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt did maintain the defences. </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond deſtroyed the offences. </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And the third was a general Clauſe, reciting the defences  and offences together, and did give the Commiſsioners power to reform or amend, repair or put down, as cauſe ſhould require.</p>
                  <p>Wherein I publiſhed this learning thereupon, That if an old Wall, Bank, Bridge or other Defences, were found to be out of uſe, it might be extirped.</p>
                  <p>And if a Were, Mill, Mildam, Stanks, Stakes, Piles or Floodgates were found beneficial to the publike good, they might be preſerved and maintained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:40438:119"/>
And I vouched ſome preſidents, at whoſe charges the ſaid Lets and Impediments ſhould be removed, and I ended my Argument with this, In what caſes Commiſſioners of Sewers might make unnavigable Rivers navigable, and and where not; and in that I concluded my fourth Exerciſe.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>This is the extent of my accompt, wherein I think I have done my ſelf ſome wrong in making ſo ſhort a Breviate, in omitting many things which I truly took pains in; but becauſe you were all preſent and privy to my layings out, I hope though I have omitted them in my extreats, you will allow me them in <hi>Summa totalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by your good favors I intend not to break Cuſtom or Promiſe in any thing; for I have ſome ſtock more left, which I told you when I began I had caſt under hatches, which now alſo I mean to diſtribute amongſt you; And becauſe there is ſome part of this as yet left untreated of, I will now therefore proceed to the unfolding thereof.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>And the ſame conſiſteth in theſe words of the Law, <hi>That the Commiſsioners hereafter named in any Commiſsion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purport of the ſame, have full power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make, conſtitute and ordain Laws, Ordinances and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and the ſame Laws and Ordinances ſo made to repeal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, amend and make new, as the caſes neceſſary ſhall require in that behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that whereas other Judges have power onely <hi>Jus dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> theſe Commiſſioners have alſo power <hi>Jus facere;</hi> yet this Statute gives not the Commiſſioners of Sewers abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power and authority to make and ordain Laws but <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid;</hi> for theſe Laws which they are to make, muſt be for the ſafegard, conſervation, redreſs, correction and reformation, and more then theſe, they muſt be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and behoofful; ſo they muſt not be made out of ſelf-will, and affection, but after their Wiſdoms and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions.</p>
               <p>Wherein I conceive, that never a ſentence in this Statute is ſeaſoned with more variety of caveats and grave dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40438:120"/>
then this Statute is in this very clauſe of making new Laws; ſo that theſe Laws ought to be made to amend, not to make worſe; they muſt be neceſſary, not nugatory, they are to be compoſed with wiſdom, and diſpoſed of with good diſcretion, and they ought chiefly to be made <hi>Pro bono publico,</hi> and not <hi>Pro privato alicujus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>New Laws are to be ordained for theſe purpoſes onely, that is, either for making and erecting of new neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, or for the overthrowing of ſome unneceſſary Lets and Annoyances, or for the continuance of the ancient.</p>
               <p>And in alteration, new addition, or diminution of a Wall, Bank, Sewer, Goat, Calcey or other Engine, a new Law is to be made for the effecting thereof.</p>
               <p>Alſo if an ancient Wall, Bank or other Defence be worn out of uſe, and is altogether unneceſſary; but in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Diſcretion of the Commiſsioners, and that a new one in another place were more convenient for the ſafety of the countrey; this muſt be all done by a new Law.</p>
               <p>But here a matter of Law will ariſe, and another matter of great caution: The matter of Law will reſt in this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an ancient Wall, Bank or other Defence which is grown out of uſe, may be overthrown and pulled down; and in my opinion it may, by the ſaid third clauſe of the Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, wherein power is given either to maintain them or to put them down.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I have formerly handled this point, I will therefore proceed to the caution, which is of great weight and importance; for whereas one or moe perſons are by Tenure, Covenant, Cuſtom, Preſcription or otherwiſe bound and tied to repair and maintain the ſaid ancient Bank, Wall, Sewer, or other Defence at their ſeveral and peculiar charges; if then the Commiſſioners of Sewers ſhould make a Law to overthrow or remove the ſame, and ſhould execute the ſame accordingly; and then ſhould make a Law to erect and build a new Wall, Bank or other defence in another place more convenient, yet the parties which were bound to maintain &amp; repair the former old Defences, ſhould not ſo be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40438:120"/>
tied and bound to repair and maintain theſe new erected ones, becauſe by the deſtroying of the ancient Walls and Banks, the Preſcriptions, Cuſtoms, Tenures and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants were either utterly diſſolved, or otherwiſe ſuſpended; &amp; the charge for the erecting &amp; maintaining of the new ones are to be laid on the Level: So that it behoveth Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to be careful in theſe affairs, elſe things in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion may fall out contrary to their expectations; for it is well ſaid, That <hi>Rerum progreſſus oſtendunt multa quae in initio nec praecaveri aut praevideri poſſunt.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>In making new Laws and Ordinanes theſe things are alſo conſiderable;</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, what the matter of the Law is which is to be  Enacted.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when the matter is known, then to weigh it  well, whether if it be made, if then it will prove neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and behoofful for the good of the people; and this neceſſary point is to be ſcanned by the counſel and adviſe of the moſt diſcreet and experienced perſons, and of the beſt tryed judgements in matters of this native.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, to conſider what charge the work will coſt, for the which this Law muſt be made; for in Scriptures he  is not counted ſapient that before he build a houſe will not firſt count the charge of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And fourthly, what perſons muſt bear this charge, leaſt  it prove too burthenſome; and this muſt be directed by the ability of the people which are to be charged, and by the the ſafety and commodity they are to have by the work.</p>

                  <head>Ordinance.</head>
                  <p>AN Ordinance is a word having a more private and leſs powerful ſignification then the word <hi>Law</hi> hath; for it is a Law but of a ſecundary power, enacted by a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Company or Commiſſion, proceeding meerly out of the Power and Prerogative of the King by Charter, Grant or Commiſſion warranting the ſame, as thoſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, Societies and Companies which have power by Charters or Patents to make the ſame; as is ſet forth in the caſes of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and of the Chamberlain of <hi>Londons</hi> Caſe in Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> Reports.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Ordinances may be made by the power of a Court, as in a Court Baron to make Orders, or by the Inhabitants of a Town by Cuſtom, for the ordering of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Repairing of their Churches and Highways: And theſe are more properly by-Laws then Laws; for a Law is either the Common Law, Cuſtomary Law, or an Act of Parliament; all which are of greater force then any Laws made by theſe ſecundary means, which of themſelves are of little or no ſtrength but as they are aſſiſted by other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary powers.</p>

                  <head>Decree.</head>
                  <p>A Decree is neither a Law nor Ordinance in proper defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is only a Sentence or Judgement in a Court of Juſtice, delivered or declared by the Judges there, by and through the power &amp; ſtrength of a general former Law, for <hi>Decretum eſt Sententia lata ſuper Legem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that a Law is a general direction for a multitude.</p>
                  <p>An Ordinance is a ſubordinate direction, proceeding out of a more general power.</p>
                  <p>And a Decree is a Sentence delivered for or againſt a particular perſon, grounded upon the ſaid Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>

                  <p>IT comes now fitly for me in turn and courſe to declare the continuance of theſe Laws, Ordinances and Decrees; for it is to be obſerved, that ſome of them be but temporary, though others perpetual.</p>
                  <p>The words in our Statute are, <hi>That every Statute and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance made before the Statute of</hi> 23 H. 8. <hi>concerning the things and matters therein mentioned, as well in the time of</hi> H. 8. <hi>as of any of his Progenitors, not being contrary to this Statute, or heretofore repealed, ſhall ſtand in force for ever, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be put in due Execution:</hi> But this clauſe is intended of all Acts of Parliament made touching the Sewers, and be not intended or meant of Laws and Ordinances made by the Commiſſioners of Sewers themſelves.</p>

               <p>And ſo by this ſhort declaration I have made, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners may the better obſerve how long time Laws and Ordinances of Sewers are to continue in force; yet though they loſe their vigor they may notwithſtanding be revived by the power of a new Commiſsion, or remain for preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for after ages to imitate.</p>

               <head>Repealing of Laws.</head>
               <p>IN this laſt place I intend to deliver my opinion, what Laws, Ordinances and Decrees may be repealed, altered or made void by the Commiſsioners of Sewers.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is firſt to be conſidered, what grounds are to be obſerved in repealing or altering former Laws.</p>
               <p>It appears in Eſther, that the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were ſo perdurable, as they could never be changed: And in my opinion there is required as great foreſight, judgement, and as ſound diſcretion and mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in repealing of old Laws, as in making new ones; For <hi>Quae preter conſuetudinem &amp; morem major' fiunt ne<expan>

               </p>
               <p>I have noted how carefully and conſtant the Lords of the Parliament Houſe were in the 20 year of <hi>H.</hi> 3. when they all cried out aloud <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mutare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore there ought to be great care in making Laws, ſo muſt there be great heed taken in repealing of Laws.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>And becauſe Commiſsioners of Sewers have power herein, I will therefore deliver my opinion how far that power will extend: And if one note this Branch of the Statute well, he ſhall well perceive the Judicious care taken by the Parliament in penning of it; For the words be, <hi>That the Commiſsioners of Sewers ſhould have Power and Authority to make, conſtitute and ordain Laws, Ordinances and Decrees, and the ſame Laws and Ordinances</hi> (omitting the word Decrees) <hi>to alter, repeal and make void;</hi> for a Decree is a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is <hi>Finis operis,</hi> and a Judgement cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed without a Writ of Error: Neither can a Sentence or a Decree in Chancery be reverſed without a Bill of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; neither can the Commiſsioners of Sewers reverſe a Judgement or Decree of Sewers Judiciouſly pronounced, which is a Judgement upon a Tryal betwixt the King and the party, or betwixt party and party, without a Bill of

               </p>
               <p>A Writ of Error lay at the Common Law for to reverſe a Judgement given by Commiſsioners of Sewers when the Commiſsion was in Latine, as is ſet forth in the Regiſter, being then one of the ſpecial Commiſsions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> but ſince the Commiſſion was put into the Engliſh frame, the Writs of Error ceaſed.</p>
               <p>A Law for ſale of Lands ingroſſed into parchment, and certified into the Kings Court of Chancery, with the Kings Royal aſſent had thereto, is not reverſable without an Act of Parliament; but then the ſaid ſale muſt be made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form, frame and power of this Statute.</p>
               <p>For put the Caſe that <hi>A. B.</hi> holdeth his Lands of <hi>I. S.</hi> by the payment of Twenty ſhillings yearly towards the repair of ſuch a Bridge, Bank or Wall, it fortuneth that <hi>A. B.</hi> paid the Twenty ſhillings yearly to his Lord for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who neglecteth to pay it, though he be thereto Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and Aſſeſſed to pay the ſame to the ſaid repairs by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, the ſeigniory of Twenty ſhillings yearly is to be decreed, and not the Land, for that the fault was in <hi>I. S.</hi> and not in <hi>A. B.</hi> the owner of the Land.</p>
               <p>If any perſons be by Preſcription, Cuſtom, Tenure, Covenant or otherwiſe, bound to repair Walls, Banks or other defences of Sewers, the Commiſſioners have not any power by their Commiſſion to repeal, alter or make void any of theſe, becauſe theſe are eſtabliſht by the Common Law, and Cuſtoms of the Realm, and not by the power of the Commiſſion of Sewers: But their power is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, alter or make void Laws and Ordinances made by themſelves, or by the power of their Commiſſion: And ſo the words of their Commiſſion plainly deſcribe it; For thereby they have power to make Laws and Ordinances, and the ſame to repeal, alter and make void, ſo they muſt be the ſame and no other: And herein I end all my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diſcourſe upon this Statute, for I accompt all the reſt which remaineth unſpoken of not to be worthy of
