         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all the Ignorant, Carnal, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
who are Lovers of pleasures
more than God, and seek this world
more than the Life Everlasting, and
live after the Flesh, and not after the

directed in hope of their Conversion
to God, and of their Salvation.</head>

               <salute>Miserable Souls.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi>
and <hi>Love</hi> in every <hi>true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi>
but especially in
every <hi>Faithful Minister</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which engageth
them to long and labour for your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<hi>Life</hi> is communicative and
active. It maketh us sensible that Faith
is not a fantasie, nor true Religion a
stage-play, nor our hopes of eternal
happiness a dream. And as we desire
nothing more for our selves, than to
have more of the Holy Life which we
<pb facs="tcp:47965:3"/>
have, alas! in so small a measure, so
what is it that we should more desire for
others? With the eye of an infallible
(though too weak) faith, <hi>we see</hi> the
Heaven which you neglect, and the
blessed souls in Glory with Christ, whose
companions you might be for ever: we
see the multitudes of souls in hell,
who came thither by the same way that
you are going in: who are shut out of
the glorious presence of God, and are
now among those devils that deceived
them, remembring that they had their
good things here, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25. and how
they spent the day of their visitation, and
how light they once set by God, by
Christ, by Heaven, by Mercy, whilest
Mercy was an earnest solicitour for their
hearts: And with our bodily eyes we
see at the same time, abundance of
poor sinners living about us, as if there
were no God, no Christ, no Heaven,
no Hell, no Judgment, no nor Death
to be expected; as if a man were but
a master beast, to rule the rest, and feed
upon them, and perish with them. And
if it were your own case, to see what
souls do in Heaven and Hell, and at once
to see how unbelievingly, carelesly and
senselesly most men live on earth, as if
<pb facs="tcp:47965:3"/>
there were no such difference in another
world, would it not seem a pitiful sight
to you? If you had once seen the five
brethren of <hi>Dives</hi> on earth, eating,
drinking, laughing and merry, clothed
and faring daily with the best, and at
the same time seen their brothers soul in
Hell, begging in vain for a little ease,
and wishing in vain that one from the
dead might go warn his brethren that
they come not to that place of torment,
would it not seem to you a pitiful sight?
would not pity have made you think,
[<hi>Is there no way to open these Gentlemens
eyes? No way to acquaint them what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of their brother, and where</hi> Lazarus
<hi>is, and whither they themselves are going?
No one driveth or forceth them to Hell:
and will they go thither of themselves?
and is there no way to stop them or keep
them back?]</hi> Did you but see your selves
what we see by faith (believing God)
and at once beheld the Saints in Heaven,
the lost despairing souls in Hell, and the
senseless sensual sinners on earth, that
yet will lay none of this to heart, sure it
would make you wonder at the stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of mankind. Would you not say,
O what a deciver is the Devil that can
thus lead on souls to their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
<pb facs="tcp:47965:4"/>
O what a cheater is this transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
world, that can make men so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the world where they must live for
ever! O what an enemy is this flesh,
that thus draweth down mens souls from
God! O what a besotting thing is sin
that turneth a reasonable soul into worse
than a beast! What a Bedlam is this
wicked world, when thousands are so
busily labouring to undo themselves
and others, and gratifying the Devil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the God and Saviour, who would
give them everlasting blessed life.</p>
            <p>And as we have such a sight as this by
Faith to make us pity you, so have we
so much <hi>tast</hi> of the <hi>goodness</hi> of God, the
<hi>sweetness</hi> of his wayes, and the <hi>happiness</hi>
of believers, as must needs make us wish
that you had but once tryed the same
delights, which would turn the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of sin into detestation. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that we desire nothing more for <hi>our
selves,</hi> than the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi>
of this <hi>holiness and happiness</hi> which we
<hi>believe and tast.</hi> And should we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the same for you?</p>
            <p>And being thus moved with necessary
pitty, we ask of God, what he would
have us to do for your salvation. And
he hath told us in Scripture, that the
<pb facs="tcp:47965:4"/>
preaching of his Gospel, to acquaint you
plainly with the truth, and earnestly
and frequently intreat you to turn from
the flesh and world to God by Jesus
Christ, is the means with which his
grace is ready to concurr for your
salvation, when obstinate resistance
causeth not the Holy Spirit to forsake
the sinner and leave him to himself, to
follow his own Counsels, Lusts and Wills.</p>
            <p>In this hope we undertook the Sacred
Ministry, and gave up our selves to this
great and most important work: in the
great sense of our unworthiness, but yet
in the sense of your souls necessity. We
were not such fools at our first setting
out, as not to know it must be a life of
labour, self-denial and patience, and
the devil would do his worst to hinder
us, and that all sorts of his instruments
would be ready to serve him against
our labours, and against your souls.
<hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Captain</hi> saved us by <hi>patient
Conquest,</hi> and so must <hi>we</hi> save <hi>our selves</hi>
and <hi>you:</hi> and so must <hi>you save your
selves</hi> under Christ, if ever you be saved.
It was no strange thing to <hi>Paul</hi> that
bonds and afflictions did every where
abide him, nor did he account his life
dear that he might finish his course with
<pb facs="tcp:47965:5"/>
joy, and the Ministry committed to
him by the Lord. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 23, 24. It was no
strange thing to him to be <hi>forbidden to
preach to the Gentiles that they might be
saved,</hi> by such as were <hi>filling up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their sins,</hi> and were under Gods
<hi>uttermost wrath</hi> on earth. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 15.
16. Devils and Pharisees, and most
where they came, both high and low,
were against the Apostles preaching of
the Gospel, and yet they would not
sacrilegiously and cruelly break their
Covenant with Christ, and perfidiously
desert the souls of men; even as their
Lord for the love of souls, did call <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Satan,</hi> that would have tempted
him to save his life and flesh, instead of
making it a sacrifice for our sins. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.
23.</p>
            <p>What think you should move us to
undertake a calling so contrary to our
fleshly ease and interests? Do we <hi>not
know</hi> the way of <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> of
<hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Pleasures</hi> as well as others?
And have we not <hi>flesh</hi> as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Could we not be content that
the cup of reproach and scorn and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and poverty and labours, might pass
from us, if it were not for the will of
God and your salvation? Why should
<pb facs="tcp:47965:5"/>
we love to be the lowest, and trodden
down by malignant pride, and counted
as the filth of the world and the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouring
of all things, and represented
to Rulers whom we honour, as schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
disobedient, turbulent, unruly,
by every Church-usurper, whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to make a God of? Why give we
not over this preaching of the Gospel,
at the will of Satan, that is for the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>suffering</hi> of <hi>your souls,</hi> under the
pretense of making <hi>us suffer?</hi> Is not all
this that you may be converted and
saved? If we be herein besides our
selves, it is for you. Could the words
of the ignorant or proud, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
us, that either your wants and
dangers are so inconsiderable, or your
other supplies and helps so sufficient,
that our labours had been unnecessary
to you, God knoweth we should have
readily obeyed the <hi>silencing sort of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi>
and have betaken us to some other
land, where our service had been more
necessary. Let shame be that hypocrites
reward who taketh not the saving of
souls, and the pleasing of God, for a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reward, without Ecclesiastical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities,
preferments, or wordly wealth.</p>
            <p>I have told you our <hi>motives:</hi> I have
<pb facs="tcp:47965:6"/>
told you our <hi>business</hi> and the terms of
our undertaking. It is God and you
<hi>sinners</hi> that next must tell us what our
entertainment and success shall be. Shall
it be still neglect, and unthankful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and turning away your ear and
heart, and saying, we have somewhat
else to mind? Will you still be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this deceiving world? and spend
all your daies in pampering your guts,
and providing for that flesh that must
lie rotting very shortly in a grave?
Were you made for no better work than
this? May not we bring you to some
sober thoughts of your condition, nor
one hour seriously to think whither you
are going? What! not to <hi>one awakened
look</hi> into the world where you must be
for ever? Nor one heart-raising
thought of the everlasting Glory? Not
one heart-piercing thought of all your
Saviours love, nor one tear for all your
sinful lives? O God forbid: Let not
our labour be so despised. Let not
your God, your Saviour and your souls
be set so light by. O let there be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
person among you like <hi>Esau,</hi> who
for one morsel sold his birth-right.</p>
            <p>Poor sinners! We talk not to you as
on a stage, in customary words, and
<pb facs="tcp:47965:6"/>
because that talking thus is our trade.
We are in as good earnest with you, as
if we saw you all murdering your selves,
and we are perswading you to save
your lives. Can any man be in jest
with you who believeth God? who by
faith foreseeth whither you are going,
and what you lose, and where the game
of sin will end? It is little better to jest
with you now in Pulpit or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
than to stand jesting over your
departing souls, when at death you are
breathing out your last.</p>
            <p>Alas, with shame and grief we do
confess, that we never speak to you of
these things as their truth and weight
deserve, nor with the skill and wisdom,
the affection and fervency which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
men engaged in the saving of
poor souls. But yet you may perceive
that we are in good sadness with you.
(For God is so.) What else do we stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for, labour for, suffer for, live for?
Why else do we so much trouble our
selves, and trouble you with all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
and anger them that would have
had us silent? For my own part, I will
make my free confession to you to my
shame; that I never grow co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and dull
and pittiless to the souls of others, till I
<pb facs="tcp:47965:7"/>
first grow too cold and careless of my
own (unless when <hi>weakness</hi> or <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
studies</hi> cool me, which I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they often do.) We never cease
pittying you, till we are growing too
like you, and so have need of pitty our
selves.</p>
            <p>When, through the mercy of my
Lord, the prospect of that world of
souls which I am going to, hath any
powerful operation on my self, O then
I could spend and be spent for others.
No words are too earnest, no labour
too great, no cost too dear, the frowns
and wrath of malignant opposers of the
preaching of Christ's Gospel are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to me. But when the world of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
doth disappear, or my soul is cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and receiveth not the <hi>vital illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating</hi>
influences of Heaven, I grow
cold first to my self, and then cold to
others.</p>
            <p>Come then poor sinners, and help us
who are willing at any rate to be your
helpers. As we first crave Gods help,
so we next crave yours: Help us, for we
cannot save you against your wills, nor
save you without your consent and help.
God himself will not save you without
you; and how should we? We know
<pb facs="tcp:47965:7"/>
that the Devil is against us, and will do
his worst to hinder us; and so will all
his ministers, by what names or titles
soever dignified or distinguished. But
all this is nothing if you will but take
our parts your selves: I mean if you
will take Christs part, and your own,
and will not be against your selves. Men
and Devils cannot either help or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us in saving you as you may do your
selves. If <hi>God</hi> and <hi>you</hi> be for us, who
shall be against us?</p>
            <p>And if you <hi>will help us,</hi> give over
striving against God, and Conscience,
give over fighting against Christ and
his Spirit: take part no more with the
world and the flesh which in your Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
you renounced: set <hi>your hearts</hi> to
the message which we bring you. Allow
it your <hi>man-like sober thoughts;</hi> search
the Scripture, and see whether these
things which we speak be so or not. We
offer you nothing but what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedly
chosen our selves: and that
after the most serious deliberation that
we can make. We have many a time
looked round about us, to know what
is the happiness of man: And had we
found better for <hi>our selves,</hi> we had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
better to <hi>you.</hi> If the world
<pb facs="tcp:47965:8"/>
would have served <hi>our turns,</hi> it should
have served <hi>yours</hi> also; and we would
not have troubled you with the talk of
<hi>another world:</hi> But it will not; I am
sure it will not serve your turns, to make
you happy, nor shall you long make
that sorry self-deceiving shift with it as
now you do.</p>
            <p>But if you will not <hi>think</hi> of these
things; if you will not use the reason of
men, alas what can we do to save your
souls? O pitty them Lord, that they may
pitty themselves. Have mercy on them,
that they may have some more mercy
on themselves. Help them that they
may help themselves and us. If you still
refuse, will not <hi>your</hi> loss be more than
<hi>ours:</hi> If we lose our labour (which to
our selves we shall not;) if we lose our
hopes of your salvation: what is this
to your everlasting loss of salvation it
self? And what is our suffering for your
sakes, in comparison of your endless suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>But, O, this is it that breaketh our
hearts, that we leave you under more
guilt than we found you; and when we
have laid out life and labour to save you,
the impenitent souls must have their
pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> increased, for the refusing of these
<pb facs="tcp:47965:8"/>
Calls? And that it will be part of your
Hell to think for ever how madly you
refused our Counsel, and what pains and
cost and patience were used to have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you, and all in vain. It will be so: it
must needs be so: Christ saith that <hi>it shall
be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah in the
day of Iudgment, than for the</hi> rejecters of
his Gospel-calls. The nature of the <hi>thing,</hi>
and the nature of <hi>Iustice</hi> certainly tell
you, that it must be so.</p>
            <p>O turn not our complaints to God
against you: Turn us not from beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to be reconciled to God, to
tell him you will not be reconciled.
Force us not to say, that we earnestly
invited you to the heavenly feast, and
you would not come. Force us not to
bear this witness against you, <hi>Lord we
could have born all our labour and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for them much easilyer, if they would
but have yielded to thy grace. But it
was they themselves that broke our hearts,
that lost our labour, that made us preach
and intreat in vain: It was easier to preach
without maintenance, than without success.
It was they that were worse to us than all
the persecutors in the world. How oft would
we have gathered them, but they would
not, but are ungathered still?</hi> How many
<pb facs="tcp:47965:9"/>
holy faithful Ministers have I known
these eleven years last past, who have
lived in pining poverty and want, and
hardly by charity got bread and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and yet if they could but have
truly said [Lord the Sermons, which I
preach privately and in danger, have
won home many souls to thee] it would
have made all this burden easie. But I
tell thee senseless impenitent sinner, thou
that deniedst God thy heart, and thou
that deniedst them thy Conversion,
which was the end of all their labours,
hast dealt much more cruelly with them,
than they that denied them the <hi>Levites</hi>
bread.</p>
            <p>Poor sinners! I know that I am speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this to those that are <hi>dead in sin:</hi>
but it is a <hi>death</hi> consisting with a <hi>natural
life,</hi> which hath a <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>spiritual
life:</hi> Or else I would no more speak to
you than to a stone. And I know that
you are <hi>blind</hi> in sin: but it is a <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
consisting with a <hi>reasonable</hi> faculty,
which is capable of spiritual <hi>Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
Or else I would no more perswade
you, than I would do a beast. And I
know that you are in the fetters of your
own lusts: your <hi>wills,</hi> your <hi>love,</hi> your
<hi>hearts</hi> are turned away from God, and
<pb facs="tcp:47965:9"/>
strongly bewitched with the dreams and
dalliances of the flesh and world: But
your <hi>wills</hi> are not <hi>forced</hi> to this Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
Surely those <hi>wills</hi> may be changed
by Gods grace, when you clearly see
sufficient reason for to change them:
Else I would as soon preach (were I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable)
to Devils and damned souls.
Your case is not yet desperate: O make
it not desperate: There is just the same
hope of your <hi>Salvation,</hi> as there is of
your true <hi>conversion</hi> and <hi>perseverance,</hi>
and no more: Without it there is no
hope: and with it you are safe, and
have no cause to doubt and fear. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
may yet be yours if <hi>you will.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but your own wills, refusing Christ
and a holy life, can keep you out. And
shall that do it? Shall Hell be your own
choice? And <hi>will</hi> you not, I say <hi>will</hi>
you not be saved?</p>
            <p>O think better what you do! Gods
terms are reasonable: His word and
ways are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>equal:</hi> Christs yoke
is easie and his burden light, and his
Commandments are not grievous to any,
but so far as blindness and a bad and
backward heart doth make them so. You
have no true reason to be <hi>unwilling:</hi>
God and Conscience shall one day tell
<pb facs="tcp:47965:10"/>
you and all the World that you had no
reason for it. You may as wisely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
reason to cut your throats, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
your selves, as plead reason against
a true conversion unto God. Were I
perswading you not to kill your selves,
I should make no question, but you
would be perswaded. And yet must I
be hopeless when I perswade you from
everlasting misery, and not to prefer the
world and flesh before your Saviour and
your God, and before a sure everlasting
Joy? God forbid!</p>
            <p>Reader, I take it for a great mercy
of God, that before my head lieth down
in the dust, and I go to give up my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
unto my judge, I have this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
once more, earnestly to bespeak
thee for thy own salvation. I beg it of
thee, as one that must shortly be called
away, and speak to thee no more, till
we come unto our endless state, that
thou wouldst but sometimes retire into
thy self, and use the reason of a man,
and look <hi>before</hi> thee <hi>whither</hi> thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and look <hi>behind</hi> thee, <hi>how</hi> thou
hast lived, and what thou hast been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the world till now; and look
<hi>within</hi> thee, what a case thy soul is in,
and whether it be ready to enter upon
<pb facs="tcp:47965:10"/>
Eternity; and look <hi>above</hi> thee what a
Heaven of Glory thou dost neglect, and
what a <hi>God</hi> thou hast to be thine ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Enemy,</hi> as thou <hi>choosest</hi>
and as thou <hi>livest,</hi> and that thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in his sight: <hi>Yea</hi> and look <hi>below
thee,</hi> and think where they are, that
died unconverted. And when thou
hast soberly thought of all these things,
then do as <hi>God</hi> and true <hi>Reason</hi> shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
thee. And is this an unreasonable
request? I appeal to God, and to all wise
men, and to thy own conscence when it
shall be awake. If I speak <hi>against thee,</hi>
or if all this be not for <hi>thy good,</hi> or if it
be not <hi>true</hi> and <hi>sure,</hi> then regard not
what I say: If I speak not that message
which God hath commanded his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to speak, then let it be refused as
contemptuosly as thou wilt. But if I do
but in Christs name and stead, beseech
thee to be reconciled to God, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 19, 20. refuse it at thy peril: And
if Gods beseeching thee shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against thy sloth, thy lust, thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
against the desires of thy flesh,
against the dust &amp; shadows of this world,
remember it when with fruitless cries
and horrour, thou art <hi>beseeching him</hi> too
late.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47965:11"/>I know, poor sinner, that <hi>Flesh</hi> is
bruitish, and lust and appetite have no
reason: But I know that <hi>thou</hi> hast reason
thy self which was given thee to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
them; and that he that will not be a
<hi>Man</hi> cannot be a <hi>Saint,</hi> nor a <hi>Happy man.</hi>
I know that thou livest in a <hi>tempting</hi> and
a <hi>wicked</hi> world, where <hi>things</hi> or <hi>persons</hi>
will be daily hindering this. But I know
that this is no more to a man, that by
<hi>Faith</hi> seeth <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> before him,
than a grain of sand is to a Kingdom,
or a blast of Wind, to one that is fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or flying for his life. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4. O
man! that thou didst but know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between that which the Devil
and sin will give thee, if thou wilt sell
thy soul and Heaven, and that which
God hath promised and sworn to give
thee, if thou wilt <hi>heartily</hi> give up thy
self to him.</p>
            <p>I know that thou maist possibly fall
into company (at least among some sots
and drunkards) that will tell thee, all
this is but troublesome preciseness, and
making more ado than needs: But I know
withal what that man deserveth, who
will believe a fool before his Maker:
(For he can be no better than a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fool, that will contradict and revile
<pb facs="tcp:47965:11"/>
the word of God, even the word of
Grace that would save mens souls.)</p>
            <p>And, alas, it is possible thou maist hear
some of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> (or rather of
<hi>Cain,</hi>) deriding this <hi>serious Godliness</hi> as
meer <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> and <hi>Phanaticism,</hi> and <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedness:</hi>
As if you must <hi>be no better</hi>
than the Devils slaves, lest you be
<hi>Proud</hi> in <hi>thinking</hi> that you <hi>are better than
they:</hi> That is, you must go with them
to Hell, lest in Heaven you be <hi>proud
Hypocrites</hi> for <hi>thinking</hi> your selves <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi>
than they.</p>
            <p>It may be they will tell you, that this
talk of <hi>Conversion</hi> is fitter for <hi>Pagans</hi> and
Infidels to hear, than Christians and
Protestants. Because such mens big
looks or Coats may make the poyson
the easilier taken down, I will intreat
thee but as before God to answer these
following questions, or to get them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
and then judge whether it be
<hi>They</hi> or <hi>We</hi> that would deceive thee?
and whether, as men use to talk against
<hi>Learning</hi> that have <hi>none themselves,</hi> so
such men prate not against <hi>Conversion</hi>
and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, because they have
no such thing themselves?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. I pray ask these men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a Puritane or Phanatick o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb facs="tcp:47965:12"/>
that men <hi>must dye?</hi> and what all
the pomp, and wealth, and pleasure of
the World will signifie to a departing
soul? Ask them whether they will live
on Earth for ever, and their merry hours,
and Lordly looks will have no end?
And whether it be but the conceit of
Hypocrites and Schismaticks, that their
Carcases must lie rotting in a darksome
grave?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Ask them whether man have

            <p n="3">
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Ask them whether reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

must be for ever, than of that where he
must be but for a little while, and from
whence he is posting day and night.
And whether it be not wiser to lay up
our treasure where we must stay, than
where we must not stay, but daily look
to be called away, and never more be

it be not the mark of an ungodly

And whether we must not <hi>seek first Gods

6. 33. and <hi>labour most</hi> for the <hi>meat</hi> that

Mat. 5. 8. Tit.</hi> 2. 14. And whether the
carnal mind is not enmity to God, and
to be carnally minded is not death, and
to be spiritually minded, life and peace?
And whether if you live after the flesh
you shall not die, and be condemned?
and they shall live and be saved that
walk after the Spirit? And whether any

damnableness of the <hi>Pharisees hypocrisie,</hi>
if <hi>Hypocritical Christians</hi> may be saved.
And what were these <hi>Pharisees?</hi> They
were the <hi>Masters</hi> of the Jewish Church:
The <hi>Rabbies</hi> that must have <hi>high places,
high titles,</hi> and <hi>ceremonies, formal gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and must be reverenced of all:
That gave God lip-service without the
heart, and made void his commands, and
worshipped him in vain, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men,
and strictly tythed Mint and Cummin,
while love, mercy and Justice were past
by: Who worshipped God with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ceremonies, and built the
Tombs, and garnished the Sepulchres
of the Saints; while they killed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
those that did imitate them, and
hated the <hi>living Saints,</hi> and honoured
the <hi>dead.</hi> They were the bitterest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and murderers of Christ, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
that he was a blasphemer, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
enemy to <hi>Caesar</hi> and the common
peace, and one that spake against the
Temple: They were the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Apostles, and silencers of
<pb facs="tcp:47965:15"/>
those that preached Christs Gospel, and
persecuted them that called on his name.
And had these no need of <hi>Conversion,</hi>
because they could say, God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(when the Devil was their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44.) and that they were
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed? And are not hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
Christians, drunken Christians,
fornicating Christians, carnal, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
infidel Christians, (the contradiction
is your own) persecuting Christians,
false-named hypocritical Christians, as
bad, yea worse, as they abuse a more
excellent profession? <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 7, 8. and

the Holy Catholick Church, and the
Communion of Saints,</hi> who shall have
the <hi>forgiveness of sins, and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
Ask them whether they mean
<hi>Holy Adulterers, holy worldlings, holy
perjured persons?</hi> Ask them whether
they mean a <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> in a
Tavern, in a play-house, in a gaming
house, in a whore-house, or a jesting, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
stage-play Communion? If the
Church <hi>be holy,</hi> be holy if you will be of
the Church: If it be a Communion of
Saints, make it not a Communion of
swine, and make not Saints and their
Communion seem odious either for
their infirmities, or their crossness to
your carnal interests or conceits.</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. Ask them whether there be
a <hi>Heaven,</hi> and a <hi>Hell,</hi> or not? If not,
why are they pretended Christians? If
there be, will God send one man to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and another to <hi>Hell,</hi> to so vast,
so amazing a difference of states, if
there be no great difference between
them here? If <hi>Holiness</hi> no more differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced

            <p n="19">

            <p>Pitty O Lord, and perswade these
souls: Let not Christ's blood, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
his example, his spirit, be lost
unto them, and they lost for ever. Let
not Heaven be as no Heaven to them,
while they dream and dote on the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
in this world. And O save this
land from the greater destruction, than
all our late plagues, and flames, and
divisions which our sins and thy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
make us fear. O Lord in thee
have we trusted, let us never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
            <p>Having thus contributed my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in this Preface to the furtherance
of the design of this excellent book, I
must tell thee Reader that I take it for an
honour to commend so masculine a birth
<pb facs="tcp:47965:18"/>
unto the World: The Midwife of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
or <hi>Aristotle</hi> need not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of her office. Who the Author of
this treatise was; how he preached, how
he lived, how he suffered (and for what)
and how he died, his Life and Letters
lately printed fully tell you: and I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
commend the reading of them to
all, but especially Ministers, not to tell
them what men have been here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to preach Christ's Gospel, and for
what, nor what men they are that so
many years have done it: but to tell
you what men Christ's Ministers should
be: But say not, He kill'd himself with
excessive Labour, and therefore I will
take warning, and take my ease. For
1. He lived in perfect health all his
days notwithstanding his labours, till
after his hard and long imprisonment.
2. It was not the greatest labours of his
times of liberty that hurt him, but his
preaching 6 or 7 or 8 times a week, after
that he was silenced, because he could
not speak to all his people at once. O
make not an ill use of so excellent an
example. Say not like <hi>Iudas, What need
this waste?</hi> His labour, his life, his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
his death were not in vain. The
ages to come that read his Life, and
<pb facs="tcp:47965:18"/>
read this little popular treatise, and his
<hi>Call to Archippus</hi> shall say, They were not
in vain. And though he was cut off in the
midst of his age, and his longer labours,
&amp; more elaborate writings thus preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
take thankfully this small, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical,
warm, and serious tractate:
Read it seriously, and it cannot be but it
must do thee good.</p>
            <p>I am one that have lookt into books,
and sciences, and speculations of many
sorts, and seriously tell thee as a dying
man, that after all my searches and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
I have found that <hi>Philosophical
enquiries</hi> into the <hi>Divine Artifices,</hi> and
the <hi>Nature of things</hi> hath among a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number of uncertainties, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretty pleasant probabilities, which
a holy soul can make good use of in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
God, &amp; may find us a lawful kind
of sport: but in the moralities which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
count uncertainties, the <hi>knowledge
of God,</hi> and <hi>our duty,</hi> and <hi>our hopes,</hi> the
<hi>doctrine and practice</hi> of <hi>Holiness, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> and the <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
seeking</hi> &amp; <hi>joyful hopes of life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
is all the true <hi>Wisdom,</hi> the <hi>Goodness,</hi>
the <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of a soul: whatever
be our <hi>play,</hi> this is the <hi>satisfying certainty,</hi>
the <hi>Business,</hi> and the <hi>beatifying</hi> improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47965:19"/>I have done, when I have sought to
remove a little scandal, which I foresaw;
that I should my selfwrite the Preface to
his Life, where himself and two of his
friends make such a mention of my name,
which I cannot own; which will seem a
praising him for praising me. I confess it
looketh ill-favouredly in me: But I had
not the power of other mens writings,
&amp; durst not therefore forbear that which
was his due. Had I directed their pens
they should have gone a middle way,
and only esteemed me [a very unworthy
servant of Christ, who yet long to see the
peace and prosperity of his Church] and
should have forborn their undeserved
praise, as other men should have done
their slanderous libels. But if the Reader
get no harm by it, I assure him the use I
made of it was, to lament that I am really
<hi>so much worse</hi> than they esteemed me; and
to fear lest I should prove yet <hi>worse than</hi> I
discern my self; who see so much sin and
weakness, in my betters, and much more
in my self, as to make it the <hi>constant senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of my soul, that PRIDE of mens
GREATNESS, WISDOM and GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS
is the first part of the DEVILS I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAGE
on mans soul, and DARKNES is
the second, and MALIGNITY the third.</p>

said to this man, that's like to
<pb facs="tcp:47965:20"/>
bring him to good? Friend, know
thy self better, or thou perishest
without remedy. Thou maist pray,
but what hope is there in thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Thou maist read, but what
hope is there in thy reading? Yet
read on, this little hope there is;
In this book there's <hi>Eye-Salve</hi>
that may heal thee of thy blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
In this book there is a <hi>Glass</hi>
that will shew thee thy face. Dost
thou know thine own face when
thou seest it? Behold thy very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in those <hi>Marks</hi> that are
given of an unconverted person;
Read and consider them, and
then say, if thou be not the
man.</p>
            <p>Be willing to know thy self,
and to know the worst of thy case;
wink not at the light, hide not
thy self from thine own soul. Wilt
thou never know thy disease, till
thou be past remedy?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47965:21"/>Much of our hardest work would
be over, if we could see the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to whom we are sent, to be
<hi>convinced sinners.</hi> If we could
but open the blind eyes, there were
hope we should shortly raise the
dead.</p>
            <p>Sinner, of a truth, thou art
in evil case, whether thou know
it or not; thou art among the dead,
and there is but a step betwixt
thee and Hell. Thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it though it be told thee,
yet once again let me beseech thee,
come to the Glass that is here
presented to thee, and narrowly
observe whether the very marks
of the dead be not found upon
thee.</p>
            <p>If there be a miscarriage in this
first work, if thou wilt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
thy misery and thy dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
there's an end of all hopes
concerning thee. Whilest this
<pb facs="tcp:47965:21"/>
self-ignorance abides upon thee,
all the Counsels, that are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a man in thy case, will do
thee no good; they are never like
to prosper with thee, because thou
wilt not count them proper for
thee. Who will be perswaded to
do that, which he believes is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done? Who will take the
Counsel of the Physician that does
not think himself sick? The man
of God may spare his pains of
perswading thee to Conversion,
whilest thou art confident thou art
converted already. Who will be at
the pains of repentance that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
he hath repented? Who will
bear the labour and the pangs of
the new birth that is confident he is
already passed from death to life?</p>
            <p>But Friend, let me a little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with thee; Thou art confident
it is well with thee, yet why wilt
thou not yield to thus much at least,
<pb facs="tcp:47965:22"/>
to put it to the question, <hi>am I not
mistaken?</hi> Thou art worse than mad,
if thou thinkest such a question may
not be put. Dost thou know that
thine heart is false and deceitful,
and yet because it speaks good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thee, must it not be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
whether it speak <hi>truth</hi> or no?
Be so wise as to conclude <hi>I may be
mistaken,</hi> and thus come to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
whether thou art mistaken or not.</p>
            <p>And if upon trial by the marks
that are before thee, thou come to be
undeceived, and see thy self wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in that misery which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thou wouldst not suspect, the
next news I expect to hear from thee
is, <hi>What must I do to be saved?</hi>
O were it come to that once! Then
thou hast an answer at hand in those
<hi>Means</hi> thou wilt find prescribed
thee: And because they are such as
thou wilt hardly be perswaded to
use, take in the <hi>Motives</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb facs="tcp:47965:22"/>
and these will help down the
means. Consider both the one and
the other, and if thou dost not find
the means proper, and the motives
weighty, I think I shall do thee no
wrong if I tell thee, thou art still of
a blind mind and an harder heart.</p>
            <p>Friend, the matter which this
little book comes to treat with thee
about, is of highest importance;
'tis a matter of life and death. If
thou sayest, The terms upon which
Life is offered, are hard; consider,
is it not harder to dye? He is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to dye who will lose his soul to
save his labour. If thou couldst
step down into the deep, and take
a turn or two with those damned
souls who are drench'd with fire and
brimstone, and bound in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
chains of vengeance, &amp; shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
ask them, <hi>Now what do you
think of the terms upon which
life was offered? Now what think
<pb facs="tcp:47965:23"/>
you of that repentance, of that
obedience, of that holy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,
self denyal, and the
greatest severity which by the
Gospel were imposed upon you?
If you might once again have the
same terms granted you for
your redemption from this place
of torment, would you yet say,
Hard terms! Let me rather dye
this death for ever, than live such
a life! let me broil in this furnace,
rather than escape with such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty!</hi>
Shouldst thou ask them thus
that have felt what 'tis to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
what answer dost thou think
they would make? O friend, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again groan under the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of conversion, till thou believe
them to be worse than Hell. But I
will not farther anticipate my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Author.</p>
            <p>Nor is there much need I should
commend either himself or his works;
<pb facs="tcp:47965:23"/>
for the Author himself thou maist
at a small charge get acquaintance
with him in that History of his life
and death, which is extant; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which I shall only say,
<q>Sic mihi contingat vivere sicque
mori.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And for this work of his, what
commendation I should give of it,
would be needed no longer than till
thou hast read it over. Thou wilt
find such Wine in it as needs no
Bush. This only I shall say, as far
as my credit will go, it is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well worth thy most serious peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.
O maist thou hear that voice,
(such a voice from Heaven there is
whether thou hear it or no) <hi>Tolle
&amp; lege, take up and read.</hi> Read,
friend, and read over again. Read
and understand, understand and
pray, pray and consider, consider
and consent unto him, who by the
<pb facs="tcp:47965:24"/>
pen of his servant calls to thee from
Heaven, <hi>why wilt thou dye? turn
and live.</hi> O suffer this word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and exhortation, to open

            <head>Mr. JOSEPH ALLEINE'S
CALL
TO THE
UNCONVERTED.</head>
            <p>DEarly Beloved, and longed for,
I gladly acknowledge my self a
debtour to you all, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
as I would be found a
good steward of the houshold of
God, to give to every one his portion. But
the Physician is most sollicitous for those
Patients, whose case is most doubtful and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous,
and the Fathers bowels are especially
turned towards his dying child. The numbers
of the unconverted souls among you, call for my
most earnest compassions, and hasty diligence
to pluck them out of the burning, <hi>Iud.</hi> 23. and
therefore to these first I shall apply my self in
these lines.</p>
            <p>But whence shall I fetch my arguments, or
how shall I choose my words? Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
shall I wooe them? whereby shall I win
them? Oh that I could but tell! I would write
unto them in tears, I would weep out every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I would empty my veins for ink, I
would petition them on my knees; verily
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47965:25"/>
(were I able) I would, (O how thankfully
I would!) if they would be prevailed with to
repent and turn.</p>
            <p>How long have I travelled in birth with
you? how frequently have I made suit to you?
how often would I have gathered you? how
instant have I been with you? This is that I
have prayed for, and studied for, for many
years, that I might bring you to God: O that I
might but do it! Will you yet be intreated?
O what a happy man might you make me, if
you would but hearken to me, and suffer me to
carry you over to Jesus Christ?</p>
            <p>But, Lord, how insufficient am I for this work! I
have been many a year wooing for thee, but the
damsel would not go with me. Lord, what a task
hast thou set me to! Alas wherewith shall I pierce
the scales of Leviathan, or make the heart to feel
that is firm as a stone, hard as a piece of the
nether milstone! Shall I go and lay my mouth to
the grave, and look when the dead will obey me
and come forth? shall I make an oration to the
rocks? or declaim to the mountains, and think to
move them with arguments? shall I give the blind
to see? From the beginning of the world was it not
heard, that a Man opened the eyes of the blind.
But thou, O Lord, canst pierce the scales, and
prick the heart of the sinner. I can but shoot at
rovers, and draw the bow at a venture; do thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the arrow between the joints of the harness,
and kill the sin, and save the soul of the sinner,
that casts his eye into these labours.</p>
            <p>But I must apply my self to you, to whom I
am sent: yet I am at a great loss. Would to
God I knew how to go to work with you!
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47965:25"/>
would I stick at the pains? God knoweth, you
your selves are my witnesses, how I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
you in private, as well as in publick,
and have brought the Gospel to your doors;
testifying to you the necessity of the new birth,
and perswading you to look in time after a
found and through change. Beloved, I have
not acted a part among you, to serve my own
advantage; our Gospel is not yea, and nay.
Have not you heard the same truths from the
Pulpit, by publick labours, and by private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by personal instructions? Bretheren, I
am of the same mind as ever, that holiness is
the best choice; that there is no entring into
Heaven, but by the streight passages of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
birth: that without holiness you shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Ah my beloved! refresh
my bowels in the Lord. <hi>If there be any consolation
in Christ, any comfort of love, any fellowship of the
spirit, any bowels and mercies, fulfil you my joy.</hi>
Now give your selves unto the Lord: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
8. 5. Now set your faces to seek him. Now
set up the Lord Jesus in your hearts, and set
him up in your houses. Now come in, and kiss
the Son, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 12. and embrace the tenders
of his mercy. Touch his Scepter, and live:
why will you die? I beg not for my self; but
fain I would have you happy: This is the prize
I run for, and the white I aim at. My souls
desire and prayer for you is, that you may be
saved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> having instituted most
strict and wholesome laws for his people, told
them, he was necessitated to go a journey from
them, and got them to bind themselves in an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47965:26"/>
oath, that his laws should be observed, till his
return. This done, he went into a voluntary
banishment, and never returned more, that
they might, by vertue of their oath, be engaged
to the perpetual observing of his laws. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I should be glad of the hard conditions,
which he endured (though I love you tenderly)
so I might but hereby engage you throughly to
the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved, would you rejoice the heart
of your Ministers? Why then, embrace the
counsels of the Lord by me: forgo your sins:
set to prayer: up with the worship of God in
your families: keep at a distance from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the times. What greater joy to a
Minister, than to hear of souls born unto
Christ by him, and that his children walk in the
truth? 2 <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Brethren, I beseech you suffer a friendly
plainness and freedom with you in your deepest
concernments. I am not playing the oratour to
make a learned speech to you, nor dressing my
dish with eloquence, wherewith to please you.
These lines are upon a weighty errand indeed,
<hi>viz.</hi> to convince, and convert, and save you. I
am not baiting my hook with Rhetorick, nor
fishing for your applause, but for your souls.
My work is not to please you, but to save you:
nor is my business with your fancies, but
your hearts. If I have not your hearts, I have
nothing. If I were to please your ears, I would
sing another song. If I were to preach my
self, I would steer another course. I could
then tell you a smoother tale; I would make
you pillows, and speak you peace, for how can
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47965:26"/>
               <hi>Ahab</hi> love this <hi>Micaiah,</hi> that alwaies prophesies
evil concerning him? 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 8. But how
much better are the wounds of a friend, than
the fair speeches of the harlot, who flattereth
with her lips, till the dart strike through the
liver, and hunteth for the precious life? <hi>Prov.
7. 21. 22, 23. &amp; Prov.</hi> 6. 26. If I were to quiet
a crying infant, I might sing him into a pleasant
mood, or rock him asleep: but when the child
is fallen into the fire, the parent takes another
course; he will not now go to still him with a
song or trifle. I know, if we speed not with
you, you are lost: if we cannot get your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to arise and come away, you perish for
ever. No Conversion, and no Salvation. I
must get your good will, or leave you miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here the difficulty of my work again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs
upon me.</hi> Lord choose my stones out of the
rock. 1 Sam. 17. 40. v. 45. I come in the name
of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of
<hi>Israel.</hi> I come forth like the stripling against
<hi>Goliah,</hi> to wrestle not with flesh and blood, but
with Principalities, and Powers, and the Rulers
of the darkness of this world. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. This
day let the Lord smite the Philistine, and spoil the
strong man of his Armour, and give me to fetch
off the captives out of his hand. Lord choose my
words, choose my weapons for me, and when I put
my hand into the bag, and take thence a stone, and
sling it, do thou carry it unto the mark, and make
it sink, not into the forehead, 1 Sam. 17. 49. but
the heart of the unconverted sinner, and smite him
to the ground, with <hi>Saul</hi> in his so happy fall. Act.
9. 4. Thou hast sent me, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Eliezer,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47965:27"/>
to take a wife unto my master thy son. Gen. 24. 4.
But my discouraged soul is ready to fear, the woman
will not be willing to follow me. O Lord God of
my Master, I pray thee send me good speed this
day, and shew kindness unto my Master, and send
thine Angel before me, and prosper my way, that
I may take a wife unto thy son. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 12.
That as the servant rested not, till he had brought
Isaac and <hi>Rebeckah</hi> together, so I may be succesful
to bring Christ and the souls of my people together,
before we part.</p>
            <p>But I turn me unto you. Some of you do not
know what I mean by conversion, and in vain
shall I perswade you to that which you do not
understand; and therefore for your sakes, I shall
shew <hi>what this Coversion is.</hi> Others do cherish
secret hopes of mercy, though they continue as
they be; and for them I must shew <hi>the necessity
of Conversion.</hi> Others are like to harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with a vain conceit, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
already; unto them I must shew <hi>the
marks of the Vnconverted.</hi> Others, because they
feel no harm, fear none, and so sleep upon the

               </gap>t; to them I shall shew <hi>the
misery of the Vnconverted.</hi> Others sit still, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they see not their way out; to them I
shall shew <hi>the means of Conversion.</hi> And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the quickening of all, I shall close with
<hi>the motives of Conversion.</hi>

And therefore that you may not mistake me, I
shall shew you what I mean by the conversion
I perswade you to endeavour after.</p>
            <p>It is storied that when <hi>Iupiter</hi> let down the
golden chaplets from Heaven, all of them but
one were stoln: Whereupon (left they should
lose a relique of so great esteem) they made
five others so like it, that if any were so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
minded, as to steal that also, they should
not be able to discern which was it. And truly
my beloved, the Devil hath made many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits
of this conversion, and cheats one with
this, and another with that; and such a craft
and artifice he hath, in this mystery of deceits,
that (if it were possible) he would deceive
the very Elect. Now that I may cure the
damnable mistakes of some, who think they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47965:28"/>
are converted, when they are not; as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the troubles, and fears of others, that
think they are not converted, when they are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
I shall shew you the nature of conversion, both
negatively, or what it is not; and positively,
what it is.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the negative.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not the taking on us the profession of
Christianity.</hi> Doubtless Christianity is more
than a name. If we will hear <hi>Paul,</hi> it lies not
in word, but in power. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20. If to cease
to be Jews and Pagans, and to put on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
profession had been true conversion, (as
this is all, that some would have to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by it) who better Christians than they of
<hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea?</hi> These were all Christians
by profession, and had a name to live, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had but a name, are condemned by
Christ, and threatened to be spewed out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
1, 16. Are there not many that name the name
of the Lord Jesus, that yet depart not from
iniquity? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and profess they know
God, but in works deny him? <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. And
will God receive these for true converts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
turned to the Christian religion? What,
converts from sin, when yet they do live in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in! 'Tis a visible contradiction. Surely if the
lamp of profession would have served the turn,
the foolish virgins had never been shut out.
<hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 3, 12. We find not only professours
but preachers of Christ, and wonder-workers
turned off, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> or putting on the badge of Christ
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47965:28"/>
in baptism. Many take the press-money, and
wear the Livery of Christ, that yet never stand
to their colours, nor follow their leader. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias,</hi>
and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and <hi>Magus</hi> were baptized,
as well as the rest. How fondly do many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
here, deceiving, and being deceived!
dreaming, that effectual grace is necessarily tied
to the external administration of baptism,
(which what is it, but to revive the popish
tenent, of the Sacraments working grace, <hi>ex
opere operato?)</hi> and so every infant should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
not only (<hi>Sacramento tenus)</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally,
but really and properly. Hence
men do fancy, that being regenerated already,
when baptized, they need no further work.</p>
            <p>But if this were so, then all that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(in their infancy) must necessarily be
saved: because the promise of pardon and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is made to conversion and regeneration.
<hi>Act. 3. 19. 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4. Matth.</hi> 19. 28. Our
Calling, Sanctification, (as to the beginnings
of it) or conversion, (which are but the same
thing, under different conceptions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;)
is but a middle link in the golden
chain, fastened to election at the one end, and
glorification at the other. <hi>Rom. 8. 30. 2 Thes.
2. 13. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. The silver cord may not be
broken, nor the connexion between sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and salvation, between grace and glory,
impiously violated. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. If we are indeed
begotten again, it is to an inheritance incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reserved in Heaven for us, and the divine
power is ingaged to keep us for it 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. And
if the very regenerate may perish at last in their
sins, we will no more say, That he that is born
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47965:29"/>
of God, his seed remaineth in him, and that
he cannot sin, 1 <hi>Iohn. 3. 9. i. e.</hi> unto death, nor
that it is impossible to deceive the very elect.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.</p>
            <p>And indeed were this true, then we need
look no further to see our names written in
Heaven, than only to search the register, and
see whether we were baptized: then I would
keep the certificate of my baptism, as my fairest
evidence for Heaven, and should come by Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of my gracious state, with a wet finger:
then men should do well to carry but a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of their baptism under the registers hand,
when they died, (as the Philosopher would be
buried with the Bishops bond in his hand, which
he had given him for the receiving his alms in
another world:) and upon sight of this, there
were no doubt of their admission into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</p>
            <p>In short, if there be no more necessary to
conversion or regeneration, than to be turned
to the Christian Religion, or to be baptized in
infancy, this will flie directly in the face of that
scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 14. as well as multitudes of
others. For first, we will then no more say,
<hi>Strait is the gate and narrow is the way:</hi> for if all
that are baptized, and of the true religion are
saved, the door is become heavenly wide, and
we will henceforth say, wide is the gate, and
broad is the way, that leadeth unto life: for if
this be true, whole parishes, yea whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and whole Kingdoms may go in a breast,
and we will no more teach, that the righteous
is scarcely saved, or that there is need of such a
stir in taking the Kingdom of Heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47965:29"/>
and striving to enter in. Surely if the
way be so easie, as many make it, that there is
little more necessary, than to be regenerated
in our baptism, and cry God mercy, and be
absolved by the Minister at our end, 'tis more
ado than needs, to put our selves to such run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and seeking, and knocking, and fighting,
and wrestling, as the word requires, as necessary
to salvation. Secondly, if this be true, we will
no more say, <hi>few there be that find it:</hi> yea we
will rather say, <hi>few there be that miss it:</hi> we
will no more say, that of the many that are
called, but <hi>few are chosen, Matth.</hi> 22. 14. and
that even of the professing <hi>Israel, but a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
shall be saved, Rom.</hi> 11. 5. If this doctrine
be true, we will not say any more with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
<hi>Who then shall be saved?</hi> but rather
who then shall not be saved? Then if a man
be called a brother (that is, a Christian) and
be baptized, though he be a fornicatour or a
railer, or covetous, or a drunkard, yet he shall
inherit the Kingdom of God. 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. 1 Cor.</hi>
6. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Arminian</hi> will reply; such as these,
though they did receive regenerating grace in
Baptism, are since fallen away, and must be
renewed again, or else they cannot be saved.</p>
            <p>I answer, 1. That there is an infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between regeneration and salvation, as
we have already shewed, and itch to be farther
evidencing, but that 'tis against designed brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
2. Then men must be again born again,
which carries a great deal of absurdity in its
very face. And why may not men be twice
born in nature, as well as in grace? Why not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47965:30"/>
as great an absurdity to be twice regenerated
as to be twice generated? But 3. and above
all, This grants however the thing I contend
for, that what ever men do, or pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in baptism, if they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound afterwards
to be grosly ignorant or prophane, or formal,
without the power of godliness, they must be
born again, or else be shut out of the Kingdom
of God. So then, they must have more to plead
for themselves, than their baptismal rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>Well, in this you see all are agreed, that be it
more or less that is received in baptism, if
(when men come to years) they are evidently
unsanctified, they must be renewed again by a
through and powerful change, or else they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
escape the damnation of hell. Friends and
Brethren be not deceived, God is not mocked;
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. whether it be your baptism or what
ever else that you pretend, I tell you from the
living God, that if any of you be a prayerless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>Iob</hi> 15. 14. or unclean, or malicious, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
or riotous, or a scoffer., or a lover of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
company, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. in a word, if you
are not holy, strict, and self denying Christians,
<hi>Heb. 12. 14. Matt.</hi> 16. 24. you cannot be saved,
except you be transformed by a further work
upon you, and renewed again by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Thus I have shewed, that it is not enough to
evidence a man to be regenerate, that he hath
been baptized; effectual grace not necessarily
accompanying baptism, as some have vainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rted.
But I must answer one objection before
I pass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47965:30"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The Sacraments do certainly attain their
ends, where man doth not <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> or lay
some obstruction, which Infants do not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer it is not the end of Baptism to
regenerate. 1. Because then there would be
no reason, why it should be confined only to
the seed of believers: for both the law of God,
and the nature of Charity, require us to use the
means of conversion for all, as far as we can
have opportunity. Were this true, no such
charity as to catch the children of Turks and
Heathens, and baptize them, and dispatch
them to heaven out of hand, like the bloody
wretches, that made the poor Protestants (to
save their lives) to swear they would come to
mass, and that they would never depart from
it, and then put them forth with to death, saying,
<hi>they would hang them while in a good mind.</hi> 2.
Because it presupposeth regeneration, and
therefore cannot be intended to confer it. In
all the express instances in Scripture, we find
that baptism doth suppose their repenting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
receiving the Holy Ghost. <hi>Act. 8 37.
Act. 2. 38. Act. 10. 47. Mark</hi> 16. 16. And to
imagine, that baptism was instituted for an end
of which not one of the first subjects was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
(for they were all adult persons and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have faith and repentance according
as they professed, and their children were not
baptized till after them, in their right,) were
no little absurdity. Were this doctrine true,
baptism would make disciples, but we find it
doth bespeak them such before hand. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.
19. 3. Because Baptism, being but a Seal of
the Govenant, cannot convey the benefits, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47965:31"/>
according to the tenour of the covenant, to
which it is set. Now the Covenant is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
therefore the Seal conveys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally.
The Covenant requires faith and
repentance, as the condition of the grand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
pardon, and life. <hi>Act. 16. 31. Act.</hi> 3. 19.
And what the Covenant doth not convey but
upon these conditions, the Seal cannot. So
that baptism doth presuppose faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the subject, without which it neither
doth, nor can convey the saving benefits: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the Seal should convey contrary to
the tenour of the Covenant to which it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed.</p>

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It lies not in the chaining up of corruption, by

was nothing more than good education all this

            <p n="6">6. <hi>In short, it consists not in illumination, or
convictions, in a superficial change, or partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>

<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. and a <hi>Felix</hi> tremble under

have fin alarm'd only by convictions, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have it captivated and crucified by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
grace. Many, because they have been
troubled in conscience for their sins, think well
of their case; miserably mistaking conviction
for conversion. With these <hi>Cain</hi> might have
passed for a Convert, who run up and down the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47965:32"/>
world, like a man distracted under the rage of
a guilty conscience, till with building and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
he had worn it away. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13, 14.
Others think, that because they have given off
their riotous courses, and are broken off from
evil company, or some particular lust, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to sobriety and civility, they are now no
other than real Converts; forgetting that there
is a vast difference between being sanctified,
and civilized; and that many seek to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. and
are not far from it, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34. and arrive to
the <hi>almost</hi> of Christianity, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 28. and yet
fall short at last. While conscience holds the
whip over them, many will pray, hear, read
and forbear their delightful sins: but no sooner
is this Lyon asleep, but they are at their vomit
again. Who more religious than the Jews,
when Gods hand was upon them? <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 34,
35. but no sooner was the affliction over, but
they forgat God, and shewed their religion to
be but a fit, <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. Thou maist have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged
a troublesome sin, that will not sit in
thy stomach, and have escaped the gross pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions

thy swinish nature, all the while. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 20, 22.</p>
            <p>You may cast the lead, out of the rude mass,
into the more comely proportion of a plant,
and then into the shape of a beast, and thence
into the form and features of a man: but all
the while, it is but lead still. So a man may pass
through divers transmutations, from ignorance
to knowledge, from prophaneness to civility,
thence to a form of religion, and all this while
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47965:32"/>
he is but carnal and unregenerate, while his
nature remains unchanged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application. Hear then, O sinners hear; as you
would live, so come and hear, Esay</hi> 55. 3. Why
would you so wilfully deceive your selves, or
build your hopes upon the sand? I know he
shall find hard work of it, that goes to pluck
away your hopes. It cannot but be ungrateful
to you, and truly it is not pleasing to me. I set
about it, as a Surgeon, when to cut off a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
member from his well-beloved friend;
which of force he must do, but with an aking
heart, a pitiful eye, and trembling hand. But
understand me, Brethren, I am only taking
down the ruinous house, (which will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
speedily fall of it self, and hurry you in
the rubbish,) that I may build fair, and strong,
and firm for ever. The hope of the wicked shall
perish, if God be true of his word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 7.
And wert not thou better, O sinner, to let the
word convince thee now in time, and let go
thy false and self-deluding hopes, than to have
death too late to open thine eyes, and find thy
self in hell, before thou art aware? I should
be a false and faithless Shepherd, if I should
not tell you, that you who have built your
hopes upon no better grounds, than these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
are yet in your sins. Let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
speak; What is it, that you have to
plead for your selves? Is it that you wear
Christs livery? That you bear his name? That you
are of the visible Church? That you have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the points of Religion, are civilized,
perform religious duties, are just in your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47965:33"/>
have been troubled in conscience for your
sins? I tell you from the Lord, these pleas will
never be accepted at Gods Bar. All this, though
good in it self, will not prove you converted,
and so will not suffice to your salvation. Oh
look about you, and bethink your selves of
turning speedily and soundly. Set to praying,
and to reading, and to studying your own
hearts, rest not, till God hath made through
work with you: for you must be other men,
or else you are lost men.</p>
            <p>But if these be short of Conversion, what
shall I say of the prophane sinner? It may be,
he will scarce cast his eyes, or lend his ears
to this discourse: but if there be any such read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or within hearing, he must know from
the Lord that made him, that he is far
from the Kingdom of God. May a man be
civilized and not converted, where then shall
the Drunkard, and Glutton appear? May a
man keep company with the wise Virgins, and
yet be shut out? shall not a companion of fools
much more be destroyed? <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. May a
man be true and just in his dealings, and yet not
be justified of God? What then will become
of thee, O wretched man, whose conscience
tells thee thou art false in thy trade, and false of
thy word, and makest thine advantage by a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tongue. If men may be inlightened, and
brought to the performance of holy duties,
and yet go down to perdition, for resting in
them, and sitting down on this side of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
what will become of you, O miserable
families, that live as without God in the world?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47965:33"/>
And of you, O wretchless sinners, with whom
God is scarce in all your thoughts; that are so
ignorant, that you cannot, or so careless, that
you will not pray? O repent and be converted;
break off your sins by righteousness: away to
Christ for pardoning and renewing grace: give
up your selves to him, to walk with him in
holiness, or else you shall never see God. Oh

            <p>Conversion then (in short) lies, in the
thorow change both of the heart, and life. I
shall briefly describe it in its nature and causes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Author of it is the spirit of God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called, the sanctification of the spirit;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47965:34"/>
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. and the renewing of the Holy
Ghost. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Yet not excluding the other
persons in the Trinity: For the Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, to bless the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, for that he hath begotten us again:
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. and Christ is said, to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to <hi>Israel; Acts</hi> 5. 31. and is called the
everlasting Father; <hi>Esay</hi> 9. 6. and we his seed,
and the children which God hath given him
<hi>Heb. 2. 13. Esay</hi> 53. 10. Oh blessed birth! Seven Cities contended for the birth of <hi>Homer:</hi>
but the whole Trinity fathers the new creature.
Yet is this work principally ascribed to the
Holy Ghost, and so we are said to be born of
the Spirit. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>So then, it is a work above mans power.
We are born, not of the will of the flesh, nor
of the will of man; but of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 13.
Never think thou canst convert thy self. If ever
thou wouldst be savingly converted, thou must
despair of doing it in thine own strength. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.
18. It is a resurrection from the dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.
5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. a new creation, <hi>Gal. 6. 15.
Eph.</hi> 2. 10. a work of absolute omnipotency:
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. Are not these out of the reach of
humane power? If thou hast no more, than
thou hadst by thy first birth, a good nature, a
meek and chast temper, &amp;c. thou art a very
stranger to true Conversion. This is a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The moving cause is Internal, or Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Internal mover is only free grace.</hi> Not
by works of righteousness which we have done;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47965:34"/>
but of his own mercy he saved us—by the
renewing of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Of his
own will begat he us: <hi>Iames</hi> 1. We are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and called unto Sanctification, not for it.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>God finds nothing in man to turn his heart,
but to turn his stomach: enough to provoke his
loathing, nothing to provoke his love. Look
back upon thy self, O Christian. Take up thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
rags: Look upon thy self in thy blood.
<hi>Ez.</hi> 16. 6. O reflect upon thy swinish nature,
thy filthy swill, thy once beloved mire. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. Canst thou think without loathing of thy
trow and draugh? Open thy Sepulchre, <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. 27. Art not thou almost struck dead with
the hellish damp? Behold thy putrid soul, thy
loathsome members. O stench unsufferable, if
thou dost but sense thine own putrefaction!
<hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3. Behold thy ghastly visage,
thy crawling lusts, thy slime and corruption.
Do not thine own cloths abhor thee? <hi>Ioh</hi> 9.
31. How then should holiness and purity love
thee. Be astonied O Heavens at this, be moved
O earth. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 12. Who but must needs cry,
Grace! Grace! <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. Hear and blush you
children of the most High. O how unthankful
generation! That free grace is no more in your
mouths; in your thoughts; no more adored
admired, commended by such as you. One
would think you should be nothing but praising
and admiring God, where ever you are. How
can you make a shift to forget such grace, or to
pass it over with a slight and seldom mention?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47965:35"/>
What but free grace should move God to love
you, unless enmity could do it, or deformity
could do it; unless vomit, or rottenness could
do it? How affectionately doth <hi>Peter</hi> lift up his
hands? <hi>Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ, who of his Abundant mercy hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
us again:</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. How feelingly doth
<hi>Paul</hi> magnifie the free mercy of God in it?
<hi>God who is rich in mercy, for his great love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

with Christ; by Grace are ye saved. Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The External mover is the merit and intercession
of the blessed Iesus.</hi> He hath obtained gifts for
the rebellious; <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 18. and through him
it is, that God worketh in us, what is well
pleasing in his sight: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. Through him
are all spiritual blessings bestowed upon us in
Heavenly things. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. He intercedeth for
the Elect, that believe not. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 20. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Convert is the fruit of his travel. <hi>Esay</hi> 53.
11. Oh never was infant born into the
world with that difficulty, that Christ endured
for us. How emphatically he groaneth in his
travel! All the pains that he suffered on his
Cross, they were our birth-pains, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24.

for us. He is made Sanctification to us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 30. He sanctified himself (that is set apart him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as a Sacrifice) that we might be sanctified.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 19. We are sanctified through the
offering of his body once for all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
            <p>'Tis nothing then without his own bowels,
but the merit and intercession of Christ, that
prevails with God to bestow upon us conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

grace. If thou art a new creature, thou
knowest to whom thou owest it, to Christ's
pangs and prayers. Hence the natural affection
of a believer to Christ. The foal doth not
more naturally run after the dam, nor the suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

And whither else shouldst thou go? If any in

            <p>Thou beginnest at the wrong end, if thou
disputest first about thine Election. Prove thy
conversion, and then never doubt of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
Or canst thou not yet prove it? Set
upon a present and thorow turning. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Gods purposes be (which are secret) I am
sure his promises are plain. How desperately
do rebels argue! If I am elected, I shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
do what I will: if not, I shall be damned,
do what I can. Perverse sinner, wilt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
where thou shouldest end? Is not the word
before thee? what saith it? <hi>Repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
that your sins may be blotted out. Acts. 3.
19. If you mortifie the deeds of the body, you shall
live. Rom. 8. 13. Believe and be saved. Acts</hi> 16.
31. What can be plainer? Do not stand still,
disputing about thine election, but set to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
and believing. Cry to God for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Grace. Revealed things belong to
thee; in these busie thy self. 'Tis just (as one
well,) that they that will not feed on the plain
food of the word, should be choaked with the
bones. Whatever Gods purposes be, I am sure
his promises be true. Whatever the decrees of
Heaven be, I am sure, that if I repent and believe,
I shall be saved; and that if I repent not, I
shall be damn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. Is not here plain ground for
thee: and wilt thou yet run upon the rocks?</p>
            <p>More particularly, this change of conversion
passes thorowout in the whole subject. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47965:37"/>
person may have some shreds of good
morality, a little near the list, but he is
never good throughout the whole cloth,
the whole body of Holiness and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
feel him a little further near the ridge,
and you shall see him to be but a deceitful piece.
Conversion is not a repairing of the old buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but it takes all down, and erects a new
structure: it is not the putting in a patch or sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a list of holiness; but with the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
holiness is woven into all his powers,
principles, and practice. The sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is quite a new fabrick, from the foundation
to the top stone all fire-new. He is a new man,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. a new creature, All things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Conversion is a deep
work, a heart work; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. and 16. 14.
it turns all upside down, and makes a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
a new world. It goes <hi>thorowout</hi> with men,
<hi>thorowout</hi> the Mind, <hi>thorowout</hi> the Members,
<hi>thorowout</hi> the motions of the wole life.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Thorowout the Mind.</hi> It makes an universal
change within. First it turns the ballance of the
judgement, so that God and his glory do
weigh down all carnal and worldly interests.
<hi>Act. 20. 24. Phil. 1. 20. Psal.</hi> 73. 25. It opens
the eye of the mind, and makes the scales of its
native ignorance to fall off, and turns men from
darkness to light. <hi>Act. 26. 18. Eph. 5. 8. 1
Pet</hi> 2. 9. The man that before saw no danger
in his condition, now concludes himself lost,
and for ever undone, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. except renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the power of Grace. He that formerly
thought there was little hurt in sin, now comes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47965:38"/>
to see it to be the chief of evils; he sees the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness,
unrighteousness, the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the filthiness that is in sin, so that he is
affrighted with it, loaths it, dreads it, flies it,
and even abhors himself for it. <hi>Rom. 7. 15.
Iob 42. 6. Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. He that could see
little sin in himself, and could find no matter
for confession (as it was said of that learned Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> (who it seems while he
knew so much abroad, was a miserable stranger
to himself,) that when he was to be confessed by
the Priest, could not remember any thing to
confess, but was fain to run back to the sins of
his youth) I say he that could not find matter
for confession, unless it were some few gross
and staring evils, now sin reviveth with him,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. he sees the rottenness of his heart,
and desperate and deep pollution of his whole
nature: he cries, unclean, unclean, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.
45. Lord purge me with Hyssop, wash me
throughly, create in me a clean heart. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.
2, 7, 10. He sees himself altogether become
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lthy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3. corrupt both root and tree.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 17, 18. he writes <hi>unclean</hi> upon all his
parts, and powers, and performances, <hi>Esay 63.
6. Rom.</hi> 7. 18. He discovers the nasty corners
that he was never aware of, and sees the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
and theft, and murther, and adultery
that is in his heart, which before he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of.
Heretofore he saw no form nor come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in Christ, no beauty that he should desire
him; but now he finds the hid treasure, and will
sell all to buy this field. Christ is the pearl he
seeks, sin the puddle he loaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47965:38"/>Now according to this new light, the man
is of another mind, another judgment, than
before he was. Now God is all with him: he
hath none in heaven nor earth like him. <hi>Psal.</hi>
73. 25. He prefers him truly before all the
world: his favour is his life: the light of his
countenance is more than Corn and Wine and
Oyl, (the good that he formerly enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and set his heart upon. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.) Now
let all the world be set on one side, and God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
on the other; let the Harlot put on her
paint, and gallantry, and present her self to the
soul (as when Satan would have tempted our
Saviour with her) in all the glory of her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
yet the Soul will not fall down and
worship her; but will prefer a naked, yea a
crucified, persecuted Christ before her. <hi>Phil. 3.
8. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 2. Not but that a Hypocrite may
come to yield a general assent to this, that God
is the chief good: yea the wiser Heathens (some
few of them) have at last stumbled upon this:
but there is a difference between the absolute,
and comparative judgment of the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
No Hypocrite comes so far, as to look
upon God, as the most desirable and suitable
good to him, and thereupon to acquiesce in
him. This is the converts voice; <hi>The Lord is
my portion, saith my soul. Whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
but thee? and there is none upon earth, that I
desire besides thee. God is the strength of my heart
and my portion for ever. Psal. 73. 25, 26. Lam.</hi>
3. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, It turns the Byas of the Will, both as
to means and end. (1.) The intention of the will
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47965:39"/>
is altered; Ezek. 36. 26. Ier. 31. 33. Esay</hi> 26.
8, 9. Now the man hath new ends and designs.
Now he intends God above all, and desires and
designs nothing in all the world so much, as
that Christ may be magnified in him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.
20. He accounts himself more happy in this,
than in all that the earth could yield, that he
may be serviceable to Christ, and bring him
glory in his generation. This is the mark he
aims at, that the name of Jesus may be great in
the world, and that all the sheaves of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
may bow to this sheaf.</p>
            <p>Reader, dost thou view this and never ask
thy self, whether it be thus with thee? Pause a
while, and breath upon this great concernment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The election also is changed,</hi> so that he
chooses another way. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 30. He pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
upon God as his blessedness, and upon Christ
as the principal, and holiness as the subordinate
means, to bring him to God. <hi>Iohn 14. 6. Rom.</hi>
2. 7. He chooses Jesus for his Lord. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. He
is not meerly forced into Christ by the storm,
nor doth he take Christ for bare necessity, as the
man begged from the Gallows, when he takes
the wife, rather than the halter: but he comes off
freely in the choice, This match is not made
in a fright, as with the terrified conscience, or
dying sinner, that will seemingly do any thing
for Christ, but doth only take Christ, rather than
hell: but he deliberately resolves, that Christ is
his best choice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. and would rather
have him to choose, than all the good of this
world, might he enjoy it while he would. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
he takes holiness for his path. He doth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47965:39"/>
not out of meer necessity submit to it: but he
likes and loves it. <hi>I have chosen the way of thy
Precepts. Psal.</hi> 119. 173. He takes Gods testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
not as his bondage, but his heritage,
yea his heritage for ever: <hi>v.</hi> 111. he counts
them not his burden, but his bliss; not his cords,
but his cordials. 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 3. Psal.</hi> 119. 14, 16,
47. He doth not only bear, but take up Christs
yoke. He takes not holiness, as the stomach
doth the loathed potion, (which it will down
with rather than dye) but as the hungry
doth his beloved food. No time passes so
sweetly with him (when he is himself) as that
he spends in the exercises of holiness; these
are both his aliment, and his element, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of his eyes, and the joy of his heart. <hi>Iob
23. 12. Psal. 119. 82, 131, 162, 174. Psal.</hi>
63. 5.</p>
            <p>Put thy conscience to it as thou goest, whether
thou art the man. O happy man, if this be
thy case! But see thou be thorow and impartial
in the search.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, it turns the Bent of the affections. 2 Cor.</hi>
7. 11. These run all in a new channel. The <hi>Iordan</hi>
is now driven back, and the water runs upward
against its natural course.</p>
            <p>Christ is his <hi>Hope. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 1. this is his prize:
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. here his eye is, here his heart is. He is
contented to cast all over board (as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in the storm, ready to perish) so he may
but keep this Jewel.</p>
            <p>The thirst of his <hi>Desires</hi> is, not after gold, but
grace: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. He hungers after it, he seeks
it as silver, he digs for it as for hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47965:40"/>
he had rather be gracious, than be great:
he had rather be the holiest man on earth, than
the most learned, the most famous, most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous.
While carnal, he said: Oh! if I
were but in great esteem, and rolled in wealth,
and swim'd in pleasure, if my debts were paid,
and I and mine provided for, then I were a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man: but now the tune is changed. O,
saith the Convert, if I had but my corruptions
subdued; if I had such measures of grace, such
fellowship with God, though I were poor and
despised, I should not care, I should account
my self a blessed man. Reader, is this the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of thy soul?</p>
            <p>His <hi>Ioys</hi> are changed. He rejoyceth in the
way of Gods testimonies, as much as in all
riches: <hi>Psal</hi> 119. 14. He delights in the law
of the Lord, wherein once he had little savour.
He hath no such joy, as in the thoughts of
Christ, the fruition of his company, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of his people.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Cares</hi> are quite altered. He was once set for
the world, and any scraps of by-time, nothing
(too often) was enough for his soul. Now he
gives over caring for the asses, and sets his heart
on the Kingdom. Now all the cry is, <hi>What
shall I do to be saved? Act.</hi> 16. 30. His great
sollicitude is, how to secure his soul. Oh! how
he would bless you, if you could but put him out
of doubt of this!</p>
            <p>His <hi>Fears</hi> are not so much of suffering; but of
sinning. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 27. Once he was afraid
of nothing so much as the loss of his estate,
or efteem, the dipleasure of friends, the frowns
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47965:40"/>
of the great: Nothing sounded so terrible to
him, as pain, or poverty, or disgrace. Now
these are little to him, in comparison of Gods
dishonour, or displeasure. How warily doth
he walk, left he should tread on a snare? He
feareth alway: he looks before, and behind;
he hath his eye upon his heart, and is often
casting over his shoulder, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t he should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
with sin: <hi>Psal. 39. 1. Prov. 28. 14.
Eccles.</hi> 2. 14. It kills his heart to think of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Gods favour; this he dreads as his only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.
<hi>Psal. 51. 11, 12. Psal.</hi> 119. 8. No
thought in the world doth pinch him and pain
him so much, as to think of parting with
Christ.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Love</hi> runs a new course. My Love was
crucified (said holy <hi>Ignatius</hi>) that is, my
Christ. This is my beloved, saith the spouse.
<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16. How doth <hi>Augustine</hi> often pour his
loves upon Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He can find no words sweet enough.</hi> Let me see
thee, O Light of mine eyes. Come, O thou joy of
my spirit; let me behold thee, O the gladness of
my heart. Let me love thee, O life of my soul.
Appear unto me, O my great delight, my sweet
comfort, O my God, my life, and the whole glory
of my soul. Let me find thee, O desire of my
heart: let me hold thee, O love of my soul. Let
me embrace thee, O Heavenly Bridegroom. Let
me possess thee, O esternal blessedness, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His <hi>sorrows</hi> have now a new vent. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 9, 10. The view of his sins, the sight of a
Christ crucified, that would scarce stir him
before, now how much do they affect his heart?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47965:41"/>His <hi>Hatred</hi> boils, his Anger burns against sin.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 104. He hath no patience with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
he calls himself fool, and beast, and thinks
any name too good for himself, when his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
is stirred against sin. <hi>Psal. 73. 22.
Prov.</hi> 30. 2. He could once swill in it, with too
much pleasure; now he loaths the thought of
returning to it, as much as of licking up the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
vomit.</p>
            <p>Commune then with thine own heart, and
attend the common and general current of
thine affections, whether it be towards God in
Christ, above all other concernments. Indeed,
sudden and strong commotions of the affections
and sensitive part, are oft times found in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
especially where the natural constitution
leads thereunto: and contrariwise, the sanctified
themselves are many times without sensible
stirrings of the affections, where the temper is
more slow, dry, and dull. The great enquiry
is, whether the judgment and will be stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
determined for god, above all other
good, real, or apparent: and if the affections
do sincerely follow their choice, and conduct,
though it be not so strongly and sensibly, as is
to be desired, there is no doubt, but the change
is saving.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thorowout the Members.</hi> These that were
before the instruments of sin, are now become
the holy utensils of Christs living Temple. <hi>Rom.
6. 19. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 16. He that before made, as it
were, a baud, or a barrel of his body, now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
his vessel in sanctification, and honour, in
temperance, chastity, and sobriety, as dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47965:41"/>
to the Lord. <hi>Thes. 4. 4. Gal. 5. 22, 23. 1 Cor.</hi>
6. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>The <hi>eye</hi> that was once a wandring eye, a
wanton eye, a haughty, or a covetous eye, is
now employed, as <hi>Mary,</hi> in weeping over her
sins <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 38. In beholding God in his works,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 3. in reading his word, <hi>Act</hi> 8. 30. in
looking up and down for objects of mercy, and
opportunities for his service.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ear</hi> that was once open to satans call,
and that (like a vitiated palate.) did relish no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much as filthy, or at least forthy talk,
and the fools laughter, is now bored to the
door of Christ house, and open to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
It saith, <hi>speak Lord for thy servant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi>
It cries with him, <hi>veniat verbum Domini,</hi>
and waits for his words as the rain, and relishes
them more than the appointed food, <hi>Iob.</hi> 23. 12.
than the very honey and honey-comb. <hi>Psal.</hi>
19. 10.</p>
            <p>The <hi>head,</hi> that was the shop of worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
is now filled with other matters, and set
on the study of Gods will, <hi>Psal. 1. 2. Psal.</hi> 119.
97. and the man beats his head, not so much
abouts his gain, but about his duty. The
<hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>cares</hi> that now fill his head are
principally, how he may please God, and flie
sin.</p>
            <p>His <hi>heart,</hi> that was sty of filthy, lusts, is now
become an Altar of incense, where the fire of
divine love is ever kept in, and whence the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sacrifice of prayer and praises, and sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
of holy desires, ejaculations, and anhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are continually ascending. <hi>Psal. 108. 1.

Psal. 119. 20. Psal.</hi> 139. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>The <hi>mouth</hi> is become a well of life, his <hi>tongue</hi>
as choice silver, and his <hi>lips</hi> feed many: Now
the salt of grace hath seasoned his speech, and
eat out the corruption, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. and cleansed
the man from his filthy communications, flattery,
boasting, railing, lying, swearing, backbiting, that
once came like the flashes proceeding from
the hell that was in the heart. <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 6, 7.
The <hi>throat,</hi> that was once an open sepulchre,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13. now sends forth the sweet breath
of prayer, and holy discourse, and the man
speaks in another tongue, in the language of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and is never so well, as when talking
of God, and Christ, and the matters of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world. His <hi>mouth</hi> bringeth forth wisdom,
his <hi>tongue</hi> is become the silver Trumpet of his

that he hath.</p>

He speaks it may be like an Angel, but
he hath a covetous eye, or the gain of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
in his hand. Or the hand is
white, but his heart is full of rottennes, <hi>Mat.</hi>
13. 27. full of unmortified cares, a very oven
of lust, the shop of pride, the seat of malice.
It may be with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s image, he
hath a golden head, a great deal of knowledge:
but he hath feet of clay, his affections are
worldly, he minds earthly things, and his way
and walk are sensual, and carnal: you may
trace him in his secret haunts, and his footsteps
will be found in some by-paths of sin. The
work is not thorowout with him.</p>
            <p n="3">

<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 3. His Conversation is in Heaven.
<hi>Phi.</hi> 3. 20. No sooner doth Christ call by effectual
grace, but he straight way becomes a follower
of him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 20. When God hath given
the new heart and writ his law in his mind, he
forth with walks in his statutes and keeps his
judgments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Though sin may dwell (God knows a
wearisome and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unwelcome guest) in him,
yet it hath no more dominion over him. <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 14, 7. He hath his fruit unto holiness; <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 22. and though he makes many a blot, yet
the law and life of Jesus is that he eyes, as his
copy, <hi>Psal. 119. 30. Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigned
respect to all Gods commandments. <hi>Psa.</hi>
119. 6. He makes conscience even of little sins &amp;
little duties. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 113. His very infirmities
which he cannot help, though he would, are his
souls burden, and are like the dusts in a mans
eye, which though but little, yet are not a
little troublesome. [O man, dost thou read
this, and never turn in upon thy soul, by self-examination?]
The sincere Convert is not one
man at Church and another at home: he is not
a Saint on his knees, and a cheat in his shop: he
will not tithe Mint and Cummin, and neglect
mercy and judgment, and the weighty matters
of the Law: he doth not pretend piety and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
morality, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14. but he turns from
All his sins and keeps All Gods Statutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18. 21. though not perfectly (except in desire
and endeavour) yet sincerely, not allowing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47965:43"/>
himself in the breach of any. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. Now
he delights in the word, and sets himself to
prayer, and opens his hand, (if table) and
draws out his soul to the hungry. <hi>Rom. 7.
22. Psal. 109. 4. Esay</hi> 58. 10. He breaks off
his sins by righteousness, and his iniquities by
shewing mercy to the poor; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. and
hath a good conscience willing in All things to
live honestly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. and to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence towords God and men.</p>
            <p>Here again you shall find the unsoundness of

2. 9. and take up with the cheap and easie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of religion; but they go not thorow with
the work. They are as a cake not turned,
half roasted, and half raw. It may be you shall
have them exact in their words, punctual in
their dealings, but then they do not exercise
themselves unto godliness; and for examining
themselves, and governing their hearts, to this
they are strangers. You shall have them duly
at the Church, but follow them to their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and there you shall see little but the world
minded: or if they have a road of family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
follow them to their closets, and there
you shall find their souls are little looked after.
It may be they seem otherwise religious, but
bridle not their tongues, and so all their religion
is in vain: <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 26. It may be they come up
to closet and family prayer; but follow them
to their shops, and there you shall find them in
a trade of lying, or some covert and cleanly
way of deceit. Thus the hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47965:43"/>
thorowout in the course of his obedience.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the subject of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The terms are either from which, or to
which.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The terms from which we turn in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Conversion, <hi>are</hi> sin, Satan, <hi>the</hi> world, <hi>and</hi>
our own righteousness.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Sin.</hi> When a man is converted, he is
for ever out with sin: yea with All sin, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 128. but most of all with his own sins,
and especially with his bosom sin: <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23.
Sin is now the But of his indignation; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 11. he thirsts to bath his hands in the blood
of his sins. His sins set abroach his sorrows.
It is sin that pierces his and wounds him: he
feels it like a thorn in his side; like a prick in
his eyes: he groans and struggles under it,
and not formally, but feelingly cries out, <hi>O
wretched man!</hi> He is not impatient of any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
so much as of his sin. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12. If
God should give his choice, he would
choose any affliction, so he might be rid of sin.
He feels it like the cutting gravel in his
shooes, pricking, and paining him as he
goes.</p>
            <p>Before Conversion he had light thoughts of
sin: He cherished it in his bosom, as <hi>Uriah</hi> his
lamb: he nourished it up, and it grew up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with him; it did eat as it were of his
own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay
in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter:
but when God opens his eyes by Conversion,
he throws it away with abhorrence; <hi>Esay</hi> 30.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47965:44"/>
22. as a man would a loathsome toad, which
in the dark he had hugged fast in his bosom,
and thought it had been some pretty and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
bird. When a man is savingly changed,
he is not only deeply convinced of the danger,
but defilement of sin: and O how earnest is
he with God to be purified? He loaths himself
for his sins. <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. 31. He runs to Christ,
and casts himself into the fountain opened for
sin and for uncleanness. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. If he fall,
what a stir is there to get all clean again? He
flies to the word, and washes, and rubs, and
wrinses, labouring to cleanse himself from all
filthiness both of flesh and spirit: he abhorrs
his once beloved sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. as a cleanly
nature doth the trow, and mire, wherein he
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es the swine delight.</p>
            <p>The sound Convert is heartily engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin. He wrestles with it, the wars against
it. He is too often foiled, but he never yields
the cause, nor lays down the weapons; but he
will up, and to it again, while he hath breath
in his body. He will never give quiet possession;
he will make no peace; he will give no quarter;
he falls upon it, and fires upon it, and is still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
of it with continual alarms. He can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
his other enemies; he can pity them, and
pray for them: <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 60. but here he is implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
here he is set upon revenge: he hunteth, as it
were, for the precious life; his eye shall not
pity, his hand shall not spare, though it be a
right hand, or a right eye: Be it a gainful sin,
most delightful to his nature, a support to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m
with carnal friends; yet he will rather
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47965:44"/>
throw his gain down the kennel, see his credit
fall, or the flower of pleasure wither in his
hand, than he will allow himself in any known
way of sin. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8. He will grant no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
he will give no toleration; but he
draws upon sin where ever he meets it, and
frowns upon it with this unwelcome salute,
<hi>Have I found thee, O mine enemy!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, hath conscience been at work, while
thou hast been looking over these lines? Hast
thou pondered these things in thine heart?
Hast thou searched the book within, to see if
these things be so? If not, read it again, and
make thy conscience to speak whether or no it
be thus with thee.</p>
            <p>Hast thou crucified thy flesh with its affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and lusts, and not only confessed, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
thy sins, all sin in thy servent desires, and
the ordinary practice of every deliberate and
willful sin in thy life? If not, thou are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.
Doth not conscience fly in thy
face, as thou readest, and tell thee that thou
livest in a way of lying for thy advantage, that
thou usest deceit in thy calling, that there is
some way of secret wantonness that thou livest
in? Why then, do not deceive thy self, thou
art in the gall of bitterness, and bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>Doth not thine unbridled tongue, thy brutish
intemperance, thy wicked company, thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of prayer, of hearing and reading the
word now witness against thee, and say, <hi>We
are thy works, and we will follow thee?</hi> Or if I
have not hit the right, doth not the bird with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47965:45"/>
tell thee, there is such or such a way, that
thou knowest to be evil, that yet for some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
respect thou dost tolerate thy self in, and
art willing to spare? If this be the case, thou
art to this day unregenerate, and must be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
or condemned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Satan.</hi> Conversion binds the strong
man, spoils his armour, casts out his goods,
and turns men from the power of Satan unto
God. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. Before, the Devil could no
sooner hold up his finger to the sinner, to call
him to his wicked company, sinful games, filthy
delights, but presently he follows, like an Ox
to the slaughter, and a fool to the correction of
the stocks, as the bird that hasteth to the prey,
and knoweth not that it is for his life. No
sooner could Satan bid him lie, but presently he
had it upon the top of his tongue: <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. no
sooner could Satan offer a wanton object, but
he was stung with lust. The Devil could do
more with him than God could. If the Devil
say, away with these family duties, be sure they
shall be rarely enough performed in his house.
If the Devil say, away with this strictness,
this preciseness, he will keep far enough from
it. It he tells him, there's no need of these clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
duties, he shall go from day to day and
scarce perform them. But now he is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he serves another master, and takes quite
another course: 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 4. 4. he goes and comes
at Christs beck. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. Satan may some
times catch his foot in his trap; but he will no
longer be a willing captive. He watches against
the snares and baits of Satan, and studies to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47965:45"/>
be acquainted with his devices. He is very
suspicious of his plots, and is very jealous, in
what comes athwart him, left Satan should
have some design upon him. He wrestles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
principalities and powers. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. He
entertains the messenger of Satan as men do
the messenger of death. He keeps his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his enemy, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and watches in his
duties, left Satan should put in his foot.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>World.</hi> Before sound faith, a
man is overcome of the world. Either he
bows down to <hi>Mammon,</hi> or idolizes his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or is a lover of pleasure, more than a
lover of God. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. Here's the root of
mans misery by the fall; he is turned aside to
the creature, instead of God, and gives that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
confidence, affection to the creature,
that is due to him alone. <hi>Rom. 1. 25. Mat. 10. 37.
Prov. 18. 11. Ier.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
            <p>O miserable man! What a deformed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hath sin made thee. God made thee little
lower than the Angels, sin little better than the
devils: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 70. and 8. 44. a monster, that
hath his head and heart, where his feet should
be; and his feet kicking against Heaven, and
every thing out of place. The world, that was
formed to serve thee, is come to rule thee; and
the deceitful harlot hath bewitched thee with
her inchantments, and made thee bow down
and server her.</p>
            <p>But converting grace sets all in order again,
and puts God in the Throne, and the world at
his footstool; <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. Christ in the heart,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47965:46"/>
and the world under feet: <hi>Eph. 3. 17. Rev.</hi> 12. 1.
So <hi>Paul, I am crucified to the world, and the world
to me. Gal.</hi> 6. 14. Before this change all the cry
was, <hi>who will shew us any (worldly) good:</hi> but
now he sings quite another tune, <hi>Lord lift up
the light of thy countenance upon me,</hi> and take
the corn and wine whoso will: <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.
Before, his hearts delight and content was in
the world: then the song was, <hi>Soul take thine
ease, eat, drink, and be merry, thou hast much goods
laid up for many years:</hi> but now all this is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
and there is no comliness that he should
desire it, and he tunes up with the sweet Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
of <hi>Israel, The Lord is the portion of mine
inheritance; the lines are fallen to me in a fair
place, and I have a goodly heritage.</hi> He blesses
himself, and boasts himself in God: <hi>Psal. 34.
2. Lam.</hi> 3. 24. nothing else can give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
He hath written vanity and vexation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all his worldly enjoyments, <hi>Ec.</hi> 1. 2. and loss
and dung upon all humane excellencies. <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 7, 8. He hath life and immortality now in
chase; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. he trades for grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and hath the Crown incorruptible in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25. His heart is set in him to
seek the Lord: 1 <hi>Chron</hi> 22. 19. and 2. <hi>Chron,</hi>
15. 15. he first seeks the kingdom of Heaven
and the righteousness thereof, and religion is
no longer a matter by the by with him, but
the main of his care, <hi>Matth. 6. 33. Psal.</hi> 27. 4.
Now the gawdy idol is become <hi>Nehushtan.
2 Kings</hi> 18. 4. and he ups and treads upon it, as
<hi>Diogenes</hi> trampling on <hi>Plato</hi>'s hangings and
saying, <hi>Caleo Platonis fastum.</hi> Before, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47965:46"/>
world had the swaying interest with him: he
would do more for gain than, godliness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
6. 5. more to pleasure his friend, or his flesh,
than to please the God that made him, and
God must stand by till the world were first
served; but now all must stand by: he hates
father and mother and life and all in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
            <p>Well then, pause a little, and look within.
Doth not this nearly concern thee? Thou
pretendest for Christ; but doth not the world
sway thee? Dost thou not take more real delight
and content in the world, than in him? Dost
not thou find thy self better at ease when the
world goes to thy mind, and thou art encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with carnal delights, than when retired
to prayer and meditation in thy closet, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
upon Gods word and worship? No
surer evidence of an unconverted state, than to
have the things of the world uppermost in our
aims, love, and estimations, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 15. Iames</hi>
4. 4.</p>
            <p>With the sound Convert Christ hath the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.
How dear is this name to him?
How precious is its favour? <hi>Cant. 1. 3. Psal.</hi>
45. 8. The name of Jesus is engraven upon his
heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. and lies as a bundle of myrrh
between his breasts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13, 14. Honour is but
air, and laughter is but madness, and <hi>Mammon</hi> is
fallen like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the ark, with hands and
head broken off on the threshold, when once
Christ is savingly revealed. Here is the pearl
of great price to the true Convert; here is his
treasure, here is his hope. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44, 45.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47965:47"/>
This is his glory: My beloved is mine, and I
am his. <hi>Gal. 6. 14. Cant.</hi> 2. 16. Oh 'tis sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to him, to be able to say, Christ is mine,
than if he could say, the Kingdom is mine,
the <hi>Indies</hi> are mine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>our own righteousness.</hi> Before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
man seeks to cover himself with his
own fig-leaves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7. and to lick himself
whole with his own duties. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6, 7. He is
apt to trust in himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. and 18. 9.
and set up his own righteousness, and to reckon
his counters for Gold, and not submit to the
righteousness of God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
changes his mind; now he casts away
his filthy rags, and counts his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but a menstruous cloth: he casts it off, as a
man would the verminous tatters of a nasty
beggar: <hi>Esay</hi> 64. 6. Now he is brought to
poverty of spirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3. complains of and
condemns himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and all his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is, <hi>poor, and miserable, and wretched, and
blind, and naked. Rev.</hi> 3. 17. He sees a world of
iniquity in his holy things, &amp; calls his once ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
righteousness, but flesh, and loss, and dogs
meat, and would not for a thousand worlds be
found in himself; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 7, 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 9. His finger is
ever upon his sores, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3. his sins, his
wants. Now he begins to set a high price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christs righteousness: he sees the need of a
Christ in every duty, to justifie his person, and
justifie his performances; he cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, he cannot pray without him; Christ
must go with him, or else he cannot come into
the presence of God; he leans upon the hand
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47965:47"/>
of Christ and so he bows himself in the house of
his God. He sets himself down for a lost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
man without him. His life is hid in Christ,
as the life of man in the heart. He is fixed in
Christ, as the roots of the tree spread in the
earth for stability and nutriment. Before, the
news of a Christ was a stale and sapless thing:
but now, how sweet is a Christ? <hi>Augustine</hi> could
not relish his before so much admired <hi>Cicero,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he could not find the name of Christ.
How pathetically cries he? <hi>Dulcissime, amantis.
benignis. claris. &amp;c. quando te videbo? quando
satiabor de pulchritudine tuâ? Medit. c. 37. O
most sweet, most loving, most kind, most dear, most
precious, most desired, most lovely, most fair, &amp;c.</hi>
all in a breath, when he speaks of and to his
Christ. In a word, the voice of the Convert
is, with the Martyr, <hi>None but Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The terms to which <hi>are either</hi> Vltimate, <hi>or</hi>
Subordinate <hi>and</hi> mediate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vltimate</hi> is God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, whom the true Convert takes, as
his All-sufficient and eternal blessedness. A man
is never truly sanctified, till his very heart be
in truth set upon God, above all things, as his
portion and chief good. These are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
breathings of a believers heart, <hi>Thou art my
portion O Lord: Psal. 119. 57. My soul shall
make her boast in the Lord: Psal. 34. 2. My ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
is from him: he only is my rock, and my
salvation, he is my defence: in God is my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and my glory, the rock of my strength, and
my refuge is in God. Psal. 62. 1, 2, 5, 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be converted or not, now then let thy soul and

Come then, and with <hi>Abraham</hi> lift up thine

having a name like the name of the great men
of the earth? Would any of this, all this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
thee, and make thee count thy self a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man? If so, then certainly thou art carnal
and unconverted. If not, go further; wade
into the divine excellencies, the store of his
mercies, the hiding of his power, the deeps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable
of his All-sufficiency. Doth this
suit thee best, and please thee most? Dost thou
say, <hi>'Tis good to be here? Matth. 17. 4. Here I
will pitch; here I will live and die?</hi> Wilt thou let
all the world go, rather than this? Then 'tis
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47965:48"/>
well between God and thee: Happy art thou, O

If a God can make thee happy, thou must needs

is the turning point. An unsound professour
never takes up his rest in God; but converting
grace does the work, and so cures the fatal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of the fall, by turning the heart from its
idols, to the living God. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. Now

            <p>Thus the poor soul doth venture upon Christ,
and resolvedly adhere to him. Before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the man made light of Christ, minded the

               </gap>arm, friends, merchandise, more than Christ:
<hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 5. now Christ is to him as his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
food, his daily bread, the life of his heart,
the staff of his life. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. His great design
is, that Christ may be magnified in him. <hi>Phil.</hi>
1. 20. His heart once said, as they to the
spouse, <hi>What is thy beloved, more than another?
Cant.</hi> 5. 9. He found more sweetness in his
merry company, wicked games, earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47965:49"/>
than in Christ. He took religion for a
fancy, and the talk of great enjoyments, for an
idle dream. But now, to him to live is Christ.
He sets light by all that he accounted precious,
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>All of Christ is accepted by the sincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.
He loves not only the wages, but work
of Christ: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. not only the benefits,
but the burden of Christ. He is willing not
only to tread out the corn, but to draw
under the yoke: he takes up the commands of
Christ, yea and the Cross of Christ. <hi>Mat. 11.

            <p>The unsound closes by the halves with
Christ: he is all for the salvation of Christ, but
he is not for sanctification: he is for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
but appretiates not the person of
Christ. He divides the offices, and benefits of
Christ. This is an error in the foundation.
Whoso loveth life, let him beware here. 'Tis
an undoing mistake, of which you have been
often warned, and yet none more common.
Jesus is a sweet name, but men love not the
Lord Jesus in sincerity. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 24. They will
not have him, as God offers, <hi>To be a Prince and a
Saviour. Act.</hi> 5. 31. They divide what God
hath joined, the King, and the Priest. Yea
they will not accept the salvation of Christ, as
he intends it; they divide here. Every mans
vote is for salvation from suffering; but they
desire not to be saved from sinning. They
would have their lives saved; but withall they
would have their lusts saved. Yea many divide
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47965:50"/>
here again; they would be content to have
some of their sins destroyed; but they cannot
leave the lap of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> or divorce the beloved
<hi>Herodias.</hi> They cannot be cruel to the right
eye, or right hand: the Lord must pardon
them in this thing. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 18. Oh be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely

The sound Convert takes a whole Christ, and
takes him for all intents and purposes, without
exceptions, without limitations, without
reserves. He is willing to have Christ, upon
his terms, upon any terms. He is willing of
the dominion of Christ, as well as deliverance
by Christ, he saith with <hi>Paul, Lord what wilt
thou have me to do? Act.</hi> 9. 6. Any thing Lord:
He sends the blank for Christ to set down his
own conditions. <hi>Act. 2. 37. Act.</hi> 16. 30.</p>
            <p>The <hi>less Principal</hi> is the <hi>Laws, Ordinances,</hi>
and <hi>ways of Christ.</hi> The heart that was once
set against these, and could not endure the
strictness of these bonds, the severity of these
wayes, now falls in love with them, and
chooses them as its rule and guide for ever. <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 111, 112.</p>
            <p>Four things (I observe) God doth work
in every sound Convert, with reference to the
Laws and ways of Christ, by which you may
come to know your estates, if you will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

more desirable than gold, fine gold, yea much
fine gold. <hi>Psal</hi> 19. 10. His judgment is settled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in the work. Alms-giving is not a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, but of vain-glory, unless dealt
forth by the hand of divine love. What is the
prayer of the lips, without grace in the heart,
but the carcase without the life? What are all
our confessions, unless they be the exercises of
godly sorrow and unfeigned repentance? What
our petitions, unless animated all along with
holy desires, and faith in the divine attributes
and promises? What our praises and thanks-giving,
unless from the love of God, and a
holy gratitude, and sense of Gods mercies in
the heart? So that a man may as well expect
the trees should speak, or look for Logick from
the bruits, or motion from the dead, as for any
service holy and acceptable to God, from the
unconverted. When the tree is evil, how can
the fruit be good? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>to bad purpose.</hi> The unconverted
soul is a very cage of unclean birds, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 2.
a sepulchre full of corruption and rottenness,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 27. a loathsome carcase full of crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47965:55"/>
worms, and sending forth a hellish and
most noisome favour in the nostrils of God.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3. O dreadful case! Dost thou not
yet see a change to be needful? Would it not
have grieved one, to have seen the golden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
vessels of Gods temple turned into
quaffing bowls for drunkenness, and polluted
with the idols service? <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Was it
such an abomination to the Jews, when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
set up the picture of a swine at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Temple? How much more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
them would it have been, to have had
the very Temple it self turned into a stable, or
a sty, and to have the holy of holies served
like the house of <hi>Baal,</hi> to have the image
of God taken down, and be turned into a
draught-house? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 27. This is the
very case of the unregenerate: all thy members
are turned into instruments of unrighteousness,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. servants of Satan; and thy inmost
powers, into the receptacles of all uncleanness.
<hi>Eph. 2. 2. Tit.</hi> 2. 15. You may see the goodly
guests within, by what comes out. <hi>For out of
the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false, witness, blasphemies,
&amp;c.</hi> This black guard discovers what a hell
there is within.</p>
            <p>Oh abuse unsufferable! to see a heaven-born
soul abased to the filthiest drudgery: to
see the glory of Gods creation, the chief of
the wayes of God, the Lord of the universe,
lapping with the prodigal at the trow, or licking
up with greediness the most loathsome vomit.
Was it such a lamentation to see those that did
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47965:56"/>
feed delicately, sit desolate in the streets? and
the precious sons of Sion comparable to fine
gold, to be esteemed as earthen pitchers? and
those that were clothed in scarlet to embrace
dunghils? <hi>Lim.</hi> 4. 2, 5. And is it not fearful
much more, to see the only thing that hath
immortality in this lower world, and carried the
stamp of God, to become as a vessel wherein
there is no pleasure? (which is but the modest
expression of the vessel, men put to the most sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
use.) Oh indignity intolerable! Better
thou wert dashed on a thousand pieces, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to be abused to so filthy a service.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Not only man, but the whole visible creation is
in vain, without this.</hi> Beloved, God hath made
all the visible creatures in Heaven and earth for
the service of man, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 28. and man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is the spokesman for all the rest. Man is in the
universe, like the tongue in the body, (which
speaks for all the members.) The other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
cannot praise their maker, but by dumb
signs and hints to man, that he should speak for
them. Man is, as it were, the High-Priest of
Gods creation, to offer the Sacrifice of praise,
for all his fellow creatures. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147, and 148,
and 150. The Lord God expecteth a tribute
of praise from all his works; <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 22.
now all the rest do bring in their tribute to man,
and pay it in by his hand. So then, if man be
false, and faithless, and selfish, God is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all, and shall have no active glory from his
works.</p>
            <p>Oh dreadful thought to think of! That God
should build such a world as this, and lay out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47965:56"/>
such infinite power, and wisdom, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereupon, and all in vain; and man
should be guilty at last, of robbing, and spoiling
him, of the glory of all. Oh think of this<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
while thou art unconverted, all the offices of
the creatures to thee are in vain: thy meat
nourishes thee in vain, the Sun holds forth his
light to thee in vain, the stars, that serve thee
in their courses by their most powerful, though
hidden influences, <hi>Iudges 5. 20. Hos.</hi> 2. 21, 22.
do it in vain; thy cloths warm thee in vain;
thy beast carries thee in vain: in a word, the
labour unwearied, and continual travel of the
whole creation (as to thee) is in vain. The
service of all the creatures, that drudge for
thee, and yield forth their strength unto thee
(that therewith thou shouldst serve their
maker) is all but lost labour. Hence the
whole creation groaneth under the abuse of the
unsanctified world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. that pervert
them to the service of their lusts, quite contrary
to the very end of their being.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Without this thy Religion is in vain. Iames</hi>

            <p>O soul, do not think when thy sins pursue
thee, a little praying and reforming thy course
will pacify God: thou must begin with thine
heart: if that be not renewed, thou canst no

            <p>It is a great misery to labour in the fire. The
Poets could not invent a worser hell for <hi>Sysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
than to be getting the barrel still up the

lose our pains in religion, to pray, and hear,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47965:57"/>
and fast in vain? This is an undoing and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

thy sinful estate, though thou shouldst spread

though thou make many prayers, he will not

the bones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 8. it pierceth, it wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

A man may as well expect ease, when his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
are in their strength, or his bones out of
joint, as true comfort, while in his sins.</p>
            <p>O wretched man, that canst have no ease in
this case, but what comes from the deadliness
of thy disease! You shall have the poor sick man,
saying in his lightness, he is well; when you
see death in his face. He will needs up and about
his business, when the very next step is like to be
into the grave. The unsanctified often feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiss, they think themselves whole, and
cry not out for the Physician, but this shews
the danger of their case.</p>
            <p>Sin doth naturally breed distempers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
in the soul. What a continual tempest
and commotion is there, in a discontented
mind? What an eating evil is inordinate care?
What is passion, but a very feaver in the mind?
What is Lust, but a fire in the bones? What is
Pride but a deadly tympany? or covetousness,
but an unsatiable and unsufferable thirst? or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and envy, but venom in the very heart? Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
sloth is but a scurvy in the mind, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
security, a mortal lethargy. And how can
that soul have true comfort that is under so
many diseases? But converting grace cures, and
so eases the mind, and prepares the soul for a
setled, standing, immortal peace. <hi>Great peace
have they that love thy commandments, and nothing
shall offend them. Psal.</hi> 119. 165. They are the
wayes of wisdom that afford pleasure and peace.
<hi>Prov. 3. 17. David</hi> had infinitely more pleasure
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47965:58"/>
in the word, than in all the delights of his
Court, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 103, 127. The conscience
cannot be truly pacified, till soundly purified.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Cursed is that peace, that is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in a way of sin. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20. Two
sorts of peace are more to be dreaded, than all
the troubles in the world; Peace with sin, and
Peace in sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Thy hopes of Salvation hereafter
are in vain:</hi> yea worse than in vain; they are
most injurious to God, most pernicious to thy
self; there is death, desperation, blasphemy in
the bowels of this hope. 1. <hi>There is death in
it. Thy confidence shall be rooted out of thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi>
(God will up with it root and branch)
<hi>it shall bring thee to the King of terrors. Iob</hi> 18.
14. Though thou maist lean upon this house, it
will not stand, <hi>Iob.</hi> 8. 15. but will prove like
a ruinous building, which when a man trusts
to it, falls down about his ears. 2. <hi>There is
desperation in it. Where is the hope of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
when God taketh away his soul? Iob</hi> 27. 8.
Then there is an end, for ever, of his hope. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the hope of the righteous hath an
end, but then 'tis not a destructive, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
end; his hope ends in fruition, others
in frustration. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 28. The godly must say
at death, <hi>It is finished;</hi> but the wicked, <hi>It is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished;</hi>
and in too sad earnest bemoan himself,
(as he in a mistake) <hi>Where now is my hope?
He hath destroyed me, I am gone, and my hope is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
like a tree. Iob. 19. 10. The righteous hath
hope in his death. Prov.</hi> 14. 32. When nature is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47965:59"/>
dying, his hopes are living: when his body is
languishing, his hopes are flourishing, his hope
is a living hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
but others a dying, yea a damning, soul undoing
hope. <hi>When a wicked man dyeth, his expectation
shall perish; and the hope of unjust men perisheth.
Prov 11. 7. It shall be cut off,</hi> and prove <hi>like the
spiders web, Iob</hi> 8. 14. which he spins out of
his won bowels, but then comes death with
the broom, and takes down all, and so there is
an eternal end of his confidence, wherein he
trusted. <hi>For the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and
their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. Iob</hi>
11. 2. Wicked men are setled in their carnal
hope, and will not be beaten out of it. They hold
it fast, they will not let it go. Yea but death will
knock off their fingers. Though <hi>we</hi> cannot
undeceive them, death and judgment will.
When death strikes its dark through thy liver, it
will let out thy soul, and thy hopes together.
The unsanctified have hope only in this life,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. and therefore are of all men
most miserable. When death comes, it lets
them out into the amazing gulf of endless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration,
3. <hi>There is blasphemy in it.</hi> To
hope we shall be saved, though continuing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,
is to hope, we shall prove God a
liar. He hath told you, that so merciful and
pitiful as he is, he will never save you not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if you go on in ignorance, or a course
of unrighteousness: <hi>Esay 27. 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9.
in a word, he hath told you, that whatever
you be, or do, nothing shall avail you to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
without you be new creatures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47965:59"/>
15. Now to say, God is mercifu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and we
hope, he will save us nevertheless, is to say in
effect, we hope God will not do as he saith.
We may not set Gods attributes at variance.
God is resolved to glorifie mercy, but not with
the prejudice of truth, as the presumptuous
sinner will find to his everlasting sorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Why, but we hope in Jesus Christ,
we put out whole trust in God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doubt not, but we shall be saved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. 1. This is not to hope in Christ, but against
Christ.</hi> To hope to see the Kingdom of God,
without being born again, to hope to find eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life in the broad way, is to hope, Christ will
prove a false prophet. 'Tis <hi>David</hi>'s plea, <hi>I
hope in thy word: Psal.</hi> 119. 81. but this hope
is against the word. Shew me a word of Christ
for thy hope, that he will save thee in thine
ignorance, or prophane neglects of his service,
and I will never to to shake thy confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God doth with abhorrency reject this hope.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>If thy hope were any thing worth, it would

neither may you despair of attaining to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and conversion, in the use of Gods
means.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Without this all that Christ hath done and
suffered will be (as to you) in vain; Iohn 13. 8.
Tit.</hi> 2. 14. that is, it will no way avail to your
salvation. Many urge this, as sufficient ground
for their hopes, that Christ died for sinners: but I

parts of his trust, before he leaves the world.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 4, 6, 12. Now Christ should quite
cross his fathers glory, his greatest trust, if he
should save men in their sins; for this were to
overturn all his counsels, and offer violence to
all his attributes.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>To overturn all his counsels;</hi> of which
this is the order, that men should be brought,
through sanctification, to salvation. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.
13. he hath chosen them that they should be
holy. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. They are elected to pardon

thou canst repeal the Law of Gods immutable
counsel, or corrupt him, whom the Father
hath sealed, to go directly against his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
then, and not otherwise, maist thou
get to Heaven in this condition. To hope that
Christ will save thee while unconverted, is to
hope that Christ will falsify his trust. He never
did, nor will, save one soul, but whom
the Father had given him in election, and
drawn to him in effectual calling. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37, 44.
Be assured, Christ will save none, in a way
contrary to his Fathers will, who came on
purpose to do his will. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 38.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To offer violence to all his attributes.
1. To his Iustice.</hi> For the righteousness of
Gods judgment lies, in rendring to all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

were the glory of divine Justice, since it should
be given to the wicked, according to the work
of the righteous? 2. <hi>To his holiness.</hi> If God
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47965:61"/>
should not only save sinners, but save them in
their sins, his most pure and strict holiness
would be exceedingly defaced. The unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
is, in the eyes of Gods holiness, worse than
a swine, or viper. <hi>Mat. 23. 33. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 22.
Now what cleanly nature could endure, to
have the filthy swine bed and board with
him in his parlour, or bed chamber? It would
offer extremest violence to the infinite purity
of the divine nature, to have such to dwell
with him. They cannot stand in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they cannot abide in his presence. <hi>Psal.
1. 5. Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5. If holy <hi>David</hi> would not

<hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 3, 7. shall we think God will? Should
he take men as they be, from the trow to the
table, from the harlots lips, from the sty and

would think God were at no such distance
from sin, nor had such dislike of it, as we are

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould bring men to salvation without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47965:61"/>
O desperate sinner, that darest to
hope, that Christ will put the lie upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and nullify his word to save thee! 4. <hi>To
his wisdom.</hi> For this were to throw away the
choicest mercies, on them that would not value
them, nor were any way suited to them. <hi>First,</hi>
they would not value them. The unsanctified
sinner puts but little price upon Gods great
salvation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 5. He sets no more by
Christ, than the whole by the physician: <hi>Mat.</hi>
9. 12. he prizes not his balm, values not his
cure, tramples upon his blood. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.
Now, would it stand with wisdom, to force
pardon and life, upon them that would give
him no thanks for them? Will the all-wise God
(when he hath forbidden us to do it) throw
his holy things to dogs, and his pearl to swine,
that would (as it were) but turn again and
rent him? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 6. This would make mercy
to be despised indeed. Wisdom requires, that
life be given, in a way suitable to Gods honour;
and that God provide for the securing his own
glory, as well as mans felicity. It would be
dishonourable to God, to set his jewels in the
snouts of swine (continuing such) and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
his choicest riches on them, that have
more pleasure in their swill, than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
delights that he doth offer. God should
lose the praise and glory of his grace, if he
should cast it away on them, that were not only
unworthy, but unwilling. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are
no way suited to them. The divine wisdom is
seen in suiting things each to other, the means
to the end, the object to the faculty, the quality
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47965:62"/>
of the gift to the capacity of the receiver.
Now, if Christ should bring the unregenerate
sinner to Heaven, he could take no more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
there, than a beast, if you should bring him
into a beautiful room, to the society of learned
men, and a well furnished table; when as the
poor thing had much rather be grazing with
his fellow-bruits. Alas, what should an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
creature do in Heaven! he could
take no content, because nothing suits him.
The place doth not suit him, he would be but
<hi>piscis in arido,</hi> quite out of his element, as a
swine in the parlour, or a fish out of water. The
company doth not suit him. What commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath darkness with light, corruption
with perfection? Filth and rottenness, with
glory and immortality? The employment doth
not suit him. The anthems of Heaven fit not
his mouth, suit not his ear. Canst thou charm
thy beast with musick? or wilt thou bring him
to thy Organ, and expect that he should make
thee melody, or keep time with the skilful
quire? Or had he skill, he would have no
will, and so could find no pleasure, no more
than the nauseous stomach in the meat, on
which it hath newly surfeited. Spread thy table
with delicates before a languishing patient, and
it will be but a very offence. Alas, if the poor
man think a sermon long, and say of a Sabbath,
<hi>What a weariness is it? Mal.</hi> 1. 13. how miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
would be think it, to be held to it, to all
eternity? 5. <hi>To his Immutability, or else to his
Omnisciency, or Omnipotency.</hi> For this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted
in the conclave of Heaven, and enrolled
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47965:62"/>
in the decrees of the Court above, that none
but <hi>the pure in heart shall ever see God. Mat.</hi> 5. 8.
This is laid up with him, and sealed among
his treasures. Now if Christ, yet, bring any to
Heaven unconverted, either he must get them in
without his fathers knowledge, and then where
is his Omnisciency? or against his will, and
then where were his Omnipotency? or he must
change his will, and then where were his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability?</p>
            <p>Sinner, wilt thou not yet give up thy vain
hope of being saved in this condition? Saith
<hi>Bildad, Shall, the earth be forsaken for thee? or
the rocks removed out of their place? Iob.</hi> 18. 4.
May not I much more reason so with thee?
Shall the Laws of Heaven be reversed for thee?
Shall the everlasting foundations be overturned
for thee? Shall Christ put out the eye of his
Fathers omnisciency, or shorten the arm of his
eternal power for thee? Shall divine justice be
violated for thee? Or the brightness of the
glory of his holiness be blemished for thee?
Oh the impossibility, absurdity, blasphemy,
that is in such a confidence! To think Christ
will ever save thee in this condition, is to
make thy Saviour to become a sinner, and to
do more wrong to the infinite Majesty, than
all the wicked on earth, or devils in hell ever
did, or could. And yet wilt thou not give up
such a blasphemous hope?</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Against his word.</hi> We need not say, <hi>Who
shall ascend into Heaven to bring down Christ from
above? Or who shall descend into the deep to bring
up Christ from beneath? The word is nigh us.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47965:63"/>
Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. Are you agreed, that Christ
shall end the controversie? Hear then his own
words: <hi>Except you be converted, you shall in no
wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Mat. 18. 3.
You must be born again. Iohn 3. 7. If I wash thee
not, thou hast no part in me. Iohn 13. 8. Repent
or perish. Luke</hi> 13. 3. One word, one would think,
were enough from Christ; but how often and
earnestly doth he reiterate it, verily, verily, verily,
verily, except a man be born again he shall not
see the Kingdom of God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3, 5. Yea he
doth not only assert, but prove the necessity of
the new birth, <hi>viz.</hi> from the fleshliness and
filthiness of mans first birth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 6. by
reason of which, man is no more fit for Heaven,
than the beast is for the chamber of the Kings
presence. And wilt thou yet believe thine own
presumptuous confidence, directly against
Christs word? He must go quite against the
Law of his Kingdom, and rule of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to save thee in this estate.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Against his Oath.</hi> He hath lifted up his
hand to Heaven, he hath sworn, that those that
remain in unbelief, and know not his wayes,
(that is, are ignorant of them, or disobedient to
them) shall not enter into his rest. <hi>Psal. 95. 11.
Heb.</hi> 3. 18. And wilt thou not yet believe, O
sinner, that he is in earnest? Canst thou hope
he will be forsworn for thee? The Covenant of
grace is confirmed by oath, and sealed by
blood: <hi>Heb. 6. 17. Heb. 9. 16, 18, 19. Mat.</hi>
26. 28. but all must be made void and another
way to Heaven found out, if thou be saved
living and dying unsanctified. God is come to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47965:63"/>
his lowest and last terms with man, and hath
condescended as far as with honour he could,
hath set up his pillars, with a <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi>
Men cannot be saved, while unconverted,
except they could get another Covenant made,
and the whole frame of the Gospel (which
was established for ever, with such dreadful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities)
quite altered; and would not this
be a distracted hope?</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Against his Honour.</hi> Christ will so shew
his love to the sinner, as withall to shew his
hatred to sin. Therefore he that names the
name of Jesus, must depart from iniquity,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and deny all ungodliness; and
he that hath hope of life by Christ must purify
himself, as he is pure: 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Tit.</hi> 2. 12.
otherwise Christ would be thought a fautour of
sin. The Lord Jesus will have all the world
to know, though he pardon sin, he will not
protect it. If holy <hi>David</hi> shall say, <hi>depart from
me all you workers of iniquity, Psal.</hi> 6. 8. and
shall shut his doors against them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 7.
shall not such much more expect it from Christs
holiness? Would it be for his honour, to have
the dogs to the table? or to lodge the swine
with his children? or to have <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
to be a nest of Vipers?</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Against his Offices.</hi> God hath exalted him
to be <hi>a Prince and a Saviour, Act.</hi> 5. 31. he should
against both, should he save men in their sins.
It is the office of a King
<q>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arcere subjectis, &amp; debellare superbos;</q>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47965:64"/>
               <hi>To be a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them
that do well. Rom. 13. 3, 4. He is the Minister of
God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth
evil.</hi> Now should Christ favour the ungodly
(so continuing,) and take those to reign
with him, that would not that he should reign
over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. this were quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his office. He therefore reigns, that he
may put his enemies under his feet: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
25. now should he lay them in his bosome, he
should cross the end of his Regal power. It
belongs to Christ, as King, to subdue the
hearts, and slay the lusts of his chosen. <hi>Psal.
45. 5. Psal.</hi> 110. 3. What King would take
the rebels, in open hostility, into his Court?
What were this but to betray life, Kingdom,
Government and all together? If Christ be a
King, he must have homage, honour, subjection,
&amp;c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. now to save men while in their
natural enmity were to obscure his dignity, lose
his authority, bring contempt on his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and sell his dear-bought rights for
nought.</p>
            <p>Again, as Christ should not be a Prince, so
neither a Saviour, if he should do this. For
his Salvation is spiritual: he is called Jesus,
because he saves his people <hi>from</hi> their sins.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. So that should he save them <hi>in</hi> their
sins, he should be neither Lord, nor Jesus. To
save men from the punishment, and not
from the power of sin, were to do his work by
halvs, and be an imperfect Saviour. His office,
as the <hi>Deliverer, is, to turn away ungodliness from
Iacob: Rom. 11. 26. He is sent to bless men in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47965:64"/>
turning them from their iniquities, Act. 3. 26
to make an end of sin: Dan.</hi> 9. 24. so that he
should destroy his own designs, and nullify
his offices, to save men abiding in their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
estate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi> Arise then, what meanest thou
O sleeper? awake O secure sinner, lest thou
be consumed in thine iniquities. Say as the
Lepers, <hi>If we sit here we shall die. 2 Kings</hi> 7. 3, 4.
Verily, it is not more certain thou art now out
of hell, than that thou shalt speedily be in it,
except thou repent and be converted: there is
but this one door for thee to escape by. Arise
then O sluggard, and shake off thine excuses.
How long wilt thou slumber, and fold thy
hands to sleep? <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10, 11. Wilt thou lie
down in the midst of the Sea, or sleep on the
top of the mast? <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 34. There is no
remedy; but thou must either turn, or burn.
There is an unchangeable necessity of the
change of thy condition, except thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to bide the worst of it, and try it out
with the Almighty. If thou lovest thy life,
O man, arise, and come away. Methinks I
see the Lord Jesus laying the merciful hands
of an holy violence upon thee: methinks he
carries it, like the Angels to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. 15.
<hi>&amp;c. Then the Angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise,
lest thou be consumed. And while he lingred,
the men laid hold upon his hand, the Lord being
merciful unto him, and they brought him without
the City, and said, Escape for thy life, stay not in
all the plain, escape to the mountain, lest thou be
consumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:47965:65"/>Oh how willful will thy destruction be, if
thou shouldst yet harden thy self in thy sinful
state! But none of you can say, but you have
had fair warning. Yet methinks I cannot tell
how to leave you so. It is not enough to me
to have delivered my own soul. What, shall
I go away without my errand? Will none of
you arise, and follow me? Have I been all
this while speaking in the wind? Have I been
charming the deaf adder, or allaying the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Ocean with arguments? Do I speak to
the trees or rocks, or to men? to the tombs
and monuments of the dead, or to a living
auditory? If you be men, and not senseless
stocks, stand still, and consider whither you
be going. If you have the reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of men, dare not run into the flames,
and fall into hell with your eyes open: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
your selves, and set to the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
What, men, and yet run into the
pit, when the very beasts will not be forced in!
What, endowed with reason, and yet dally
with death and hell, and the vengeance of the
Almighty! Are men herein distinguished from
the very bruits, that they have a foresight of,
and a care to provide for, the things to come;
and will you not hasten your escape from eternal
torments? Oh shew your selves men, and let
reason prevail with you. Is it a reasonable
thing for you to contend against the Lord your
maker, <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 9. or to harden your selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his word, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 4. as though the
strength of <hi>Israel</hi> would lie? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29.
Is it reasonable, that an understanding creature
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47965:65"/>
should lose, yea live quite against, the very end
of his being, and be as a broken pitcher, only
fit for the dunghil? Is it tolerable, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing in this world that God hath made
capable of knowing his will, and bringing him
glory, should yet live in ignorance of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and be unserviceable to his use, yea should
be engaged against him, and spit his venom in
the face of his Creatour? Hear O Heavens,
and give ear O earth, and let the creatures
without sense be judge, if this be reason that
man, when God hath nourished and brought
him up, should rebel against him. <hi>Esay</hi> 1. 2.
Judge in your own selves: is it a reasonable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
for briars and thorns, to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in battel against the devouring fire? <hi>Esay</hi>
27. 4. or for the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sheard of the earth, to strive
with his maker? If you will say, this is reason,
surely the eye of reason is quite put out. And
if this be not reason, then there is no reason that
you should continue as you be, but 'tis all the
reason in the world, you should forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and turn.</p>
            <p>What shall I say? I could spend my self in
this argument. Oh that you would but heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to me! that you would presently set upon a
new course! Will you not be made clean?
When shall it once be? What, will no body be
perswaded? Reader, shall I prevail with thee
for one? Wilt thou sit down and consider the
forementioned arguments, and debate it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not best to turn? Come and let us
reason together. Is it good for thee to be here?
Wilt thou sit still, till the tide come in upon

thee? Is it good for thee to try whether God
will be so good as his word? and to harden thy
self in a conceit, that all is well with thee,
while thou remainest unsanctified?</p>
            <p>But I know, you will not be perswaded, but
the greatest part will be as they have been, and
do as they have done. I know the drunkard
will to his vomit again, and the deceiver will
to his deceit again, and the lustful wanton to
his dalliance again. Alas, that I must leave
you where you were! in your ignorance or
looseness, or in your liveless formality and
customary devotions! However, I will sit
down and bemoan my fruitless lobours, and
spend some sighs over my perishing hearers.</p>
            <p>Oh distracted sinners! What will their end
be? What will they do in the day of visitation?
<hi>Whither will they fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

leave their glory? Esay</hi> 10. 3. How powerfully
hath sin bewitched them? How effectually
hath the god of this world blinded them?
How strong is their delusion? How uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
their ears? How obdurate their hearts?
Satan hath them at his beck: but how long
may I call, and can get no answer? I may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
with them year after year, and they will
give me the hearing, and that is all. They
must and will have their sins, say what I
will. Though I tell them there is death
in the cup, yet they will take it up. Though
I tell them 'tis the broad way, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in destruction, yet they will on in it. I
warn them, yet cannot win them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I think, the mercies of God will melt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47965:66"/>
them, and his winning invitations will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them: but I find them as they were.
Sometimes that the terror of the Lord will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them: yet neither this will do it. They
will approve the word, like the Sermon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the preacher: but they will yet live as
they did. They will not deny me, yet they
will not obey me. They will flock to the word of
God, and sit before me as his people, and hear
my words: but they will not do them. They
value and will plead for Ministers; and I am to
them as the lovely song of one that hath a
pleasant voice: yet I cannot get them to
come under Christs yoke. They love me,
and will be ready to say they will do any
thing for me: but for my life I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to leave their sins, to forgoe
their evil company, their intemperance, their
unjust gains, &amp;c. I cannot prevail with them,
to set up prayer in their families and closets:
yet they will promise me, like the forward son,
that said, <hi>I go sir, but went not. Mat.</hi> 21. 30.
I cannot perswade them to learn the principles
of religion, though else <hi>they will die without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Iob</hi> 36. 12. I tell them their misery;
but they will not believe, but 'tis well enough.
If I tell them particularly, I fear for such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
their state is sad, they will judge me cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious:
or, if they be at present a little awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are quickly lull'd asleep by Satan again, and
have lost the sense of all.</p>
            <p>Alas for my poor hearers! Must they perish
at last by the hundreds, when Ministers would
so fain save them? What course shall I use
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47965:67"/>
with them that I have not tried? <hi>What shall I
do for the daughter of my people? Ier. 9. 7. O
Lord God, help. Alas, shall I leave them thus! If
they will not hear me, yet do thou hear me. Oh
that they might yet live in thy sight! Lord save
them, or else they perish. My heart would melt to
see their houses on fire about their ears, when
they were fast in their beds: and shall not my
soul be moved within me to see them falling into
endless perdition? Lord have compassion, and save
them out of the burning. Put forth thy divine
power, and the work will be done: but as for me,
I cannot prevail.</hi>

eye discover the rotten foundation of the self-deceiver,
and lead me O Lord God, as thou didst
thy Prophet, into the chambers of imagery, and

Must I leave you at last where you were? Must I

the wanton still at his dalliance? Must I leave
the malicious still in his venome? And the
drunkard still at his vomit? However you
must know, that you have been warned, and
that I am clear of your blood. And whether
men will hear, or whether they will forbear, I
will leave these three scriptures with them,
either as thunderbolts to awaken them, or as
searing Irons to harden them to a reprobate
sense, <hi>Psal. 68. 21. God shall wound the head of his

that there are another sort of unsanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that carry not their marks in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
but more secretly and covertly in their
hands. These do frequently deceive themselves
and others, and pass for good Christians, when
they are all the while unsound at bottom.
Many pass undiscovered, till death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
bring all to light. Those self-deceivers
seem to come even to Heaven-gate with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their admission, and yet are turned
off at last. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. Brethren Beloved, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you deeply to lay to heart, and firmly
to retain this awakening consideration: <hi>That
Multitudes miscarry by the hand of some secret sin,
that is not only hidden from others, but (for want
of observing their own hearts) even from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
A man may be free from open pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
and yet die at last by the fatal hand
of some unobserved iniquity: And there be
these eleven hidden sins, by which souls go
down by numbers to the chambers of death.
These you must search carefully for, and take
them as black marks (where-ever they be
found) discovering a graceless and unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
estate. As you love your lives read them
carefully, with a holy jealousie of your selves,
lest you should be the persons concerned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gross Ignorance.</hi> Ah how many poor
souls doth this sin kill in the dark, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 6.

mischiefs them. You shall find whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
you have for ignorance, that 'tis a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undoing

4. 3. Ah would it not have pitied a man's
heart to have seen that woful spectacle, when
the poor Protestants were shut up a multitude
together in a barn, and a butcher comes with
his inhumane hands warm in humane blood
and leads them one by one blindfold to a block,
where he slew them (poor Innocents!) one
after another by the scores in cold blood? But
how much more should our hearts bleed, to
think of the hundreds in great congregations,
that ignorance doth butcher in secret, and lead
them blindfold to the block? Beware this be
none of your case. Make no pleas for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
If you spare that sin, know that that

forsake all for Christ, to hate father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yea and a mans own life for him, this is a
hard saying. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. Some will do much,
but they will not be of the religion that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do

to Christ, nor fully to resign to him. They
must have the sweet sin. They mean to do
themselves no harm. They have secret ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
for life, liberty, or estate. Many take
Christ thus hand over head, and never consider
his self-denying terms, nor cast upon the cost;
and this error in the foundation marrs all, and

the external performance of holy duties; <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. 25. and this oft times doth most effectually
deceive men, &amp; doth more certainly undo them,
than open looseness, as it was in the Pharisees
case. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 31. They hear, they fast, they pray,
they give alms, and therefore will not believe but
their case is good: <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. whereas resting in
the work done, and coming short of the heart-work,
and the inward power and vitals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they fall at last into the burnings, from
the flattering hopes, and confident perswasions,
of their being in the ready way to Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi>
7. 22, 23. Oh dreadful case, when a man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
shall serve, only to harden him, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually

soul!</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The prevalency of false ends in holy duties.
Mat.</hi> 23. 5. This was the bane of the Pharisees.
Oh how many a poor soul is undone by this,
and drops into hell, before he discerns his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake!
He performs good duties, and so thinks
all is well, and perceives not that he is acted
by carnal motives all the while. It is too true,
that even with the truly sanctified, many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ends will oft times creep in; but they are
the matter of his hatred and humiliation, and
never come to be habitually prevalent with
him, and to bear the greatest sway. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 7.
But now when the main thing that doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
carry a man out to religious duties, shall
be some carnal end, as to satisfy his conscience,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47965:72"/>
to get the repute of being religious, to be seen
of men, to shew his own gifts and parts, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the reproach of a prophane and irreligious
person, or the like, this discovers an unsound
heart. <hi>Hos. 10. 1. Zech.</hi> 7. 5, 6. Oh Christians,
if you would avoid self-deceit, see that you

they do indeed reject Christ's. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
you had need be watchful on every

may undo you. It may be you never thought

when a man doth trust to these as his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
before God, for the satisfying his justice,
appeasing his wrath, procuring his favour, and
obtaining of his own pardon for this is to put
Christ out of office, and make a Saviour of our

marks of a sound believer? Can you
evidence that you have something more than
any Hypocrite in the world ever had? If not,
fear this peace, more than any trouble; and
know, that a carnal peace doth commonly
prove the most mortal enemy of the poor soul,
and while it smiles and kisses and speaks it fair,
doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By this time methinks I hear my reader cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out with the Disciples, who then shall be
saved? Set out from among our congregations
all those ten ranks of the prophane on the one
hand; and then besides take out all these twelve
sorts of close and self deceiving Hypocrites on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47965:74"/>
the other hand, and tell me then whether it
be not a remnant that shall be saved. How
few will be the sheep that shall be left, when all
these shall be separated, and set among the
Goats? For my part, of all my numerous hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
I have no hopes to see any of them in
Heaven, that are to be found among these
two and twenty sorts, that are here mentioned,
except by sound conversion they be brought
into another condition.</p>

               <hi>Application.</hi> And now conscience do thine
office. Speak out, and speak home to him
that heareth or readeth these lines. If thou
find any of these marks upon him, thou must
pronounce him utterly unclean. <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 44.
Take not up a lie into thy mouth: speak not
peace to him, to whom God speaks no peace.
Let not lust bribe thee, or self-love, or carnal
prejudice blind thee. I <hi>sub-poena</hi> thee from the
Court of Heaven, to come and give in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
I require thee in the name of God to
go with me to the search of the suspected
house. As thou wilt answer it at thy peril, give
in a true report of the state and case of him
that readeth this book. Conscience, wilt thou
altogether hold thy peace at such a time as
this? I adjure thee by the living God, that
thou tell us the truth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 63. Is the man
converted, or is he not? Doth he allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in any way of sin, or doth he not? Doth
he truly love, and please, and prize and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God above all other things, or not?
Come, put it to an issue. How long shall this
soul lie at uncertainties? Oh Conscience bring
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47965:75"/>
in thy verdict. Is this man a new man, or is
he not? How dost thou find it? Hath there
passed a through and mighty change upon him,
or not? When was the time, where was the
place, or what was the means, by which this
through change of the new birth was wrought
in this soul? Speak Conscience. Or if thou
canst not tell time and place, canst thou shew
scripture evidence, that the work is done?
Hath the man been ever taken off from his false
bottom, from the false hopes, and false peace
wherein once he trusted? Hath he been deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced of sin, and of his lost and undone
condition, and brought out of himself, and
off from his sins, to give up himself intirely to
Jesus Christ? Or dost thou not find him to
this day under the power of ignorance, or in
the mire of prophaneness? Hast not thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon him the gains of unrighteousness?
Dost not thou find him a stranger to prayer,
a neglecter of the word, a lover of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world? Dost not thou often catch him in
a lie? Dost not thou find his heart fermented
with malice, or burning with lust, or going
after his covetousness? Speak plainly to all the
forementioned particulars: canst thou acquit
this man, this woman, from being any of the
two and twenty sorts here described? If he
be found with any of them, set him aside, his
portion is not with the Saints. He must be
converted and made a new creature, or else
he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Beloved, be not your own betrayers, do not
deceive your own hearts, nor set your hands to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47965:75"/>
your own ruine, by a wilful blinding of your
selves. Set up a tribunal in your own breasts.
Bring the word and conscience together. <hi>To the
law, and to the Testimony. Isai.</hi> 8. 20. Hear what the
word concludes of your estates. O follow the
search, till you have found how the case stands.
Mistake here, and perish. And such is the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of the Heart, the subtilty of the tempter,
and the deceitfulness of sin, <hi>Ier. 17. 9. 2 Cor.
11. 3. Heb.</hi> 3. 13. all conspiring to flatter and
deceive the poor soul, and withal so common
and easie it is to be mistaken, that it's a thousand

be very careful, and thorow, and impartial in
the enquiry into your spiritual conditions. Oh
therefore ply your work: go to the bottom:
search as with candles: weigh you in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;
come to the standard of the Sanctuary:
bring your coin to the touch-stone. You have
the archest cheats in the world to deal with: a
world of counterfeit Coin is going: happy is
he, that takes not Counters for Gold. Satan is
master of deceits: he can draw to the life: he
is perfect in the trade: there is nothing but he
can imitate. You cannot wish for any Grace,
but he can fit you to a hair with a counterfeit.
Trade warily: look on every piece you take:
be jealous: trust not so much as your own
hearts. Run to God to search you and try you,
to examine you and prove your reins. <hi>Psal.
26. 2. Psal.</hi> 139. 23, 24. If other helps suffice

            <head type="sub">Shewing the miseries of the unconverted.</head>
            <p>SO unspeakably dreadful is the case of every
unconverted soul, that I have sometimes
thought, if we could but convince men, that
they are yet unregenerate, the work were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter done. But I sadly experience,
that such a spirit of sloth and slumber (<hi>Rom. 11.
8. Mat.</hi> 13. 15.) possesses the unsanctified, that
though they be convinced; that they are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted;
yet they oft-times carelesly sit still:
and what through the avocation of sensual
pleasures, or hurry of worldly business, or
noise and clamour of earthly cares, and lusts,
and affections, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 14. the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is drowned, and men go no farther
than some cold wishes, and general purposes of
repenting and amending. <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25.</p>
            <p>It's therefore of high necessity, that I do not
only convince men, that they are unconverted;
but that I also endeavour, to bring them to a
sense of the fearful misery of this estate.</p>
            <p>But here I find my self a ground at first put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth. What tongue can tell the heirs of
Hell sufficiently of their misery, unless 'twere
<hi>Dives</hi> his, that was tormented in that flame?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47965:76"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 24. Where is the ready writer, whose
pen can decypher their misery, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the world? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. This cannot
fully be done, unless we knew the infinite ocean
of that bliss and perfection which is in that
God, which a state of sin doth exclude men
from. Who knoweth (saith <hi>Moses</hi>) the power
of thine anger? <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 11. And how shall I
tell men, that which I do not know? Yet so
much we know, as one would think would
shake the heart of that man, that had the least
degree of spiritual life and sense.</p>
            <p>But this is yet the more posing difficulty,
that I am to speak to them that are without
sense. Alas, this is not the least part of man's
misery upon him, that he is dead, stark dead in
trespasses and sins. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>Could I bring Paradise into view, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Kingdom of Heaven to as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as the tempter did the Kingdoms of

or could I uncover the face of the deep

and open the grates of the infernal furnace,
alas he hath no eyes to see it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 14, 15.
Could I paint out the beauties of holiness, or
glory of the Gospel to the life; or could I
bring above board the more than diabolical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
and ugliness of sin; he can no more
judge of the loveliness and beauty of the one,
nor of the filthiness and hatefulness of the other,
than the blind of colours. He is alienated
from the life of God through the ignorance
that is in him, because of the blindness of his

heart. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. He neither doth nor can
know the things of God, because they are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually

be savingly opened, but by converting
grace: <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. he is a child of darkness,
and walks in darkness, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 6. yea the light
in him is darkness. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. 3</p>
            <p>Shall I ring his knell, or read his sentence,
or sound in his ear, the terrible trump of God's
judgments, that one would think should make
both his ears to tingle, and strike him into <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazar</hi>'s
fit, even to appale his countenance, and
loose his joints, and make his knees smite one
against the other? Yet alas! he perceives me
not: he hath no ears to hear. Or shall I call
up all the daughters of musick, and sing the song
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the Lamb? yet he will not be
stirred. Shall I allure him with the joyful
sound, and the lovely song and glad tidings of
the Gospel? with the most sweet and inviting
calls, comforts, cordials of the divine promises,
so exceeding great and precious? it will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
him savingly, unless I could find him ears,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 15. as well as tell him the news.</p>
            <p>Shall I set before him the feast of fat things,
the wine of wisdom, the bread of God, the
tree of life, the hidden <hi>Manna?</hi> he hath no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
for them, no mind to them. 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14.
Mat.</hi> 22. 5. Should I press the choicest grapes,
the heavenly clusters of gospel priviledges, and
drink to him in the richest wine of Gods own
cellar, yea of his own side, or set before him
the delicious honey-comb of Gods testimonies,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 10. alas he hath no taste to discern

them. Shall I invite the dead to arise and eat
the banquet of their funerals? No more can the
dead in sin, savour the holy food wherewith
the Lord of life hath spread his table.</p>
            <p>What then shall I do? shall I burn the brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of hell at his nostrils? or shall I open the
box of Spikenard, very precious, that filleth the
whole house of this universe with its perfume,
<hi>Mark 14. 3. Ioh.</hi> 12. 8. and hope that the savour
of Christs ointments, and the smell of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

spiritual sense and motion.</p>
            <p>But let me try the sense that doth last leave us,
and draw the sword of the word: yet lay at
him while I will, yea though I choose mine
arrows out of Gods quiver, and direct them
to the heart, nevertheless he feeleth not; for
how should he, being past feeling? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19.
So that though the wrath of God abideth on
him, and the mountainous weight of so many
thousand sins, yet he goes up and down as
light, as if nothing ailed him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. In
a word, he carries a dead soul in a living body,
and his flesh is but the walking cossin of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

prophesie be, as of thy Prophet's, when he prophesied
the valley of dry bones, into a living army, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great. Ezek. 37. 1. &amp;c. The hand of the
Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit
of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the
valley, which was full of bones. He said unto me,
prophesie upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord: Thus saith
the Lord God unto these bones; Behold I will cause
breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. And
I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh
upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath
in you, and ye shall live, and ye shall know that
I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
and as I prophesied, there was a noise,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bone to his bone. And when I behold, Loe the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
and the flesh came up upon them, and covered

said he unto me; Prophesie unto the wind, prophesie
son of man, and say to the wind; Thus saith the

So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the

            <p>But I must proceed, as I am able, to unfold
that misery, which I confess no tongue can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,

            <p>Sinner, methinks this should go like a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

enemy. Oh whither wilt thou go, where
wilt thou shelter thee? There is no hope for
thee unless thou lay down thy weapons, and
sue out thy pardon, and get Christ to stand thy
friend, and to make thy peace. If it were not
for this, thou mightest go into some howling
wilderness, and there pine in sorrow, and run
mad for anguish of heart and horrible despair.
But in Christ there is a possibility of mercy
for thee, yea a proffer of mercy to thee,
that thou maist have God to be more for
thee, than he is now against thee. But if thou
wilt not forsake thy sins, nor turn throughly,
and to purpose unto God, by a sound Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;

how terrible was the consequence? <hi>Ezek. 14. 8.
I will set my face against that man, and will make

unless thou canst make a scripture claim to
Christ and his satisfaction. When the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sinner looks on justice, and sees the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
in which he must be weighed, and the
sword by which he must be executed, he feels
an earth-quake in his breast. But Satan keeps
this out of sight, and perswades the soul
while he can; that the Lord is all made up of
mercy, and so lulls it asleep in sin. Divine
Justice is very strict; it must have satisfaction
to the utmost farthing, it denounceth <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and wrath, tribulation and anguish, to every
soul that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one that continueth not in every thing, that is
written in the Law to do it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47965:81"/>
justice of God to the unpardoned sinner, that
hath a sense of his misery, is more terrible, than
the sight of the bailiff or creditour to the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
debtour, or than the sight of the Judge
and bench to the robber, or of the irons and
gibbet to the guilty murderer. When justice
sits upon life and death, oh what dreadful
work doth it make with the wretched sinner?
<hi>Bind him hand and foot, cast him into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matt. 22. 13. Depart from me ye cursed, into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting

sentence that justice pronounceth. Why sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by this severe justice must thou be tried;
and as God liveth, this killing sentence shalt
thou hear, unless thou repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The holiness of God is full of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
against thee. Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5. He is not only
angry with thee (so he may be with his
own children) but he hath a fixed, rooted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
displeasure against thee: he loaths thee,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 8. and what is done by thee, though
for substance commanded by him: <hi>Esay 1. 14.
Mal.</hi> 1. 10. As if a man should give his servant
never so good meat to dress; yet if he should
mingle filth, or poison with it, he would not
touch it. Gods nature is infinitely contrary to
sin, and so he cannot but hate a sinner out of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Oh what a misery is this, to be out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,

how darest thou to think of the bright and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
Sun of purity, upon the beauties, the

Psal.</hi> 113. Oh those light and sparkling

<hi>Who shall stand before this holy Lord God?
1 Sam.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Power of God is mounted like a

power is to be displayed, in the wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion

make thy party good against thy maker? No
more than a silly reed, against the Cedars of
God; or a little cock-boat, against the tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ocean; or the childrens bubbles, against
the blustering winds. Sinner, the power of
Gods anger is against thee: <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 11. and
power and anger together, make fearful work.
'Twere better thou hadst all the world in arms

man that shall understand it by feeling it!
<hi>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer
him one of a thousand. He is wise in heart,
and mighty in strength; who hath hardened
himself against him, and prospered? Which
removeth the mountains and they know it not
which overturneth them in his anger. Which
shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
thereof tremble. Which commandeth the Sun, and
it riseth not; and sealeth up the Stars. Behold he
taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say
unto him, What dost thou? If God will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under
him. Iob. 9. 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</hi> And art thou a fit
match for such an antagonist? Oh <hi>consider this,
you that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and
there be none to deliver you. Psal.</hi> 50. 22. Submit
to mercy. Let not dust and stubble stand it
out against the Almighty. Set not briars
and thorns against him in battel, lest he go
through them, and consume them together:
but <hi>lay hold on his strength, that you may make
peace with him. Esay 27. 4, 5. Wo to him that striveth
with his maker. Esay</hi> 45. 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The wisdom of God is set to ruine thee,</hi>
He hath ordained his arrows and prepared the
instruments of death and made all things ready.
<hi>Psa.</hi> 7. 11, 12. 13. His counsels are against thee, to

sees how thou wilt come down mightily in a

moment; how thou wilt wring thine hands, and
tear thine hair, and eat thy flesh, and gnash thy
teeth for anguish and astonishment of heart,
when thou seest how thou art fallen remedilesly
into the pit of destruction.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Truth of God is sworn against thee.
Psal.</hi> 95. 11. If he be true and faithful, thou must
perish if thou goest on. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3. Unless he
be false of his word, thou must die, except
thou repent. <hi>Ezek. 33. 11. If we believe not, yet
he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himself. 2 Tim.</hi>
2. 13. That is, he is faithful to his threatnings,
as well as promises, and will shew his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in our confusion, if we believe not. God
hath told thee, as plain as it can be spoken;
<hi>That if he wash thee not, thou hast no part in him.
Iohn 13. 8. That if thou livest after the flesh, thou
shalt dye; Rom. 8. 13. That except thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
thou shalt in no wise enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven; Mat.</hi> 18. 3. and he abideth faithful,
he cannot deny himself. Beloved, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
faithfulness of God in his promise and
oath, afford believers strong consolation; <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 18. so they are to unbelievers, for strong
consternation and confusion. O sinner, tell me,
what shift dost thou make to think of all the
threatnings of Gods word, that stand upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
against thee? Dost thou believe their truth,
or not? If not, thou art a wretched infidel,
and not a Christian; and therefore give over
the name and hopes of a Christian. But if thou
dost believe them, O heart of steel that thou
hast, that canst walk up and down in quiet,
when the truth and faithfulness of God in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47965:83"/>
to destroy thee: that if God Almighty
can do it, thou shalt surely perish, and be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Why man, the whole book of God doth
testify against thee, while thou remainest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified:
it condemns thee in every leaf, and is
to thee, like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s roll, written within and
without with lamentations, and mourning, and
wo: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 10. and all this shall surely come
upon thee, and overtake thee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 15. except
thou repent. <hi>Heaven and earth shall pass away;
but one jot, or tittle of this word shall never pass
away. Mat.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
            <p>Now put all this together, and tell me, if the
case of the Unconverted be not deplorably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.
As we read of some persons, that had
bound themselves in an oath, and in a curse
to kill <hi>Paul:</hi> so thou must know, O sinner, to
thy terror, that all the attributes of the infinite
God are bound in an oath to destroy thee: <hi>Heb.</hi>
3. 18. O man what wilt thou do? whither wilt
thou fly? If Gods Omnisciency can find thee,
thou shalt not escape. If the true and faithful
God will save his oath, perish thou must, except
thou believe and repent. If the Almighty hath
power to torment thee, thou shalt be perfectly
miserable in soul and body to all eternity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be prevented by thy speedy Conversion.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The whole creation of God is against thee.
The whole creation</hi> (<hi>saith</hi> Paul) <hi>groaneth and
travelleth in pain. Rom.</hi> 8. 22. But what is it
that the creation groaneth under? Why, the
fearful abuse that it is subject to, in serving the
lusts of unsanctified men. And what is it that
the creation groaneth for? why, for freedom
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47965:83"/>
and liberty from this abuse; for <hi>the creature is
very unwillingly subject to this bondage. Rom.</hi> 8.
19, 20, 21. If the unreasonable and inanimate
creatures had speech and reason, they would
cry out under it, as a bondage unsufferable, to
be abused by the ungodly, contrary to their
natures, and the ends that the great Creatour
made them for. It is a passage of an eminent
Divine; The liquor that the drunkard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if it had reason as well as a man, to know
how shamefully 'tis abused and spoiled, it
would groan in the barrels against him, it
would groan in the cup against him, it would
groan in his throat, in his belly against him. It
would fly in his face, if it could speak. And
if God should open the mouth of the creatures,
as he did the mouth of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s ass, the proud
mans garments on his back would groan against
him. There is never a creature, but if it had
reason to know how 'tis abused, till a man is
converted, 'twould groan against him. The
land would groan to bear him, the air would
groan to give him breathing, their houses
would groan to lodge them, their beds would
groan to ease them, their food to nourish them,
their cloaths to cover them, and every creature
would groan to give them any help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
so long as they live in sin against God.
Thus far he. Methinks this should be a terrour
to an unconverted soul, to think, that he is a
burden to the creation. <hi>Luke 13. 7. Cut
it down why cumbereth it the ground.</hi> If the
poor inanimate creatures could but speak,
they would say to the ungodly, as <hi>Moses</hi> to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47965:84"/>
               <hi>Israel; Must we fetch you water out of the rock,
ye rebels? Numb.</hi> 2. 10. Thy food would say,
<hi>Lord, must I nourish such a wretch as this, and
yield forth my strength for him, to dishonour thee
withal? No, I will choak him rather, if thou
wilt give me Commission:</hi> The very air would say,
<hi>Lord, must I give this man breath, to set his
tongue against Heaven, and scorn thy people, and
vent his pride and wrath, and filthy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and helch out oaths and blasphemy against
thee? No, if thou wilt but say the word, he shall
be breathless for me.</hi> His poor beast would say,
<hi>Lord, must I carry him upon his wicked designs? No,
I will break his bones, I will end his dayes rather,
if I may have but leave from thee.</hi> A wicked man
the earth groans under him, and hell groans
for him, till death satisfies both, and unburdens
the earth, and stops the mouth of hell with
him. While the Lord of Hosts is against thee,
be sure the Hosts of the Lord are against thee,
and all the creatures as it were up in arms, till
upon a mans conversion, the controversie being
taken up between God and him, he makes a
covenant of peace with the creatures for him.
<hi>Iob 5. 22, 23, 24. Hos.</hi> 2. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>The roaring Lion hath his full power upon
thee. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 8. Thou art fast in the paw of
that Lion, that is greedy to devour, <hi>in the snare
of the devil, led captive by him at his will. 2 Tim.</hi>
2. 26. This is <hi>the spirit that worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of disobedience, Eph.</hi> 2. 2. His drudges they
are, and his lusts they do. He is the ruler of
the darknes of this world: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. that is,
of ignorant sinners, that live in darkness. You
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47965:84"/>
pity the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> that worship the Devil
for their God; but little think that 'tis your
own case. Why 'tis the common misery of all
the unsanctified, that the Devil is their God.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Not that they do intend to do him
homage and worship; they will be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
him, and him that should say so by them;
but all this while they serve him, and come and
go at his beck, and live under his government.
His servants you are, to whom you yield your
selves to obey. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. Oh how many then
will be found the real servants of the Devil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that
take themselves for no other than the children
of God? He can no sooner offer a sinful delight
or opportunity for your unlawful advantage,
but you embrace it. If he suggest a lie, or
prompt you to revenge, you readily obey. If
he forbid you to read, or pray, you hearken to
him, and therefore his servants you are. Indeed
he lies behind the curtain, he acts in the dark,
and sinners see not who setteth them on work:
but all the while he leads them in a string.
Doubtless the liar intends not a service to Satan,
but his own advantage: yet 'tis he that stands in
the corner unobserved, and putteth the thing
into his heart. <hi>Act. 5. 3. Iohn</hi> 8. 44. Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless,
<hi>Iudas</hi> when he sold his master for mony,
and the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> when they plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>Iob,</hi> intended not to do the Devil a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but to satisfie their own covetous thirst:
yet 'twas he that acted them in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Iohn 13. 27. Iob</hi> 1. 12, 15, 17. Men
may be very slaves and common drudges for the
Devil, and never know it: nay they may please
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47965:85"/>
themselves in the thoughts of a happy liberty.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>Art thou yet in ignorance, and not turned
from darkness to light? why thou art under the
power of Satan. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. Dost thou live in
the ordinary and wilful practice of any known

3. 8. Dost thou live in strife, or envy, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?
Verily he is thy father. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 40, 41. Oh

slaves with divers pleasures; <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. yet it is but

that is now thy tempter, will be one day thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter.
Oh that I could but give thee to see how
black a master thou servest, how filthy a drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
thou dost, how merciless a tyrant thou gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyest,
all whose pleasure is, to set thee on work
to make thy perdition and damnation sure, and
to heat the furnace hotter and hotter, in which
thou must burn for millions of millions of ages.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>The guilt of all thy sius lies like a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
upon thee.</hi> Poor soul! Thou feele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t it not,
but this is that which seals thy misery upon thee.
While unconverted, none of thy sins are blotted
out: <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. they are all upon the score a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee. Regeneration and remission are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
separated: the unsanctified are unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
unjustified, and unpardoned. 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11.
1 Pet. 1. 2. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing to be in debt, but above all in Gods debt:
for there is no arrest so formidable as his, no
prison so horrible as his. Look upon an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47965:85"/>
sinner, who feels the weight of his own
guilt, and oh how frightful are his looks, how
fearful are his complaints! His comforts are
turned into Wormwood, and his moisture into
drought, and his sleep departeth from his eyes.
He is a terrour to himself and all that are about
him, and is ready to envy the very stones that
lie in the street, because these are senseless, and
feel not his misery; and wishes, he had been a dog,
or a toad, or serpent rather than a man, because
then death had put an end to his misery, whereas
now it will be but the beginning of that,
which will know no ending.</p>
            <p>How light soever you may make of it now,
you will one day find the guilt of unpardoned sin
to be a heavy burden. This is a milstone that
whosoever falleth upon it shall be broken, but
upon whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him
to powder. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 44. What work did it
make with our Saviour? it pressed the very
blood (to a wonder) out of his veins, and
broke all his bones: and if it did this in the
green tree, what will it do in the dry?</p>
            <p>Oh think of thy case in time. Canst thou
think of that threat without trembling, <hi>Ye shall
die in your sins? Iohn</hi> 8. 24. Oh better were
it for thee to dye in a gaol, dye in a ditch, in a
dungeon, than dye in thy sins. If death, as
it will take away all thy other comforts, would
take away thy sins too, it were some mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But thy sins will follow thee, when thy
friends leave thee, and all worldly enjoyments
shake hands with thee. Thy sins will not dye
with thee, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10. Rev.</hi> 20. 12. as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47965:86"/>
other debts will; but they will to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with thee, there to be thine accusers; and
they will to Hell with thee, there to be thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.
Better to have so many fiends and
furies about thee, than thy sins to fall upon thee
and fasten in thee. Oh the work that these will
make with thee! Oh look over thy debts in
time. How much art thou in the books of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of Gods laws? How is every one of
Gods commandments ready to arrest thee, and
take thee by the throat, for innumerable bonds
that it hath upon thee? What wilt thou then
do, when they shall altogether lay in against
thee? Hold open the eyes of conscience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this, that thou maist despair of thy self, and
be driven to Christ, and fly for refuge, to lay hold
upon the hope that is set before thee. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Thy raging lusts do miserably enslave thee.</hi> While
unconverted, thou art a very servant of sin: it
reigns over thee, and holds thee under its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
till thou art brought within the bond
of Gods covenant. <hi>Iohn 8. 34, 36. Tit. 3. 3.
Rom. 6. 12, 14. Rom.</hi> 6. 16, 17. Now there's
no such Tyrant as sin. Oh the filthy and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
work, that it doth engage its servants in!
Would it not pierce a mans heart to see a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of poor Creatures drudging and toiling,
and all to carry together faggots and fuel for
their own burning? Why, this is the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sins drudges. Even while they bless
themselves in their unrighteous gains, while
they sing and swill in pleasures, they are but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring

            <p>What a woful spectacle was that poor wretch
possessed with the legion? would it not have
pityed thine heart to have seen him among the
tombs, cutting, and wounding of himself?
<hi>Mark</hi> 5. 5. This is thy case, such is thy work.
Every stroke is a thrust at thine heart. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
6. 10. Conscience indeed is now asleep; but
when death and judgment shall bring thee to
thy senses, then thou wilt feel the raging smart
and anguish of every wound. The convinced
sinner is a sensible instance of the miserable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of sin. Conscience flies upon him, and
tells him what the end of these courses will be:
and yet such a slave is he to his lusts, that on he
must, though he see it will be his endless perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and when the temptation comes, lust
gets the bit in its mouth, breaks all the cords of
his vows and promises, and carries him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to his own destruction.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>The furnace of eternal vengeance is heated
ready for thee. Esay</hi> 30. 33. Hell and destruction
open their mouths upon thee, they gape for thee,
they groan for thee, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 14. waiting as
it were with a greedy eye, as thou standest upon
the brink, when thou wilt drop in. If the
wrath of a man may be, <hi>as the roaring of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Prov. 19 12. more heavy than the sand;
Prov.</hi> 27. 3. What is the wrath of the infinite
God? If the burning furnace heated in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezars</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:47965:87"/>
fiery rage, when he commanded it
to be made yet seven times hotter, were so fierce
as to burn up even those that drew near it, to
throw the three children in: <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 19, 22.
How hot is that burning oven of the Almighty's
fury? <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. Surely this is seventy times
seven more fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rce. What thinkest thou, O man,
of being a faggot in Hell to all eternity? <hi>Can
thine heart indure, or can thine hands be strong, in
the day that I shall deal with thee, saith the Lord of
hosts? Ezek.</hi> 22. 14. Canst thou dwell with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
burnings? Canst thou abide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
fire? <hi>Esay</hi> 33. 14. When thou shalt
be as a glowing Iron in Hell, and thy whole
body and soul shall be as perfectly possessed by
Gods burning vengeance, as the fiery sparkling
iron, when heated in the fiercest forge? Thou
canst not bear Gods whip: how then wilt thou
endure his scorpions? Thou art even crushed,
and ready to wish thy self dead, under the
weight of his finger: how then wilt thou bear
the weight of his loins? The most patient man
that ever was, did curse the day that ever he
was born, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. 1. and even wooe death to
come and end his misery, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 15, 16. when
God did but let out one little drop of his wrath.
How then wilt thou endure, when God shall
pour out all his vials, and set himself against
thee to torment thee? When he shall make thy
conscience the tunnel, by which he will he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his burning wrath into thy soul for ever;
and when he shall fill all thy powers as full of
torment, as they be now full of sin? When im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
shall be thy misery, and to die the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47965:87"/>
death of a bruit, and be swallowed into the
gulf of annihilation, shall be such a felicity, as
a whole eternity of wishes, and an Ocean of
tears shall never purchase? Now thou canst put
off the evil day, and canst laugh and be merry,
and forget the terror of the Lord: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.
but how wilt thou hold out, or hold up, when
God shall cast thee into a bed of torments, <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 22. and make thee to lie down in sorrows?
<hi>Esay</hi> 50. 11. When roarings and blasphemy
shall be thine only musick, and the wine of the
wrath of God, which is poured out without
mixture into the cup of his indignation, shall be
thine only drink? <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. When thou
shalt draw in flames for thy breath, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
stench of sulphur shall be thine only perfume?
In a word, when the smoak of thy torment shall
ascend for ever and ever, and thou shalt have
no rest night nor day, no rest in thy conscience,
no ease in thy bones, but thou shalt be an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
and an astonishment, and a curse, and
a reproach for evermore? <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. 18.</p>
            <p>Oh sinner, stop here; and consider. If thou
art a man and not a senseless block, consider.
Bethink thy self where thou standest: why up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very brim of this furnace. As the Lord
liveth and thy soul liveth, there is but a step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thee and this. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 3. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not, when thou liest down, but thou maist
be in before the morning: thou knowest not
when thou risest but thou maist drop in before
the night. Darest thou make light of this? wilt
thou go on in such a dreadful condition, as if
nothing ailed thee? If thou puttest it off, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47965:88"/>
sayest, this doth not belong to thee; look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
over the foregoing Chapter, and tell me
the truth, are none of those black marks found
upon thee? Do not blind thine eyes, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thy self: see thy misery while thou maist
prevent it. Think what 'tis to be a vile cast-out,
a damned reprobate, a vessel of wrath, into
which the Lord will be pouring out his tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fury, while he hath a being. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
            <p>Divine wrath is a fierce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 22. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring,
<hi>Esay</hi> 33. 14. everlasting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
41. unquenchable fire; <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. and thy
soul and body must be the fuel upon which it
will be feeding for ever, unless thou consider
thy ways, and speedily turn to the Lord by a
sound conversion. They that have been only
singed by this fire, and had no more but the
smell thereof passing upon them, Oh what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
spectacles have they been. Whose heart
would not have melted, to have heard <hi>Spira</hi>'s
outcries, to have seen <hi>Chaloner</hi> that monument
of justice, worn to skin and bones blaspheming
the God of Heaven, cursing himself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
crying out, <hi>O torture, torture, torture, O
torture, torture,</hi> as if the flames of wrath had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
took hold of him? To have heard <hi>Rogers</hi>
crying out, <hi>I have had a little pleasure, and now I
must to Hell for evermore;</hi> wishing but for this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation,
that God would but let him lie burning
for ever behind the back of that fire (on the
hearth) and bringing in this sad conclusion still,
at the end of whatever was spoken to him to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him some hope, <hi>I must to Hell, I must to the
furnace of Hell, for millions of millions of ages.</hi> Oh
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47965:88"/>
if the fears and fore thoughts of the wrath to
come be so terrible, so intolerable, what is the
feeling of it!</p>
            <p>Sinners, 'tis but in vain to flatter you; this
would be but to toll you into the unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fire: know ye from the living God, that
here you must lie, with these burnings must you
dwell, till immortality die, and immutability
change, till Eternity run out, and omnipotency
is no longer able to torment, except you be in
good earnest renewed throughout by sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>The Law dischargeth all its threats and
curses at thee. Gal. 3. 10. Rom.</hi> 7. Oh how
dreadfully doth it thunder? It spits fire and
brimstone in thy face. Its words are as drawn
swords, and as the sharp arrows of the mighty.
It demands satisfaction to the uttermost, and
cries, Justice, Justice. It speaks bloud, and war,
and wounds, and death against thee. Oh the
execrations, and plagues, and deaths, that this
murdering-piece is loaded with! (read
<hi>Deut. 28. 15, 16. &amp;c.</hi>) and thou art the
mark at which this shot is levelled. O man,
away to the strong hold, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 12. away
from thy sins: haste to the sanctuary, the City
of refuge, <hi>Heb</hi> 6. 18. even the Lord Jesus
Christ; hide thee in him, or else thou art lost
without any hope of recovery.</p>
            <p>VIII. <hi>The Gospel it self binds the sentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
condemnation upon thee. Mark</hi> 16. 16. If
thou continuest in thine impenitent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
estate, know, that the Gospel denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
a much sorer condemnation, than ever
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47965:89"/>
would have been for the transgression only o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the first covenant. Is it not a dreadful case, to
have the Gospel it self fill its mouth with threats,
and thunder, and damnation? To have the
Lord to <hi>roar from mount Sion against thee? Ioel</hi>
3. 16. Hear the terrour of the Lord: <hi>He that
believeth not shall be damned. Except ye repent, ye
shall all perish.</hi> Luke 13. 3. <hi>This is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that light is come into the world, and men
love darkness rather than light.</hi> John. 3. 19. <hi>He
that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
John 3. 36. <hi>If the word spoken by Angels was sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
and every transgression and disobedience recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a just recompence of reward: how shall we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
if we neglect so great salvation? Heb. 2. 2,
3. He that despised Moses law, died without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
Of how much sorer punishment shall he be
thought worthy, that hath trampled under foot the
son of God?</hi> Heb. 10. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi> And is it true indeed? is this
thy misery? yea 'tis as true as God is. Better
open thine eyes and see it now, while thou
maist remedy it, than blind and harden thy self,
till, to thy eternal sorrow, thou shalt feel what
thou wouldest not believe: and if it be true,
what dost thou mean to loyter, and linger in
such a case as this?</p>
            <p>Alas for thee poor man, how effectually hath
sin undone thee, and depraved thee, and despoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thee even of the reason to look after thine

thee! Oh let me knock up and awake this sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Who dwells within the walls of this flesh?
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47965:89"/>
Is there ever a soul here, a rational understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
soul? Or art thou only a walking ghost,
a senseless Iump? Art thou a reasonable soul,
and yet so far brutified, as to forget thy self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
and to think thy self to be as the beasts
that perish? Art thou turned into flesh, that
thou savourest nothing but gratifying the sense,
and making provision for the flesh? Or else ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reason to understand the eternity of thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

miserable? which is to be so much
below a brute, as it is worse to act against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than to act without it. Oh unhappy soul,
that wast the glory of man, the mate of Angels,
and the image of God! that wast Gods repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
in the world, and hadst the supremacy
amongst the creatures, and the dominion over
thy makers works! Art thou now become a
slave to sense, a servant to so base an idol, as thy

where thou shalt be for ever? Death is at hand.
<hi>The Iudge is even at the door. Iames</hi> 5. 9. Yet a
little while, and <hi>time shall be no longer. Rev.</hi> 10.
5, 6. And wilt thou run the hazard of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing

            <p>Come then, arise, and intend thy nearest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.
Tell me wither art thou going?
What, wilt thou live in such a course, wherein
every act is a step to perdition? and thou dost

not know, but the next night, thou maist make
thy bed in Hell? Oh! if thou hast a spark of
reason, consider, and turn, and hearken to thy
very friend, who would therefore shew thee thy
present misery, that thou mightest in time make
thine escape, and be eternally happy.</p>
            <p>Hear what the Lord saith; <hi>Fear ye not me
saith the Lord? Will ye not tremble at my presence?
Ier.</hi> 5. 22. Oh sinners, do you make light <hi>of the

time coming, when you will not make light of
it. Why, the very <hi>Devils do believe and tremble.
Iames</hi> 2. 19. What, you more hardened than
they? Will you run upon the edge of the rock?
will you play at the hole of the Asp? will you
put your hand upon the Cockatrice den? Will
you dance about the fire, till you are burnt? or
dally with devouring wrath, as if you were at
a point of indifferency, whether you did escape
it, or endure it? Oh madness of folly! <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
mad man, that casteth firebrands, and arrows,
and death, and faith, am I not in jest? <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.
18. is nothing so distracted as the wilful sinner,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17. that goeth on in his unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
estate without sense, as if nothing ailed him.
The man that runs on the Cannons mouth, that
sports with his blood, or lets out his life in a
frolick, is sensible, sober and serious, to him
that goeth on still in his trespasses. <hi>Psal. 68. 21.
For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and
strengtheneth himself against the ALMIGHTY.
He runneth upon him, even upon his neck, upon the
thick bosses of his buckler.</hi> Job. 15. 25, 26. Is
it wisdome to play with the second death, or to

venture into the lake that burneth with fire and

What shall I say? I can find out no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,

            <p>Awake, awake, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. oh sinner: arise and
take thy flight. There is but one door that thou
maist fly by, and that is the strait door of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

and walk in him in Holiness and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life, as the Lord liveth, it is not more
certain that thou art now out of Hell, than that
thou shalt without fail be in it, but a few days
and nights from hence. Oh set thine heart to
think of thy case: Is not thine everlasting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
or welfare, that which doth deserve a little
consideration? Look again over the miseries of
the unconverted. If the Lord hath not spoken
by me, regard me not. But if it be the very
word of God, that all this misery lies upon
thee, what a case art thou in? Is it for one that
hath his senses to live in such a condition, and
not to make all possible expedition for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the mischief; but in matters of everlasting

consequence shouldst be slight and careless, as if

to thee to have all the attributes of God enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
against thee? Canst thou do well without
his favour? Canst thou escape his hands, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
his vengeance? Dost thou hear the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
groaning under thee, and Hell groaning for
thee, and yet think thy case good enough? Art
thou in the paw of the Lion, under the power
of corruption, in the dark and noisome prison,
fetter'd with thy lusts, working out thine own
damnation, and is not this worth the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
Wilt thou make light of all the terrours of
the law, of all its curses, and thunderbolts, as
if they were but the reports of the childrens
pop-guns, or thou wert to war with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

or canst drink the envenomed cup of

Art thou such a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as that the scales of

Art thou chief of all the children of pride, even
that thou should'st count his darts as stubble,

Well, if the threats and calls of the word will
not fear thee, nor awaken thee, I am sure
death and judgment will. Oh what wilt thou
do when the Lord cometh forth against thee,
and in his fury falleth upon thee, and thou shalt
feel what thou readest? If when <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

God, and his holy Angels, to resolve
to follow them, (as far as conscience shall be

blessing that they may succeed. And as I have

to bring you to set upon turning, and making use

Were you shut up under your present misery,
without remedy, it were but mercy (as one
speaks) to let you alone, that you might take
in that little poor comfort, that you are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, here in this world. But you may yet
be happy, if you do not willfully refuse the
means of your recovery. Behold, I hold open

own murderers, and throw your selves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
when God and men cry out to you, as
<hi>Peter</hi> in another case to his Master, <hi>Spare thy

of <hi>Spain,</hi> was wickedly ravished by the King;
and hereupon exciting the Duke her Father to
revenge, he called in the Moors to his help:
who, when they had executed his design, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
wasted and spoiled the Countrey: which
this Virgin laying exceedingly to heart, shut
her self up in a Tower belonging to her Fathers
house, and desired her Father and Mother might
be called forth: and bewailing to them her
own wretchedness, that she should have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
so much misery and desolation to her
Countrey, for the satisfying of her revenge,
she told them, she was resolved to be avenged

<hi>Do thy self no harm.</hi> The Ministers of

            <p>What shall I say? would it not grieve a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

plague he should have a receipt (as one well)
that would infallibly cure all the Countrey,
and recover the most hopeless patients, and yet
his friends and neighbours should dye by the

use it? Men and brethren, though you carry
the certain symptoms of death in your faces,
yet I have a receipt that will cure you all, that
will cure infallibly. Follow but these few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and if you do not then win Heaven,

            <p>Direct. I. <hi>Set it down with thy self as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
truth, that it is impossible for thee ever to
get to Heaven, in this thine unconverted estate.</hi>
Can any other but Christ save thee? And he
tells thee he will never do it, except thou be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
and converted. <hi>Mat. 18. 3. Iohn.</hi> 3. 3.
Doth not he keep the keys of Heaven? And
canst thou get in without his leave, as thou
must, if ever thou comest thither in thy natural

condition, without a sound and through reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
            <p>Dir. II. <hi>Labour to get a thorow sight and lively
sense and feeling of thy sins.</hi> Till men are weary
and heavy laden, and pricked at the heart, and
stark sick of sin, they will not come to Christ
in his way, for ease and cure, nor to purpose
enquire, <hi>What shall we do? Mat. 11. 28. Act.
2. 37. Mat.</hi> 9. 12. They must set themselves
down for dead men, before they will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, that they may have life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40.
Labour therefore to set all thy sins in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee. Never be afraid to look upon them,
but let thy spirit make diligent search. <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.
6. Enquire into thine heart, and into thy life.
Enter into a thorow examination of thy self,
and of all thy wayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59. that thou
maist make a full discovery; and call in the help
of Gods spirit, in the sense of thine own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
hereunto: for it is his proper work to
convince of sin. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8. Spread all before
the face of thy conscience, till thine heart and
eyes be set abroach. Leave not striving with
God, and thine own soul, till it cry out under
the sense of thy sins, as the inlightened Jaylour,
<hi>What must I do to be saved? Acts</hi> 16. 30. To this
purpose</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meditate of the Numerousness of thy sins. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
heart failed when he thought of this, and
considered that he had more sins than hairs. <hi>Psal.</hi>
40. 12. This made him to cry out upon the
multitudes of Gods tender mercies. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 1.
The loathsome carcase doth not more hatefully
swarm with crawling worms, than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47965:94"/>
soul with filthy lusts. They fill the
head, the heart, the eyes and mouth of him.
Look backward, where was ever the place,
what was ever the time, in which thou didst
not sin? Look inward, what part or power
canst thou find in soul or body, but it is poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with sin? What duty dost thou ever perform,
into which this poison is not shed? Oh how
great is the sum of thy debts, who hast been all
thy life long running upon the books, and never
didst, nor canst pay off one penny? Look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the sin of thy nature, and all its cursed
brood, the sins of thy life. Call to mind thine
Omissions, Commissions, the sins of thy
thoughts, of thy words, of thine actions; the
sins of thy youth, the sins of thy years &amp;c. Be
not like a desperate bankrupt, that is afraid to
look over his books. Read the records of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
carefully, these books must be opened
sooner, or later. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meditate upon the aggravations of thy sins, as
they are the grand enemies against the God of thy
life, against the life of thy soul: in a word they are
the publick enemies of all mankind.</hi> How do
<hi>David, Ezra, Daniel</hi> and the good <hi>Levites</hi> aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their sins, from the consideration of their
injuriousness to God, their opposition to his
good and righteous Laws, the mercies, the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that they were committed against. <hi>Nehem.</hi>
9. <hi>Dan. 9. Ezra.</hi> 9. Oh the work that sin hath
made in the world! This is the enemy that

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47965:94"/>
Iohn</hi> 8. 34. this is the enemy that hath turned
the creation upside down, and sown dissension
between man and the creatures, between man
and man, yea between man and himself, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the sensitive part against the rational, will
against judgment, lust against conscience; yea
worst of all, between God and man, making
the lapsed sinner both hateful to God, and a
hater of him. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 8. O man, how canst
thou make so light of sin? This is the traitour,
that sucked the blood of the Son of God, that
sold him, that mocked him, that scourged him,
that spat in his face, that digged his hands, that
pierced his side, that pressed his soul, that
mangled his body, that never lest, till it had
bound him, condemned him, nailed him, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
him, and put him to open shame. <hi>Esay</hi>
53. 4, 5, 6. This is that deadly poison, so
powerful of operation, as that one drop of it,
shed upon the root of mankind, hath corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
spoiled, and poisoned, and undone his
whole race at once. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. This is the
common butcher, the bloody executioner,
that hath killed the Prophets, that hath burnt
the Martyrs, that hath murdered all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
all the Patriarchs, all the Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
that hath destroyed Cities, swallowed
Empires, butchered and devoured whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whatever was the weapon that 'twas
done by, sin was it that did the execution.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Dost thou yet think it but a small
thing? If <hi>Adam</hi> and all his children could be
digged out of their graves, and their bodies
piled up to Heaven, and an inquest were made,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47965:95"/>
what matchless murderer were guilty of all this
blood: it would be all found in the skirts of
sin. Study the nature of sin, till thy heart be
brought to fear and loath it. And meditate on
the aggravations of thy particular sins, how
thou hast sinned against all Gods warnings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thine own prayers, against mercies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
corrections, against clearest light, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
freest love, against thine own resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
against promises, vows, covenants of
better obedience, &amp;c. charge thy heart home
with these things, till it blush for shame, and
be brought out of all good opinion of it self.
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6.</p>

               <hi>Meditate upon the desert of sin.</hi> It cryeth up

Its due wages is death, damnation. It pulls
the curse of God upon the soul and body. <hi>Gal.</hi>

3. 8, 10. It would more affright thee, to see

pure and perfect holiness of the divine nature,
and as loathsome as that is to thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 33.
till thou art purified by the blood of Jesus, and
the power of renewing grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Above all other sins, fix the eye of Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on these two. 1. The sin of thy nature.</hi> 'Tis
to little purpose to lop off the branches, while
the root of original corruption remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.
In vain do men lave out the streams,
when the fountain is still running, that fills up

<hi>David</hi>'s) go to the root of sin. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. Study
thy natural pollution; how universal it is,
how deep, how close, how permanent it is,
till thou dost cry out with <hi>Paul</hi>'s feeling, upon
thy body of death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. Look into all

soundly broken, till throughly convinced of
the heynousness of original sin. Here fix thy
thoughts. This is that, that makes thee back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to all good, prone to all evil; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47965:96"/>
that sheds blindness, pride, prejudices, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

unfaithfulness into thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
slipperiness into thy memory, and in a
word hath put every wheel of thy soul out of
order, and made it of an habitation of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to become a very hell of iniquity. <hi>Iames</hi>
3. 6. This is that that hath defiled, corrupted,
perverted all thy members, and turned them into
weapons of unrighteousness, and servants of sin;
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. that hath filled the head with carnal

meditating on this desperate contagion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
corruption, till with <hi>Ephraim</hi> thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan

evil that thou art most addicted to. Find out
all its aggravations. Set home upon thy heart
all Gods threatnings against it. Repentance
drives before it the whole herd; but especially
sticks the arrow in the beloved sin, and singles
this out, above the rest, to run it down. <hi>Psal.</hi>
18. 23. Oh labour to make this sin odious to

            <p>Dir. III. <hi>Strive to affect thy heart with a deep

Chapter again and again, and get it out
of the book into thine heart. Remember when
thou liest down, that for ought thou knowest,
thou maist awake in flames, and when thou
risest up, that by the next night thou maist
make thy bed in hell. Is it a jesting matter to
live in such a fearful case? to stand tottering
upon the brink of the bottomless pit, and to
live at the mercy of every disease, that if it
will but fall upon thee, will send thee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
into the burnings? Suppose thou sawest a

                  </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>'s
burning fiery furnace by nothing but a
twine thread, which were ready to break every
moment: would not thine heart tremble for
such a one? Why, thou art the man. This is
thy very case, O man, woman, that readest this,
if thou be yet unconverted. What if the thred
of thy life should break? (Why, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not but it may be the next night, yea the
next moment) where wouldst thou be then?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47965:97"/>
whither wouldst thou drop? verily, upon the
crack but of this thred, thou fallest into the
lake, that burneth with fire and brimstone,
where thou must lie scalding and sweltring in a
fiery ocean, while God hath a being, if thou
die in thy present case. And doth not thy soul
tremble as thou readest? Do not thy tears bedew
the paper, and thy heart throb in thy bosom?
Dost thou not yet begin to smite on thy breast,
and bethink thy self, what need thou hast of a
change? Oh what is thy heart made of! Hast
thou not only lost all regard to God, but art
without any love and pity to thy self?</p>
            <p>Oh study thy misery, till thy heart do cry
out for Christ, as earnestly, as ever a drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man did for a boat, or the wounded for a
Chirurgeon. Men must come to see the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and feel the smart of their deadly sores and
sickness, or else Christ will be to them a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
of no value. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 12. Then the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayer
hastens to the City of refuge, when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by the avenger of blood. Men must be
even forced, and fired out of themselves, or
else they will not come to Christ. 'Twas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
and extremity, that made the prodigal
think of returning. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 16, 17. While
<hi>Laodicea</hi> thinks her self rich, increased in
goods, in need of nothing, there is little hope.
She must be deeply convinced of her wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
blindness, poverty, nakedness, before she
will come to Christ for his gold, raiment, eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Therefore hold the eyes
of conscience open, amplify thy misery, as
much as possible. Do not fly the sight of it, for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47965:97"/>
fear it should fill thee with terrour. The sense
of thy misery is but, as it were, the suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wound, which is necessary to the
cure. Better fear the torments that abide thee
now, than feel them hereafter.</p>
            <p>Dir. IV. <hi>Settle it upon thine heart, that thou
art under an everlasting inability ever to recover thy
self.</hi> Never think thy praying, reading, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
confessing, amending will do the cure.
These must be attended; but thou art undone
if thou restest in them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. Thou art
a lost man, if thou hopest to escape drowning
upon any other plank, but Jesus Christ. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.
12. Thou must unlearn thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf, and renounce
thine own wisdom, thine own righteousness,
thine own strength, and throw thy self wholly
upon Christ, as a man that swimmeth casteth
himself upon the water, or else thou canst not
escape. While men trust in themselves, and
establish their own righteousness, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the flesh, they will not come savingly
to Christ. <hi>Luke 18. 19. Phil.</hi> 3. 3. Thou must
know thy gain to be but loss and dung, thy
strength but weakness, thy righteousness rags
and rottenness, before there will be an effectual
closure between Christ and thee. <hi>Phil. 3. 7, 8, 9.
2 Cor. 3. 5. Esay</hi> 64. 6. Can the liveless car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
shake off his grave-cloths, and loose the
bonds of death? Then maist thou recover thy
self, who art dead in trespasses, and sins, and
under an impossibility of serving thy maker
(acceptably) in this condition. <hi>Rom. 8. 8. Heb.</hi>
11. 6. Therefore, when thou goest to pray, or
meditate, or to do any of the duties, to which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47965:98"/>
thou art here directed; go out of thy self, call
in the help of the spirit, as despairing to do any
thing pleasing to God, in thine own strength.
Yet neglect not thy duty, but lie at the pool,
and wait in the way of the spirit. While the
<hi>Eunuch</hi> was reading, then the Holy-Ghost
sent <hi>Philip</hi> to him. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 28, 29. When the
disciples were praying, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 31. when <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
and his friends were hearing, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.
44. then the Holy-Ghost fell upon them and
filled them all. Strive to give up thy self to
Christ. Strive to pray, strive to meditate,
strive an hundred and an hundred times, try to
do it as well as thou canst, and while thou art
endeavouring in the way of thy duty, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord will come upon thee, and help
thee to do, what of thy self thou art utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>Dir. V. <hi>Forthwith renounce all thy sins.</hi> If
thou yield thy self to the ordinary practice of
any sin, thou art undone. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. In vain
dost thou hope for life by Christ, except thou
depart from iniquity. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. Forsake
thy sins, or else thou canst not find mercy.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. Thou canst not be married to
Christ, except divorced from sin. Give up the
traitour or you can have no peace with Heaven.
Cast the head of <hi>Sheba</hi> over the wall. Keep
not <hi>Dalilah</hi> in thy lap. Thou must part with
thy sins, or with thy soul. Spare but one sin,
and God will not spare thee. Never make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses:
thy sins must die, or thou must die for
them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 21. If thou allow of one sin,
though but a little, a secret one, though thou
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47965:98"/>
maist plead necessity, and have a hundred shifts
and excuses for it, the life of thy soul must go
for the life of that sin; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. and will
it not be dearly bought?</p>
            <p>O sinner, hear and consider. If thou wilt
part with thy sins, God will give thee his Christ:
is not this a fair exchange? I testify unto thee
this day, that if thou perish, it is not because
there was never a Saviour provided, nor life
tendered: but because thou preferredst (with
the Jews) the murderer before a Saviour,
sin before Christ, and lovedst darkness rather
than light. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 19. Search thy heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with candles, as the Jews did their houses
for leaven, before the passeover: labour to
find out thy sins. Enter into thy closet, and
consider, What evil have I lived in? what duty
have I neglected towards God? what sin have
I lived in against my brother? and now strike
the darts through the heart of thy sin, as <hi>Ioab</hi>
did through <hi>Absalom</hi>'s. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 14. Never
stand looking upon thy sin, nor rolling the
morsel under thy tongue: <hi>Iob</hi> 20. 12. but
spit it out as poison, with fear and detestation.
Alas, what will thy sins do for thee, that thou
shouldst stick at parting with them? They will
flatter thee, but they will undo thee, and cut
thy throat while they smile upon thee, and
poison thee while they please thee, and arm the
justice and wrath of the infinite God against
thee. They will open hell for thee, and pile up
fuel to burn thee. Behold the gibbet that they
have prepared for thee. Oh serve them like
<hi>Haman,</hi> and do upon them the execution,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47965:99"/>
they would else have done upon thee. Away
with them, crucify them, and let Christ only be
Lord over thee.</p>
            <p>Dir. VI. <hi>Make a solemn choice of God for thy
portion and blessedness. Deut.</hi> 26. 17. With all
possible devotion and veneration avouch the
Lord for thy God. Set the world with all its
glory, and paint, and gallantry, with all its
pleasures and promotions on the one hand, and
set God with all his infinite excellencies and
perfections on the other, and see that thou do
deliberately make thy choice. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24. 15.
Take up thy rest in God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 68. Set thee
down under his shadow. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. Let his
promises and perfections turn the scale against
all the world. Settle it upon thy heart, that
the Lord is an all-sufficient portion, that thou
canst not be miserable, while thou hast a God
to live upon. Take him for thy shield and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great reward. God alone is more than
all the world. Content thy self with him.
Let others carry the preferments and glory of
the world, place thou thy happiness in his
favour, and the light of his countenance. <hi>Psal.</hi>
4. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Poor sinner, thou art fallen off from God, and
hast engaged his power, and wrath against
thee. Yet know that of his abundant grace,
he doth offer to be thy God again in Christ.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. What sayest thou man? Wilt
thou have the Lord for thy God? Why, take
this counsel, and thou shalt have him. Come
to him by his Christ. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. Renounce the
idols of thine own pleasure, gain, reputation:

1 Thess. 1. 9. <hi>let these be pulled out of the

not endure to have any set above him;</hi> Rom. 1.
25. Psal. 73. 25. <hi>In a word, thou must take

I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy

since of thy wonderful mercy, thou art pleased to

devil to be thy child, I solemnly take thee for my
father, I commend my self to thy care, and trust
to thy providence, and cast my burden on thy shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
I depend on thy provision, and submit to thy
correction, and trust under the shadow of thy wings,

               </gap> I repose my confidence in thee,
I depose my concernments with thee. I will be for
thee, and for no other. <hi>Again, God the Son

and righteousness.</hi> Iohn 1. 2. <hi>He must be

send a bill of divorce to my other lovers: I give my
heart to thee. I will be thine undividedly, thine

everlastingly. I will set thy name on all I have, and
use it only as thy goods, as thy loan, during thy

thine inheritance.</hi> Rom. 8. 26. Psal. 73. 24.
Iohn 14. 16. Eph. 1. 14. Iohn 14. 26. Eph. 4.
30. Awake thou Northwind, and come thou

Come thou Spirit of the most high; here is a house

rest for ever; dwell here, and rule here. Loe I give
up the possession to thee, full possession. I send thee
the keys of my heart, that all may be for thy use,
that thou maist put thy goods, thy graces into every

            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:47965:100"/>Secondly, <hi>In all his essential perfections.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how the Lord hath revealed himself to
you in his word: will you take him as such a
God? O sinner, here's the blessedst news that
ever came to the sons of men. The Lord will
be thy God, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Rev</hi> 21. 3. if thou
will but close with him in his excellencies. Wilt
thou have the merciful, the gracious, the sin-pardoning
God, to be thy God? O yes (saith
the sinner) I am undone else. But he further
tells thee, I am the holy, and sin-hating God.
If thou wilt be owned as one of my people,
thou must be holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. holy in heart,
holy in life. Thou must put away all thine
iniquities, be they never so near, never so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
never so necessary to the maintaining
thy fleshly interest. Unless thou will be at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
with sin, I cannot be thy God. Cast out
the leaven: put away the evil of thy doings:
cease to do evil: learn to do well, or else I can
have nothing to do with thee. <hi>Esay</hi> 1.
16, 17, 18. Bring forth mine enemies, or there
is no peace to be had with me. What doth
thine heart answer? <hi>Lord, I desire to have thee
as such a God. I desire to be holy, as thou are
holy, to be made partaker of thy holiness. I love
thee, not only for thy goodness and mercy, but for
thy holiness and thy purity. I take thy holiness for
my happiness. Oh! be to me a fountain of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
set on me the stamp and impress of thy holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I will thankfully part with all my sins a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
thy command. My willful sins I do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
forsake; and for my infirmities, that I
cannot get rid of, though I would; I will strive
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47965:101"/>
against them, in the use of thy means. I detest
them, and will pray and war against them, and
never let them have quiet rest in my soul.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
whosoever of you will thus accept the
Lord for his God, he shall have him.</p>
            <p>Again, he tells you; I am the All-sufficient
God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Will you lay all at my feet,
and give it up to my dispose, and take me for
your only portion? Will you own and honour
mine All-sufficiency? Will you take me as your
happiness and treasure, your hope and bliss?
I am a Sun and shield, all in one: will you
have me for your All? 1 <hi>Gen. 15. Psal.</hi> 84. 11.
Now what dost thou say to this? Doth thy
mouth water after the Onions and Flesh-pots
of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Art thou loth to exchange thy
earthly happiness, for a part in God: and
though thou wouldst be glad to have God and
the world too, yet thou canst not think of
having him, and nothing but him, but hadst
rather take up with the earth below, if God
would but let thee keep it, as long as thou
wouldst? This is a fearful sign. But now if
thou art willing to fell all for the pearl of
great price; <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46. if thine heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Lord, I desire no other portion but thee. Take
the corn, and the wine, and the oyl whose will, so
I may have the light of thy countenance. I pitch
upon thee for my happiness. I gladly venture my
self on thee, and trust my self with thee. I set my
hopes in thee; I take up my rest with thee. Let
me hear thee say, I am thy God, thy salvation,
and I have enough, all I wish for. I will make no
terms with thee, but for thy self. Let me but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47965:101"/>
have thee sure, let me be able to make my claim,
and see my title to thy self; and for other things,
I leave them to thee. Give me more, or less, any
thing, or nothing, I will be satisfied in my God.</hi>
Take him thus, and he is thine own.</p>
            <p>Again, he tells you; I am the Soveraign
Lord. If you will have me for your God, you
must give me the Supremacy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. I
will not be an underling. You must not make
me a second to sin, or any wordly interest. If
you will be my people, I must have the rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you. You must not live at your own list,
will you come under my yoke? Will you bow
to my government? Will you submit to my
discipline, to my word, to my rod? Sinner,
what sayst thou to this? <hi>Lord I had rather be at
thy command, than live at mine own list. I had
rather have thy will to be done, than mine. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of and consent to thy laws, and account it my
priviledge to live under them. And though the flesh
rebel, and often break over bounds, I am resolved to
take no other Lord but thee. I willingly take the oath
of thy supremacy, and acknowledge thee for my leige
Soveraign, and resolve all my days to pay the tribute
of worship, obedience, and love, and service to thee,
and to live to thee as the end of my life.</hi> This is a
right accepting of God.</p>
            <p>To be short, he tells you; I am the true and
faithful God. If you will have me for your God,
you must be content to trust me. 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 12. Prov.</hi>
3. 5. Will you venture your selves upon my word,
and depend on my faithfulness, and take my
bond for your security? Will you be content to
follow me, in poverty, and reproach, &amp; affliction
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47965:102"/>
here, and to see much going out, and little
coming in, and to tarry till the next world for
your preferment? <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21. I deal much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trust, will you be content to labour, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and to tarry for your returns, till the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the just? <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 14. The womb
of my promise will not presently bring forth;
will you have the patience to wait? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
36. Now beloved, what say you to this? Will
you have this God for your God? Will you be
content to live by faith, and trust him for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
happiness, an unseen Heaven, an unseen
glory? Do your hearts answer, <hi>Lord, we will
venture our souls upon thee, we commit our selves
to thee: we roll upon thee, we know whom we have
trusted: we are willing to take thy word: we will
prefer thy promises, before our own possessions; and
the hopes of Heaven, before all the enjoyments of
the earth. We will wait thy leisure. What thou
wilt here, so that we may have but thy faithful
promise for Heaven hereafter?</hi> If you can in truth,
and upon deliberation, thus accept of God,
he will be yours. Thus there must be, in a
right Conversion to God, a closing with him
suitable to his excellencies. But when men
close with his mercy, but not with his sin-hating
holiness and purity; or will take him for
their benefactor, but not for their Soveraign;
or for their Patron, but not for their portion,
this is no thorow, and so no sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
            <p>Dir. VII. <hi>Accept of the Lord Iesus, in all his
offices, with all his inconveniences, as thine.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these terms Christ may be had. Sinner,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47965:102"/>
thou hast undone thy self, and art plunged into
the ditch of most deplorable misery out of
which thou art never able to climb up. But
Jesus Christ is able and ready to help thee, and
he freely tenders himself to thee. <hi>Heb. 7. 25.
Iohn</hi> 7. 37. Be thy sins never so many, never
so great, of never so long continuance, yet
thou shalt be most certainly pardoned and saved,
if thou dost not wretchedly neglect the offer,
that in the name of God is here made unto
thee. The Lord Jesus calleth to thee, to look
unto him and be saved, <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 22. to come
unto him, and he will in no wise cast thee out.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. Yea he is a suiter to thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth
thee to be reconciled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.
he cryeth in the streets, he knocketh at thy
door, he wooeth thee to accept of him, and
life with him: <hi>Prov. 1. 20. Rev.</hi> 3. 20. if thou
diest, 'tis because thou wouldst not come to
him for life. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. Now accept of an
offered Christ, and thou art made for ever.
Now give up thy consent to him, and the
match is made, all the world cannot hinder it.
Do not stand off because of thine unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Man, I tell thee, nothing in all the
world can undo thee, but thine unwillingness.
Speak man, art thou willing of the match?
Wilt thou have Christ in all his relations to be
thine, thy King, thy Priest, thy Prophet? Wilt
thou have him with all his inconveniences?
Take not Christ hand over head: but sit down
first, and count thy cost. Wilt thou lay all at
his feet? Wilt thou be content to run all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
with him? Wilt thou take thy lot with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47965:103"/>
him, fall where it will? Wilt thou deny thy
self, take up thy Cross, and follow him? Art
thou deliberately, understandingly, freely, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
detetermined to cleave to him in all times,
and conditions? If so, my soul for thine, thou
shalt never perish, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. but art passed
from death to life. Here lies the main point
of thy salvation, that thou be sound in thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-closure
with Jesus Christ, and therefore
if thou love thy life, see that thou be faithful
to God and thy soul here.</p>
            <p>Dir. VIII. <hi>Resign up all thy powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and thy whole interest to be his. They gave their
own selves unto the Lord. 2 Cor. 8. 5. Present your
bodies as a living Sacrifice. Rom.</hi> 12. 1. The
Lord seeks not yours, but you. Resign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy body with all its members to him, and
thy soul with all its powers, that he may be
glorified in thy body and in thy spirit, which
are his. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. In a right closure with
Christ, all the faculties give up to him: The
Judgment subscribes, <hi>Lord thou art worthy of all
acceptation, chief of ten thousand. Happy is the
man, that findeth thee. All the things that are to
be desired, are not to be compared with thee. Prov.</hi>
3. 13, 14, 15. The Understanding lays aside its
corrupt reasonings and cavils, and its preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
against Christ and his ways. It is now past
questioning and disputing, and casts it for
Christ against all the world. It concludes, it's
good to be here, and sees such a treasure in this
field, such value in this pearl, as is worth all.
<hi>Mat. 13. 44. Oh here's the richest bargain that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> here's the richest prize that ever man
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47965:103"/>
was offered: here's the soveraignst remedy that ever
mercy prepared: he is worthy of my esteem, worthy
of my choice, worthy of my love, worthy to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
adored, admired for ever more. Rev. 5. 12.
I approve of his articles: his terms are righteous
and reasonable, full of equity and mercy.</hi> Again,
the Will resigns. It stands no longer waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor wishing, and woulding, but is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
determin'd. <hi>Lord, thy love hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
me thou hast won me, and thou shalt have
me. Come in Lord, to thee I freely open. I consent to
be saved in thine own way, thou shalt have any
thing, thou shalt have all, let me have but thee.</hi>
The Memory gives up to Christ: <hi>Lord, here is
a store-house for thee. Out with this trash; lay
in thy treasure. Let me be a granary, a reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of thy truths, thy promises, thy providences.</hi>
The Conscience comes in; <hi>Lord, I will ever side
with thee. I will be thy faithful register. I will
warn when the sinner is tempted, and smite when
thou art offended. I will witness for thee, and
judge for thee, and guide into thy ways, and will
never let sin have quiet in this soul.</hi> The Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also come in to Christ. O saith Love, <hi>I am
sick for thee.</hi> O saith Desire, <hi>now I have my long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Here's the satisfaction I sought for. Here's
the desire of nations. Here's bread for me, and
balm for me, all that I want.</hi> Fear bows the knee
with aw and veneration; <hi>Welcome Lord: to thee
will I pay my homage. Thy word and thy rod shall
command my motions. Thee will I reverence and
adore, before thee will I fall down and worship</hi>-Grief
likewise puts in, <hi>Lord thy displeasure and thy
dishonour, thy peoples calamities, and mine own
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47965:104"/>
iniquities shall be that, that shall set me abroach.
I will mourn when thou art offended, I will weep
when thy cause is mounded.</hi> Anger likewise comes
in for Christ: <hi>Lord nothing so enrages me, as my
folly against thee, that I should be so befooled and
bewitched, as to hearken to the flatteries of sin, and
temptations of Satan against thee.</hi> Hatred too will
side with Christ. <hi>I protest mortal enmity with
thine enemies, that I will never be friends with thy
foes. I vow an immortal quarrel with every sin. I
will give no quarter, I will make no peace.</hi> Thus
let all thy powers give up to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Again, thou must give up thy whole interest
to him. If there be any thing, that thou keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
back from Christ, it will be thine undoing.
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. Unless thou wilt forsake all (in
preparation and resolution of thy heart) thou
canst not be his disciple. Thou must hate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, yea and thine own life also in

competition with him. <hi>Mat. 10. 37. Luke 14.
26, 27, 28, &amp;c.</hi> In a word, thou must give

            <p>Dir. IX. <hi>Make choice of the Laws of Christ as
the rule of thy words, thoughts and actions. Psal.</hi>
119. 30. This is the true Converts choice. But
here remember these three rules. 1. <hi>Thou must
choose them all.</hi> There is no coming to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by a partial obedience. Read <hi>Psal. 119. 6,
128, 160. Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. None may think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to take up with the cheap and easie part
of religion, and let alone the duties that are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47965:104"/>
costly, and self-denying, and grate upon the
interest of the flesh. You must take all, or none.
A sincere Convert, though he makes most
conscience of the greatest sins, and weightiest
duties; yet he makes true conscience of little
sins, and of all duties. <hi>Psal. 119. 6, 113. Mat.
23. 23. 2. For all times,</hi> for prosperity, and
for adversity; whether it rain, or shine. A
true Convert is resolved in his way: he will
stand to his choice, and will not set his back to
the wind, and be of the religion of the times.
<hi>I have stuck to thy testimonies. I have enclined
my heart to perform thy statutes alway, even to the
end. Thy testimonies have I taken, as an heritage
for ever. Psal. 119. 31, 111, 117, 44, 93. I will
have respect unto thy statutes continually. 3. This
must be done, not hand over head, but deliberately
and understandingly.</hi> That disobedient son said,
<hi>I go sir, but he went not. Mat.</hi> 24. 30. How
fairly did they promise: <hi>All that the Lord our
God shall speak unto thee, we will do it;</hi> and
it's like they spake as they meant, but when it
came to tryal, it was found that there was
not such a heart in them, as to do what they
had promised. <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

and compass of them.</hi> Remember, that
they are very spiritual: they reach the very
thoughts, and inclinations of the heart; so that
if you will walk by this rule, your very

and self-denying, quite contrary to the grain of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47965:105"/>
your natural inclinations. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. You

that they are very large: for <hi>the commandment

not in generals,</hi> (for there's much deceit in that)
<hi>but bring down thy heart to the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ.</hi> Those Jews in the Prophet
seemed as well resolved as any in the world,
and call God to witness, that they meant, as

This is the way to be sound in Gods sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,

What sayst thou to thy bosom sin, thy gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

            <p>First, set apart some time, more than once to

            <p n="1">1. In seeking earnestly his special assistance, and

            <p n="2">2. In considering distinctly all the terms or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Covenant, expressed in the form here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

            <p n="3">3. In searching thine heart, whether thou art
sincerely willing to forsake all thy sins, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
up thy self, body and soul unto God, and his
service, to serve him in holiness and righteousness
all the days of thy life.</p>
            <p>

serious frame possible, suitable to a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
of so high importance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Lay hold on the Covenant of God,
and rely upon his promise of giving grace and
strength, whereby thou maist be enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
thy promise. Trust not to thine own

Covenanting with Thee, not to allow
my self in any known Sin, but Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
to use all the means that I know
thou hast prescribed, for the Death and
utter Destruction of all my Corruptions.
And whereas I have formerly inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
and idolatrously let out my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

Grace from Thee, that when thou

my resolution through thy Assistance,
to forsake all that is dear unto me in this

the ways of sin; and that I will watch
against all its Temptations, whether of
Prosperity, or Adversity, lest they
should withdraw my Heart from thee:
beseeching thee also to help me against
the Temptations of Satan, to whose
wicked Suggestions I resolve by thy

wretched, and miserable, and blind,
and naked, a most loathsome polluted
wretch, a guilty condemned Malefactor,
unworthy for ever to wash the feet of
the servants of my Lord, much more
to be solemnly married to the King of

Head and Husband, for better, for
worse, for richer, for poorer, for all
times and conditions, to love, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and obey thee before all others,
and this to the death. I embrace thee
in all thine Offices: I renounce mine

to be the Lord my Righteousness: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
mine own wisdom, and do here
take thee for mine only Guide: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
mine own will, and take thy

               <p>And since thou hast told me that I
must suffer if I will reign, I do here
Covenant with thee to take my lot, as
it falls, with thee, and by thy Crace
assisting to run all hazards with thee,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47965:108"/>
verily supposing that neither life nor

               <p>And because thou hast

I do here willingly put my Neck under

burden; and subscribing to all thy Laws,
as holy, just, and good, I solemnly take
them as the rule of my words, thoughts,
and actions; promising that though my
flesh contradict and rebel, yet I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to order and govern my whole

will not allow my self in the neglect of
any thing that I know to be my Duty.</p>
               <p>Only because through the frailty of
my flesh, I am subject to many failings;
I am bold humbly to protest, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
miscarriages, contrary to the
setled bent and resolution of my heart,
shall not make void this Covenant, for
so thou hast said.</p>
               <p>Now Almighty God, searcher of
hearts, thou knowest that I make this

aright.</p>
               <p>And now Glory be to thee, O God the
Father, whom I shall be bold from this
day forward, to look upon as my God
and Father; that ever thou shouldest
find out such a way for the recovery of
undone sinners: Glory be to thee, O
God the Son, who hast loved me and
washed me from my sins in thine own

Thou wilt never be turned from sin, till thou

               <p>I never expect thy Conversion from sin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
thou art brought to so much self-denial, as
to fly the occasions. If thou wilt be nibling at

men in his providence, unavoidably, to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
and the occasions are such as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remove, we may expect special assistance in
the use of his means. But when we tempt God
by running into danger, he will not engage to
support us, when we are tempted. And of all
temptations, one of the most fatal and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
is evil company. Oh what hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
have these often stifled! Oh the souls,

if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. If they say,
come with us: cast in thy lot among us: Walk
not thou in the way with them, refrain thy foot
from their path. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn
from it, and pass away. For the way of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

Oh! fly them as you would those that had the

words, and actions, that have flown from thence!
Oh the load of guilt that is on my soul! my
head is full, and my heart full; my mind and
my members, they are all full of sin. Oh my
sins! How do they stare upon me! How do
they witness against me! Wo is me, my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
are upon me: every commandment ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
hold upon me, for more than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
talents, yea ten thousand times ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
How endless then is the summe of all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47965:113"/>
my debts! If this whole world were filled up
from earth to Heaven with paper, and all this
paper written over within and without by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians:
yet, when all were cast up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it would come unconceivably short, of
what I owe to the least of Gods commandments.
Wo unto me, for my debts are infinite, and my
sins are increased. They are wrongs to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Majesty: and if he that committeth trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against a silken mortal, is worthy to be
racked, drawn, and quartered: what have I
deserved, that have so often lifted up my hand
against Heaven, and have struck at the Crown
and dignity of the Almighty?</p>
               <p>Oh my sins! my sins! Behold a troop com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Multitudes! multitudes! there is no
number of their Armies. Innumerable evils
have compassed me about; mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me; they have set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in array against me. Oh! it were better
to have all the Regiments of Hell come against
me, than to have my sins to fall upon me, to
the spoiling of my Soul. Lord, how am I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded!
How many are they that rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me! They have beset me behind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
they swarm within me and without me:
they have possessed all my powers, and have
fortified mine unhappy soul, as a Garrison,
which this brood of Hell doth man, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
against the God that made me.</p>
               <p>And they are as mighty, as they be many.
The sands are many, but then they are not
great: the mountains great but then they are
not many. But wo is me, my sins are as many
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47965:114"/>
as the sands, and as mighty as the Mountains.
Their weight is greater than their number. It
were better, that the Rocks, and the mountains
should fall upon me, than the crushing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
load of my own sins. Lord, I am
heavy laden: let mercy help, or I am gone.
Unload me of this heavy guilt, this sinking load,
or I am crushed without hope, and must be
pressed down to Hell. If my grief were
thorowly weighed, and my sins laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances
together, they would be heavier than
the sand of the Sea, therefore my words are
swallowed up: they would weigh down all the
rocks, and the hills, and turn the ballance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the Isles of the Earth. O Lord, thou
knowest my manifold transgressions, and my
mighty sins.</p>
               <p>Ah my soul! Alas my Glory! Whither art
thou humbled! Once the Glory of the creation,
and the Image of God: now, a lump of
filthiness, a Coffin of rottenness, replenished
with stench and loathsomeness. Oh what work
hath sin made with thee! Thou shalt be termed
<hi>Forsaken,</hi> and all the rooms of thy faculties <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,</hi>
and the name that thou shalt be called by
is <hi>Ichabed,</hi> or Where is the Glory? How art
thou come down mightily! My beauty is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into deformity, and my Glory into shame.
Lord, what a loathsome Leper am I! The ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous
bodies of <hi>Iob</hi> or <hi>Lazarus</hi> were not more
offensive to the eyes and nostrils of men, than I
must needs be to the most holy God, whose eyes
cannot behold iniquity.</p>
               <p>And what misery have my sins brought upon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47965:114"/>
me! Lord, what a case am I in! Sold under
sin, cast out of Gods favour, accursed from the
Lord, cursed in my body, cursed in my soul,
cursed in my name, in my estate, my relations,
and all that I have. My sins are unpardoned,
and my soul within a step of death. Alas! what
shall I do? Whither shall I go? Which way shall
I look? God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rowning on me from above;
Hell gaping for me beneath; Conscience smiting
me within, temptations and dangers surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me without. Oh, whither shall I fly?
What place can hide me from Omnisciency?
What power can secure me from Omnipotency?</p>
               <p>What meanest thou O my soul to go on thus?
Art thou in league with Hell? hast thou made a
covenant with death? Art thou in love with thy
misery? Is it good for thee to be here? Alas, what
shall I do! Shall I go on in my sinful ways? Why
then certain damnation will be mine end: &amp; shall
I be so besotted and bemadded, as to go and sell
my soul to the flames, for a little Ale, or a little
ease; for a little pleasure, or gain, or content
to my flesh? Shall I linger any longer in this
wretched estate? No: if I tarry here, I shall
dye. What then, is there no help? no hope?
None, except I turn. Why, but is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for such woful misery? any mercy, after
such provoking iniquity? Yes: as sure as Gods
Oath is true, I shall have pardon, and mercy,
yet, if I presently, unfeignedly, and unreser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
turn by Christ to him.</p>
               <p>Why then I thank thee upon the bended knees
of my soul, O most merciful <hi>Iehovah,</hi> that thy
patience hath wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47965:115"/>
thou took me away in this estate, I had perished
for ever. And now I adore thy Grace, and
accept the offers of thy mercy. I renounce all
my sins, and resolve by thy Grace to set my self
against them, and to follow thee in holiness and
righteousness all the days of my life.</p>
               <p>Who am I, Lord, that I should make any
claim to thee, or have any part or portion in
thee, who am not worthy to lick up the dust of
thy feet? Yet since thou holdest forth the golden
Scepter, I am bold to come, and touch. To
despair, would be to disparage thy mercy; and
to stand off, when thou biddest me come, would
be at once, to undo my self, and rebel against
thee, under pretence of humility. Therefore I
bow my soul unto thee, and with all possible
thankfulness accept thee, as mine, and give up
my self to thee, as thine. Thou shalt be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
over me, my King, and my God. Thou
shalt be in the Throne, and all my powers shall
bow to thee, they shall come, and worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy feet. Thou shalt be my portion, O Lord,
and I will rest in thee.</p>
               <p>Thou callest for my heart. Oh that it were
any way fit for thine acceptance! I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
O Lord, everlastingly unworthy to be thine.
But since thou wilt have it so, I freely give up
my heart to thee. Take it, it is thine. Oh that
it were better! But Lord, I put it into thy hands,
who alone canst mend it. Mould it after thine
own heart; make it as thou wouldst have it, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
humble, heavenly, soft, tender, flexible, and
write thy law upon it.</p>
               <p>Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly: enter in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47965:115"/>
triumphantly: take me up for thy self for ever.
I give up to thee, I come to thee, as the only
way to the Father, as the only Mediator, the
means ordained to bring me to God. I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
my self, but in thee is my help. Save,
Lord, or else I perish. I come to thee, with the
rope about my neck. I am worthy to dye, and
to be damned. Never was the hire more due to
the servant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> never was penny more due to the
labourer, than death and Hell, my just wages,
is due to me for my sins. But I fly to thy merits;
I trust alone to the value and virtue of thy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and prevalency of thine intercession. I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to thy teaching, I make choice of thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Stand open ye everlasting doors, that
the King of Glory may enter in.</p>
               <p>O thou spirit of the most high, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and sanctifier of thy chosen; come in with
all thy glorious train, all thy Courtly attendants,
thy fruits, and Graces. Let me be thine habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
I can give thee, but what is thine own
already: but here with the poor Widdow, I
cast my two mites, my soul, and my body, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy treasury; fully resigning them up to thee,
to be sanctified by thee to be servants to thee.
They shall be thy patients; cure thou their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies:
they shall be thy agents; govern thou
their motions. Too long have I served the world;
too long have I hearkened to Satan: but now I
renounce them all, and will be ruled by thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
and directions, and guided by thy counsel.</p>
               <p>O blessed Trinity, O glorious Unity, I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up my self to thee: receive me: write thy
name, O Lord, upon me, and upon all that I
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47965:116"/>
have, as thy proper goods. Set thy mark upon
me, upon every member of my body, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faculty of my soul. I have chosen thy precepts.
Thy law will I lay before me: this shall be the
copy, which I will keep in my eye, and study to
write after. According to this rule do I resolve,
by thy Grace, to walk: after this law shall my
whole man be governed. And though I cannot
perfectly keep one of thy Commandments, yet
I will allow my self in the breach of none. I
know my flesh will hang back: but I resolve, in
the power of thy Grace, to cleave to thee, and
thy holy ways, whatever it cost me. I am sure
I cannot come off a loser by thee: and therefore
I will be content with reproach, and difficulties
and hardships here, and will deny my self, and
take up my Cross, and follow thee. Lord Jesus
thy Yoke is easie, thy Cross is welcome, as it is
the way to thee. I lay aside all hopes of a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happiness. I will be content to tarry, till I
come to thee. Let me be poor, and low, little
and despised here, so I may be but admitted to
live, and reign with thee hereafter. Lord, thou
hast my heart and hand to this agreement. Be it
as the laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> never to
be reversed. To this I will stand: in this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,

Conversion unto God: yet knowing what a

the heart of man naturally is, I have
thought it necessary, to add to the means of
Conversion, and Directions for a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure
with God in Christ, some <hi>Motives</hi> to
perswade you hereunto.</p>
            <p>O Lord, fail me not now at my last attempts. If
any soul hath read hitherto, and be yet untouched,
now Lord fasten in him, and do thy work: Now
take him by the heart, overcome him, perswade
him, till he say, Thou hast prevailed, for thou
wast stronger than I. Lord, didst not thou make
me a fisher of men? And have I toyled all this
while, and caught nothing? Alas, that I should
have spent my strength for nought! And now I
am casting my last: Lord Iesus, stand thou upon
the shore, and direct, how, and where I shall spread
my net; and let me so enclose with arguments the
souls I seek for, that they may not be able to get
out. Now Lord for a multitude of souls! now
for a full draught! O Lord God, remember me I
pray thee, and strengthen me this once, O God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:47965:117"/>But I turn me unto you.</p>
            <p>Men, and Brethren, Heaven and earth do
call upon you, yea hell it self doth preach the
doctrine of repentance unto you. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of the Churches travel with you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.
the Angels of Heaven wait for you, for your
repenting and turning unto God. O sinner, why
should the devils make merry with thee? Why
shouldst thou be a morsel for that devouring
<hi>Leviathan?</hi> Why should harpies and hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds
tear thee, and make a feast upon thee,
and when they have got thee into the snare,
and have fastened their talons in thee, laugh at
thy destruction, and deride thy misery, and
sport themselves with thy damnable folly? This
must be thy case, except thou turn. And were
it not better thou shouldst be a joy to Angels,
than a laughing-stock and sport for devils? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
if thou wouldst but come in, the Heavenly
Host would take up their anthems, and sing,
<hi>Glory be to God in the highest;</hi> the morning Stars
would sing together, and all the sons of God
shout for joy, and celebrate this new creation as
they did the first. Thy repentance would as it
were make holy-day in heaven, and the glorious
spirits would rejoyce, in that there is a new bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
added to their society, <hi>Re.</hi> 22. 9. another heir
born to their Lord and the lost son received safe
and sound. The true penitents tears are indeed
the wine that cheereth, both God, and man.</p>
            <p>If it be little, that men and Angels would
rejoyce at thy Conversion, know that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would rejoyce over thee, even with sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and rest in his love. <hi>Luke 15. 9. Esay</hi> 62. 5.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47965:117"/>
Never did old <hi>Iacob</hi> with such joy weep over
the neck of his <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as thy heavenly Father
would rejoyce over thee, upon thy coming in
to him. Look over the story of the <hi>Prodigal.</hi>
Methinks I see how the aged Father laies aside
his state, and forgets his years: behold how
he runneth! <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 20. Oh the hast that
mercy makes! The sinner makes not half that
speed. Methinks I see how his bowels turn,
how his compassions yern. (How quick-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is love!) Mercy spies him a great way off,
forgets his riotous courses, unnatural rebellion,
horrid unthankfulness, debauched practices,
(not a word of these) but receives him with
open arms, clasps about his neck, forgets the
nastiness of his rags, kisses the lips that deserve
to be loathed, the lips that had been joined to
harlots, that had been commoners with the
swine, calls for the fatted calf, the best robe,
the ring, the shooes, the best cheer in Heavens
store, the best attire in Heavens wardrobe, &amp;c.
yea the joy cannot be held in one breast; <hi>Luke</hi>
15. 6, 9, 23. others must be called to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
the friends must meet and make merry.
Angels must wait, but the <hi>Prodigal</hi> must be set
at the table, under his Fathers wing. He is the
joy of the feast: he is the sweet subject of the
Fathers delight. The friends sympathize, but
none knows the felicity the father takes
in his new born son, whom he hath received
from the dead. Methinks I hear the musick
and the dancing, at a distance. Oh the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Heavenly Choristers! I cannot learn
the song, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. but methinks I over-hear
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47965:118"/>
the burden, at which all the harmonious quire
with one consent strikes sweetly in, for thus
goes the round at Heavens table, <hi>For this my son
was dead, and is alive again; was lost and is
found. Luke</hi> 15. 23, 24, 32. I need not farther
explain the parable. God is the Father, Christ
the cheer, his righteousness the robe, his graces
the ornaments, Ministers, Saints, Angels the
friends and servants, and thou that readest (if
thou wilt but unfeignedly repent and turn) the
welcome <hi>Prodigal,</hi> the happy instance of all this
grace, and the blessed subject of this joy &amp; love.</p>
            <p>Oh Rock! Oh Adamant! What not
moved yet! not yet resolved to return forthwith
and to close with mercy! I will try thee
yet once again. If one were sent to thee from
the dead, wouldst thou be perswaded? Why
hear the voice from the dead, from the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
crying to thee that thou shouldst repent.
<hi>I pray thee that thou wouldst send him to my fathers
house: for I have five brethren, that he may testify
unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
If one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
Luke. 16. 27, 28, &amp;c.</hi> Hear O man, thy Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in impenitence preach to thee from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
gibbets, from the flames, from the rack,
that thou shouldst repent. O look down into
the bottomless pit. Seest thou how the smoak
of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever?
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 11. How black are those fiends? How

and their fat droppeth, to drench them with
burning metal, and to rip open their bodies,
and pour in the fierce and fiery brass into their

Ezek. 33. 11. If the wicked will turn from all his

and do that which is lawful and right, he shall
surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions

or pine your selves with famine, or to offer
the fruit of your bodies, for the sin of your souls,
would you not have thankfully accepted eternal

Yea further, if God should have told you,
you should have fried in the fire for millions of

            <p>And now my brethren let me know your
minds. What do you intend to do? Will you
go on and dye, or will you set upon a thorow
and speedy conversion, and lay hold on eternal
life? How long will you linger in <hi>Sodom?</hi> how
long will you halt between two opinions? 1.
<hi>Kings</hi> 18. 21. Are you not yet resolved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ or <hi>Barrabas,</hi> whether bliss or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether the land of <hi>Cabul, 1 kings.</hi> 9.
13. or the Paradise of God, be the better choice?
Is it a disputable case, whether the <hi>Abana</hi> and
<hi>Pharphar</hi> of <hi>Damascus,</hi> be better than all the
streams of <hi>Eden?</hi> or whether the vile puddle
of sin, be to be preferred before the water of
life, clear as Crystal, proceeding out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb? Can the world
in good earnest do that for you, that Christ can?
will it stand by you to eternity? will pleasures,
titles, lands, treasures, descend with you? <hi>Psal.
49. 17. 1. Tim.</hi> 6. 7. If not, had you not need
look after somewhat that will? What mean
you to stand wavering, to be off and on? Foolish
children! how long will you stick between the
womb and the world? Shall I leave you at last
no farther than <hi>Agrippa,</hi> but <hi>almost</hi> perswaded?
Why, you are for ever lost, if left here. As
good not at all, as not altogether Christians.
You are half of the mind to give over your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
negligent life, and to set to a strict and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
course: you could wish that you were as some
others be, and could do as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> can do. How
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47965:126"/>
long will you rest in idle wishes, and fruitless
purposes? when will you come to a fixed, full,
and firm resolve? Do not you see how Satan
gulls you, by tempting you to delays? How long
hath he toll'd you on in the way to perdition?
How many years have you been purposing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend?
What if God should have taken you off
this while?</p>
            <p>Well, put not me off with a dilatory answer.
Tell not me of <hi>hereafter.</hi> I must have your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
consent. It you be not now resolved, while
the Lord is treating with you, and wooing of
you, much less are you like to be hereafter, when
these impressions are worn out, and you are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
through the deceitfulness of sin. Will you
give me your hands? Will you set open the
doors, and give the Lord Jesus the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ull and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

               </gap>ill upon your delays,
my labour is lost, and all is like to come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Fain I would, that you should now put
in your adventures. Come, cast in your lot, make
your choice. <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is
the day of salvation: to day if you will hear his
voice.</hi> Why should not this be the day, from
whence thou shouldst be able to date thine hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?
Why shouldst thou venture a day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in this dangerous and dreadful condition?
What if God should this night require thy soul?
<hi>Oh that thou mightest know, in this thy day, the
things that belong unto thy peace, before they be hid
from thine eyes! Luke</hi> 19. 42. This is thy day,
and 'tis but a day. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 4. Others have had
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47965:126"/>
their day, and have received their doom; and
now art thou brought upon the stage of this
world, here to act thy part, for a whole eternity.
Remember, thou art now upon thy good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
for everlasting. If thou make not a wise
choice now, thou art undone for ever. Look
what thy present choice is, such must thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
condition be. <hi>Luke 10. 42. Luke 16. 25.
Prov.</hi> 1. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>And is it true indeed? is life and death at thy
choice? Yea, 'tis as true as truth is. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
Why then, what hinders but that thou shouldst
be happy? Nothing doth, or can hinder, but
thine own wilful neglect, or refusal. It was
the passage of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip: See, here is
water, what doth hinder me to be baptised?</hi> So I
may say to thee: See, here is Christ, here is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
pardon, life, what hinders but that thou
shouldst be pardoned, and saved? One of the
Martyrs as he was praying at the stake, had his
pardon set by in a box (which indeed he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
deservedly, because upon unworthy terms.)
But here the terms are most honourable and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
Oh sinner, wilt thou burn with thy pardon
by? Why do but forthwith give up thy consent
to Christ, renounce thy sins, deny thy self,
take up the Yoke, and the Cross, and thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
the day; Christ is thing, pardon, peace,
life, blessedness, all are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e: And is not this
an offer worth the embracing? Why shouldst
thou hesitate, or doubtfully dispute about the
case? Is it not past controversy, whether God
be better than sin, and glory better than vanity?
Why shouldst thou forsake thine own mercy,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47965:127"/>
and sin against thine own life? When wilt thou
shake off thy sloth, and lay by thine excuses?
<hi>Boast not thy self of to morrow:</hi> thou knowst not
where this night may lodge thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 1.</p>
            <p>Beloved, now the holy spirit is striving with
you. He will not always strive. Hast thou not
felt thy heart warmed by the word, and been
almost perswaded to leave off thy sins, and come
in to God? Hast thou not felt some good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in thy mind, wherein thou hast been war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of thy danger, and told what thy careless
course would end in? It may be thou art like
young <hi>Samuel,</hi> who when the Lord called once
and again, he knew not the voice of the Lord:
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 6, 7. but these motions and items
are the offers, and essays, and the calls and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of the Spirit. O take the advantage of the
tide, and know the day of thy visitation.</p>
            <p>Now, the Lord Jesus stretcheth wide his arms
to receive you. He beseecheth you by us. How

it is not <hi>Sinais</hi> Thunder; but the soft and still

of the Trumpet, nor the noise of War;

<hi>Behold me, behold me: I have stretched out my hands

            <p>Father of Spirits, take the heart in hand that is
too hard for my weakness. Do not thou have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though I have done. Half a word from thine
effectual power, will do the work. O thou that
hast the key of <hi>David,</hi> that openest when no man
shutteth, open thou this heart as thou didst <hi>Lydia</hi>'s,
and let the King of glory enter in; and make this
soul thy happy captive. Let not the tempter harden
him in delays. Let him not stir from this place, nor
take his eyesfrom these lines, till he be resolved to forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his sins, and to accept of life upon thy self-denying
terms. In thy name O Lord God did I go forth
to these labours, in thy name do I shut them up.

Let not all the time they have cost, be but lost hours:
let not all the thoughts of heart, and all the pains
that have been about them, be but lost labour. Lord
put in thine hand into the heart of this Reader, and
send thy Spirit, as once thou didst <hi>Philip,</hi> to joyn
himself to the Chariot of the Eunuch, while he was
reading thy word. And though I should never
know it while I live, yet I beseech thee Lord God, let
it be found at that day, that some souls were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by these labours: and let some be able to
stand forth and say, that by these perswasions,
they were won unto thee. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi> Let
him that readeth say <hi>Amen.</hi>
