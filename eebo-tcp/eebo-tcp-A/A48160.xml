            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Find a <hi>Postscript</hi> to the newly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished <hi>Defence of Dr.</hi> Sherlock<hi>'s Notion</hi> of the <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> takes Notice of <hi>the Enquiry concerning the possibility of a Trinity in the Godhead.</hi> He that writes it seems somewhat <hi>out of Humour,</hi> or not <hi>in such</hi> as it is decent to hope is more usual with him: And I can't guess for what, unless that <hi>one, whom he imagines a Dissenter,</hi> hath adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to cast his Eyes, that way that he did, his. But for that Imagination he may have as little ground, as I to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101170:3"/>
think the <hi>Dean's Defender is the Dean</hi>: And as little as he had to say the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer <hi>took great Care that no Man should suspect that he favours the Dean in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> where he is quite out in his guess; for the Enquirer took no such Care at all, but nakedly to represent his own Sentiments as they were, whether they agreed with the Dean's, or wherein they differ'd: And really cares not who knows that he hath not so little kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness either for the <hi>truth</hi> or for <hi>him,</hi> as to abandon or decline what he thinks to be true for his sake, or (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd himself <hi>p.</hi> 29. of that Discourse) <hi>because he said it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Defender</hi> represents the <hi>Dean</hi> as much of another <hi>temper,</hi> and that he will <hi>thank him for not favouring him in his Notions.</hi> But yet he says, <hi>that tho' the Enquirer doth not in every particular say what the Dean says, yet he says what will justifie him against — the Charge of Tritheism.</hi> And is there any hurt to him in that?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101170:3"/>
what a strange Man doth he make the Dean! as if he could not be pleased unless he alone did engross Truth! will he thank a Man for not favouring his Notions, and yet would blame him for not saying in every particular what he says, tho' he say what will justifie him <hi>against the heaviest Charge fram'd against him!</hi> may one neither be allow'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him, nor disagree?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> the Defender's Discourse hath no design (nor I believe he himself) to disprove the Possibility of a Trinity in the ever blessed God-head. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enquirer is safe from him as to the principal Design he is concerned for, it is all one to him if it still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear possible in what way it be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, that is intelligible, consistent with it self, and with other truth; so that it is hardly worth the while to him, further to enquire whether the <hi>Dean's Hypothesis</hi> or <hi>his</hi> be better, if either be found unexceptionably, safe and good.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101170:4"/>
But because the Defender hath, to give preference to the one, misrepresented both with some appearing disadvantage to the Cause it self, what he says ought to be considered.</p>
            <p>And the whole Matter will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this twofold Enquiry:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the Enquirer hath said more than the Dean, or more than is defensible, <hi>of the distinction</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Three</hi> in the <hi>Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the Dean hath said so much as the Enquirer, or so much as was requisite <hi>of their Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the former, the Defender, <hi>p.</hi> 103. mentions the Dean's Notion of <hi>three Infinite Minds or Spirits</hi>: And makes the Enquirer to have been proving <hi>three Spirits, three distinct Essences, three indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Natures, in the Godhead</hi>; and then adds — <hi>for my part, I cannot take where the difference is, unless it be in the term Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi> 'Tis indeed strange the Enquirer shou'd have said more than the Dean,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101170:4"/>
if there were no difference, unless in the term <hi>Infinite,</hi> wherein he must have said Infinitely less.</p>
            <p>But he at length, apprehends another difference, tho' he after labours to make it none, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Enquirer <hi>disputes,</hi> but <hi>asserts nothing,</hi> and he fancies he doth so <hi>to shelter himself from the Animadverter,</hi> of whom he says <hi>he seems to be terribly afraid</hi> — Here he puts the <hi>Dean</hi> into a <hi>fit</hi> of <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>good Nature,</hi> allowing the Enquirer to partake with him in his <hi>fears,</hi> tho' not in his <hi>Notions,</hi> as more sacred. But he herein understands not the Enquirer, who if he had been so terribly afraid, could very easily have said nothing: And who was really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of a greater Animadverter, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too great boldness, under his Eye, to speak confidently of his <hi>own peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and that ly folded up in so vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable darkness. He thought it enough, in opposition to the daring Person (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he was) with whom he was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101170:5"/>
concern'd that so peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the <hi>Trinity an absurdity,</hi> a <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, nonsense,</hi> and <hi>an impossibility,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present whar he proposed as <hi>possible for ought he knew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Defender will have the Dean to have done no more. And with all my Heart let him have done no more, if he and his Animadverter, and the rest of the World will so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it: But he will have the Enquirer to have done more, and to be <hi>much more exposed to the Charge of Tritheism, by asserting three distinct Essences, three indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Natures, and three spiritual Beings</hi> in the Godhead. This is indeed very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, that the Enquirer should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself to the Charge of Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism <hi>by asserting</hi> all this, when but a few Lines before upon the same Page, he is said to have <hi>asserted nothing!</hi> But he may as well make the Enquirer <hi>in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing</hi> to have <hi>asserted all this,</hi> as the Dean in <hi>asserting all this</hi> to have <hi>asserted nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101170:5"/>And where the <hi>Enquirer hath said in express words</hi> that the <hi>Sacred Three</hi> are <hi>three distinct substances</hi> I can't find: And we must in great part alter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notion of Substance to make it affirmable of God at all, <hi>viz.</hi> that it doth <hi>substare accidentibus,</hi> which I believe the Dean will no more than the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer suppose the Divine Being to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. But 'tis true, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more considerable in the Notion of Substance, according whereto, if the Dean can make a shift to avoid the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any inconvenient thing proved upon him by consequence, I hope the Enquirer may find a way to escape as well.</p>
            <p>But whereas he says <hi>the Dean allows but one Divine Essence, and one individual Nature in the Godhead repeated in three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but without multiplication,</hi> as he says he had <hi>already explained it.</hi> This hath occasion'd me to look back to <hi>that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation,</hi> and if he thinks the allowing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101170:6"/>
but one Divine Essence, and one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Nature in the Godhead, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with what the Dean hath said in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> I shall not envy him, nor (now) go about to disprove it. But I confess I see not how it can agree with what <hi>the Defender</hi> says in <hi>this his explanation it self,</hi> when <hi>p.</hi> 23. he tells us <hi>the Son is the living subsisting Image of the Father, and the Image and the Prototype can not be the same but must be two. No man is his own Image, nor is an Image the Image of it self.</hi> And he adds, this is so self evident, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whereas the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> all this while might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be but <hi>modal,</hi> and that appears to be the Defenders present (what ever was the Deans former) meaning, that the three subsistences differ only in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner of subsisting, yet with this meaning his other words do little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for he plainly asserts a <hi>real distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>three</hi> in the <hi>same individual numerical nature.</hi> And who did ever make <hi>a real
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101170:6"/>
distinction</hi> to be but <hi>modal?</hi> More ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly he had said before <hi>p.</hi> 18. the Divine Nature is <hi>one individual nature, but not one single nature, for one single nature can be but one person whether in God or man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not here discuss with him the <hi>Criticism</hi> upon which he lays so mighty stress of one <hi>individual nature</hi> and <hi>one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle nature,</hi> but take the terms he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and if the Divine Nature be <hi>not one single nature,</hi> it must be double, it must be triple. And what doth this come to less than three Natures? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less all ordinary forms of speech must be quite abandon'd and forsaken. And wherein doth it come short of what is said by the Enquirer? <hi>p.</hi> 50. and 51. <q>This term <hi>individual</hi> must (in the case now supposed, <hi>as possible not as certain</hi>) admit of a twofold application either to the distinct essence of the <hi>Father,</hi> or of the <hi>Son,</hi> or of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; or to the <hi>entire essence</hi> of the Godhead,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101170:7"/>
in which these three do concurr. <hi>Each</hi> of these <hi>conceived by it self,</hi> are (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this supposition) individual essences, but <hi>conceived together</hi> they are <hi>the entire individual essence of God,</hi> for there is <hi>but one such essence and no more,</hi> and it can never be multiplied nor divided into more of the same name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> 
               <hi>Duplicity, triplicity,</hi> are admitted; simplicity rejected, if (simple and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle be of the same signification.) Where is the difference, but that the one thinks <hi>absolute omnimodous simplicity</hi> is not to be affirmed of the Divine Nature, as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten speaks. The other says downright, <hi>it is not single or simple without limitation.</hi> The one denies multiplication of it, so doth the other: The one indeed <hi>speaks positively,</hi> the other doth but <hi>suppose</hi> what he says as <hi>possible not certain.</hi> And there is indeed some difference between supposing a thing as possible for ought one knows; and affirming it <hi>so positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as to impute <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Nonsense</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101170:7"/>
to all Gainsayers. But both bring for proof, the same thing, <hi>The incarnation</hi>; as in <hi>the Postscript,</hi> the <hi>Defender</hi> takes notice the <hi>Enquirer</hi> doth. <hi>p.</hi> 102. And so doth <hi>he himself</hi> in <hi>his letter,</hi> p. 102. — <hi>The Divine Nature was incarnate in Christ, he was perfect God and perfect man, and if there was but one single Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all three persons, this one single Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature was incarnate, and therefore the Father and the Holy Ghost who are this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Divine Nature as well as the Son, must be as much incarnate as the Son was.</hi> He makes the contrary absurd. And brings in (fitly enough) <hi>Victorinus Afer</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>we ought not to say, nor is it lawful to say, that there is but one substance</hi> (i. e. as he paraphrases it, <hi>one single subsisting nature</hi> (therefore there must be three sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle subsisting natures) <hi>and three persons. For if this same substance did and suffer'd all</hi> (Patri-passiani et nos) <hi>we must be</hi> Patri-passians, <hi>which God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what the <hi>Defender</hi> alledges from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101170:8"/>

Persons at least as much as the <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> And whether the <hi>Enquirer</hi> have supposed more than is defensible against the Defenders objections, will be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by and by in its proper place. In the mean time let it</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be examin'd whether the Dean has said as much <hi>for salving the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Godhead</hi> as <hi>the Enquirer,</hi> or as much <hi>as is requisite to that purpose.</hi> And here our Business will be short, for it all turns upon that one single point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mutual Consciousness be that Union</hi> which must be acknowledged, or <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it</hi> only. For which we need only appeal to common Reason, whether <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> do not in the natural Order precede even the <hi>Power of working,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether <hi>being united vitally,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede not the <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>acting agreeably</hi> to <hi>that united state,</hi> whereupon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is not concerning <hi>actual conscience</hi> only, but (as he speaks) <hi>Consciousness.</hi> Is it possible any three Persons or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101170:9"/>
Subsistences, should naturally have vital Perception of each others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Motions and Sensations, without being vitally preunited? I say <hi>naturally,</hi> for that God might give to three created Spirits a <hi>temporary Perception</hi> of each other without bringing them into a <hi>stated Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> each with other, is little to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as a Spirit may assume a Body and animate it <hi>pro tempore</hi> without being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially united with it. And if that Body were also a Spirit they might <hi>pro tempore</hi> for ought we know by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Divine Disposition (for within the ordinary course of Nature we know of no such intimacy of created Spirits to another) be <hi>quasi animae</hi> to one another. But if naturally they were so to mingle and transfuse Sensations mutually into each other, they must be naturally, <hi>first,</hi> in vital union with one another. Nor therefore did the <hi>Enquirer</hi> mistake the <hi>Dean's</hi> Notion as the Defender fancies in the passage he quotes <hi>p.</hi> 104. as if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101170:9"/>
he took mutual Consciousness for meer mutual Perspection. For tho' <hi>scire</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly taken doth not signifie more than <hi>perspicere,</hi> yet the Enquirer in that passage speaking of <hi>a never so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mutual perspection</hi> properly enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd thereby as great a feeling such Spirits were supposed to have of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in themselves, as <hi>mutual conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is apt to signifie, or as the Dean can yet be supposed to have meant, that perspection being more perfect which produces gusts and relishes suitable to the Object, than that which stays in meer speculation only.</p>
            <p>And upon the whole, it seems very strange the Defender should say, <hi>if such an internal, vital sensation, be not an essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al union, he believes no man can tell what it is.</hi> For how can such <hi>actual sensation</hi> be imagin'd to <hi>be union?</hi> As well might <hi>the use of sense its self</hi> (speaking of any thing singly to which it belongs) be said to be <hi>its constituent form,</hi> or (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101170:10"/>
the doing any thing that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Reason, be the form of a Man. So <hi>the writing a Book,</hi> should <hi>be the Author.</hi> And whereas he says <hi>it is certain the Dean took it to be so, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not leave out a natural external union</hi>; it follows, indeed, that he did not leave it out, in his Mind, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, but he nevertheless left it out of <hi>his Book,</hi> and therefore said not enough <hi>there,</hi> to salve <hi>the unity of the Godhead,</hi> but ought to have insisted upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>prior</hi> to <hi>mutual consciousness,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent of <hi>that unity,</hi> and which might <hi>make the three one,</hi> and not meerly <hi>argue</hi> them to be so.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But now <hi>p.</hi> 105. he comes to find as great fault with the Enquirers way of <hi>maintaining this unity,</hi> and because he is resolv'd to dislike it, if <hi>he can't find it faulty,</hi> sets himself to make it so.</p>
            <p>The Temper of Mind wherewith he writes to this purpose what follows <hi>p.</hi> 105. and onwards to the end so soon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101170:10"/>
and so constantly shews it self, that no man whose mind is not in the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order will upon Tryal apprehend any thing in it, but such heat as dwells in darkness. And he himself hath given the Document which may be a measure to any apprehensive Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True divine Wisdom rests not on an ill natur'd,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">See his Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>and perverse Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> I understand it, <hi>while the ill fit lasts.</hi> But 'tis strange he could write those words without any self-reflection.</p>
            <p>The Thing to be reveng'd is, that the Enquirer did freely speak his Thoughts, wherein he judg'd the Dean's <hi>Hypothesis</hi> defective, his not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he reckon'd <hi>naturally antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> to <hi>mutual conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>: A most <hi>intimate, natural, necessary, eternal union of the sacred Three.</hi> If the <hi>Enquirer</hi> spake sincerely, as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the matter, and him; and it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently apppear the <hi>Defender</hi> did not so, I only say the wrong'd person hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101170:11"/>
much the advantage and wishes him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harm, than such gentle Regrets, as are necessary to set him right with himself, and his higher Judge.</p>
            <p>He says, <hi>he (the Enquirer) represents this</hi> (Unity) <hi>by the union of soul and body, and by the union of the divine and humane nature,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he partly doth so, but more fully by the (supposed union of) <hi>three created Spirits</hi> (to which he that will may see, he only makes that a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er step) and he says, (with respect es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to the former of these) <q>That an union supposeable to be originally, eternally, and by natural necessity in the most <hi>perfect being,</hi> is to be thought unexpressibly <hi>more perfect</hi> than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q> But (he adds) these are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal unions, and therefore cannot be the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Godhead.</hi> And he very well knew (for he had but little before cited the passage) that the Enquirer never intended them so, but only to represent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101170:11"/>
that the union of the <hi>three</hi> in the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> could not be reasonably thought <hi>less possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he farther adds is much strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (and yet herein I am resolv'd to put <hi>Charity</hi> towards him to the utmost stretch, as he professes to have done his <hi>understanding</hi>) for he says — <hi>as far as he can possibly understand</hi> and that <hi>he should be glad to be better informed,</hi> tho' there is some reason to apprehend that former displeasure darkned his understanding, (and even dimn'd his Eye-sight) which yet I hope hath it's more lucid Intervals, and that his distemper is not a fixed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit with him.) And what is it now that he cannot possibly understand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? <hi>that no other union will satisfie him (viz.</hi> the Enquirer) <hi>but such an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of three spiritual Beings and individual natures as by their composition constitute the Godhead, as the composition of soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy do the Man, i. e.</hi> He cannot understand but he means what he expresly denies.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101170:12"/>
Who can help so cross an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? If he had not had his very finger upon the place where the Enquirer says in express words [I peremptorily deny all composition in the Being of God] this had been more excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note rend="inter">Calm Discourse <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note>
               <note rend="inter">Calm Discourse <hi>p.</hi> 89, 90.</note> (besides much said to the same purpose elsewhere) It had been <hi>ingenuous</hi> in any man not to impute that to another, as <hi>his meaning,</hi> which in the plainest terms he disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows, as none of his meaning: And it had been <hi>prudent</hi> in the <hi>Dean</hi> (or <hi>his Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) of all Mankind not to have done so in the present case, as will further be seen in due time. But he takes it for an Affront, when he fancies a man to come too near him.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>for this reason he disputes ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly against the universal absolute omnimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous simplicity of the divine Nature, and will not allow that Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, are the same thing in God, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101170:12"/>
distinguished into different Conceptions by us, only through the weakness of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which cannot comprehend an infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one thought, and therefore must, as well as we can, contemplate him by parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not what he means by <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,</hi> the matter was weighty, and it is true, he was in writing about it in no disposition to jeast. But it's said <hi>he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against the universal, absolute, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modous simplicity of the Divine Nature.</hi> I hope the <hi>Defender</hi> in this means honestly, but he speaks very improperly, for it supposes him to think that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, absolute, omnimodous simplicity, so earnestly disputed against, did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Divine Nature, but I can scarce believe him to think so, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he should have said, his disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tended to prove it not to belong. If <hi>he (viz.</hi> the Defender, or the Dean) did really think it did, <hi>they,</hi> or <hi>he,</hi> must be very singular in that sentiment. I would have them name me the man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101170:13"/>
that ever laid down and asserted such a position. Some I know have said of that Sacred Being, that it is <hi>summè simplex,</hi> or more simple than any thing else, but that imports not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, absolute, omnimodous simplicity, which is impossible to be a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or therefore to belong to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. No man that ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a Trinity of persons even modally distinguished, could ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, for such simplicity excludes <hi>all modes.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves can never be for it, as the <hi>Calm Discourse</hi> hath shewn.<note rend="inter">p. 139.</note> And if the Dean be, he is gone into the remotest extream from what he held (and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough seems still to hold) that ever man of sense did.</p>
            <p>But for what is added, that he <hi>will not allow that Wisdom, Power and Goodness, are the same thing in God</hi>: This is not <hi>fairly</hi> said, Civility allows me not to say, <hi>untruly.</hi> There is no word in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101170:13"/>
place he cites, nor any where in that book, that signifies <hi>not allowing,</hi> 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated we are not instructed <q>by the <hi>Scripture</hi> to conceive of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as, in every respect, <hi>most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely simple</hi>
               </q>, or that Power, Wisdom, Goodness in the abstract, are the same thing, and that our difficulty is great to apprehend them really undistinguisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And let me seriously ask himself, doth he in good earnest think it is only through the weakness of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that we distinguish the notions of the Divine <hi>Wisdom, Power and Goodness?</hi> certainly it were great weakness of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to define them alike. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he never met with the writer yet that distinguisht them less, than <hi>ratione ratiocinatâ,</hi> in contradistinction to <hi>ratocinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> which implies somewhat corresponding to our distinct notions of them (emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and not formally) <hi>in naturâ rei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he further says, This prepared his way to make Goodness,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101170:14"/>
Wisdom, Power, — a natural Trinity n Unity, herein the Defender is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This is not the <hi>Trinity</hi> which the Enquirers discourse was ever intended to terminate in, as he himself hath expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, and the Defender takes notice of it, which makes me wonder how he could think it was so intended, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the very passage <hi>p.</hi> 37. where the Enquirer <q>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Calm Disc.</hi>
                  </note> not to judge, that we are under the precise notions of <hi>Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to conceive of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</q> But why then were these three so much discourst of before? They are three most celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Divine Attributes, wherein we have our most immediate and very principal concern. And some have thought the Trinity was most fitly to be conceived by them: The Enquirer did not think so; but he thought <hi>first,</hi> it would be requisite to have our minds <hi>disentangled from any apprehended necessity</hi> of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101170:14"/>
them to be in all respects <hi>the very same things,</hi> nor are they <hi>the very same,</hi> if they be so distinguish'd as is expressed in the 16<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>summary propositions</hi>;<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Calm. Disc.</hi> p. 140.</note> where also they are <hi>each of them</hi> said to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> whence therefore it is impossible they shou'd be thought to distinguish <hi>Father,</hi> Son, and Holy Ghost. But that some distinction being admitted even <hi>of them,</hi> this might facilitate to us our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>greater distinction</hi> which must be, of <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd <hi>p.</hi> 38. Indeed he did not think fit to interrupt his discourse by staying to shew reasons why he did not rest in that account alone of the Trinity, tho' it might seem plausible, or not absurd, but proceeded further to what was more satisfying to himself, and might be so to other men. And (as the intervening <hi>Series</hi> of his discourse leads thereto) this is more directly done <hi>p.</hi> 47. &amp; 48. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> especially
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101170:15"/>
where he comes to speak of the <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coexistence,</hi> and the (as necessary and natural) order of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> towards each other. The <hi>second</hi> being, not by any intervening act of will, but by necessary, eternal <hi>promanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> from the first, and the <hi>third</hi> from them both. And the true reason why <hi>Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> were not thought expressive of the distinction of Father, Son and Spirit, but common to each of them (as is said, <hi>Summary Prop.</hi> 16.) was, thatt the two latter can not but be <hi>necessary emanations,</hi> most conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to <hi>their Original,</hi> as is truely sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the <hi>Defender,</hi> p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If you object (as the <hi>Defender</hi> brings in the <hi>Enquirer,</hi> saying) <hi>That this gives us the notion of a compounded Deity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This, i. e.</hi> the supposition, <hi>that absolute omnimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous simplicity, belongs not to it,</hi> is the thing which may be thought to give us this notion. And he tells us, <hi>he</hi> (the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer) <hi>answers this difficulty, by giving us
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101170:15"/>
a new notion of a compositum.</hi> And what's that which he calls a <hi>new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> that <hi>a compositm seems to imply a preexisting component, that brings such things together, and supposes such and such more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple things to have preexisted apart, or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and to be brought afterwards together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an united State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed is this a <hi>new notion?</hi> as new as the Creation? Let him shew me an Instance through the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted universe of Beings (And for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Being the <hi>Defender (now</hi> at this time) disputes against any composition <hi>there,</hi> and the <hi>Enquirer</hi> denies any) <hi>first,</hi> where there hath been a <hi>compositum</hi> without a pre-existing component, or next the compounded parts whereof, if substantial did not in order of nature pre-exist separate; <hi>i. e.</hi> whether <hi>esse sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitèr</hi> do not naturally precede <hi>esse tale,</hi> or which is all one, to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, whether they were not capable hereof if the Creator pleased: Let any

man, I say, tell me where was there ever a <hi>compositum</hi> made by substantial union, that did not consist of once se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate or of separable parts.</p>
            <p>But note his admirable following sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>that is to say, that if a man, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, who consists of body and soul, had been from eternity, without a maker, and his soul, and body had never subsisted a part, he could not have been said to have been a compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature?</hi> This is said with design most groundlesly (as we shall see) to fasten an absurd consequence upon the Enquirer, and see how it lucks: Did ever any man undertake to reprove an absurdity with greater absurdity? a Creature without a Maker! what sort of Creature must this be! we have a pretty saying quoted in the Defender's Letter; <hi>He that writes lies down;</hi> and we are apt enough too, when we write <hi>to trip and fall down,</hi> and ought in such Cases to be merciful to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even tho' he that falls should be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101170:16"/>
in no danger of hurting his fore-head, much more if he be. What was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's turn now, may be mine next.</p>
            <p>But let the supposition proceed, and put we <hi>Being</hi> instead of <hi>Creature,</hi> which no doubt was the Defender's meaning, for Creature he must needs know it could not be that had no Maker. And what then? <hi>why he should not (says he) have been said to be compounded, though he would have had the same parts that he has now</hi>: We have here a self-confounding supposition, which having done that first, can't hurt him whom it was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confound, being taken in season. Grant one, and you grant a thousand. A <hi>Being</hi> made up of a soul and a body, is so imperfect an entity, as could not be of it self. <hi>Nothing is of it self which is not absolutely perfect.</hi> If he mind to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this, let him try his faculty when he pleases against it, and (which I sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe he never intends) together with it, against all Religion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101170:17"/>
he hath destroy'd his own suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition himself (to put us out of that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) by saying in plain words, <hi>p.</hi> 107. <hi>We have no Notion of an eternal and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Existence, but in an absolutely perfect and infinite nature.</hi> Now say I, what is so perfect, and hath whatever belongs to it necessarily, though distinguishable things belong to it, hath no <hi>parts,</hi> for what are <hi>parts,</hi> but such things as can be parted? such things as never were parted, and never can be, (as 'tis nonsence to talk of those things being parted that are <hi>united necessarily,</hi> and of themselves) are no parts, if <hi>partiri,</hi> whence they are so called, must not (and herein he cannot so fool the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World as to make it concur with him) lose its signification to serve a turn. Tho' the <hi>things</hi> be <hi>real,</hi> there par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility is not real.

But now for the things upon which he would obtrude these words [<hi>three Essences, natures,</hi> (or if you please, <hi>Infinite minds or spirits</hi>) signified by the Names of <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in eternal union, but distinct in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God.] Let us consider his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation against them <hi>united, or in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> according to its double aspect: First, <hi>upon the Hypothesis</hi> or Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101170:18"/>
of them: Secondly, <hi>upon himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Consider his Disputation as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd against the Hypothesis or supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such distinct essences, natures, minds, spirits, in necessary, eternal Union in the Divine Being. And one of his arguments against it, is in those words of his <hi>One principal argument against it</hi> (here put out <hi>parts and composition</hi> which are his own, and we have no more to do with them) is, that God is eternal and unmade, and whatsoever (<hi>hath parts,</hi> saies he) hath such essences in it, must have a maker. And here let him prove his consequence, and his business is done, <hi>viz.</hi> both ways, as will be seen by and by. But let him shew the inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy between a things having such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct essences naturally and necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united in it, (as the supposition to be argued against is, and before ought to have been justly stated) and it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal and unmade. But how that is to be evinced I can not so much as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101170:19"/>
guess; confident affirmation, against the most obvious Tenour of Gods own Word, is of little account, who shall ascend into the heavens? or fathom the depths? or can have that perspection of God's incomprehensible nature, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out (and visibly against) his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to be able, without great rashness, to pronounce so concerning him? But so toyish an <hi>Argument</hi> as here follows, is worse than the <hi>Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; i. e. when one shall say, that <hi>for ought we know there may be three distinct Essences by an eternal unmade union, united into one, in the Being of God</hi>; any man should say, and be so vain as to expect to be regarded, that because they are united by an eternal and unmade uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore they are not united by an eternal and unmade union! If there be not a Contradiction in the terms to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a thing, by it self, is to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or is all one with proving a thing by it self. He proceeds, to what
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101170:19"/>
hath no thing in it like an Argument, but against <hi>his own Conceit of parts,</hi> and that very trifling too. <hi>There can be but one eternal nature in God: But if there be three — there must be three.</hi> This 'tis now come to, proving his Point by its self. Here he makes sure work to have nothing deny'd, but then nothing is prov'd, no advance is made; if there be three, there must be three. But if there be three what? eternal <hi>parts</hi>: There must be three different Natures, or else they — would be the same. (What? tho' distinct?) But this supposes some body said the first: And who? himself; therefore he is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving himself. If I had said so, I would have deny'd his consequence, for there may be similar parts: Whereas by different, he seems to mean dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>He says not only distinct, but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures.</hi> Now you have that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing talk'd of some times, but never brought to view before, a <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:101170:20"/>
without a <hi>difference.</hi> 'Tis strange how any things should be distinct, and no way different. What distinguishes them if they differ by nothing. This <hi>different,</hi> apply'd to this present Case, is <hi>his own word,</hi> coined to introduce a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is not new to Christians on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to all Man-kind. If by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Natures he means (as he seems) of a <hi>different kind,</hi> who thought of such a difference? But I trow, things that <hi>differ in number,</hi> do as truly differ (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever essentially cohaering) tho' not so widely.</p>
            <p>His next is, <hi>that though we have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notion of an eternal Being, we have no notion of three eternal Essences</hi> (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain I put instead of <hi>his parts) which necessarily coexist in an eternal union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth he mean we are to disbelieve every thing of God whereof we have not a natural Notion? Then to what purpose is a Divine Revelation? Is this Notion of God pretended to be Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101170:20"/>
'Tis enough, if such a Notion be most favoured by his own Revelation, who best understands his own Nature, and there be no evident natural Notion against it. He forgot that he had said, (<hi>Defence,</hi> p. 5.) <hi>If every thing which we have no positive Idea of must be allow'd to contradict Reason, we shall find contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons enow</hi>; adding, <hi>We must confess a great many things to be true, which we have no Idea of,</hi> &amp;c. He adds, <hi>once more we have no notion of an eternal and necessary exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but in an absolutely perfect and infinite nature, but if there be</hi> (I here again leave out <hi>his three parts,</hi> because I design to consider if there be any thing of strength brought against <hi>what was supposed possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Enquirer,</hi> not against <hi>his fiction,</hi> which I trouble not my self any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with) <hi>three spiritual Beings — nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can be absolutely perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> (I would rather have said <hi>none,</hi> or no one, than <hi>neither,</hi> since the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is of <hi>more than two.</hi> I thought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101170:21"/>
the meaning of <hi>uter</hi> and <hi>neuter</hi> had been agreed long ago,) <hi>tho' we could suppose their union to make such a perfect Being, because they are not the same, and (neither) no one of them is the whole,</hi> — &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is the only thing that ever came under my notice among the <hi>School-men,</hi> that hath any appearing strengh in it, against <hi>the Hypothesis</hi> which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>as possible for ought I knew.</hi> They generally dispute against many sorts of Compositions in the Being of God, which I am not concern'd in. That of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> which is alien from this affair, of <hi>quantitative parts,</hi> which is as alien. Of <hi>subject and accident,</hi> which touches us not. Of <hi>act and power,</hi> which doth it as little. Each subsistent, being eternally in utmost actuality. And by sundry sorts and methods of argument, whereof only <hi>this</hi> can seem to signify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing against the present supposition. And it wholly resolves into the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Infinity,</hi> about which I generally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101170:21"/>
spoke my sense in that <hi>first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to Dr. <hi>Wallis.</hi>
               <note rend="inter">See Calm Disc. <hi>p.</hi> 122.123</note> And as I there intimated how much easier it is to <hi>puzzle another</hi> upon that subject <hi>than to satisfy one self,</hi> so I here say, that I doubt not to give any man as much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about it in respect of <hi>quantitative extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as he can me, <hi>in this.</hi> I think it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable that one Infinite can never be from another by <hi>voluntary production,</hi> that it cannot by <hi>necessary Emanation,</hi> I think not so. In the mean time when we are told so plainly by the Divine Oracles, of a <hi>sacred three,</hi> that are each of them God, and of some one whereof some things are spoken that are not nor can be of the others. I think it easier to <hi>count three</hi> than <hi>to determine of Infiniteness</hi>: And accordingly to form ones Belief. But of this more when we come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him with himself. And for what he discourses of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this supposition hath upon the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Homo-ousion.</hi>
               <note rend="inter">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 108.109, 110.</note> It
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101170:22"/>
all proceeds still upon his own <hi>fiction of parts,</hi> and upon the invidious straining of that similitude of the union of soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as he himself doth <hi>tantum non</hi> confess; except that he lessens it by saying most untruly that he (the Enquirer) doth expresly own the Consequence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he do not own the Consequence, then the Defender confesses himself to have invidiously devised it; and what is it? That if all three by this compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are but one God, <hi>neither</hi> of them by himself is true and perfect God. The <hi>Divinity</hi> is like the <hi>English.</hi> But both his own. The <hi>Enquirer</hi> denies both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent (which he knows) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent too. Leave out <hi>by this composition,</hi> (his own figment) and his argument as much disproves any Trinity at all as it doth the present <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wherein doth the Enquirer own it? because such a Similitude is used (as 'tis often in that discourse) of the union between soul and body (declared
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101170:22"/>
elsewhere to be unexpressibly defective) that therefore the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are each of them by himself no more truly <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> according to the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> or otherwise than in as improper a sense, as the Body of a Man, excluding the Soul, is a Man, or an Humane Person. Or as if Deity were no more in one of the Persons, than humanity in a Carkass! who that looks upon all this with equal Eyes, but will rather choose as doubtful a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than so apparently ill a Spirit! Are similitudes ever wont to be alike throughout, to what they are brought to illustrate? It might as well be said, because he mentions with Approbation such as illustrate the Doctrine of the Trinity by a Tree and its Branches, that, therefore, there we are to expect Leaves and Blossoms. Is it strange the Created Universe should not afford us an exact Representation of uncreated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How could he but think of that;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101170:23"/>
               <hi>To whom do ye liken me?</hi> At least one would have thought he should not have forgot what he had so lately said him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>We must grant we have no perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any such union in nature.</hi> What Appetite in him is it,<note rend="inter">His Letter. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> that now seeks what Nature doth not afford? A very unnatural One, we may conclude. 'Twere trifling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what was said, and was so plain, before, that the union between Soul and Body was never brought to illustrate <hi>personal union</hi> but <hi>essential.</hi> The former is here imagin'd without pretence, there being no mention or occasion for the the mentioning of <hi>Persons</hi> in the place he alledges.<note place="margin">Calm Disc. 47.</note> But to make out his violent Consequence he foists in a supposition, that never came into any man's Imagination but a <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>his own.</hi> (Which I say, contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing him to them, that the matter may (as it ought) appear the more strange.<note rend="inter">His Letter <hi>p.</hi> 110.</note>) <hi>If God be a person, he can
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101170:23"/>
be but one.</hi> Is God the appropriate Name of a Person? then indeed there will be but <hi>one person</hi>; but who <hi>here</hi> says so but himself? The name God is the name of the Essence, not the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing name of a Person. But if three intelligent Natures be united in one Deity, each will be Persons, and each will be God, and all will be one God; not by parts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than conceptible, undivided, and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable, as the Soul and Body of a Man are not. Which sufficiently conserves the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Trinity from such furious and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Attaques as these. And the <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousiotes</hi> is most entirely conserved too. For what are three spiritual natures no more the same, than (as he grosly speaks) the Soul and Body are? no more than an intelligent mind, and a piece of Clay? by what consequence is this said, from any thing in the Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <hi>Hypothesis</hi>?

            <p>There had been some <hi>prudence</hi> seen in all this conduct, if the <hi>Defender</hi> could have taken effectual care, that every thing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101170:24"/>
should have been blotted out of all the Copies of that Discourse, but what <hi>he</hi> would have thought fit to be permitted to the view of other Eyes than his own. For then, tho' in so gross praevarication he had not preserved <hi>his Innocency,</hi> he might have sav'd in some degree <hi>his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi> Yet also he should have taken some heed that Anger might not so have discoloured his Eye, as to make so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious a Choice what to confess and what to conceal. For had he not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self blab'd, that it was said, we are not under the <hi>precise notions</hi> of <hi>Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to conceive of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> He might more plausibly have formed his odd Births, and father'd them where he doth. But wrath indulg'd will show its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning power. And all this fury and <hi>vengeance</hi> (upon the Enquirer, and the Dean too) he reckon'd was due, only because it was so presumptuously thought, that somewhat in <hi>his Hypothesis</hi> (or which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101170:25"/>
he defends) might have been better, and that he (probably) sees it might, so much a greater thing (in some ill fits) is <hi>the gratifying a humour</hi> than the <hi>Christian Cause!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But let us now see how all this turns upon himself. And how directly his ill-polisht (not to say envenom'd) darts, missing their designed Mark, strike into that very Breast which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to defend.</p>
            <p>Whereas there are two things, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be designed in a Discourse of this subject. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The explaining the Unity of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> so as that tho' they are some way <hi>three,</hi> they may yet be concluded to be in <hi>Godhead but one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The evincing notwithstanding <hi>that unity,</hi> the possibility of their sufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, to admit the distinct predicates that are severally spoken of them in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:101170:25"/>The Enquirer's discourse chiefly insists upon these two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That necessity of Existence is the most fundamental Attribute of Deity. And that therefore the <hi>Father,</hi> as the <hi>Fountain,</hi> being <hi>necessarily of himself</hi>: The <hi>Son, necessarily of the Father</hi>: The <hi>Holy Ghost, necessarily from them both,</hi> each can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be God, and the same, <hi>one God.</hi> (In reference to the former purpose.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>absolute omnimodous simplicity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never asserted, in Scripture, of the divine Being, nor capable of being, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, demonstrated of it, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible, either from Scripture, or rational evidence, <hi>accurately</hi> to assign the limits thereof, and determine what sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity belongs to that ever-blessed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what not. If it be necessary to our apprehending how such distinct <hi>predicates</hi> and <hi>attributions</hi> may severally belong, to the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that we conceive three <hi>distinct essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> necessarily <hi>coexisting,</hi> in an eternal,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101170:26"/>
vital, inseperable union in the Divine Being. The thing <hi>may be in it self possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ought we know.</hi> (And this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to serve the latter purpose)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Defender of the Dean</hi> seems to think otherwise of these two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Of necessity of Existence, common to the sacred three, which will prove each of them to be God, and, belonging to them in the mentioned order, as <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> will prove them, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, to be <hi>one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of what is said of <hi>simplicity,</hi> which might admit their sufficient distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; of both these, I say, he seems to think otherwise by neglecting both, lest that Discourse should be thought any way pertinent, or useful to its end. And disputes vehemently against the latter, How <hi>strongly</hi> and <hi>successfully,</hi> he does it, in <hi>respect of the Truth of the Thing,</hi> we have seen.</p>
            <p>But whether <hi>weakly</hi> or <hi>strongly,</hi> that his disputation tends to wound the Dean's
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101170:26"/>
cause, all that it can, shall now be made appear.</p>
            <p>It is notorious the Dean hath asserted, so positively, <hi>three infinite Minds or Spirits,</hi> that the <hi>benign interpretation</hi> wherewith <hi>this Defender</hi> would salve the matter, (A new <hi>Vocabulary</hi> being to be made for him on purpose, and the Reason of things quite alter'd) will to any man of sense seem rather ludicrous, than sufficient, without express retractation. For which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> thinks he is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on somewhat better Terms, than he, if there were occasion for it, both by the Tenour of his whole Discourse, and by what he hath particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said in the 28 <hi>Sect.</hi> But after the Interpretation offer'd,<note rend="inter">Calm Disc. <hi>p.</hi> 73 74.</note> See whether such things are not said o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over in <hi>the Defence,</hi> as make the Defender (and the Dean if he speak his sense) most obnoxious to the whole argumentation <hi>in the Postscript.</hi> So as, <hi>if a part was acted,</hi> it was carried so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101170:27"/>
untowardly, that it seem'd to be quite forgotten <hi>what part</hi> it was, and all the Blows (for it was come now to <hi>offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> instead of <hi>Defending</hi>) fall directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>him,</hi> whom the Actor had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to defend.</p>
            <p>It hath been noted already, that the Defender says expresly, the <hi>Divide Nature</hi> is <hi>one individual nature,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Defence <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> (and so says the <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>) — but <hi>not one single nature</hi>;<note rend="inter">Calm Disc. <hi>p.</hi> 50.51.</note> (then it must be <hi>double</hi> and <hi>triple,</hi> not absolutely simple, as also the <hi>Enquirer</hi> says) to which he (<hi>viz.</hi> the Defender) adds, <hi>one single nature can be but one person, whether in God or Man.</hi> Now let any man judge whether all his Reasonings are not most directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable against him, (if they signify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing) which are contained in his Postscript, <hi>p.</hi> 106, 107, 108. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How furiously doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitate that saying,<note rend="inter">Postscrip. <hi>p.</hi> 108, 109.</note> 
               <hi>When you prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Godhead, or the Name of God,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101170:27"/>
of any one of them,</hi> (viz. <hi>Father, Son, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost) you herein express a true but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate conception of God,</hi> &amp;c. insisting that the whole <hi>undivided Divine Nature</hi> (no doubt it is everlastingly undivided wherever it is) <hi>subsists entirely, in three distinct Persons</hi>: This the Enquirer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deny'd, tho' he charges it upon him, that he makes no one of the Persons to be <hi>true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God.</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Postscrip. <hi>p.</hi> 108.</note> But how well doth that agree with what he had himself said, (<hi>Defence,</hi> p. 26.) <hi>Tho' God be the most absolute, compleat, independent Being, yet neither the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, can be said to be, an absolute, compleat, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent God.</hi> He falsly charges it upon the Enquirer that he makes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons severally <hi>not perfect God,</hi> and he denies <hi>two</hi> of them to be <hi>compleat God.</hi> To say <hi>not perfect,</hi> is criminal (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is) to say <hi>not compleat</hi> is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent! But his saying the Son and Holy Ghost are <hi>not compleat God</hi>; How doth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101170:28"/>
it consist with what is said, <hi>Postscr.</hi> p. 109. <hi>The same whole entire Divinity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and inseparably subsists in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> What is wanting to make <hi>him</hi> compleat God, in whom the <hi>whole, entire Divinity sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists?</hi> No wonder if he quarrel with all the World who so little agrees with <hi>him,</hi> whose Defence he undertakes, or <hi>with himself.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer</hi> hath the less reason to complain, when he manifestly treats, himself as ill as him.</p>
            <p>I only add, that for his Discourse concerning [the <hi>one Divinity, or one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, subsisting wholly and entirely, three times,</hi> (whereas I had thought the three Persons had subsisted at <hi>all times,</hi> and all at once) <hi>Defence</hi> p. 26, &amp;c. And the Persons of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> not being <hi>emanations,</hi> p. 28. Not the <hi>Son,</hi> because he is the <hi>Father's Image</hi>: And an <hi>Image</hi> is not an <hi>emanation,</hi> but a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi>: (But how should there be a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101170:28"/>
reflected Image without an emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?) Nor the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not in the sense of <hi>emanation,</hi> but of the <hi>mysterious Procession</hi>] I shall make no guesses about it (for it concerns not the <hi>Enquirer</hi>) only I think it very secure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>formidable Objection</hi> which he mentions <hi>p.</hi> 35. of it's being too <hi>intelligible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I see not what service it can do him, to put <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent person</hi> instead of <hi>mind.</hi> For I thought every Person had been intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. <hi>Boethius</hi> his definition which he alledges plainly implies so much, and one would think he must know that it is the <hi>usual notion of Person</hi> to understand by it <hi>suppositum rationale</hi> or <hi>intelligents.</hi> Therefore methinks he should not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it necessary to distinguish Persons (as he doth by this addition of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) into such as are <hi>Persons</hi> and such as are <hi>no Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since he <hi>expresly saies</hi> (and I think for the most part truly) that<note rend="inter">Defence <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101170:29"/>
               <hi>the three Persons or subsistences, in the ever blessed Trinity are three real, substantial sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances, each of which hath entirely, all the Perfections of the Divine Nature, Divine Wisdom, Power, and Goodness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each of them is eternal, Infinite mind, as distinct from each other as any other three Persons; and this he believes, the Dean will no more recant, than he will renounce a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for all the wit of man, can not find a medium, between a substantial Trinity, and a Trinity of names, or a Trinity of meer modes, Respects and Relations in the same single essence, which is no Trinity at all.</hi> As also he had said much to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose before, <hi>that to talk of three subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the abstract, without three that subsist, or of one single nature which hath three sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences, when it's impossible that in singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity there can be more than one subsistence,</hi> &amp;c. I believe he will find no small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to name <hi>what it is,</hi> that <hi>with the peculiar distinct manner of subsistence</hi> makes a person; not the <hi>very same common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:101170:29"/>
for the Persons can not be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from each other by <hi>that which is common to them all.</hi> Therefore the Divine Nature which is common to the three, must <hi>according to him</hi> comprehend <hi>three single natures,</hi> and not be <hi>absolutely simple.</hi> Hither must be his resort at last, after all his earnest disputation against it. And these <hi>he</hi> will have to be parts, which because they are undivided, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partible, inseparable, everlastingly and necessarily united. I do reckon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer did <hi>with very sufficient reason,</hi> and <hi>with just decency</hi> (and doth still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue very peremptorily to) deny.</p>
            <p>And whereas he contends that the <hi>whole Divine nature</hi> is entirely in each sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, (as he does again and again) I think the term <hi>whole,</hi> improper, where there are no <hi>proper parts.</hi> And I doubt not, when he gives place to cooler thoughts, he will see cause to qualify that assertion. For if he strictly mean <hi>that every thing that belongs to the Godhead</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:101170:30"/>
is <hi>in each Person</hi>; I see not how he will fetch himself from the <hi>Socinian consequence,</hi> that then each Person must have a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity subsisting in it, and be <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost.</hi> For I doubt not he will acknowledge that the <hi>entire Divinity</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And therefore he must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to an <hi>inadequate notion</hi> in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry case, when all is done, how much soever he hath contended against it. I do however think it safe and free from any other difficulty, than we unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have, in conceiving <hi>Infinites.</hi> To say that all perfection is in each <hi>subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent</hi> (which I like better than <hi>subsistence,</hi> as more expressive of the <hi>concrete</hi>) as far as their <hi>natural, necessary, eternal</hi> order, <hi>towards one another,</hi> as the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>fountain or radix,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> from <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> from <hi>both,</hi> can possibly admit. All <hi>must be</hi> originally <hi>in the Father,</hi> with whom, the <hi>other two</hi> have that intimate, vital, eternal union, that what is in him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101170:30"/>
the other communicate therein, in as full perfection as is inconceivable, and more than it is possible for us, or for any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mind to conceive. Therefore since that <hi>difference</hi> which only proceeds from that <hi>natural, eternal order,</hi> is conjecturable only, but is really unknown, unreveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inscrutable; it is better, herein, to confess the imperfection of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have, than to boast that which we have not, or aspire to that which we cannot have.</p>
