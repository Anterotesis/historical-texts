         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By one who was brought to hear him through Lying Reports.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>Are theſe my words that here are put in Print,</l>
               <l>'Tis God clears <hi>Fowler,</hi> I am Paſſive in't.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>SUrpris'd again am I! by things thus vain,</l>
               <l>I thought they had me wain'd, but now again</l>
               <l>My heart was caught with <hi>Fowler,</hi> and I Cry</l>
               <l>To think that he too, ſhould be Vanity;</l>
               <l>Whom none could ſilence, but Death, and that dull Pit,</l>
               <l>Bare Sickneſs could not keep him from the Pulpit.</l>
               <l>O how his hearers mourn! by ſight I ſpeak,</l>
               <l>'Tis well each full. Heart can at two Eyes Leak.</l>
               <l>Their weepings ſuch, a Parrellel I lack,</l>
               <l>where all are Mourners, though but few in Black.</l>
               <l>He us'd to ſit with them, hear at Chriſt's Table,</l>
               <l>In a low ſeat, though he was Honourable.</l>
               <l>Chriſt ſaw him ſo, and ſaid unto him Friend,</l>
               <l>Come ſit here with me at the upper End.</l>
               <l>Now he with worſhip is gon to that Throne</l>
               <l>He knew ſo well, yet he was better known.</l>
               <l>But O how dark Gods Houſe grows in our day,</l>
               <l>A laſs, our Landlord takes our Lights away.</l>
               <l>My Eyes are Dim, or elſe in my Souls ſight,</l>
               <l>This Window lately ſtopt, gave in great light:</l>
               <l>The Sun-ſhon Clear through him, he was a Man,</l>
               <l>Who as a Pillar for Gods Truth did ſtand.</l>
               <l>He had much grace, yet underſtand a right,</l>
               <l>Chriſt was the Supper, he did but Invite.</l>
               <l>Ah! he could ſpeak the ſpeech of <hi>Canaans</hi> Land,</l>
               <l>None but Chriſts-Schollers him could underſtand.</l>
               <l>Though many came to hear, from Satan's School,</l>
               <l>'Twas ſuch did tearm this Uſher ſuch a Fool;</l>
               <l>But it's to them Chriſt threatneth Hell Fire,</l>
               <l>And till you meet the Judg, he doth Retire,</l>
               <l>Leaving his two laſt Sermons for your Warning,</l>
               <l>His dying Words was, Lord, forgive their Scorning.</l>
               <l>But <hi>England, England,</hi> we fear ſad's thy hap,</l>
               <l>Thy Hedg is broke, yet few do ſee the Gap.</l>
               <l>Much wrath ſure comes together, cauſe God makes</l>
               <l>The Gap yet wider, pulling up more ſtakes.</l>
               <l>Which doth preſage no good, it ſhould affright,</l>
               <l>To ſee thy Watch thus drop in thy Midnight;</l>
               <l>This Watchman did give warning, whilſt he ſtood</l>
               <l>That Sin would Ruin, therefore will thy Blood.</l>
               <l>If thou miſcarry, he on the right Shelf,</l>
               <l>Not on the Watchman, but upon thy Self,</l>
               <l>Did he not ſay Chriſt came and took our Evils,</l>
               <l>To overthrow both Power and Work of Devils.</l>
               <l>Shall we maintain, O then, that Wickedneſs,</l>
               <l>That put a Saviour under ſuch diſtreſs;</l>
               <l>O no dear Lord, we muſt be holy here,</l>
               <l>If we be happy when we diſappear.</l>
               <l>Did he not ſay, had God made thee a Beaſt,</l>
               <l>Doubtleſs thy being would at Death have ceaſt.</l>
               <l>But there's no help, now God hath made thee Man,</l>
               <l>But thou muſt be allways, do what thou Can.</l>
               <l>Did he not ſay, there's nought but Sin God hates,</l>
               <l>And none can Love it that to him relates.</l>
               <l>Did he not ſay, ſuch Faith is but a Cheat</l>
               <l>Which thoſe pretend, yet can uſe deceit.</l>
               <l>Can Swear, can Drink, can Scoff, can Lye, can Whore,</l>
               <l>Yet ſay they hope to beſav'd evermore.</l>
               <l>Did he not ſay true Faith, and Holyneſs,</l>
               <l>Shew forth each other, breath doth Life Expreſs,</l>
               <l>We might as well go take heat from the Sun,</l>
               <l>As Works from true Faith where it is begun.</l>
               <l>He told of Hell, he ſaid that men might Fear,</l>
               <l>Yea know it's Torment, and might not go there.</l>
               <l>Did he not ſay Eternity makes haft</l>
               <l>To us in Scripture, and we run as faſt</l>
               <l>To it in courſe of nature, it's a wonder</l>
               <l>If two thus runing, can be long a ſunder;</l>
               <l>How light he thought this World, is evident,</l>
               <l>With Food and Raiment we ſhould be content.</l>
               <l>The whole Creation he ſaid with its ſtore,</l>
               <l>Can give but this, and we can uſe no more.</l>
               <l>Such as know Sin, do underſtand Chriſts merrit,</l>
               <l>A Pardon ſuits with a condemned Spirit.</l>
               <l>Did he not preſs us to ſee God in all,</l>
               <l>In <hi>Shimea's</hi> Curſe <hi>David</hi> did hear God call.</l>
               <l>Afflictions do not riſe out of the duſt,</l>
               <l>Thoſe that know God, do know him to be juſt.</l>
               <l>Moſt of Chriſts Sermons was 'gainſt meer juſt men,</l>
               <l>Our danger lies in lawful things, O then,</l>
               <l>As he would ſay, the Ox, the Farm, the Wife,</l>
               <l>Kept moſt from taſting of the bread of Life.</l>
               <l>Yet he did Preach good works, the only thing,</l>
               <l>But yet to truſt in, he made Chriſt our King,</l>
               <l>Did he not prove God's Laws to be our Rule,</l>
               <l>And Chriſt our Righteouſneſs, who on a Mule</l>
               <l>Rid to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> went weeping thus,</l>
               <l>To give ſuch Righteouſneſs, God firſt gave us.</l>
               <l>A perfect one Gods Law on us requires,</l>
               <l>And we in this may anſwer its deſires.</l>
               <l>Did he not humbly pray, when he had done,</l>
               <l>If its my Fancy, that from me now run.</l>
               <l>Lord ſcatter it, yea, let it be as duſt</l>
               <l>To tread upon, that none to it may truſt.</l>
               <l>But if it's truth ſpoke from the word of truth,</l>
               <l>A meſſage from the Lord; then let both youth</l>
               <l>And old Age two live to it, elſe he told,</l>
               <l>That very Word in Judgment would take hold.</l>
               <l>Yea, he would ſay, we hear the word as man's,</l>
               <l>and that's the reaſon it for little ſtands.</l>
               <l>Though it's a Treaſure that through Pipes doth drain,</l>
               <l>And it's our Joy, its Spring doth yet remain:</l>
               <l>How full, yet mild, he anſwered any doubt,</l>
               <l>Though ſome quear'd as he Preach't, to put him out.</l>
               <l>He Preach'd one Sermon laſted thirty year,</l>
               <l>By a good Life he did his doctrine clear.</l>
               <l>In ſeaſon, yea and out, this Teacher Taught,</l>
               <l>Yet was he not for this to Heaven brought.</l>
               <l>His guiſts could not be pent in by a glaſs,</l>
               <l>Only Gods Spirit he their bounder was.</l>
               <l>What ſhall we ſay, his hearers ſo lament,</l>
               <l>It ſpeaks he gave them more then bare content.</l>
               <l>He was a man for Learning, Grace and Guifts,</l>
               <l>To ſet up Chriſt, few like to <hi>Fowler</hi> lifts;</l>
               <l>Yea we will yeild he was the Drunkards Song,</l>
               <l>Yea the Proſane men's Scoff he dwelt among.</l>
               <l>As <hi>David</hi> was, then ſure theſe went one way,</l>

               <l>For Scripture Language, Scoffers would him Scoff,</l>
