            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A full and true Account, of the Behaviours, Confeſſions, and last
Dying Speeches of the Condemn'd Criminals, that were Executed
at Tyburn, on Friday <date>the 24th of May, 1700.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN Shirly,</hi> alias <hi>Davis,</hi> 22 Years old,
Condemn'd for Firing the Houſe of Dr.
<hi>Sloan;</hi> being examin'd ſaid, that he was
Deſcended of a good Family, that his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who tenderly loved him, Educated him
at School a conſiderable time, but growing Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong,
he ran away from them, and Liſted
himſelf a Soldier, for ſeveral Years he ſerved
abroad in that Station, and at laſt, having got
Acquaintance with the Surgeon of a Regiment,
he pretended to practice that Art, which brought
him in no ſmall Profit; but being Viciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd,
liv'd at ſuch a rate, that his Incomes
could not anſwer his unneceſſary and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Expences, which caus'd him to rack his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
how to ſupport his profuſe way of
Living; this made him liſten to bad Advice,
and to turn a deaf Ear to that wholſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
which they who knew his Parents frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave him. The great Enemy of Mankind
provided ſome Accomplices for him, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſum'd their Subſtance with riotous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
were willing to undertake any wicked
Action that might ſupport their craving Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances:
To this Gang he willingly aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
himſelf, and committed ſeveral Robberies
and Burglaries, more than he could remember:
At length they reſolv'd to break open this Houſe
in <hi>Bloomsbury-Square,</hi> which they attempted in
ſeveral Places, but could not effect; then they
reſolv'd to burn it; and accordingly one of them
ſtruck a Light, and cut a little Door into Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then breaking the Glaſs and part of the
Wood in the Window, ſet a Candle to it, which
cauſ'd the Window to blaze: Their Deſign as
he ſaid, was to throw Stones at the upper Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
to awaken the Family when the Fire
had got a Head, and ſo under Pretence of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to carry away their beſt Goods, and Rob
them of all that was valuable. I preſt him very
often to diſcover whether he was concern'd in
that great Fire in <hi>Red-lion Fields,</hi> putting him
in mind, that there is no denying or leſſening
his Sins before God, who was privy to all his
Thoughts and Deſigns, and knows all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tho' never ſo ſecretly committed, and no
human Eye ſaw him. But he ſtill denyed that
he was any ways concern'd in it, only that he
was preſent when it was burning, and got a
ſilver Candleſtick, a Caſe of Piſtols, and ſome
other things. He did not ſeem at firſt ſo well
affected with his Condition as could be wiſhed;
but afterwards he returned to a better Mind, and
wiſht that he had a longer ſpace to live, that ſo
he might teſtifie his Sincerity, by leading a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Life for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip Wake,</hi> Convicted for the ſame, confeſt
his Crime, and gave an account of it much
after the ſame manner, only with this Adition,
that <hi>Davis</hi> was the Projector of it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
them to do it, when they reſolv'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.
He added, that he was an old Offender,
had made ſeveral Reſolutions, to forſake his evil
Courſes, but as often broke them: His Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
did not permit him to ſpeak much, but he
ſeem'd very attentive to good Advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Walters,</hi> Condemn'd for ſeveral Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
Was an Apprentice to a Merchant, but
leading a diſſolute debaucht Life, his Maſter
turn'd him away; then he went to his old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who prevail'd with him to go abroad
with them, where he committed a great many
baſe, notorious Actions. He complain'd of the
tedious Confinement he underwent, and how
troubleſome it was to him, who was always a
buſie ſtirring Perſon: But he was put in mind
that he ſhou'd by no means once fancy, that he
muſt lie in that doleful Place, ſhut out from all
Buſineſs, and condemn'd as it were to a ſtate of
Idleneſs; but that he ſhould ſet himſelf with all
his might, to mind the one thing neceſſary, the
great Work of Repentance, and making his Peace
with Almighty God; for this would cut out work
enough for him, and of more Comfort and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to his Soul, than any other Employment
which he had formerly been uſed to. He was
alſo told, that he ſtood now upon the very brink
of Eternity, and muſt ſhortly appear before the
Tribunal of God, which is infinitely more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than that of any earthly Judge can be; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it became him, with all the ſeriouſneſs that
is poſſible, to prepare himſelf for ſo dreadful an
Appearance; to which he reply'd, that he had
a good Education, and underſtood theſe matters
very well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Titt,</hi> 24 Years old, Convicted for Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary.
He ſerv'd his Maſter (who was a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
very Faithfully, but being made free, he
unfortunately met with ſome Acquaintance
which entic'd him to Drink to exceſs, and ſo
neglecting his lawful Calling, being reduc'd to
want, was the more eaſily prevail'd with to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this Fact, the only one of that Nature, (as
he ſaid) he ever was Guilty of. His Life of late
was very irregular, addicted to Swearing, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Debauchery, for which he ſaid he was
exceeding ſorrowful, and that his Vices were now
as deteſtable in his ſight, as before they ſeem'd
pleaſant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Hatchman,</hi> aged 15 Years, Convicted for
the ſame, confeſt his Crime, and ſaid that <hi>Titt</hi>
meeting him in <hi>Southwark,</hi> made him Drunk, and
then brought him along with them to break open
the Houſe. He denyed he ever was concern'd
with ſuch Perſons any more, and Promiſes if he be
Tranſported, to lead a better Life for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Cooper,</hi> Condemn'd for the ſame. He was
ſeiz'd with the Jayl-Diſtemper, which is a violent
Feaver, attended with a delirious Light-headed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo was not in a capacity to give any
Account of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph Fiſher,</hi> 48 Years old, Born in <hi>Cornwal,</hi>
Condemn'd for Burglary, was a Seaman, and
ſerv'd aboard in the <hi>Royal-Navy,</hi> and as he ſaid, did once</p>
