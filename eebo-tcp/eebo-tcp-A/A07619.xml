         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Immediatly after his decease, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose an odious controuersie betweene the Scottes and the olde inhabitants for the gouernement, euery nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to haue a gouernour of their owne blood, which contention enduring long time, at last they created two Gouernors, betweene whom was continuall battels and great slaughter on eyther side, through ambition and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning desire to be sole Gouernor of all Ireland. After long and dangerous battels, the two people broken with sundry displeasures, were constrained to take peace; howbeit the same endured but a short time, each one of them pursuing other with battell; and yet they dwelt many yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by enterchange of peace and warres, while at the last the Scots suffering many iniuries, sent their Embassador to METELLIVS, who was then King of the Scottes in Spaine, desiring to haue support against the old inhabitants of Ireland, declaring them to be a rude wilde people, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to suffer any Empire aboue them; So that the Scots can haue no tranquility, vnlesse the said people were the more speedily tamed and subdued. This foresaid message was the more acceptable to the King <hi>Metellius:</hi> for it concerned the Common-wealth both of the Scots nation in Spaine and Ireland, descending (by long progression) of our lineage and blood, and willingly satisfying the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

But too great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity engendreth euill maners, and causeth men to worke often displeasures vpon themselues, finding no forraigne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to inuade them at home. The people after long peace were diuided for the gouernement, contending for the same with great rigour and slaughter on both sides, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the one had almost vtterly destroyed the other, if they had not been reconciled by a noble man, named <hi>Thanaus,</hi> principall Ambassadour, sent by the King, then raigning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Scots in Spaine (reioycing of the felicity succeeding to his friends) and to cause them by his prudent consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to encrease together vnder one minde. <hi>Thanaus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a prudent man, bearing nuturall affection to both the parties, perswading them at sundry conuentions to remoue all contention, and to elect one (whom they thought most expedient) to be their King, and to be obedient to him in all their gouernment. Through this perswasion the whole people had such feruent desire to haue one King, that all olde iniuries being forgotten, they appointed <hi>Thanaus</hi> to elect a King, whom he thought most expedient) and hee seeing their mindes willing to haue a nuturall King, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them that there is in Spaine a noble Prince of great seuerity and iustice, named SIMON BREK, well accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

            <p>ROTHESAY was the first King that brought Scots with him into <hi>Albion.</hi> The first Isle that he inhabited he called after his owne name <hi>Rothesay,</hi> the remanent Isles were called <hi>Hebredes:</hi> after <hi>Hiber</hi> the eldest sonne of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus.</hi>

               <hi>Rothesay</hi> hearing the death of his father <hi>Nathasil,</hi> returned into Ireland, and was there crowned King. The yeare that Scots were brought out of Ireland into <hi>Albion,</hi> was from the Empire of <hi>Simon Brek</hi> in Ireland 216. yeares: from the beginning of the world 3530. The Scots spread in sundry parts of <hi>Albion,</hi> lying farre North, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Isles. The first part that they tooke possession of was named <hi>Ardgael,</hi> from <hi>Gathelus,</hi> which now is called <hi>Ardgile.</hi> They being diuided into sundry Tribes, elected certaine Captaines to euery Tribe, to gouerne them both in peace and warre, hauing the name of their Captaine in great reuerence, swearing by their names; which custome was long obserued in those Isles and the high lands. Then after about 150. yeares, a banished people named Pickes, came forth of Denmarke to search a dwelling place, and after they were inhibited to land in Fraunce, Britaine, and Ireland. They landed in <hi>Albion,</hi> first in <hi>Orknay,</hi> of olde called the olde Realme of the Pickes. The Seas betweene <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Caithnes</hi> is called <hi>Pentland Firth,</hi> &amp; the lands now called <hi>Loutheane</hi> (was of old called <hi>Pentland)</hi> after the name of the Pickes. Then after they came into <hi>Caithnes, Ros, Murray, Merms, Angus, Fiffe</hi> and <hi>Loutheaue,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all the olde inhabitants. They were a Ciuill people right ingenuous andcrafty both in peace and warres. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their planting in the aforesaid parts, they elected a King to gouerne them, and hold them in iustice, and made great policy in building of munitions, townes, and Castles. And because they knew all people, without issue to succeede, should perish, they sent their Ambassadours to the Scots, to haue their daughters in marriage, shewing (though they were of strange blood) they should not be so smally regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, seeing they with no lesse prudence then manhood haue sustained incredible dangers both by Sea and land. And now lately conquered (through the beneuolence of the Gods) right plenteous lands with such peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, that no other people may claime them by reason:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1569:7"/>
Trusting surely (if the Gods support them) by their owne industry to be equall to any their neighbors, both in peace and warre. Further if the Scots condescended to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable desires, it might be they encreasing together (so strong vnder one bloud) that they might resist the fury of their enemies the better, when it hapned them to be inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This Ambassage was not pleasant to the Scots at the first, thinking it vnworthy to haue any society or marriage with an vnknowne and banished people: but by graue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisement, and being profoundly resolued, and finding themselues as yet not able to resist the force of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines their olde enemies, they determined to giue their daughters to the Pickes in marriage, and to haue a band of peace with them, with conditions that euery one of them shall enioy the lands which perteyned vnto them before the marriage, and to concurre together with their whole puissance, as oft as they were inuaded by enemies. Any that did offence to any of them should be reputed as enemy to them both. And as often as the Crowne of the Pictes should come in question for lacke of an heire, the King to be elected of the neerest of the womans bloud. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions accepted on all sides, the Scots gaue their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in marriage to the Pictes. The Britaines suspecting this marriage, and dreading the encreasing of this confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate people vnder one bloud in short time, that neyther might the Britaines for the time present, nor their posterity resist the puissance of these two vnited people. Therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minded to destroy them both, and to inuade them with fraudulent sleights, rather then with any force of battell. And sending their Ambassadorus to the Pictes, allured the Pictes to violate their band with the Scots. By great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion &amp; crafty dealing of the Britains, the band was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued; &amp; mouing occasion of battel against the Scots, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by general edict, no Scots to be found in their bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds at a prefixed day, vnder paine of death. The day being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, all Scots within their bounds were killed without

               </gap>ce. In this manner the peace dissolued, the Pictes denounced battell to the Scots: then after followed continuall incursions and inuasions on eyther parties. The Scots assembling in <hi>Ardgiel,</hi> were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently resolued, that the battell that they were to holde, was not onely against the Pictes, but also against the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Therefore it was agreed, to send their Ambassadors to their ancient progenitors and friends in Ireland, to haue their support and counsaile in this most dangerous matter, and for that plurality of Captaines (as often occurreth) rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth sedition: the best is to elect one to haue Empire aboue the rest, by whose manhood and counsaile, they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their liues and liberties, against a false and periured people, inuading them without any occasion. The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours being directed to Ireland, complained of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked offence done by the Pictes, and desired support.</p>
            <p>FERQVHARDVS (then being King of the Scots in Ireland) greatly moued for the displeasure done to his friends in <hi>Albion,</hi> sent his sonne.</p>
            <p>FERGVSIVS a wise and valiant Prince, with many valiant souldiers, and to giue them the more esperance, and assurance of permanent and good fortune, hee sent with them the fatall Marble chaire. <hi>Fergusius</hi> was the more pleasantly receiued by the Scots of <hi>Albion,</hi> because their Common-wealth approched to great danger, by a most perillous apparant battell. Then after a Councell was called in <hi>Ardgiel,</hi> where <hi>Fergusius</hi> made a large Oration, and acceptable Speech. Therefore by graue consultation, they condiscended to be gouerned by Empire of one King, as well in peace as in any trouble appearing against their enemies. Furthermore to remoue all suspition of hatred (because euery Tribe desired, a King of their owne linage) they elected <hi>Fergusius,</hi> both for his noble bloud, and other
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1569:8"/>
his excellent vertues, to be their King: moreouer he was so approued in martiall deedes and iustice, that no Captaine of the Tribes might be any wayes compared vnto him.</p>
            <p>FERGVSIVS the first King of Scots (in <hi>Albion,</hi> now called Scotland) sonne to <hi>Ferquhard</hi> King of Ireland, was crowned in the fatall Marble Chaire, which hee brought with him (by respons of the Gods) to establish his reigne in Scotland. The yeare from the creation of the world 3641. Before the comming of Christ 330. In the first yeare of the 112. <hi>Olimpiade.</hi> In the 421. yeare after the building of Rome, about the beginning of the third Monarchy. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the great vanquished <hi>Darius</hi> the last Monarch of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the reigne of <hi>Chimarus</hi> King of Britaine, the King employed his whole minde to resist the iniury of this battell, moued by the Pictes; hee calling all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ordeyned them to be prepared with forty dayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision. To passe with him, he made an greement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongst all his Nobles and Captaines, commanding his people to be obedient to their Captaines, hee making sacrifice to his Gods (as the custome was) praying the Gods to take vengeance of the partie that was the first occasion of battell against other, and to graunt him such felicity in his iust defence; that victory might succeed to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great damage of his people. The Picts assembled an army, wich many Britaines concurring to their support, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on eyther side a wicked &amp; vnnatural battel between two confederate people, friends, fathers and sonnes.

The Danes and Norway people kept pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session

of them for the space of 160. yeares: and then King <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, ouercomming the Danes and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way men in a great battell, thrust them out of the Iles: yet afterward they attempted to recouer their libertie, partly, trusting to their owne strength; and partly, mooued by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the maine land of this Countrey, creating Kings of themselues, as not long ago, <hi>Iohn</hi> (of the house of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donald)</hi> did vsurpe the name of King, as others had done before. In foode, raiment, and all things pertaining to their family, they vse the ancient frugalitie of the Scots.</p>
               <p>Their bankets are hunting and fishing. They seeth their flesh in the tripe, or else in the skinne of the beast, filling the same full of water. Now and then in hunting, they straine out the bloud, and eate the flesh raw. Their drinke is the broth of sodden flesh.

They wrap themselues in their owne plaids, so taking their rest: carefull indeed, lest that barbarous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of the maine Land (as they tearme it) corrupt their naturall and Countrey hardnesse.</p>
               <p>Their armour wherewith they couer their bodies in time of warre, is an Iron Bonnet, and an Habbergion, side almost euen to their heeles. Their weapons against their enemies, are bowes and arrowes. The arrowes are for the most part hooked, with a barble on either side, which once entered within the body, cannot be drawne forth againe, vnlesse the wound bee made wider. Some of them fight with broad swords and axes. In place of a drum they vse a bag-pipe. They delight much in musicke, but chiefly in Harpes and Clairschoes of their owne fashion. The strings of the Clairschoes are made of brasse-wire, and the strings of the Harpes, of sinewes: which strings, they strike either with their nailes, growing long; or else with an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed for that vse. They take great pleasure to decke their Harpes and Clairschoes with siluer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones: and poore ones, that cannot attaine heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, decke them with Cristall. They sing verses pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compounded, containing (for the most part) prayses of valiant men. There is not almost any other argument, whereof their rimes entreat.

Among the Rockes growes the delectable Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, called, <hi>Succinum,</hi> with great resort of the Mertrik, for costly Furrings.
