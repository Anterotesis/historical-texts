            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THat there ſhould be a ſort of people ſo Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically wicked, as to defy the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of both <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Strangers, Friends</hi> and <hi>Enemies,</hi> as it is the reproach of the Chriſtian name, ſo doth it ſound very harſh to a Chriſtian conſideration. Who are meant by this character the enſuing Treatiſes will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe, who, not ſatisfied with any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle under that of the SOCIETY of JESUS, ſeem to carry on the deſign of ANTICHRIST, inſtead of profiting by the DISCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ERIES perpetually made of them and their <hi>practiſes,</hi> prove the greateſt <hi>perſecutors</hi> of thoſe that are their <hi>Remembrancers,</hi> betray <hi>vengeance</hi> where they ſhould <hi>remorſe,</hi> and turne all <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgement</hi> into <hi>exaſperation.</hi> This was the effect of the diſcovery made of their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maximes by the Authour of the PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>INCIALL LETTERS, (a book better known in Engliſh under the title of the MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERY of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ITISME) which, though containing their Tenents faithfully ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their owne works, they by their
<pb facs="tcp:35086:4"/>
interest in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> got prohibited; as if the ſame things were horrid in the citations of thoſe they thought their adverſaries, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in their Books, as may appeare by the Printing and reprinting of them ſo often. To maintain the doing of an evil action to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and juſtifiable, is, no doubt, more horrid and Satanicall, then ſimply to do it, <hi>this</hi> may plead temptation, ignorance, company, and the like, <hi>that</hi> ſpeaks the baſeſt of complyances, and a depraved deſign, if not an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation from all vertue and Religion. Whence it accordingly comes to paſſe, that thoſe, who are ſimply guilty of evill actions, haply of the higheſt nature, are ſeldome ſeen to juſtifie their exorbitances, but inclin'd to a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and acknowledgement thereof; and that ſuch, whoſe extravagant maximes give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to crimes, muſt be thought either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ready to practice what they teach, or the lewdeſt of hypocrites, for egging on others to that which they boggle at themſelves. But when the ſame perſons are both the encouragers and actors of things impious and abominable, what can be ſaid leſſe of them, then that they have ſhaken off all ſentiments of Goodneſſe, and, as Agents of <hi>Satan,</hi> ſeem to make it their buſineſſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert mankind from all reflection of good and evill.</p>
                  <p>Thus much premiſed as to the <hi>Perſons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:35086:4"/>
whom the ſeverall pieces of this COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTION are directed, we ſhall, for the Readers ſatisfaction, give a brief account of each of them, ſuch as may be thought requiſite or pertinent to the preſent deſign, though that labour be not neceſſary in relation to any ſo much as the two firſt.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> which ſo confidently brings them upon the SCAFFOLD, for ſeverall crimes committed by them in the Province of <hi>Guienne,</hi> I am to ſay ſomewhat, in the firſt place of the <hi>Author,</hi> ſecondly of the <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> made by him, and laſtly, of the <hi>credit</hi> to be given thereto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Author is <hi>Peter Jarrigius,</hi> a Member ſometime of the SOCIETY, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſon among them, admitted for his great abilities to the <hi>fourth Vow,</hi> the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour attainable upon the account of perſonall merit. All which notwithſtanding, he wanted not either his diſſatisfactions or diſcontents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, inſomuch that he entertained thoughts of forſaking both the <hi>Order</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> treated ſecretly with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and, at laſt, as he acknowledges himſelf, on the <hi>25.</hi> of <hi>December 1647.</hi> embraced the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> Perſuaſion at <hi>Rochel,</hi> where he could not ſtay long, by reaſon of the violent proſecutions of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> againſt him, upon his deſertion of the
<pb facs="tcp:35086:5"/>
                     <hi>Romane</hi> Church. So that, frighted thereby, he was forced to fly into <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſettled himſelf at <hi>Leyden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus gotten out of their clutches, they continued their violent proſecutions againſt him, crying him down in the pulpit, rayling at him in their writings, and filling all places with a noiſe of his Apoſtacy, proportionable to the Order he had quitted, his own eminence, and their exaſperation, inſomuch that at laſt, they prevailed ſo farre with the ſecular power as to get him hang'd <hi>in effigie,</hi> for a pretended ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which he makes it his buſineſſe to cleare himſelfe of in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Treatiſe. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of theirs obliging him to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vindication of himſelfe, and for the edification of his new Brethren of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med way, he put out the <hi>firſt</hi> Treatiſe, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it a probable courſe to cleare himſelf, to retort upon them, for that one of pretended <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi> faſten'd upon him, a charge of ſeverall horrid crimes of a far higher nature. Not long after which came out the <hi>ſecond</hi> Piece, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſomewhat written againſt him by <hi>James Beauſes,</hi> by the directions of the <hi>Society.</hi> And ſo much for the motive of his <hi>diſcovery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>credit</hi> to be given thereto; I ſhall not, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, urge the unlikelyhood there is, that, making an exchange of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion in things ſacred, though granted to fall
<pb facs="tcp:35086:5"/>
from the more to the leſſe certain, he ſhould own ſo little ſentiment of ſincerity and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as, out of pure malice to the Profeſſion he was of before, and to be revenged of the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> to faſten on them ſuch things as were purely the excreſcencies of his own invention and calumny. Nor, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> how improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, he ſhould put ſo great an affront on the <hi>States Generall,</hi> to whom he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his Work, and all of the Perſuaſion he embraced, as falſely to impoſe things ſo horrid upon others, though his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they were not really guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Nor <hi>laſtly,</hi> how hard it is to impoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing upon the <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> and the few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances there is of any thing done in that kind. But the credit it ſhall have, ſhall riſe from their proceeding thereupon, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly let the Reader judge, whether JAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S be an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> or the JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUITS ſuch as he deſcribes them, TRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORS, MURTHERERS, SATYR, SODOMITES, &amp;e.</p>
                  <p>When men are aſperſed and calumniated by ſtories digeſted into particulars and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch as upon the firſt ſight whereof the perſon that heares them concludes the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to be a very cheat, or that the thing muſt agree with the relation, they, if innocent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

take this courſe to vindicate themſelves. They very ſtrictly examine the particulars, diſcover the inconſiſtency of circumſtances, (it being impoſſible for a man to be ſo circumſpect in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulariſing a long, if falſe, narration, as not to let ſlip ſomething, whereby he may be ſurpriz'd) and, truly clearing up things, convince the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of <hi>impoſture,</hi> and ſatisfie the world of their <hi>innocence.</hi> Now be this rule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the proceedings of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> with <hi>Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigius.</hi> He layes down ſtories of ſuch and ſuch, particularizes them into circumſtances, gives you the time, the place, the names of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons engaged therein, and does all that's requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make a relation plauſible. Have they ſifted all theſe, and thereby diſcovered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency thereof, and accordingly cleared themſelves, by retorting the infamy upon the detractor? No ſuch thing appears. What then? They raile at him in their Sermons, make him the verieſt rogue upon earth, in their diſcourſes and writings, and repreſent him as an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> in Religion, a <hi>Heretick,</hi> a <hi>malefactor</hi> banged in <hi>effigie,</hi> and conſequently a bold <hi>calumniator,</hi> that is, a perſon to whom no credit is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and accordingly themſelves cleard, of all the crimes layd by him to their charge. This is the <hi>Jeſuiticall</hi> way of Vindication.</p>

All this is true. But this is no more then another branch of <hi>Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> vindication, that is, ſignifies very little; and yet they cannot but be ſenſible, that the world is not ſo eaſily gull'd, as to be perſuaded they are to give more beliefe to the <hi>Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> then to the <hi>relations</hi> of <hi>Jarrigius.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation is indeed ſo liberall, that it betrayes the artifices of thoſe that contrived it, which gave a certain Clergy man occaſion to tell a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Society</hi> ſpeaking of it, <hi>That they had overſhot themſelves in it, and had been better vindicated had the</hi> Retractation <hi>been more modeſt,</hi> and raiſes a ſuſpition in many others, that, not onely the <hi>World,</hi> but even <hi>Jarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> himſelfe is <hi>impos'd upon</hi> in that piece, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein brought to deny, what he had with the greateſt profeſſions of truth and ſincerity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not long before.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus having given an account what judgement is to be made of the <hi>firſt</hi> piece, which onely they could make any advantage of, I ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>have little to ſay to the reſt. And of the <hi>ſecond</hi> onely this, that though it be but a private bickering between a <hi>reall</hi> and a <hi>revolted</hi> Jeſuit, <hi>Jarrigius</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aufes,</hi> yet many things relating to the <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> as alſo the violence of their proſecutions when once exaſperated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſionally to be treated, ſomewhat will be met with, which may not haply be ſo obvious elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is a piece of their own, containing the SECRET INSTRUCTIONS for the <hi>Superiours</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> and ſo they have nothing to quarrell at, unleſſe at that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> which ordered the unexpected diſcovery thereof ſo ſoon. All the world hath to wiſh, is, to know, what <hi>Additionals</hi> they have made to theſe Inſtructions, which ſeem calculated for the infancy of the <hi>Order,</hi> before it was grown up to that confidence in <hi>Maxime</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> it has thriven in ſince.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>fourth,</hi> nothing need to be added to the account given thereof immedia ely before it. Twas the advice of a <hi>Friend</hi> and ſhould up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that account have been the more <hi>kindly</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> came alſo from the hands of a Friend, one, as may be inferred from ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that might be an Engliſh man, by his familiarity with the ſtate and affaires of that Nation.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>laſt,</hi> I met with it at the latter end of a book called ELIXIR JESUITICUM, written by the ſame Author as writ that entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, SPECULUM JESUITICUM. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of that Author, I in ſome places confine my ſelf to, in others vary from, as I thought fit. Whether any thing be ſaid by way of <hi>remark,</hi> which is not pertinently derivable from the Text of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> I leave to the judgement of the ingenuous Reader, and for the <hi>authentica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it,</hi> he may conſult the fragment of Saint <hi>Hildegard's</hi> Life, which is, to that purpoſe, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd before it.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given the Reader a ſhort directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to every particular piece of this Collection, there remains onely a word to ſay to thoſe who are brought upon the ſtage therein. Either they are ſenſible of their miſcarriadges or not; if they are not, it is a friendly and Chriſtian work to be their remembrancers, that, when they are convinc'd thereof, they may avoid falling into the like. If they are ſenſible thereof, yet <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhame of acknowledgement, perſiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:35086:8"/>
no remonſtrance can be two ſtinging, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery too ſatyricall. But that there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter probability of the latter then the former, may appeare from what is ſaid by a <hi>Provinciall</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>Moravia,</hi> in a Letter to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Abbot, Counſellor to the Emperour, which, giving an account what judgement the world had of them, and conſequently who are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the miſchiefs that are done, it will not be amiſſe to inſert, and ſo conclude. <hi>Venit hora,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in qua, &amp;c. The time now draws nigh, wherein every one thinks he doth God good ſervice, when he ſuſpects, thinks, and ſpeaks of the</hi> JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ITS <hi>as if they were guilty of all things that are evil. Nor is there any</hi> Religious <hi>man of any other Order, no</hi> Politician, <hi>no</hi> Heretick <hi>will be perſuaded, that the</hi> JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ITS <hi>either live religiouſly, or ſpeak the truth.</hi>

                  <p>THe engagement I conceive lyes upon me to endeavour the ſafety and preſervation of a State, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its ſoveraignty immediately from God the Supreme Diſpoſer of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes, and the miraculous acqueſts of your victorious Swords, obliges me to caſt at your Lordſhips feet, a ſort of dangerous perſons that lurk <hi>incognito</hi> in your Dominions, and a parcell of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Tryators, dreſſed up like Saints, to the end that in your preſence they may,
<pb facs="tcp:35086:12"/>
to their confuſion, have the long robe of their hypocriſie ſtripped off their ſhoulders. You need onely conſider Looks to be ſatisfied they are your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſince they are <hi>Jefuits,</hi> and the bare diſcovery of their crimes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them ſuch as ought to find as little ſhelter in your Provinces as Tyrants and perſons maliciouſly reſolv'd to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon any that ly in their way.</p>
                  <p>The Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> looking on them as a publick contagion, baniſhed them their Territories in theſe imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms, <hi>Be gone, carry away nothing with you, and never returne again.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> many of the Society have come to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick execution (as <hi>Garnet</hi> &amp;c.) not in effigie, for pretended Sacriledges; but really and in perſon for manifect crimes of high Treaſon. <hi>France</hi> thruſt them out her boſome, ſo to provide for the ſafety of our Kings, and the infallible <hi>Parlement</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> which had paſſed the Act of baniſhment againſt them, have had ſince occaſion enough to curſe the repeale of it, when they bewayle the
<pb facs="tcp:35086:12"/>
untimely death of the greateſt King in the world. Nay your Highneſſes did not long ſince cauſe the Rector of their Colledge of <hi>Maeſtrich</hi> to be executed for apparent conſpiracies. And your ancient Ordinances, paſſed with no leſſe juſtice then prudence, forbid them upon pain of death from coming into any place under your juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe authentick Proviſions made againſt them be not a ſufficient intimation to raiſe a jealouſie of them, in all thoſe that have, in the ſeverall parts of the earth, the overſight of the publick weale, this impartiall Treatiſe which with all poſſible ſubmiſſion, I lay at the feet of your Highneſſes, can doe no leſſe then juſtifie and confirme, by new proofs, the judgements of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks that have condemned them; and open their eyes, who at this day do, as your Lordſhips, manage the common Intereſt, that ſo they may take into conſideration both the miſchievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their actions, and the impurity of their lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:35086:13"/>
I ſpeak nothing by conjecture, as a ſtranger to their wayes, but all I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce is from my own certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as having lived a mong them. The charges I put up againſt them, are not for ſome triviall miſcarriages; no, the crimes I lay at their doores ſpeak wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe in the exceſſe, unleſſe it can be imagined, that <hi>coyning</hi> is a frivolous fault, or to obſtruct the proſperity of their Soveraign, is an innocent piece of Gallantry. If your Highneſſes will be but pleaſed to afford your great minds ſo much remiſſion from your weightier affaires, as to peruſe theſe few pages, which I preſume to preſent you with, there you will find, not without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and aſtoniſhment, the inhabitants of <hi>Gomorrha</hi> revived, and the higheſt parts of <hi>Sodomy</hi> acted o're again: you will find, with no ſmall indignation, ſuch unnaturall ſubjects, as ſhall make bonefires, to expreſſe their ſatisfaction at the calamities of their Prince. The lamentable cryes of an infinite number of little children, made away by them,
<pb facs="tcp:35086:13"/>
to ſatisfie their cruell avarice, will no doubt pierce your hearts; and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples defiled by their abominable unclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes will kindle your zeale into a holy exaſperation againſt the ſacrilegious prophaners thereof.</p>
                  <p>It is not hard for me to foreſee the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure which the enemies of the light are likely to conceive at the freedome I take to dragg out of their darkneſſe to appear before a knowing and criticall age, a ſort of unſuſpected crimes; and that the partiſans and creatures of that Sect will conclude I have in me more fire then flegme, and that it ſpeaks ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my indiſcretion then my zeale to enter the liſts, alone, againſt ſo many enemies. But Truth, my Lords, which is ſtronger then any thing of man, forces me to ſpeak, and the welfare of your State requires as an acknowledgement of the obligations I owe you, this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of my fidelity, ſince I cannot but confeſſe my being and life the effects of your liberalitie and the protection of your armes. The noiſe which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb facs="tcp:35086:14"/>
have made, hath raiſed me out of the lethargy I was in, and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>proſecution againſt me hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from my mouth, what I had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhould otherwiſe have been ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered there.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35086:21"/>
the knife among the ruſhes that were under their feet, the goat ſtruggl'd ſo much that they found it again and thruſt it into her throat. I was retir'd hither, to a ſmall corner of <hi>Holland,</hi> to work out my own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in obſcurity, having renounc'd the trouble and diſtraction of humane affairs, as Bees make their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in their combs, or as thoſe excellent Architects built the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> without ſo much as the noiſe of hammer. They on the other ſide have made ſuch an hue-and-cry in their Pulpits after the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious perſon; they have made a ſearch after my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to and from all parts, out of hopes to find in them ſome matter of diſcontent whereon to ground my lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them; to be ſhort, they have put in indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt me, and ſo have, for my own juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, forc'd me to put in the ſame againſt them for the crimes I charge them with. Had they ſuffer'd me to be quiet, I ſhould have liv'd obſcure and unknown in a ſtrange Countrey, and they would have found it no great difficulty to have made the world believe me a perſon of no worth or parts; but now that they have forc'd me to write, people will find that I am not ſo contemptible as they would have me thought. With this into the bargain, that, if ever they effect, what they have yet onely in deſign, that is, remove me out of this world either by aſſaſſination or poyſon, as, I underſtand from all parts, they threaten, all <hi>France</hi> muſt needs be ſenſible of the iniquity of their proceedings.

When I was ſent to preach in their <hi>Priories,</hi> and was accordingly obliged to hear the complaints and lamentations of thoſe afflicted people whom the Agents of the ſociety had, by pure quillets and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Law, deprived of thoſe little inheritances which had quietly paſſed from Father to ſon. I could not forbear bluſhing, inſomuch, that the confuſion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35086:25"/>
wherewith my face was covered, proved an argument to thoſe innocent ſouls, that I had no hand in their rapines.</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt upon the particular proof of a truth, which the tears of ſo many that ſuffer thereby, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confirms, it ſhall be enough to produce one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by way of argument that ſhall take away all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and further objection. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> having taken poſſeſſion of the Priory of St. <hi>Macaire</hi> upon the <hi>Garonne,</hi> at a time when it was worth but five hundred Crowns <hi>per ann.</hi> they have found out ſo many inventions to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, that it is at this day very well worth twelve thouſand Livers a year: which how it could be brought to that height without the deſtruction of houſes and ruine of Families, I leave it to be conſidered. The Mannor-book which <hi>Francis Souiller</hi> made of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements of that Benefice, heretofore ſo little and now ſo big, diſcovers much of their earneſtneſs in diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Tenants. And if the Parlement of Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux take no courſe to curb their inſatiable avarice, they are in ſome thoughts to dig up all the poſts on which are faſtened the Tolls and cuſtomes of the old Dukes of <hi>Guienne,</hi> or to ſet up new ones if need be, ſo to graſp all the eſtates of the Country. Hence comes it, that when they have once found out by their ſubtle inſinuations that ſome poor Labourer hath nothing to defend his title, they deſire no more, they preſently fall upon him, they produce ſome old manuſcript and preſently devour him. But to preſs this point more home, we will make it appear how they graſp at other men's eſtates by manifeſt forgeries.</p>

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull Provinciall, was extreamly deceived, when he took <hi>Peter Dubois</hi> for a fearfull man, and a perſon unable to mannage an affaire of any conſequence, for he afterwards found by experience, that he, though a <hi>Limouſin</hi> borne, was none of the weakeſt kind of men.

All which paſt, he engaged him to ſecrecy, for feare, ſaid he, <hi>that ſome one of us may come to be hanged for it.</hi> And yet for all this, the crime had not come abroad, but that God, who of many forgeries, is pleaſed that ſome ſhould come to light, ſo ordered things, that the Provincial muſt needs perſecute the ſaid <hi>Dubois,</hi> and that with ſo much injuſtice, that thoſe who heard the bloody rebukes he cauſed to be given him, during the whole time of Dinner, he having cauſed him to kneele down at that which they call the low table to receive them, could not forbeare the ſhedding of teares thereat, but above all, thoſe, who had been ſecret witneſſes to the verification of the Antedate by the ſaid <hi>Rivere,</hi> perceiving the implacable fury of a guilty Provinciall, treating with ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity an innocent ſubject, gave the glory unto God, and, formally proving to the generall <hi>Mutius Vitteleſchi</hi> the truth of the falſification, demanded juſtice.

What then may be concluded from all this, but that it is cleare, as noone-day, by an illuſtrious example of juſtice, that that Body which pretends to ſo much purity, is convicted of the moſt horrid falſifications. For the ancient anſwer is not to be allowed in this caſe, <hi>that crimes are to be attributed only to particulars;</hi> here the <hi>Provinciall</hi> acts, as repreſenting the whole body, in the quality of head thereof, and <hi>Sabbatheri</hi> in the quality of principall Procurator, and the moſt conſiderable perſon in relation to temporall affaires. Both theſe eminent men in a buſineſſe of very great conſequence commit an Antidate. Such as are guilty only of triviall Falſifications are taken, but great ones eſcape. It concernes the publick weale of the ſtate, that care ſhould be taken, that theſe devourers of widdowes eſtates and Houſes ſhould at laſt be ſurprized in their Villanies, that ſo there may be a check given to their violence and covetouſneſſe, and ſome quietneſſe may be afforded thoſe many perſons that are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and undone by their continuall vexatious ſuits at Law.</p>

                     <p>To inſiſt particularly on the ſeverall wayes which they have found out to diſpatch the greateſt part of theſe Innocents, is a buſineſſe of more then ordinary difficulty, for the crimes themſelves being horrid and monſtrous, the wayes whereby they are committed are ſecret and full of myſtery, and the management thereof is confined to a very few hands.

her ſelf of her naughtineſſe, and reſolved to lead a better life, making a vertuous reſiftance againſt certaine Ruffians that would have had their pleaſure of her, they were ſo exaſperated at her refuſall, that blinded with fury they cruſhed the legges of that little child, and ſo murthered it to be revenged of the Nurſe. I could not be ſatisfyed with this anſwer, for after I had done the laſt offices of Chriſtianity to that little one, I went my waies to <hi>Francis Irat</hi> then Rector of the Colledge, and gave him a faithfull account of what I had ſeen with my eies, adding that the Syndic was obliged in conſcience to make inquiry about that crime, and legally to proſecute thoſe that were guilty of the murther committed on the body of an expoſed child, for whom we were engaged to be accountable. Anſwer was made me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very much to this effect; <hi>That were to take too much upon us, this little one is now in Paradiſe, and therefore, what neceſſity is there to ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away the revenue of the colledge to revenge a crime that hath delivered it out of the miſeries of this world.</hi> I had made too much noiſe to be called a ſecond time to any ſuch ſervice, I ſpoke too loud, the lay-Brother was charged not to call me any more, ſo that ever from that time they have employed, in this laſt ceremony, a certain antient man named <hi>Ignatius Lentillac,</hi> who is ſince dead of an Apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>One ſingle circumſtance is enough to diſcover enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, and put the civil Magiſtrate into the track of Truth. One drop of blood ſcattered by chance upon the cloths of a murtherer gives much light to find what he hath committed. What I have ſaid deſerves to be taken into conſideration, and certainly there is no Cittizen of any worth or that any way concernes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the publick good, but will cry out, that the Magiſtrates are obliged to take notice of what paſſes in the adminiftration of that Hoſpital; I dare undertake, that if things were legally and ſtrictly examined, as they ought to be in a buſineſſe of this conſequence, it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35086:29"/>
will be found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, of thirty innocents that are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into that houſe, (no longer a houſe of charity, but a ſlaughter-houſe of cruelty) there ſhall not be three alive at the years end. I appeal in this caſe to the conſciences and ſound judgements of the Judges, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without a generall mortality, it is poſſible ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children ſhould periſh, and not be either cruelly killed, or diſpatched hence more gently by ſome ſecret invention, which, after they have pined away for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain daies, carries them inſenſibly away. It would be thought, that, according to the ordinary rate of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, of ten children that are born in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the better halfe ſhould live ſome years: and to ſpeak ſuitably to the common courſe of humane occurrences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be ſaid, that of ten there do not die three within the year.</p>

I never heard of any that they found dead. The ſhrill crying of many of them who thereby awaken thoſe that have their Cells towards the ſtreets, is an evident argument that they are ſtrong and lively. The ſwathing-cloaths wherein they are found very handſomely wrapp'd, their names written and put into their boſomes, or inſtead thereof ſalt, if they have not been baptiſed, and other little circumſtances, arguing that the Fathers and Mothers did all they could for them, do ſufficiently ſignifie, that, though they are forced to forſake them, yet they doubt not but that they are ſafely diſpos'd into a good and charitable houſe.</p>
                     <p>Whence comes it then, that they die in ſuch great numbers, and that at this day, the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> if they were called to account, cannot hardly ſhew one of them, unleſſe they be, by ſome great chance, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

For theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other deſign then to conceale their loves, and a certain tenderneſſe for the reputation of thoſe maids whom they have had their deſires of, are content to be at the charge of all things neceſſary for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the fruit of their own bowels; and in ſuch caſes, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are not onely no loſers, but great gainers, at leaſt ſo far as the obliging of a good Nurſe amounts to. It is not for a perſon of my qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to read Lectures to the Magiſtrates, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my conſcience into their breaſts, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good One of the wayes which theſe covetous horſe leeches make uſe of to remove out of this world ſo many innocents, is, to make choice of very poore and neceſſitous women, who forc'd by their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to embrace any courſe to get a little money, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſuckle and nurſe up theſe little ones, at ſuch a pittifull rate, that it is impoſſible but that both nurſes and children muſt ſtarve.</p>

into thy Faith, and to ſtarve them in a Chriſtian City, in a time of abundance and plenty, and this in a wealthy hoſpitall purpoſely built by the charity of ſome good men for their entertainment? And all this while their Murtherers live upon their coſt, and grow fat upon their revenues.</p>
                     <p>Another way they have to diſpatch them, which is no leſſe convenient then the former, in order to their deſign, is, to put them out to debauched women, ſuch as endure a certain martyrdome for their luſt and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricity, in the diſeaſes conſequent thereto, and ſuch as in whom the French Pox is a familiar and pardonable infirmity, by which means theſe little babes come to ſuck poyſon in ſtead of milk. To which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another trick of theſe cattell, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that having left them crying on the ground or in their neſts for a long time together, without ever taking them up, it is ſo long ere they get them ſuckled by ſome whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and charitable woman, that it is eaſie for a man to conjecture, nay indeed, to be confident, that they rather wiſh them dead then alive.

                     <p>What I have further to ſay as to this point, is, that not content to make havock of the reveneues of theſe little expoſ'd infants, and to put them to miſerable deaths, they have found out a way to ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There's no neceſſity I ſhould intreat the Judges, to take this diſcovery, which I have made for the publick good, into their conſideration; the blood of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents cryes more loudly in the ears of Juſtice then that of <hi>Abel,</hi> and there is no reaſon in the world that theſe unfortunate little ones, whom the Fathers and mothers expoſe to the mercy of others, ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and be ſo miſerable withall as not to find Magiſtrates to revenge their death and aſhes.</p>

Then to whip them deliciouſly and wantonly with the hand is but a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime with theſe inſamous Gomorrheans, whom God will no doubt provide a fire for, if they do not reforme themſelves of a ſinne which covers nature with ſhame and confuſion.</p>

This man who in the Pulpit ſeemed to be a Saint, and was an <hi>Aſmodeus</hi> in the ſhriving-ſeat, caſt his amorous eyes upon a little brown laſs, that had caſt her ſelfe at his feet, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen her ſelfe of her ſinnes, and at the firſt ſight took ſo much fire at the eyes and eares, when he look'd upon her, and heard her ſpeake, that, contraty to the firſt intention of the wench, he ſent her away loaden with more crimes then ſhe had brought thither. The firſt ſcene of this wanton Comedy, was, by crafty inſinuations to engage the wench to give him a meeting about the time that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are at Table, that he might have the opportunity to entertaine her between two doores with more ſecurity and freedome. The wench, who it ſeems, was ſomewhat in neceſſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſhe was a ſervent of ſome quality, finding her ſelf ſo much made of by a perſon whom ſhe heard every where celebrated for his great worth, thought her ſelfe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35086:40"/>
in a faire way to happineſſe, and reciprocally conceive d ſo much tenderneſſe and affection for him, that ſhee was no leſſe punctuall to meet him at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, then the Sun is to bleſſe our Hemiſphere with the gladſome day at the ordinary houres. To deſcribe the litle ſhifts that paſſed between theſe two Lovers, and the mutuall careſſes wherewith they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one another during that litle leiſure, would take up too much time, it is no hard matter to imagine, conſidering the violence of their paſſions, what might be the effects of their firſt meeting. There needs therefore no more be ſaid, then that there was no manner of feeling, which the wench did not freely ſuffer from him, nor any pleaſure which ſhee received not from him, even to the cloſeſt embraces. One thing only there was that much troubled them; that is, they were obliged ever and anon to go and ſee if any ſtranger came neer to diſturbe their enjoyments. In a word, not to defile too much paper with ſo naſty a ſtory, the wench hath ſince related to three or foure <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that <hi>Petiot</hi> had kiſſed her, embraced her, felt her, &amp;c. Nay ſo far as, that, <hi>effundens ſemen in manum eius,</hi> (O exceſſe of abomination!) ſaid to her, See my deareſt, <hi>ex quo Luto naſcuntur homines.</hi> The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the book called <hi>the Deſirer,</hi> had not certainly ever read or heard of ſuch ſtories as theſe, when he ſaid that the Porter of <hi>Monaſteries</hi> was a venerable ancient man whoſe name was, <hi>The feare of God.</hi> Were he to write now, he would certainly except the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which though they beare in their frontiſpieces, <hi>the name of</hi> JESUS, crowned with thornes or beames of light, do not put thoſe that live within them ever the more in mind to imitate the purity of the Virgin's Son.</p>
                     <p>Let us now go into the houſe, and ſee what miſchiefe they did there, when they were ſo wicked in the Entry. This great Preacher, that he might have the greater opportunity to ſtudy, had a chamber by himſelfe, at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35086:41"/>
ſome diſtance from thoſe of the reſt, that had a lock to it, which the provinciall <hi>Jaquinot</hi> had purpoſely cauſed to be furniſhed for him. Imagining with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he might eaſily bring the wench thither, and there enjoy her without any danger, he perſwaded her to diſguiſe her ſelfe. Shee took his advice, reckoned with her Miſtreſſe, quitted her ſervice, bought a hat, and a canvaſſe ſuit, ſuch as ſhould fit a litle country lad off her pitch, went into a vineyard, cut off her haire, put up her m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d's cloaths into a pacquet, retaining the upper part for a waſcot, put on the boyes cloaths, and getting a bundle of litle walking ſticks, pretended to bring them to that <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who it ſeems had a curioſity, by way of recreation, to marke them in ſeverall places with a hot iron. He who wandred about the Church in expectation of her coming, according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, came immediately to entertaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her, and receiving her as the ſervant of a Country man that was wont to bring him ſticks, brought her without any danger into the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>What Rhetorick were able to expreſſe the mutuall ſatisfaction of this amorous couple, to find themſelves ſo fortunate in ſo preſumptuous an attempt? Their paſſion, which till then had been much abated by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles and difficulties, broke forth now like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous torrent, that hath overturned the bankes that oppoſed its violence: and the reciprocall expreſſions of kindneſſe that paſt between them, were proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the former hazards they had run through. Yet were not their Loves like thoſe ſubterranean Rivers which ſlide ſilently and are out of the ſight of men. 'Tis decreed that women ſhould not keep any thing ſecret, no, not their owne ſhame and abhominations. This wench went and made her confeſſion to <hi>Nathaniel Sichard,</hi> a Jeſuit, and gave him an exact account, even to the leaſt circumſtances, of all the actions that had paſſed between the four walls of that Chamber; nay, out of an exceſſe of ſtupidity or malice, gave

him liberty (as he alledged, for that I appeale to himſelfe) to make w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>at advantage he thought fit of it. Theſe ſcrupulous Hypocrites, whoſe braſen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will not ſtretch to the leaſt diſcovery of thoſe deſignes, which are communicated to them in Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, tending to the murthering of Kings, make no difficulty to betray the ſecret of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to ruine their Brethren, eſpecially if they be of a more eminent quality and greater abilities, as this man was. <hi>Pitard,</hi> who was not very backward as to amorous inclinations, when, during the time of his reſidence at <hi>Rochoir</hi> he got a Gentlewoman to come every night to his Chamber to dance, had, out of prudence, forborne to take any notice of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour, which this unadviſed Confeſſour had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him: but the wench, miſſng her enjoyments with <hi>Petiot</hi> (who had been ſent to accompany the Biſhop of <hi>Xainſtes</hi> in his viſit) began to talk very loud, and had a ſecond time declared in Confeſſion, to <hi>Peter Thomas,</hi> that ſhe had lived eight daies within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Houſe with that Preacher, and gave out, that ſhee would acquaint the Biſhop of <hi>Bazas</hi> with the buſineſſe, if they gave her not the ſumme of mony which he had promiſed her when he tempted her to naughtineſſe.</p>
                     <p>This ſecond Confeſſor kept the ſecret of <hi>auricular confeſſion</hi> no better then the former, for he came to <hi>Francis Labrouſſe</hi> and my ſelf, who were then his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues in the <hi>Cardinal</hi>-Miſſion, to aſke our advice how he ſhould be have himſelf in a buſineſſe that was likely to derogate ſo much from the reputation of the Society. Our advice was, that it were requiſite the wench related by way of ordinary diſcourſe, what ſhe had ſaid before under the ſecret of Confeſſion, otherwiſe it were to commit one evill by diſcovering another. The wench, upon his perſwaſion, did it, and declared the buſineſſe to me with ſo mnch conviction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, that I could not make the leaſt doubt but that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35086:42"/>
ſhee had been in that Chamber. Shee gave an exact account, through what Galleries ſhe had paſſed, told how many ſtories there were to go up into it, what kind of cloſet there was within it, how the bed ſtood, what ſtuffe and what colour the furniture was of, what chaires and ſtooles were there, what pictures, nay, what the length of the ſheets, what ſhe did eat, what drink, what Fathers came to viſit her beloved, where ſhe hid her ſelf while they ſtay'd in her ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard's habit, what ſlights and ſhifts the crafty Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit was forc'd to make uſe of to carry them elſewhere, &amp;c. In a word, of all thoſe that have been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this ſtory, I have had the moſt exact relation of it, and though I was at liberty to reveale it to the Superiours, yet did I ſmother it, not without much trouble in conſcience, to ſee ſo many impious wretches betray a double ſecret, viz. that of nature, and that of Confeſſion, meerly to ſeeme Hypocritically zealous, and obſervant of an Inſtitution, prejudiciall to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fidelity. What I did then, out of prudence, as being a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> I now, being none, think it no leſſe to declare. This wench was a ſervant in <hi>Carnan-ſtreet,</hi> in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> borne in <hi>Reole</hi> in <hi>Bazadois;</hi> ſhe was ſiſter to a poor woman that had a blind man to her husband, and lives neere the Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> at <hi>Reole,</hi> and when we were upon the Miſſion, at the ſame time that ſhe threatned <hi>Peter Thomas</hi> ſo much to divulge theſe villanies, ſhe was in ſervice with the Regent of that place.</p>
                     <p>From this ſhort relation the world may eaſily judge, whether that houſe dedicated to Saint <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> which theſe Hypocrites of the Society by an Antono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick expreſſion call, <hi>The holy Houſe,</hi> does not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerve the name of the moſt eminent Brothell-Houſe in the City. No doubt but it will be thought ſuch by thoſe that ſhall call to mind what I have ſaid before of <hi>Rouſſeau,</hi> who was the ſuperiour of it, of <hi>Olive,</hi> who had ſome relation thereto, when he played
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35086:42"/>
thoſe noble prankes at <hi>Port-Saint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Mary,</hi> and of <hi>Peter Guales,</hi> who was one of the moſt famous Confeſſors there. May it be the pleaſure of God, out of his great mercy to open the eyes and apprehenſions of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who, by the multitude of their Charities, entertaine ſo many <hi>Religious Satyres</hi> in the heart of their City, to take notice of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Had I not confin'd my ſelfe to give an account only of thoſe things that happened in <hi>Guienne,</hi> I might relate the ſtory of that Rector of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who tooke in a poore blind woman that was begging an almes at the gate, kept her ſecretly in his Chamber for three months together, till at laſt, being cloy'd with her, he put her into an <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to come and viſit her, and to do great things for her. The wench, diſcontented at this, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the villany, and to prove it to one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation where ſhe then was, ſhe ſaid to him, You came to give him a viſit ſuch a day, and ſpoke to him of ſuch and ſuch a thing; I was then in his cloſet. But I ſhall obſerve the limits I have preſcribed to my ſelf.</p>

That of the Jeſuit <hi>Petiot,</hi> which from ſmall beginnings grew up to that hight of inſolence we have mentioned, ſet his heart ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly on fire, that he came not any where, but he more or leſſe ſcattered the ſparkles thereof.

                     <p>There are two ſleights which many <hi>Jeſuits</hi> do now make uſe of, and have done formerly, in order to the enjoyment of their Loves. One is, to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves invited by their Confidents into the Country, that ſo they might enjoy them with greater privacy, or that they might thence ſend for thoſe women whoſe company they were deſirous of. The ſecond is, to make their advantages of their journeys, that is, ſo order things before-hand by their plots and ſecret correſpondencies, that ſome blind Inne by the way, ſome tenants cot, nay, it may be ſome ditch may be the place for them to ſatiate their brutall inclinations. The examples which they have furniſhed the world with of this nature are ſo numerous, that, of foure that go abroad to take their recreation, there hardly ever returnes two, who have not commited ſome unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or other The liberty of walking, the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of being at a diſtance from their companion (if they have any) the opportunities of garden-walkes, groves, Chambers, lodgings, the ſeverall places, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they are purpoſely diſpoſed in the night time, the long and paſſionate conferences, after the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of delicate wine, and provoking diſhes, are ſo many favourable aſſiſtances to heighten their deſires, and accompliſh the expectation of thoſe that love them.

I would not have any man to inferre hence, that my meaning is, that all thoſe who invite them, do it out of a deſign to bring them into the occaſions of ſinning; no, I know there are many perſons of honor and quality, who when they invite them, have no other end in it then that of obliging them, and giving them an honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and diverſion. But I ſay, that thoſe Jeſuits who lay plots to get themſelves invited, and the women that invite them, are not alwayes guilty of that purity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. <hi>Guales, Penot, Cadiot, Biroat, Henry du Cheſne, Alemay, Delvaux, Duſreſne, Reignier,</hi> and other <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> whom I name not, have made their addreſſes to ſervant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mayds, have had deſignes upon the Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, have had dealings with the young gentlewomen where they came, nay, have made uſe of their <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> and their beads, as baits, to draw in the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and the ſimple.</p>

                     <p>Tis the generall complaints of all Prelates and the Regular Orders at this day, that theſe Cajollers, theſe Students of Sycophancy and inſinuation, corrupt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious women by maximes repugnant to the ſincerity of Devorion. I have known ſome Libertines of that Society, who have dogmatically maintained, even in the parlours of women devoted by a ſolemn vow to chaſtity and undefiledneſſe of life, that God, in that commandment which he hath given us in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> obliges men no further then to be diſcreet and circumſpect in their Loves, ſo to avoid giving others any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſcandall, conſidering the great inclination to Love which is naturally grafted in all men. From which doctrine it muſt needs follow, that all laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions between male and female, which, by caution and prudence are kept ſecret from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men, are not imputable as ſinnes in the ſight of God, but onely thoſe, which men tooke notice of. And whereas the Law was generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to all, and accordingly equally obliged all, it was to be conceived that Religious men and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious women, that is ſuch as had vowed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of chaſtity, might privately be allowed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall Viſits, provided their communications bred no noiſe in the world, it being granted that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions cannot be worſe then thoſe of other people.</p>
                     <p>The tenents are tranſcendently pernicious, and

therefore it may eaſily be gueſſed what the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may prove.

The cheat argued ſo much unworthineſs, and accordingly begat ſo much diſtaſt, that the people broke forth into lowd complaints againſt that avaritious piece of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and made ſo much noiſe, that, to conceale in ſome meaſure, the horridneſſe of an affront ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly put upon a whole City, the Generall ſent him penance from <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>In the yeare one thouſand ſix hundred forty and one, there was, in the Colledge of <hi>Engouleſme,</hi> a Preacher, whoſe name was <hi>Cluniac,</hi> and a Regent of the ſecond claſſe, whoſe name was <hi>Marſan,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved that there were certain deep Cellars, made time out of mind, under the third and fourth Claſſes, very proper and convenient for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, got up in the night time when their Brethren were in their firſt ſleep, and paſſing through a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Refectory, came down into the Court. From thence they made a ſhift to get into the firſt claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and thenoe through another window that look'd into
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35086:50"/>
a Garden, got in at a pitifull old doore into thoſe ſubterranean places, and there coined falſe money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any noiſe, or fear of being ſurpris'd or diſcovered by men. Who of the Inhabitants of <hi>Engouleſme</hi> could have imagined, that when the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and the <hi>Capuchins</hi> riſe up to Mattens at midnight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe their Devotions to Almighty God, there ſhould be at the ſame time, in thoſe ſolitary Cellers, in the midſt of their town, two <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> employed about a buſineſſe which the publick is ſo far concerned in, that it hangs and quarters thoſe it finds guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This crime is not ſo ſtrange among them; but they have carryed the buſineſſe ſo cloſely, that though they have had ſome hanged out of their Order for all manner of Offences, they have not yet had any Martyrs for coyning; but if publick Juſtice ſleep not too long ere it do them right, they may ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough have occaſion to make ſome addition to their Martyrologies.</p>
                     <p>It is not likely but that in an accuſation of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, it will be queſtioned by ſome how ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a crime could be diſcovered. Thus; certain Regents having taken notice, that the two Jeſuits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned employed a certain great Lad that was a Scholer in the Colledge, to prepate, in his own lodging, certain materials, which they cauſed him to boile till ſuch time as they were conſumed to the one half, they immediately thence conceived a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, that they ſtudied Alchymy, and having ſince that ſeen in the hands of <hi>Marſan</hi> a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of ſilver, and pieces made exactly round, but not ſtamped, they were confident they intended them no other impreſſion then what the King put upon thoſe of the ſame preparation. To this may be added that <hi>James Bocherel,</hi> one of the Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Society h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

when they were both ſeized, there were found about them many new pieces, like thoſe that are but juſt brought from the mint.</p>

The Scholer whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and ſimplicity they wrought upon to prepare the materialls, was a young man named <hi>Ville-neufue,</hi> borne in <hi>Rochefocaud,</hi> and was a ſtudent in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond claſſe in the yeare aforeſaid 1641.

But that which I would have the Reader particularly obſerve, is, that it was not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to give an account of all the Provinces in the world, no, that were too great a labour; my Inquiſition reaches not all thoſe of France, for I have not been in them all, but is confined only to the Province of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> which is the leaſt of all, nor do I ſearch all the Colledges thereof, but limit my ſelfe to foure or five

                        <p>'Tis a monaſticall Maxime, that the offences, which, being committed by a ſecular or worldly perſon, were veniall, become grand ſacriledges, and mortall ſinnes in a high Nature, when they are committed by a Monk or Frier. That a man may affirme an Order to be guilty of a degeneration, there is no neceſſity he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the <hi>Cenobites</hi> of being, <hi>Murtherers, Sodomites, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> to their King; no he need ſay no more then that they decline from the profeſſion of that regular ſeverity which made their predeceſſors be looked on as Saints, and that they are come to that degree of diſſolution, as not to obſerve in a manner any of their rules. Be it therefore taken into conſideration, that I do not here proſecute the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for triviall offences, ſuch as they might caſually commit in the obſervation of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Of which nature are, grumbling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction in point of obedience, their ſhunning the inconveniences of that <hi>Poverty,</hi> which they ſolemnly vow to embrace, that they live more ſumptuouſly, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35086:55"/>
feed more delicately then the moſt luxurious Cittizens' that they are perpetually quarrelling among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and impoſe crimes one upon another, that their bell does indeed ring at four in the morning, to make the world believe, that they are at prayers upon their knees, when in the mean time they are ſtretching themſelves in their beds, none riſing unleſs it were two or three of the moſt zealous in every colledge, &amp;c. But it is to be obſerved that I charge them with crimes no leſs then thoſe of <hi>Antidates, Murther</hi> of infants, <hi>Treaſon,</hi> the violation of <hi>Religious</hi> women, <hi>Coyning;</hi> ſuch as are ſufficient to prove, not only an irregularity, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or degeneration of the order, but ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute corruption, as is not found in the greateſt Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, but only among thoſe <hi>Cains</hi> and <hi>Caſt-aways</hi> that are equally abominable in the ſight of God and men.

And if a man conſider thoſe who within theſe eight or nine yeares,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35086:56"/>
upon very juſt grounds, have quitted it, he will find, that they are the greateſt wits and the moſt eminent of the Order.</p>

                        <p>When ſome ordinary ſervant Maide yields to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and importunity of temptation, and betraies her honour, the ſcandall is not great in a Citty, two or three of her neareſt relations are a litle troubled at it, and four or five of her neighbours make a ſtirre, that any ſuch thing ſhould happen. But when it falls out that ſome gentlewoman of quality parts with that which is accounted moſt precious among women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it raiſes diſcourſe through a whole Countrey, and the world is in a manner ſcandaliſed at it. The Reflection that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſes hence, is, that the perſons whom I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce by name and ſurname, as Authors of the crimes before mentioned, are the moſt eminent of the Order, ſuch as <hi>Provincials, Rectors, Procurators</hi> of <hi>Provinces, Preachers, Divines,</hi> great <hi>Humaniſts,</hi> as for inſtance, <hi>Maleſcot, Rouſſeau, Pitard, Sabbatheri, John Adam, Petiot, Olive, Biroat, Duſreſne, Manian,</hi> and ſuch others in abundance, as whoſe names and excellent parts are known to all the world.

I do not here entertain the world with the crimes of thoſe among them whom they contemptibly call formall Coadjutors, (or if I have produced any, they are very few in compariſon of the others) but I bring upon the ſtage the Ring-leaders of the Society, guilty of the moſt enormous offences. If the denomination of a <hi>compoſitum</hi> ought to be taken from the better and the nobler part, let all the world judge, whether that Society, inſtead of being called

                  <p>IT is certainly an obligation of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and a favour which all my ſervices cannot come into the leaſt degree of deſerving, that it hath been pleaſed to permit the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of our Churches, and the enemies of the Faith we profeſſe, to ſet upon, both by indictment, and by printed books, the <hi>Declaration</hi> I had made with all the ſyncerity of my heart.

                  <p>I therefore vindicate my ſelf againſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religious man, who ſeems to have made it his main buſineſſe to do violence to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maximes of the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and tramples on the lawes of charity, whereof the Scriptures are full. The Canons of the Church of Rome declare a Clerk irregular, for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed any thing to the execution of a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. And yet <hi>Beaufes,</hi> giving himſelf out to
<pb facs="tcp:35086:60"/>
be a Prieſt and Clerk of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> makes himſelf a Judge of life and death upon me in his book, pronounces and ſignes the ſentence of death againſt me, and racks his wit to find out new torments, to make my departure hence the more cruel and inſupportable.</p>
                  <p>His accuſation is, that I have celebrated their Maſſe, after I had engaged my ſelf in the deſign of my Converſion, and did not forbear preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their pulpits, even while I was in treaty with the Reverend the Miniſters of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to find out ſome ſafe courſe to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profeſſion of the Faith, which I had already embraced in my heare. This enrages and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates the man ſo farre, that he turns a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and ſpends on me, without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, all the injurious figures, and all the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous termes which his imagination can furniſh him with. In every page he finds out ſome new clawes to faſten on me withall, I am, in his judgement, a <hi>Judas among the Apoſtles, and a Devil in the houſe of God.</hi> The words <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, deteſtable, abominable,</hi> are too gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to make any deep wounds; nay, he employes the malice of his wit, and makes all his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ſweat again, to find out ſuch as are more ſtinging and more venemous. Not thinking it enough to thruſt in one or two into every period, be muſters up thirteen or fourteen altogether, as when he ſayes, page <hi>25.</hi> This man was <hi>vaine,
<pb facs="tcp:35086:60"/>
proud, envious, refractory, hypocriticall, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious, perfidious, deſperate, a prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, an impoſtor, carnal, treacherous, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, he does as much as lies in his power to make me the object of an univerſall perſecution, and it ſhall not be his fault, if the particular animoſity of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> paſſe not through all the Chriſtian world for the publick cauſe.</p>
                  <p>I am not to learn, that the Law of <hi>Grace,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we now live, does not require an eye for an eye, nor a band for a hand, as that did, which God had given from amongſt the thunder and lightning. Nor am I ignorant on the other ſide, that the Chriſtian Lenity whereof you make ſo great proſeſſion, and that mildneſſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which diſtinguiſhes you to be true Paſtors different from thoſe wolves and hirelings, may haply oblige you to diſapprove theſe refutations, as ſuch as betray too much gall and Satyre. But I ſhall entreat your Reverences to give me leave, without prejudice to the Law of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to do, in my own defence, that which nature teaches the very creatures, God fOrbids not, and reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the prudent. I do not deſire the death of <hi>Beaufes,</hi> as the reward of the crimes he hath committed, though he wiſhes nothing ſo much as mine, and that for no other reaſon then that I have done a good work; no, I heartily forgive him, and bleſſe the wounds whereby he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb facs="tcp:35086:61"/>
to aſſaſſinate me. But ſince neceſſity hath forced me to take up arms for my owne juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it cannot be expected I ſhould anſwer ſo exactly, as that I ſhould return flowers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, for calumnies and invectives. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when I oppoſe my buckler to the ſtones he caſts at me, their recoyling hurts them in the tendereſt places, the miſchief cauſed thereby is to be attributed to his inſolent and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempt, ſince that God neither forbids nor hinders the effects proceeding from a rationall reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have anſwered him in terms ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently civil and obliging, had my calumniator any way deſerv'd an honourable treatment: but civility exaſperates him, and mildneſſe irritates him; he is much of a nature with the <hi>canthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> converts into poyſon the juice of the faireſt flowers, and experience hath convinced all the faithfull at <hi>Rochel,</hi> that he grows ſo much the more inſolent againſt the truth, by how much the Paſtors endure his extravagances with the greater modesty.</p>
                  <p>I therefore humbly beſeech your Reverences not to take it amiſſe, if, being to refute a furious and inconſiderate man, I do not confine my ſelf to a ſcrupulous reſervedneſſe; an over-ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious obſervance and reſpect would pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If I diſcover many paſſages of his life, as occaſion ſerves, whereat he may be troubled, I aſſure you that the worſt I ſhall do, will be ſimply not to flatter him. <hi>I</hi> could never approve that irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cuſtome of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to whip their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne's robe, when he had offended, without touching his perſon; no, it is but juſt every one ſhould beare with the penal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Were <hi>I</hi> cited to a higher tribunall then yours, it would certainly be lawfull for me, to do what the holy Spirit allows by the mouth of David, <hi>Be angry, but ſin not,</hi> and to follow the advice of the Wiſe man, <hi>Anſwer a fool according to his folly.</hi> But if notwithſtanding all <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, my diſcourſe ſeem too ſharp to you, be pleaſed to remember, that <hi>I</hi> have lived too long among the Jeſuits, and too ſhort a time among you, to be diſmantled of thoſe paſſions, which are garriſon'd and fortifie themſelves in perſons of that Society.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> therefore moſt humbly make it my ſuit to you, that you would, without prejudice, read my Apology, and that with a ſpirit of love towards a perſon who dedicates it to your Reverences with the greateſt ſubmiſſion imaginable.

ſuffers me not to heare the coyle and hurly-burlies which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> raiſe at ſo great a diſtance againſt me; and if they write any defamatory pamphlet, to humour their exaſperation, and in ſome meaſure to alleviate their fury, it is ſo long ere it comes on our ſhores, by reaſon of the uncertainty of navigation, and the hazards of the Sea, that three or foure months ſlip away before I can get it into my hands. I was acquainted with God's raiſing up of Monſieur <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>incent</hi> in my defence, before I heard that <hi>Beaufes</hi> had put in any charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; the preſervative came to me before the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and I have ſeen my adverſary layd at my feet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by him whoſe very name ſignifies a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> before ever I took up any armes my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed but too eaſy a matter to inſult over a man, that hath been ſurprized in ſeverall falſifications, and delivered up as a Detractor to the abuſes of the people. I know it will prove no great matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to me, to purſue a wounded Serpent, that hath in a manner ſpent all its venome, and hardly hath ſtrength enough to hiſſe. Monſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> hath given <hi>James Beaufes</hi> ſuch an abſolut rout, that there is no honour in thinking of any further engagement with him. The moſt conſiderable accuſation which that devout adverſary had againſt me, amounted to no more then a certaine foamineſſe which that great man had diſſolv'd and burſt aſunder, or may be compared to a miſt in the morning, which the Sun of truth hath diſpelled by the lively heat of his more powerfull raies. All thoſe that have ſeen the refutation, have admired the prudence of the Author, the ſharpeneſſe of his Logicall abilities, the ſolidity of his replyes, the modeſty of his diſcourſes; &amp; the ſame perſons having weighed the accuſations &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of my enemy, have not been a little aſtoniſhed, to ſee, that a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> whoſe employment it is to preach the word of God, ſhould fall into ſuch palpable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, make ſo many diſcoveries of his imprudence, and betray ſo much paſſion and extravagance.</p>

And yet, notwithſtanding this former Anſwer, whereby I am more then ſufficiently juſtified, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it an obligation lying upon me to vindicate my ſelfe, by an Apologie, after my faſhion, againſt this injurious <hi>Goliah,</hi> who making his advantages of whatever may tend to my diſparagement, would no doubt take occaſion, from my ſilence, to ſay, that I am ſuch another as himſelfe, ignorant, and not able to make him any anſwer.

without reaſon, that he is no otherwiſe looked on among the learned, then as one eminent for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ignorance, though his perpetuall gagling raiſes in thoſe, that know him not, an imagination that he is guilty of ſome literature. He is ſo little verſed in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Learning, that, having taught little children for many yeares together, he could never get out of the claſſes of <hi>Grammar,</hi> and, being almoſt choak'd with the duſt of the Colledges of <hi>Agen</hi> and <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueux,</hi> he was pack'd away, to finiſh his courſe at the noble Colledge of S. <hi>Macaire</hi> upon the <hi>Garonne,</hi> there to teach one of the loweſt Claſſes, with the aſſiſtance of another, whoſe name is <hi>Salabert.</hi>

But I am confident he dares not put it to the hazard, what bragges ſo ever he may make of ſufficiency. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> is a ſtrange and barbarous language to him, for, not to injure or bely the man, he was never yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with either the points or Letters, and it is much to be queſtioned whether he can turne the Bible the right way. Having the laſt yeare, received from one of our Miniſters, a Letter in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> he runs hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained from <hi>Ruffec</hi> to <hi>Engouleſme,</hi> a whole night's journey, to get it interpreted and anſwered by Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Thomas de Maiſonnette,</hi> a knowing perſon, and well ſkilled in that Tongue. That excellent perſon cannot deny what I ſay to be true. <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Chronology</hi> are thoſe unknown parts of Learning which were never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable to him, and if he ſayes any thing of them, he does it upon the credit of another, and the ſecurity of citations which he meets with in certaine collections of Controverſies.</p>

Since he is ſo unfortunate as to all theſe it would be thought, that thoſe ſhreds of Logick he hath made a ſhift to get together might find him ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to that Science, but the courſe he was put upon at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> purely indeed for want of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, diſcovered the weakneſſe of his dialecticall faculties. That employment, beſtowed on him, not out of any conſideration of his deſert, but upon the recommendation of Monſieur <hi>Jrat,</hi> who had an affection for him, proved ſo unfortunate to him, that his Schollers, to ſhew what account they made of ſuch a maſter, brought an <hi>Aſſe</hi> into the Schoole, got it up into his ſeat, and there faſtened him in ſuch manner, that the two fore feet hung over it, as it were to repreſent Doctor <hi>Beaufes,</hi> and indeed there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only ſpeech to ſay <hi>Nego,</hi> with as much judgement as our Logick-Lecturer could.

For having given, through his notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rake-heilizing, very great ſcandall in the Colledge of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where I then was, the Provinciall was forced to pack him away thence to <hi>Pau</hi> in <hi>Beard,</hi> there to proſecute his ſtudies, after he had cauſed him publickly in the Refectory, to receive <hi>diſcipline,</hi> during the whole time, that a <hi>Miſerere</hi> was read. The employments he is put upon, are proportionable to the account they make of him. All his buſineſſe in <hi>Ruffec,</hi> for foure yeares together, was only to run up and downe the Villages thereabouts; and were it not that he makes it ſo much his buſineſſe to gaine a litle reputation by endeavouring the refutation of the Miniſters; he would be thought abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to ſpeak in publick. Thoſe of their Society, who know him as well as I do, wonder not to ſee him kept ſo low, inſomuch that it was never aſked by any one, whence it came that he was appointed to preach in the Advents and Lents at <hi>Sauue-terre</hi> a paltry towne in <hi>Bazadois,</hi> at <hi>Vieille Vigne,</hi> a village of <hi>Brittany,</hi> at <hi>Ruffec</hi> two years together, while other preachers, that were his Juniors by nine or ten years preached in the greateſt and moſt conſiderable Citties. Both Secular Prieſts and Regulars are aſtoniſhed to find him admitted into the pulpit at all, conſidering the imprudences and impertinences he falls into in his Sermons. Some <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were of opinion, that he had ſome gift in the buſineſſe of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> not that they thought him ſufficiently ſkilled as to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures, or furniſhed as to matter of ratiocination, but only becauſe he hath a bitter, ſatyricall faculty, ſuch as eaſily makes the audience laugh, by an humour he hath of making ſport with our maximes.

This man hath one that is ſo treacherous, that ere he come to the midſt of a diſcourſe that takes up but a fmall page, he deſtroyes what he had afſirmed in the beginning of it. The cheat is diſcovered ere the word is out of his mouth, as a pick-pocket taken in the midſt of the market-place, with the purſe in his hand. I feare me the man fondly imagines that the <hi>French,</hi> who will be guilty of ſo much curioſity as to read his book, are overgrowne with ſuch a ſottiſh credulity, that he can perſwade them that they do not ſee what's before their eyes. He impudently affirmes that they are not my proſecutors in that indictment, and two periods after, he acknowledges, that it was by their means the Conſiſtory was forced to produce in Court the act of <hi>November,</hi> 24. which they thought a ſufficient ground whereupon to put in an endictment againſt me. When they have thrown the ſtone before all the world, they withdrew the hand, and then confidently affirme, both by word and writing, that they did it not.

It is to be fear'd that the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of that order have a certain imagination, that all the French have made a vow of implicite obedience to them, to ſubmit their underſtandings, to their words, without the leaſt examination.

If a man would but attentively and with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine recollection read the words in their true ſence, it will be found a declaration ſo far only as a deſire may amount to, and no more; and conſequently, it comes ſo far ſhort of a publick and ſolemne profeſſion, that indeed it is not ſo much as a bare profeſſion.

So that if <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> hath inſtituted any ſuch thing as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts cannot charge me with being an Impoſtor, and falſe to them: if he hath inſtituted only the Symbols of bread and wine, to be received by Faith, as if they were his body and blood, thoſe of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have nothing to quarrell with me for. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, in whoſe preſence <hi>I</hi> write theſe lines, can bear me witneſſe that I ſpeak but the truth. If God had been pleaſed to afford me a greater meaſure of his grace, I might have generouſly declared to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor the reaſons, upon which I had reſolved not to ſay Maſſe any longer; but I deſire the world to judge from the exaſperation and fury they have betrayed in their pulpits, and the proſecutions they have worryed me with, what treatment I muſt have expected from them, in caſe I had diſcovered my deſigne. Alaſſe! Had <hi>I</hi> made but the leaſt diſcovery, I had been ſix moneths ſince in the other world; and this is ſo far certain, that they have publickly acknowledged as much, affi ming openly both in their diſcourſes and writings, that if I were ſo deſirous to ſuffer for my beliefe, I needed no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

fals into is accounted in the law for an allowable excuſe I hope the Judges will pardon my weakneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that rigour, which at this day, is the occaſion that there are ſo many hypocrites in that unhappy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. If all thoſe of their Order, who prophane the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which they call that of the body of Chriſt, were dragg'd to the tribunals of the Civill Magiſtrate, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their Sacriledges, what ſhall become of thoſe, who, not forbearing the diurnall celebration of Maſſe, procure the death of little children, are guilty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries and falſifications in Contracts, coyne mony, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt Kings, ſecretly entertain in their Chambers wenches diſguiſed in mens cloaths, and commit mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Sodomies with young Schollers, as I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcovered in the former Treatiſe? Should this happen, the cities they inhabit would find it no ſmall work to provide priſons, and erect ſcaffolds and Gibbets for <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> There you ſhould have one accus'd for his impious approaches to the Altar, coming piping hot out of the Confeſſion-ſeat, where he had ſpent the time in amorous entertainments with ſome crack'd commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. You ſhould have another brought to the bar, when he had juſt before ſealed up his Letters, wherein he had ſent ſome intelligence prejudiciall to the affairs of his Prince: and ſo conſequently a many others for having committed ſeverall other crimes not half an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The reaſon is this, that theſe wretched Galley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves of Religion are forced to comply with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome which they have taken up, to ſay their Maſſes, what condition ſoever they may be in. Which if they do not, the Catamites and Zealots, whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are full, very ſuſpiciouſly queſtion whether ſuch and ſuch be not ſick, ſince they had not ſaid their Maſſes. And thus much I thought fit to ſay in order to my vindication from the crime which they would impoſe upon me.</p>

For though his beard be powdred by the age of above fifty yeares, yet hath he not yet put off the ſwathing clouts and weakneſſes of his infancy; and in two things he betrayes himſelf more particularly, One, when he denyes that I writ two Letters that have come abroad under my name. The other, when he would refute them by certain ſhreds and fragments of a Letter I had written, five moneths before my coming from among them, to the Provinciall.</p>

Now obſerve the Adverſaries weakneſſe. <hi>Beaufes</hi> hath taken, and induced others to take my writing of <hi>November</hi> 24. as that onely thing whereon the Judges might admit of an indictment againſt me, and by a weakneſſe of judgement, which all humane Sophiſtry and invention cannot cover, ſayes in his book ſince that Monſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> writ the Letters, hath fallen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foule upon him, as the Author thereof, and to demonſtrate it can be no other, he oppoſes not onely me to my ſelfe, and my latter Letters to thoſe I had written before, but he oppoſes the pretended Letters of Monſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> to mine, to refute, as he ſayes, <hi>the Impoſtures ſcattered abroad under my name.</hi>

                     <p>I here take no more then what <hi>Beaufes</hi> is willing to afford me, and argue thus; If Monſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> be the Authour of thoſe Letters, the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But if they find that the Writing authoriſed by my hand and ſeale belong to me, they will alſo conclude, that the Letters are alſo mine, ſince they carry the ſame Authority of my hand and ſeal.

But what hath <hi>M. James Beaufes</hi> to alledge by way of vindication as to this childiſh, and ſo palpable an impoſture? Will he ſay (as haply he may, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contemptible character he gives me in point of abilities) that I was not able enough to write a Letter? But that he cannot, ſince he acknowledges my admiſſion to the fourth vow, which is the higheſt degree of preferment that the Generall can beſtow on the moſt knowing of the Society. Can it be imagin'd that the moſt conſiderable of their Body ſhould not be able to pen a Letter? No, no, let us not be ſo ſevere towards him, paſſion co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or is it that the ſtyle of thoſe few lines that I writ, makes a greater diſcovery of the ſtyle and parts of Monſieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> then my own? But to that there is a whole Conſiſtory, conſiſting of perſons of honour and credit, making evidence, that I brought thoſe Letters as they were produced from the Colledge. Beſides, my ſtile is neither ſo pure, ſo polite, nor ſo patheticall as that of Monſieur <hi>Vincent,</hi> and we muſt equally, (my quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Brother) acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that both my Genius and yours, what idea ſoever you may conceive of your ſelfe, are very much below the excellencies of that worthy perſon. This book which I write, and that miſhapen abortive iſſue of your braines, which you have dreſſed up and ſent abroad under your name, will ever be ſufficient demonſtrations of the difference there is between us and him. Whereto may be added, that the things which I diſcover are of ſuch a nature, as that it was impoſſible Monſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> ſhould have known them, and it was neceſſary he ſhould firſt have them from my mouth. Whence may be ſtarted this queſtion, what neceſsity there was, that, to lay them down in a ſimple and low ſtyle, as I have done, I ſhould employ the pen of that eloquent man?</p>
                     <p>I muſt therefore, to your confuſion and the glory of the Goſpell, let the world know, what ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block that is, which makes you fall ſo infamouſly. It

                     <p>Nor come <hi>I</hi> to examine the ridiculous refutation which the adverſary hath made to my Letters, and it ſhall be ſeen whether this famous <hi>Logician</hi> hath not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerved that the ſcholers of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſhould put an aſſe to ſupply his place in the ſeat whence he read his Lectures. He hath faſtened upon two Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former and that of moſt conſequence was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten foure moneths, and the Latter, two moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my departure. And by an unheard of kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he takes certain broken periods of the one not relating any way to the other to weaken the credit of certain propoſitions that are in the ſecond. Were it lawfull, according to his unperfect Philoſophy, to argue in that manner, St. <hi>Paul</hi> may very well be in fear that ſome miſchievous perſon, ſuch an other as <hi>Beaufes,</hi> might take ſome of his Letters, and muſtring together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all coherence, certain paſſages ſtraggled out of

What can be more formally againſt the Laws of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, then to make that competible to one time which is only to another? For inſtance, I had ſaid in one of my Letters whereof he produces this ſhred; <hi>I had been admitted to the fourth vow, to which none are, but ſuch as have been approved for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this envious wretch, knowing that the Society muſt needs be exaſperated to ſee one of thoſe that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the fourth vow fallen into the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the better to diſſemble it, and elude the reflections of the world thereupon, cites the words before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>I refer to the judgement of God thoſe who have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me</hi> &amp;c.

for thoſe never make any ſolemn. And yet ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this great Body animated by Hypocriſy, that; that is attributed to zeal, which proceeds meerly from diſſatisfaction, inſomuch that the greateſt part of thoſe that go upon Miſſions into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> not going thither upon any other account then that of avoiding the domeſtick traines of villany and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, they are forced to ſtruggle with (I ſay the greateſt part, not all) theſe ambitious ſpirits, who make all things contributory to their own reputation, will nevertheleſſe have theſe afflicted ſouls tranſported into thoſe parts as great Apoſtles, and would perſuade the people that their earneſtneſſe for the glory of God had wafted into thoſe barbarous regions, ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, and the affronts they had received, had baniſh'd into thoſe diſconſolate places. It hath been told me not long ſince by one of the moſt ſincere and vertuous men that were engaged in that Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Miſſion, that the motive which induced him to go for <hi>Portugal,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Indies</hi> was the ſupplantations and intrigues which were but too too apparent in his Province. I could give the names and ſirnames of a great number of theſe diſcontented perſons; and, if the inſolence of <hi>Beaufés</hi> force me thereto, I ſhall do it, and moreover produce a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of thoſe that are not of the number of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. Yet do I think fit to forbear it at the preſent, meerly out of a conſideration, that it is a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity to adde to the afflictions of a ſort of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whoſe conſciences cannot groan in this world under a greater burthen, then that of their being Jeſuits and wanting the courage to quit the Society.</p>

of the miſchief, but with this difference, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactions of theſe latter laſt onely for a certain time, and thoſe of the others are perpetuall, becauſe of the fatall neceſſity there is, by reaſon of the degree they are in, that they ſhould be contemptible. In a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where treacheries are ſo predominant, it is not to be expected that any man ſhould ſay he lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcontent. The community of the Jeſuits is a knot of undermining Serpents; let a man be ever ſo eminent, it is impoſſible he ſhould live a moneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, where there is ſo much bandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without making ſome complaint. <hi>John de la Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audie,</hi> a late Provinciall among them, was wont to ſay, that the moſt eminent of the Society, the better to digeſt diſſatisfactions they were to meet with, ſhould imagine to themſelves that they were condemned to the Galleys for ninety nine years. Jealouſie makes a diviſion amongſt the braveſt minds. Ambition forms in the ſouls of all thoſe that are more conſiderable in the Government of the Society great idaea's of their own perſons; for, perceiving themſelves raiſed to a higher condition then their Brethren, they think no acknowledgements more then their due. And this is the ſeminary of thoſe bloody complaints, thoſe inap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeable heart-burnings, and the implacable diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents which raiſe diviſions among them, and ſmother all ſentiments of Charity.

Another, a very Bacchanalian Prieſt, called <hi>John Ricard,</hi> a worm crept up into greatneſſe out of the duſt, by his profuſions of the revenues of the Novitiat, and the intereſt of certain Jeſuits of <hi>Paris,</hi> who recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſince his time, one <hi>Gilbert Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau,</hi> a man of an implacable and revengefull diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one that, the more to exaſperate the Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> preſumptuouſly threatned he would have the head of the Sieur <hi>des Eſtangs,</hi> though it ſhould multiply like that of a <hi>Hydra</hi> Theſe I ſay have, with ſo much inſolence, manag'd the affairs of that unhappy Province for the ſpace of nine or ten years laſt paſt, that the one half of the young men of greateſt hopes have forſaken them, and others of longer ſtanding have been content to groan, and ſtill do groan under their Tyranny. Were I now of the Order (which God forbid I ever ſhould) it were but juſt I ſhould repreſent theſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Pope, as their Supreme head, as ſome have already done. But ſince it hath been the pleaſure of God to bring me from among them, I ſhall diſcover them to the greater advantage of the publick.</p>

Thoſe, who take the Government of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> into a generall examination, cannot but conclude that ſo peſtilent an indiſpoſition will ever be falling from the head into the members, and that that imperious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy that exacts an implicite obedience from its ſubjects and that in all things whatſoever, cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but it muſt fill their hearts with perpetuall bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and heart burning.</p>
                     <p>The firſt foundation of diſcontent is thus layd. The Generall of the Order, who creates theſe ſubalternate Superiours, and the Provincials, upon whoſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and informations they are preferred to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, are guided by this maxime, not to put into em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the moſt deſerving, but the moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the end, ſay they, that they may ever be ready at hand, to be, like ſo many Maſtives, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the execution of thoſe Orders that come from <hi>Rome.</hi> From this, it muſt needs be inferred, that the Superiours are neither the moſt knowing, nor the moſt able, but a ſort of upſtarts, and very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in point of Literature, who not able to get into preferment upon any account of their own worth, as having not thoſe qualifications which are requiſite to render men excellent, are accordingly obliged to proſecute the deſignes of thoſe who are the Raiſers of them.</p>
                     <p>Now I deſire the kind Reader to imagine with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what diſturbances there muſt needs be in that Body where the blind lead thoſe that have their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſight, and he that is guilty of thouſands of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and hath little or nothing that is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in him, governs and diſpoſes of the greateſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and wiſeſt men. Hence muſt needs follow a contempt of the perſon governing, who is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called proud, ſelf-will'd, imperious, ignorant, thence diſſatisfactions are to the <hi>Generall,</hi> who admitted him, and exaſperations againſt the <hi>Provincials</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him.

                     <p>The ſecond inconvenience, is, that the Rectors are not ſhie of any ſo much as thoſe who are any way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent above others; and accordingly they make it their main buſineſſe to tread them under foot and make them contemptible. Upon this account is it, that they are inſupportably imperious in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not calling thoſe that are eminent above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rate, to adviſe with them, no more then if they were not of the houſe. And if they take them along with them in their viſits to great perſons, it is onely to make oſtentation of their ſuperiority above them; they ſpeake firſt, and make their inſolence the more notorious by the humility of thoſe great perſons, who are in all things obliged to comply with theſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Idols of preheminence, and, by their ſubmiſſions, to make it appear, that they are inferiour to ſuch as they far exceed in reputation and abilities. <hi>Haec Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni vox eſt, quicquid excelſum in regno cadat.</hi> To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without ſome kind of demonſtration, I deſire the Reader but to enquire what kind of people are <hi>John Ricard, William Ricard, Milſeneau, Iſhier, Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baud, la Rhede, Coulon, Saige, Guillard, Reginer, Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, Gadaud,</hi> and others of that rate, and he will find that they are no more known in <hi>Gnienne</hi> then if they were not there, ſo inconſiderable are their qualities. And yet theſe are the Superiours who ſit at the helm of the Society, and exerciſe their empire over the <hi>Camains,</hi> the <hi>Martinons,</hi> the <hi>Godefrés,</hi> the <hi>Goſſets,</hi> the moſt eminent Preachers and moſt excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.

                     <p>A third diſorder, is, that theſe Superiours, without the leaſt ground, and upon no other account then that of the commands laid upon them by the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,</hi>

Thence comes it, that it is commonly ſaid, that all the affairs of the Province are managed according to the directions of the <hi>Provinciall</hi> and two or three of his greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, who make no account of the reſt though in all things to be preferred before them. Thence alſo comes it, that at <hi>Rome,</hi> the General growes ſo imperious by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the intelligence that is between him and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials,</hi> whom he knows to be his creatures, that the yoke of obedience becomes inſupportable. Now let the Reader conſider with himſelf, whether any honeſt man can poſſibly bear with the inſolence of theſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavils,</hi> without ſo much as writing ſome Letters to diſcover his reſentment of ſuch miſcariages.</p>
                     <p>The fourth misfortune is the damme of no fewer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, and diſſatisfactions. Theſe pearching <hi>Rectors,</hi> not for that they had thoſe parts which were neceſſary for their recommendation to the Government, but

Tis the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall complaint of the graveſt men, that all deſignes are undertaken and accompliſhed without communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for theſe proud upſtarts, would think themſelves ſlighted, if a knowing man had given them ſome good advice. I have been in ſome Colledges where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have made ſo little account of the Ancients, that they called them not into their chambers to conſult with them, once in ſix moneths, and when they did, they propoſed nothing but trifles, ſo true is it that the preſumption of ſome particular men hath brought the Government among them to an incredible height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence. For a man to ſee his condition and fortunes managed according to the humour of an imperious ignorant man, and not bemoan himſelf, ſpeaks a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy above that of the ſevereſt Stoicks.</p>
                     <p>There remains yet a fiſt ſpring of diſcontents, which is, that the ſame <hi>Rectors</hi> carry things on with ſuch an abſolute diſpoſall in their Colledges, that it is in their power to put in execution their own advice, though contrary to that of all the reſt, and to oblige, nay they really do oblige their Subjects, prejudicially to the Lawes of the Nation they live in, to obey their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt commands, and to do their will.</p>

                     <p>All a man hath to do, to be excluded all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, to be indu'd with thoſe qualities that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Pope, coming at laſt to hear of theſe circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, publiſh'd a Brief not long ſince, whereby he commands, that all Superiours (the Generall only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) ſhould be diſplaced preciſely at the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of three years, and ſhould not be admitted to any ſuperiority for the ſpace of eighteen moneths thence next enſuing. This intermiſſion of Government, making them equall, if not inferiour to thoſe whom before they had tyranniſed over, galled their ſpirits to the quick, they accordingly left not a ſtone unmoved to get the Brief repealed, but not being able to obtain it, they could not be perſuaded to have it proclaimed, to the great contempt of the Popes power and authority; nay, to make up the meaſure of their infamy, they have caſt out pious and devout men for diſcovering a certain ſatisfaction at that piece of reformation, ſo important in order to an abatement of their inſolence, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition it was to perpetuate their charges and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a more intolerable injuſtice committed by them in the abuſe of their uſurped authority. The moſt eloquent <hi>Preachers</hi> are not thoſe that preach in the moſt eminent places, nor are they the moſt acute <hi>Divines</hi> that teach in the moſt famous Schools, nor yet thoſe the greateſt <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> that are the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in their chiefeſt Colledges.

                     <p>Hence comes it that Learning is not attended by reward, excellency carryes not the honour of the day, deſerts are diſcarded, and there is hardly any one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to employments of conſequence but thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Preferment depends abſolutely on the favour and countenance of the ſuperiours; vertue is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to be trod under foot.</p>
                     <p>This kind of unjuſtice will diſcover it ſelf much more to our obſervation, if we do but conſider the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions required by ſuch as are injured.

All I have now to do ſhall be to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that theſe Rules are two Sources of injuſtice and diſcontent. Of injuſtice they are, for that theſe <hi>Syndications</hi> are a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ort of ſecret informations made of the faults or offences of another, given in to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour without proof or hearing the parties concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. There cannot be a fairer opportunity then this, for the miſchievous to oppreſſe the good by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret accuſations, which the other never come to the knowledge of. The envious have the like advantage to put a rub in their way whoſe endeavours are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately contributory to the publick good, when they leaſt think of any ſuch thing; and the Superiours, who have not an equall affection for all their Subjects, are not a litle glad to have, in their Reading-Seats articles and informations to put a ſlurte upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, and ſuch as any way eclypſe their reputation. Now I leave it to the conſideration of any judicious man, from the generall inclination which we have to take notice rather of that which is evill then that which is good, and the impreſſion that an obligation which they imagine lyes upon them to diſcover all things rather then break their Rule, may make in weak minds, whether ſuch a government be not deſtructive, and without any difficulty, chargeable with injuſtice;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35086:88"/>
it being an ordinary acknowledgement, that the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome triviall circumſtance may make a good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a bad action good.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, I affirm theſe Rules to be a ſourſe of diſcontents, for it will be found by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall of the <hi>Archivi</hi> of the Superiours, that of three hundred ſuch, that now live in <hi>Guienne,</hi> there ſhall not be one that may be called a vertuous man, that is, hath not been accuſed of ſeverall offences. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, ſuch as are thoſe of diverſe of them, are contradictory; one ſaies white, another black. In the greateſt part there are aggravations and imaginary inferences made, and ordinarily falſifications and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures. Were there a legall proceeding, ſome would be acquitted, others convicted of their crimes. But inſtead of a juridicall procedure, the Superiours go by the way of informations, as they think moſt convenient. If any one hath ſpoken advantageouſly of any of their Friends, they make the beſt they can of thoſe favourable Suffrages, and the world ſhall hear nothing of their defects. If any one hath ſpoken ill of thoſe whom they affect not, or any way ſtand in fear of, they conceal their vertues, and produce againſt him thoſe injurious ſuggeſtions. So that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver furniſhed with materials to condemn ſome and to acquit others, it being the main deſign of theſe Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, or ſecret informations, to make the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours uncontroulable, the inferiours unfortunate.</p>
                     <p>This contagious union, and poyſon of fraternall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cannot but raiſe in them a miſtruſt one of another, and puts them into a fear that any one may ſell them in a manner, to ingratiate himſelf with thoſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. I deſire any one that hath frequented the claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to reflect and conſider, whether they are not much more free in point of converſation, when they have to do with ſecular perſons, then when they are among themſelves. Though ten ſtrangers ſhould come into the place where they are engaged in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35086:88"/>
their preſence ſhould not oblige them to any more reſervedneſſe, but if ſome Jeſuit drop in, all is immediately ſmothered. The reaſon whereof can be no other then that their Government is grounded on cenſures and Syndications, and that every man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the ill offices of <hi>Eves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>droppers</hi> and <hi>Informers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the end therefore that a man ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented among a Society of Sycophants and detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, the onely way, is, to burne the Rules they have, and to make others. Let not therefore any man be aſtoniſhed to find ſo many forſaking the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when they do it meerly for their own quiet ſake, nor wonder that thoſe who continue therein have in a manner perpetuall occaſion of complaint and repining, and betray it in both words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I acknowledge, that I bemoan'd my ſelf to <hi>Rouſſeau,</hi> the Provinciall, foure moneths before I came from among the curſed crue, but it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain withall, that the grounds of my complaint were ſo juſt, that I ſhould not have expoſed my ſelf to ever the more cenſure, though my Letters had been more ſharp and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the Reader does but reflect on the occaſions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which I have diſcovered in the four precedent Chapters, he cannot but he ſatisfied, that it is an ordinary thing in that ill diſciplined body, to write bloody and invective Letters, and that they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me very much, by producing mine, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the world, that my converſion was not reall and ſincere.</p>

                     <p>SAtan who transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light, cannot ſo abſolutely conceal his uglineſſe under the borrowed beauties of an Archangel, but that he ſtill diſcovers himſelf to be a Devil, by ſome claw or other which divine Permiſſion will not give him leave altogether to hide. Let the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> pretend ever to ſo much ſincerity, in the publication of my Letters, yet ſhall the world find them to be, what they really are, cheats, falſificators, impoſtors. I muſt needs acknowledge that I writ a Letter to <hi>Gilbert Rouſſeau,</hi> out of no other deſign then to expoſtulate a little with him about my imployments, and to let him know how much I reſented, and was diſſatisfied with the diſpoſall he had made of me to preach on Sundayes and feſtivall dayes at <hi>Rochell.</hi> Not that I thought my ſelfe any way diſparaged to be employed in that noble City, but that it was my expectation that the infamous impoſtor ſhould, according to the Letters I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, have diſpoſed more honourably of me, and taken occaſion to appoint me ſome good place to preach in the Advent and Lent, ſutably to the good ſucceſſe I had had at <hi>Nantes,</hi> when there was a generall Aſſembly of the Eſtates of the Province of <hi>Brittany,</hi> and but a litle before on the Octave of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day at <hi>Poictiers.</hi> But, finding my hopes fruſtrated, I muſt confeſſe I put pen to paper and writ the Letter mentioned, with great deliberation, inſomuch that out of the intimacy there was between me and <hi>Peter Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnier</hi> and <hi>James le Grand,</hi> I communicated it to them. All thoſe that know me will ſay thus much for my juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35086:89"/>
that I had reaſon to complain. Nay, the Provinciall himſelf was not inſenſible thereof, as may appeare by his keeping of the Letter for the ſpace of foure moneths in the <hi>Archivi,</hi> out of a deſigne to vindicate himſelfe againſt me, if the buſineſſe ſhould ever come before the <hi>Generall,</hi> but now that it hath pleaſed God, out of his mercy, to reduce me to the Reformed Religion, he hath made other advantages thereof.</p>
                     <p>It argues a ſtrange conjunction of weakneſſe and malice to be forced to make uſe of Falſifications to perſwade the world there can be much inferred from a pityfull Letter penned out of diſcontent. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate and vindicative ſort of people, who make no great difficulty to ſwallow <hi>Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Antidates,</hi> making it their buſineſſe to perſwade the people, firſt that I was an inconſiderable perſon, and ſecondly, that it was a ſuggeſtion of <hi>vanity</hi> rather then of <hi>verity</hi> that prevailed with me to forſake the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, imagined, that the Letter I had written, whereby I diſcovered the diſſatisfaction it was to me to preach in Countrey villages, might contribute ſomewhat to their deſigne. But finding withall that in the ſame Letter I made mention of my preaching before the Generall Aſſembly of the Eſtates of <hi>Brittany,</hi> and on the Octave of the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> (as they call it) at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> they could not but at the ſame time craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily inferre, that the world, reflecting on the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations requiſite to preach with applauſe at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and before a generall meeting of an illuſtrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, might open their eyes and ſay, It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon that this man complains of hard meaſure. For if it be ſo, as is apparent to all the world, that he preaches with ſatisfaction before an Aſſembly of Biſhops, Lords, Preſidents, &amp;c. and that in ſuch a number that there are ſeldome ſeen ſo eminent Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, the Provinciall is very much to blame to put him upon a miſſion to country villages. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35086:90"/>
concluded it neceſſary to falſifie the Letter, and to ſuppreſſe the beginning, ſo to produce onely what made for their deſign, and conceal what made for my advantage and commendation, upon which reſolution they ſhortned the Letter, which ran in theſe words.</p>

                     <p>WHat can be expected from a fool that hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a ſword into his hand, but that he ſhould ſtrike without any conſideration, and haply do as much miſchief to his Friends as thoſe whom he takes to be his enemies.

But his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not being of any great reach, foreſaw not the wound he at the ſame time gave himſelf and thoſe of his Fraternity. Could Monſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> have a fairer occaſion to handle him as he hath, or could they give me a better opportunity to diſcover the genealogies of abundance of the moſt eminent of the Society? I am confident that <hi>Beaufes</hi> never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted <hi>Rouſeau,</hi> his Provinciall, when he fell into this piece of indiſcretion, nor took the advice of <hi>Penot</hi> or <hi>Daron,</hi> who live with him in the Colledge of <hi>Rochel.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> made it very much their buſineſſe, from their firſt inſtitution to this very day, to make the world believe, that, for the moſt part, thoſe who were admitted into their Society were perſons of good extraction, and many were perſuaded it was ſo; but this man hath of a ſudden pulled down all that they had built, and were builded upon that account.

When <hi>Ignatius</hi> came to inſiſt on the qualifications, which ſhould make the Superiours of his Order the more reſpected, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is, that thoſe ſhould be particularly advanced to Government who were of noble extraction; for beſides that they are more recommendable in the ſight of ſtrangers, the Religious men themſelves are more willing to obey ſuch perſons then thoſe that iſſue out of the peaſantry. If therefore there be any thing of Nobility in this Society, we ſhall find it in the moſt eminent charges thereof.

                     <p>IT is a great argument, that <hi>James Beaufes</hi> is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe paſſion very much out-weighs his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherwiſe he would not have given me ſo faire an occaſion to caſt diviſion and diſorder in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, by a diſcovery of the degrees that are among them.

The world may therefore take notice, that there are <hi>foure</hi> kinds of degrees among the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt noble is that of thoſe who are admitted to a <hi>Profeſſion of the fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ow,</hi> of which ranke are the <hi>Generall,</hi> the <hi>Aſſiſtants, Provincialls, Superiours</hi> of profeſſed Houſes, great <hi>Divines,</hi> eminent <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> and rare and excellent <hi>Humanists.</hi> No man ought to be admitted to this degree, but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome more then ordinary endowments.

that they are ſimply aſſiſtants to the <hi>Profeſs'd,</hi> and, as an honeſt <hi>Recollect</hi> of <hi>Marennes</hi> ſaid, little <hi>Titus's</hi> and <hi>Timotheus's</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>Paul's</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's.</hi> Theſe alſo make the three ſimple and ſolemn vowes of <hi>Poverty, Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and cannot aſpire to any advancement, though they ſhould, in proceſſe of time become more learned then <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Aquinas.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt degree is of thoſe, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Order to be ſerviceable to others in the drudgeries of the Houſes, ſuch as are thoſe that are employed in the <hi>ſacriſty,</hi> the <hi>Kitchin, Shoom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ordinary way, to bring Learned men to a rank ſuitable to their deſerts and Learning, are the <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> through which a man muſt paſſe to make a diſcovery of his abilities; and theſe ought to be ſo impartially managed, that the Examiners ſhould ſwear, that they give their ſuffrages and judgement conſcientiouſly. From this ſhort explication the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may inferre what a diſcourteſy <hi>James Beaufes</hi> hath done many of his Brethren, when he gives me occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſcover the wretched conditions wherein many of them are involved, and the reaſon I have had to make boaſt of my admiſſion to the firſt and higheſt degree.</p>
                     <p>This laid down by the way, we may obſerve in the diſcourſe of <hi>Beaufes,</hi> three notorious defects. The firſt is, an impudent falſhood, when he ſayes, that to be of the number of the Profeſſed is a thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that there is not any Prieſt elder then my ſelfe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35086:97"/>
who is not of it. But to go no further than <hi>Rochell</hi> to convince him, there are Father <hi>Penot,</hi> F. <hi>Daron,</hi> F. <hi>Galtier,</hi> F. <hi>Richard,</hi> F. <hi>Quintin,</hi> (if ſo be they are there ſtil) all elder then I am by fifteen years, yet are not oſ that number. Nay, I could name ſixty more, were it neceſſary, but I forbear, becauſe I think it hard meaſure to add to the afflictions of thoſe whoſe hearts are ſufficiently burthened already through the imprudences of my Adverſary.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond very much argues the decaies of his underſtanding, in that, being to write a treatiſe, he knowes not what he ought to faſten on, what to let paſſe. What trouble was it to him that I ſhould be of the number of thoſe that are admitted to the fourth vow, when he was reſolved not to deny it? Did he imagine, that upon his telling the people, that in the beſt regulated Societies it is not impoſſible but ſome worthleſſe skip-jack may creep in, men would be immediately perſuaded that an exceſſe of favour advanced me to that degree? Ah! I pity the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dence and diſ-circumſpection of the man, who forgets that he makes my diſcontents and diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the occaſion of my quitting the Society, and yet does withall reproach me with the meanneſſe of my birth.</p>
                     <p>The third is an inſupportable injury, which he does many of his Fraternity that labour earneſtly in their rank, who yet, not being known to be <hi>ſpirituall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutors,</hi> manage their buſineſſe with reputation; but when the world comes to be acquainted with their condition, they fall into diſeſteem and their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in point of edification prove the leſſe effectuall. How often have theſe depreſſed Aſſiſtants addreſſed themſelves, not without reaſon, by way of complaint to the Superiours, againſt the inſolencies of ſome that crow'd over them, and would, the more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage them in the Monaſteries, tell the Nunnes that they were not of the number of the <hi>Profeſſed?</hi> When
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35086:98"/>
they reflect on theſe malicious offices, it raiſes ſuch a heart burning in them, that they cannot look on their Judges without indignation, nor heare any thing of this difference of Orders in their Society, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dejected and diſcouraged thereby. <hi>Beaufes</hi> to give them ſome comfort, by a ſingular act of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, pretending to reduce all the ancient Prieſts to the ſame Category, obliges me to diſcover the difference there is between them, and to make it appear, that thoſe good people have been thought incapable ever to arrive at any degree of excellence, and the greateſt part of them have been diſcarded in the ſtudy of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for want of appreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beaufes</hi> is excellent at both, when, to diſguiſe and diſparage my employments, he ſayes that I was not declared the ſole Confeſſor of all, becauſe it is the Popes pleaſure, as he ſayes, that there ſhould be two. Had this man but one ſmall grain of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he could not thus contradict himſelf in all he ſayes. For if I am one of the two Confeſſors, as he acknowledges, I am conſequently a Confeſſor to all, and all are at liberty to come to me, according to the <hi>Brief,</hi> and I am obliged to receive them all. My Collegue hath the ſame power, and we have an equall juriſdiction over all, for according to the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, they are at liberty to make their Confeſſions, ſometimes to the one, and ſometimes to the other; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35086:99"/>
I may ſay that it hath happened ſeverall times that I have my ſelf heard the confeſſions of all; which could not be, if one part were aſſigned to me and another to my Colleague. The thing is as clear as day, if a man would but conſider the reaſon why the Pope put out the Brief; that is, to the end that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Religious ſhould ſuffer no violence, he gives them liberty to go indifferently to either as they ſhould think good themſelves. But obſerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the malicious envy and the metaphyſicall flights of this ignorant Sir <hi>James,</hi> who is ſo cautious as not to adde that I was, without collegue or companion in matter of ſpirituall advice, the ghoſtly Father of all, and conſequently had an advantage over the other Confeſſor, who had not the ſame management of things ſpirituall. If ever I write any thing by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> I ſhall take occaſion to ſhew wherein the great weight and charge of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter office conſiſts.</p>

They have ſpoken that which is untrue in many particulars, as the world hath ſeen, and the prudent Reader, if he will but take the pains to compare their words with their words, ſhall eaſily ſurpriſe them in their abominable lyes.

                     <p>I am therefore to entreat the Reader to take this into his particular obſervation, that, though they have not left a ſtone unmoved to compaſſe my deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well by indictment, as in their Sermons and printed books, yet have they not been able to ſay any thing to my diſparagement, ſave that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an imaginary Sacriledge, by ſaying Maſſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Monſieur <hi>de la Thuiellerie,</hi> as the ſame Father <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> hath related, that I was a perſon of conſequence, who had not all the time of my abode among them done any thing that might blaſt my reputation, and that he would very much oblige their Order, if he could prevail with me to come back again to the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, ſince that it muſt infallibly be ſome high diſguſt that had forced me to that extremity. Now let the Reader but compare the Elogies, which theſe diſ-intereſſed perſons, give me, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies caſt upon me by <hi>Beaufes,</hi> and he will find that thoſe two former ſpeak conſonantly to the truth, and the reputation I lived in; and that the latter, who is a perſon, infamous even among his own for his evill ſpeaking and detraction, does not write and ſpeak in his Sermons, out of any other motive then that of choler and exaſperation.</p>

                     <p>For what concerns the <hi>publick</hi> he may tell them, I was their <hi>Preacher,</hi> that is, one that ought to be as remarkable for his life as doctrine.

But this ſhallow-brain'd fellow muſt needs immediately fall to invectives, to perſwade the world, that I was a perſon fit onely to be employed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey villages, becauſe I had in a Letter diſcovered ſome diſſatisfaction that I was forced to endure the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of <hi>Cardinall-Miſſions.</hi> There it was that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Vincent</hi> took him by the eare, telling him, that the very yeare of my departure I preached before the Eſtates of <hi>Britany</hi> at <hi>Nantes,</hi> at <hi>Poictiers</hi> on the <hi>Octave,</hi> at <hi>Rochell,</hi> according to ordinary deſignation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon takes occaſion to aske him, whether <hi>Nantes, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers</hi> and <hi>Rochell</hi> were Countrey villages, whether Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Lords, Preſidents, and all the Deputies of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Eſtates were Peaſants, and whether all the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate inhabitants of thoſe faire Cities were yeomen and carters? This puts poor <hi>Beaufes</hi> to ſuch a loſſe that he hath not a word to ſay, but folds up his Letter which gave him occaſion to make ſuch a noiſe, to ſhew, that I preached onely in Country villages. <hi>Fontenay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>le-Comte,</hi> a place but nine Leagues diſtant from <hi>Rochell,</hi> will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on my behalfe, that, the yeare before I preached on the octave at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> I had preached at our <hi>Ladie</hi>'s faire Church there, in the <hi>Advent, Lent,</hi> on t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Society is to endeavour to ingratiate it ſelf as much as may be with the Inhabitants of the place where they are entertained, eſpecially upon the allowance of a new Foundation. This may be advantageouſly done by an explication of the end and deſign of the Society, as it is layd down in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rule of the Summary, namely, <hi>To be as tender of the wellfare of our Neighbour as their own.</hi> Upon this account are the meaneſt things to be undergone, Hoſpitals are to be viſited, the pooreſt miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and adviſed; the Fathers are to go to places at no ſmall diſtance if need require, to receive the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of all whatſoever; charitable collections are to be made, and thoſe to be diſpoſed of to the poor, <hi>in the preſence of many,</hi> to the end that they, edified and ſtirred up by our example may afterwards prove the more liberall towards us.

                     <head type="sub">What courſe is to be taken to inſinuate into the favour and familiarity of Grandees and Princes.</head>
                     <p>THis is, above all others, a thing to be endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the greateſt earneſtneſſe poſſible. Tis a leſſon learnt by experience that Princes do ordinarily conceive an affection for ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall perſons, when their actions are not Baptiſtically cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and reproved, but with as much favour as may be all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>viated. This is apparent in the marriages of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their neareſt kindred, there ariſing alwayes great difficulties in the negotiation thereof, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vulgar opinion which faſtens ſomething of execration on ſuch contracts, When therefore we ſee Princes reſolved on ſuch things, it will be our duty to encourage and aſſiſt them in their inceſtuous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let ſuch reaſons be inſiſted on, as may heighten their deſires, as for inſtance, that Matrimony with thoſe circumſtances might prove the occaſion of a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35086:113"/>
ſtricter allyance, and contribute more to the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, when the Prince intends to doe ſomething, which the Nobility ſeemes to be averſe from, or not very ready to give their conſent to, (as for example, engage in a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>) his will is principally to be humour'd, and conſtancy of reſolution to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated as the greateſt endowment of a Prince. The Fathers are to perſuade the Nobility, that a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the deſignes of their Prince is the nobleſt character of that rank. But let them forbear inſiſting on particulars, left any imputation fall upon us. Yet if it happen that we are charged with any thing; let the Fathers cite thoſe generall Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which permit us not to intermeddle in ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo no ſmall ſtep into the favour of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to engage in the Agency and negotiation of things acceptable to them. Thoſe that are their neareſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants muſt be gained by little preſents, to make a diſcovery of the Princes humour and diſpoſition, what things he is delighted with, how he is to be pleaſed; yet this is to be done with a reſpect had to vertue and good Conſcience. And ſo making their advantages of ſuch diſcoveries they are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves into an intimacy with great men and Princes. If they are Batchelors or widdowers let the Fathers propoſe matches to them, but ſuch as, with their Relations, are favourable to us. Let thoſe be recommended to them as ſuch as the Princes themſelves would wiſh them to be. By this means will it come to paſſe, that we ſhall by theſe allyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ingra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Left the women change their minds, or time work any remiſſion of their favour towards us, let their affection for our Society be repreſented to them as the moſt meritorious thing of any, as well by our Fathers, as by ſuch of their owne ſex as creep into their attendances by ſome recommendation of ours; with whom a certain correſpondence is to be held by preſents and good offices. By which meanes will the eaſie natured wenches be induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale their Miſtreſſes ſecrets, and diſcover ſuch things, as it may make very much for our advantage to know.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers of our Society, are, in the diſpoſall and directions of Great mens conſciences to follow the opinion of thoſe Authors who allow a greater freedome and indempnity to ſinne, contrary to the practife of the Monkes and Friers. This done, the effect will be, that, thoſe diſcarded, they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ours, and be guided by their advice and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore, the better to curry favour with Princes, Prelates and Noblemen, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to communicate to them the merits of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: to perſuade them that we have extraordinary priviledges to abſolve in reſerved Caſes and matters of Cenſure, to give diſpenſation as to Faſting, as alſo to exempt men from paying their debts, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with them, as to the impediments of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and other vowes. Let them be invited to our Schooles; celebrated with verſes; Let <hi>Theſes</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to them; if it be requiſite let them be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the Refectory: and if the quality of the perſon will permit it, let them be ſaluted in ſeverall tongues, while they are at Table by ſome of our Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                     <p>If there be any differences between great men, let the Fathers endeavour the compoſure thereof. If there chance to be an eminent perſon that, being no favourer of our Society, is nevertheleſſe employed by

                     <p>FOr the better Inſtitution of Kings, Princes, and perſons of Honour, our Fathers are to direct them in all things with that circumſpection and prudence, that their direction may ſeem to tend to the quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of their conſciences whereof they have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them with the management and diſpoſall. Their direction therefore ought not immediately, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible degrees, to incline towards things relating to externall policy. They are, to that end, often to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate to Princes, that the diſtribution of Honours and dignities in the Common-wealth is to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated according to Juſtice, and to perſuade them that they never offend God ſo highly as by a contempt thereof. But theſe things are to be repreſented with this caution, that it is not without ſome violence to themſelves that they any way meddle with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Commonwealth, and that they are in a manner forced to ſpeak out of a conſideration of their duty.</p>
                     <p>This when Princes are once made ſenſible of, let them have lectures read to them of the Vertues where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with thoſe perſons ought to be endued who are to be advanced in the Commonwealth. But let the maine deſign of the recommendation reflect on ſuch as are Friends of our Society, and ſuch others, whoſe admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Government may prove advantageous to the Society: whom yet it is not fit for the Confeſſors and Preachers to name to the Prince, but to leave that to be done by ſuch as are aſſured Friends to the Society,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35086:116"/>
and have an intereſt in the Prince. To this end are the Confeſſors and Preachers to have an account from the Society of what Men there are in all parts of the Princes Dominions, of their qualities, power, intereſts, wealth, and particularly, of their liberality towards us. They are to have a liſt of their names, that they may accordingly give a character of them to the Prince to whom they are to be dextrouſly commended; that ſo he may be the ſooner induc'd, when occaſion ſerves, to preferre thoſe, whom he ſhall call to mind to have been long before recommended to him by his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and Preachers.</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſors and Preachers to Princes are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to remember, that they are to deal very mildly and tenderly with them, by all means to forbear being too much given to reproof and cenſure in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and private conferences. Let them be very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail'd with to accept of Sweet-meats, Spirits, &amp;c. and content themſelves, in order to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe, with little money. When they are in Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let them not think it any diſhonour to make vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to the moſt obſcure Lodgings. Let them prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcate to their Princes, that there is nothing ſo dangerous, as, in the leaſt meaſure to ſlight the advice of their ghoſtly Fathers. Be they carefull, with the ſooneſt, to get notice of the death or removall of the Officers of the Commonwealth, that ſo timely proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be made for the ſupply of their places. But that no imputation of being over-pragmaticall in the affaires of the world, might be faſten'd on them, let them not undertake the ſollicitation even of their Friends cauſes to their Princes, but rather recommend them to the management of others.</p>

                  <p>FRom ſome paſſages in the enſuing Treatiſe, it may eaſily be inferred that the Author thereof was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> thas is, one, who, though diſſatisfied with the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> yet ſeems to deal with them as mercifully, and with as much tenderneſſe as might be. So that it is to be imagined the Piece was written rather out of deſigne to bemoan their miſcarriages, that they might thence take occaſion to reform them, then out of any pique that the Author ſeems to have againſt the <hi>Society,</hi> whoſe ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Church upon their firſt Jnſtitution he ſufficiently acknowledges and celebrates. Whence, if a man reflects on the time it was written in, that is, while the Society had yet ſomewhat of its firſt purity and zeal left, before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſation of S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Xaverius,</hi> he muſt withall imagine, that it began to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in a manner, as ſoon as it began. And what is conſequent to this, that, if ſome zealous Chriſtian ſhould in theſe dayes undertake to give an account, <hi>why the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>are ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated,</hi> ſince the diſcovery made of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and extravagant <hi>Tenents,</hi> and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
<pb facs="tcp:35086:132"/>
they have introduced into <hi>Chriſtian Morality,</hi> he would be ſo far from confining himſelf to the ſhortneſſe of ſuch a Diſcourſe as this, that he would haply take it as a favour, to ſit down and breathe a little, after a ſecond or third Volume.</p>

And ſuch no doubt it was intended by the Founder thereof, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and ſuch, it is to be thought, continu'd while it was cultivated by thoſe firſt Fathers, from whoſe Piety, and auſterity, as it deriv'd vigour and life, ſo did it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of children, the ſaving of ſouls, and the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>But the indefatigable Enemy of Mankind, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, who is exaſperated at all manner of good, and whatſoever hath the leaſt tendency to reformation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover d his earneſtneſs and ſubtilty to deſtroy this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>tree,</hi> and with it all the fruitfull advantages the world expected to reap thereby; taking occaſion even from the greatneſs it ſelf of this Religious Order, and from that admirable improvement which it had made in ſo ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is therefore to be noted, that the Society of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> ſpreading and enlarging it ſelf more and more by their undertaking the education of Children (a deſign no doubt acceptable to all Cities and Kingdomes) they accordingly, upon their firſt Inſtitution ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiated themſelves with <hi>Princes,</hi> that in a few <hi>years</hi> they diffus'd themſelves ſo far as other <hi>Orders</hi> had done in many <hi>Centuries.</hi>

But I ſhall think it ſufficient to glance only at ſome few things, leaving it to other mens judgements to make what gloſſes they ſhall think fitt thereupon, and to conceive an Ida a of thoſe men ſuitable thereto. The enſuing heads therefore I deſire the Reader to take for the ground of his diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers of the Society finding that their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preaching, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other religious and Monaſticall exerciſes contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not ſo much as was expected to the raiſing of them to the greatneſſe they aſpired to, were forc'd to think of other wayes to effect their deſign. For though (as is ſaid) they were entertain'd at the beginning with all kindneſs by many people, yet in proceſs of time they perceived that, through diſſatisfaction, or ſome other occaſion, thoſe that had honour'd them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before withdrew their affection from them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fearing their growth ſhould determine in their infancy, they found out two other wayes to keep up, and to enlarge the greatneſſe of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35086:148"/>
One was, by calumnies and crafty inſinuations to raiſe in the minds of <hi>Princes,</hi> and conſequently as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others as they could, a baſe opinion of all other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Inſtitutions,</hi> making them deſpicable by diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their imperfections, and like ſubtill <hi>Politicians,</hi> building up their own greatneſſe upon the ruines of others. By this means got they out of the hands of the lawfull Poſſeſſors, many Monaſteries, Abbeys and other Spirituall revenues, depriving thoſe Religious men that formerly enjoy'd them, both of them, and all that belonged thereto.</p>
                  <p>Another was, their pragmaticall engaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Affairs of <hi>State,</hi> thruſting themſelves into the intereſts and concernments of Chriſtian Princes. To bring this to effect, they have as ſubtill and artificious a device as any the world was yet acquainted withall; into which, as it is hard to penetrate, ſo is it almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make a full diſcovery thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> is the conſtant reſidence of the chief of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, commonly known by the name of <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Pather Generall,</hi> to whom all the reſt render exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Beſides him, there are for the moſt part reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the ſame place certain perſons choſen from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other Fathers, who from the Aſſiſtance they alwayes give Him, are called his <hi>ASSISTANTS.</hi> Of this quality there is one at leaſt as a Repreſentative of every Nation, who, from the Nation he repreſents, takes his name. Hence, one is ſtiled the <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> of <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> another of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a third of <hi>Italy,</hi> a fourth of <hi>England,</hi> a fiſt of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and ſo of all Provinces and Kingdoms. Their main buſineſs is, to give the <hi>F. General</hi> an account of all Occurrences of State in thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kingdoms whereof they are the reſpective <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants.</hi> This they perform by the means of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents, who, upon that deſign, have their reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the principall Cities of the Provinces and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms where they are. And theſe are perpetually ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling up and down to inform themſelves of the State,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35086:148"/>
quality, nature, inclination and intentions of Princes, and take advantage of all opportunities to advertiſe the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> of ſuch accidents as they have diſcovered. Theſe no ſooner receive them, but they diſburthen themſelves of all into the boſom of the Father <hi>Generall,</hi> who thereupon calling his <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> to Councell, they do as it were anatomiſe the whole world, comparing and ballancing the intereſts, concernments and deſigns of all Chriſtian Princes. Here they conſult of all freſh intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence receiv'd from their Correſpondents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly examining and conferring them together, it is at laſt reſolv'd, that the affairs of ſuch a Prince ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, the deſigns of another oppos'd as they ſhall conceive moſt for their intereſt and advantage. And as it is poſſible, that the ſtander by may better ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a Plot, then the Gameſter employ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d in it; ſo is it likely, that the Fathers of the Society taking as it were a generall view <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f the intereſts of all Princes, are the better able to obſerve the circumſtances of place and time, and effectually advance the Affairs of that Prince who is likely to prove the greateſt favourer of them.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly a thing evil in it ſelf and inſupportable, that a ſort of men devoted to a Religious life, ſhould ſo much intermeddle with matters of State, it being their duty to provide for the welfare of ſouls, as ſuch as had to that end taken leave of the concernments of the world. But it is to be conſidered, that the Fathers of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are, as to this point, more intangled then thoſe who have the management thereof, and for many pernicious conſequences ariſing thereby; this procedure of theirs will be found moſt miſchievous, and conſequently ſuch as requires a ſpeedy and effectuall remedy.</p>
                  <p>For, in the firſt place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>J ſuits</hi> are <hi>Confeſſors</hi> to the greateſt part of the <hi>Nobility</hi> in all States and Kingdoms that acknowledge a ſubmiſsion to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, that they might be the more ready to entertain theſe, and none but theſe they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to admit ordinary perſons to their Confeſſionaries, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather at an Empire over the Conſciences of <hi>Princes,</hi> themſelves. By this means do they craftily dive into the deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, reſolutions and inclinations as well of <hi>Soveraigns</hi> as of <hi>Subjects,</hi> whereof they immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Father-<hi>Generall</hi> or his <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now to perceive and be ſatisfy'd what prejudice this muſt needs be to Princes, and what rubbes may be laid in their way when they imagine their affaires in a ſaire and ſecure poſture, a man needs no extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſince <hi>ſecrecy</hi> is a proper and inſeparable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which ſo attends the <hi>ſafety</hi> of a State, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And whereas on the other ſide, the underſtandiug of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Princes deſigns makes a man the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and more able to judge of his own condition, it is accordingly ordinary with them to be at vaſt charges in the maintenance of <hi>Ambaſſad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Inſomuch, that they have a more particular knowledge of the power, poſſeſſions, expences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Princes then the Princes themſelves have, and this without any other charge then that of the carriage of their Letters; which yet in <hi>Rome</hi> alone (as I have it from the relation of the Perſons employ'd about

                  <p>Coming then by this means to know exactly the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of all Princes, they do not only do ill offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, but wound their reputation with their own ſubjects, depreſſing or advancing their concernments at their pleaſure. And that they can with the leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty do, for that by the ſame way of <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Conſultations</hi> they ſerpent-like glide into the very ſecrets of the peoples ſoules, knowing who ſtand well affected to their Prince, who diſſatisfy'd and exaſperated. So that by theſe relations which they have of State-affairs they may eaſily ſow diſcord among Princes, raiſe thouſands of jealouſies, and by their inſight into the Subject's affections, raiſe commotions and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, making the perſon of the Prince contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible.</p>
                  <p>From all which there can be no leſſe inferr'd, then that there is not any thing may prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ifting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, and making their advantages thereof to infinuate into the favour of Princes.

                  <p>Thirdly, which is a greater diſcovery then hath been made yet, the world is to take notice, that there are four ſorts or degrees of <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> The firſt <hi>degree</hi> is compos'd

of a number of ſecular perſons of both ſexes, that are taken or admitted to be of the Society, living accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly under a certain obedience, which themſelves call an <hi>implicite Obedience.</hi> Theſe are guided in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the advice of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> reſigning themſelves in all things abſolutely to their conduct.

adulterate relations had ſo ſhuffled things, that there was but little credit left for what might be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Ambaſſadors and other Agents employ'd therein.</p>
                  <p>The ſame tricks they play the Prelates of <hi>Rome,</hi> they alſo put upon other Princes, either by themſelves, or by the means of their Penſionary <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> out of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it may well be concluded, that the greateſt part of what is done all over the Chriſtian world, paſſes through the hands of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and thoſe only take effect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which they make no oppoſition. Stupendious and inexpreſſible are the artifices and inſinuations they make uſe of in this kind, which though it is impoſſible for me to decypher, yet may it not haply be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to thoſe Princes, who ſhall ſeriouſly obſerve the ſlight Character I have here given of them. For if they do, they preſently reflect on the things that are paſt, and as they muſt needs be more and more convinc'd of the truth of my diſcourſe, the more they call to mind with what Art things have been handled, ſo will it ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in the diſcovery of what ſeem'd ſo ſtrange and marvellous to them. Nay, not content with this cloſe artifice, whereby they inſenſibly thruſt themſelves into the Affaires of the world, out of a confidence that it is the only means to attain that Monarchicall Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency at which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thence taking occaſion to commend it to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the publick good of the Church, they required that he would command all his Legates and Apoſtolicall Nuncio's to take to them every one for his Companion and confident, ſome <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> by whoſe Counſell he ſhould be governed in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by theſe crafty inſinuations, and their infight into Affairs of publick concernment, the moſt eminent among the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have gain'd the love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Princes, as well <hi>Temporall</hi> as <hi>Spirituall,</hi> whom they have the confidence to perſwade that they have ſaid and done many things for their advantage; and this proceeding of theirs is the Damme of two very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable inconveniences. The firſt is, that, abuſing the favour and friendſhip which the Princes had for them, they have made no difficulty to diſguſt many private, though otherwiſe rich and Noble Families, uſurping the wealth of Widowes, though with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of their Retinue and Relations to extreme miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: enticing, to embrace their Inſtitution, and to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent their Schools, perſons of the nobleſt and moſt hopefull inclination, who yet if they prov'd unfit for the employments they deſign'd them for, were under ſome pretence or other diſmiſs'd the Society, which though it parted from their perſons, yet could not be got to part with their Eſtates.

                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Inconvenience is, that theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> omit no occaſion whereby they would make the world ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the familiarity and influence which they have over Princes, making the people, by their crafty repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of it, look thereon as through a magnifying glaſſe, to the end they may ingratiate themſelves with their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and ſo bring things about, that all that ſtand in need of favour may make their applications to them.

do accordingly ſerve the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> with farr greater affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then they do the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf.

To avoid tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therefore, I ſhall conclude th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s point, ſaying, that this haply is the cauſe why the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are wont to call their way of Religion, <hi>A Grand-Monarchy;</hi> as if they governed all Princes and their Miniſters at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nor is it long ſince, that one of the chief among them, being to treat publickly with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lluſtrious Prince in the name of the <hi>Society,</hi> began with theſe words full of arrogance, and grounded upon a conceit of their Monarchy; <hi>Our Society hath alwayes maintained good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with your Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, thoſe Fathers make a great ſtir to let the world know, that all thoſe that are any way in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Prince, were ſometimes Creatures of theirs, and are oblig'd for their advancement to them. Hence it muſt follow, that they have a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſubjects affections then the Prince himſelf, upon whom this muſt needs bring great inconvenieni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. For it is in the firſt place an <hi>affront</hi> to the <hi>publick</hi> Intereſt, that a ſort of <hi>Religious</hi> Perſons, that pretend to have abjur'd all commerce with the things of this world, yet ſo ambitious and politick, ſhould have ſuch an influence over Miniſters of State, that when ever it pleaſes them, they can cauſe Treaſons and inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, it is dangerous, ſince that by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Miniſters their Adherents, they induce into the <hi>Princes</hi> ſervice for <hi>Counſellors</hi> or <hi>Secretaries</hi> ſome of the Jeſuits in <hi>Vote,</hi> of whom mention is made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35086:153"/>
before, and theſe again perſwade the Prince to take ſome <hi>Jeſuit</hi> for his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> or Chaplaine. Thus do they all combine together to ſerve as Intelligencers to the Father <hi>General</hi> to whom they give an exact account of all the <hi>tranſactions</hi> of the moſt <hi>ſecret</hi> Councells. Whence it comes, that many times we ſee deſignes prevented, and ſecrets of the greateſt importance di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered; and yet things are carried ſo cunningly, that no man can faſten on the true Author, but it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens, that the greateſt ſuſpition lies on thoſe that are moſt innocent.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tis a common obſervation, that Subjects are naturally much given to imitate and comply with the inclinations of their Prince. In like manner thoſe, who give obedience to their Father <hi>Generall,</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that his thoughts are wholly taken up with matters of State, as indeavouring by that means to improve and enrich their Society, do alſo apply themſelves that way; and thereupon making uſe of their Relations and friends, would penetrate into the very hearts of Princes, ſo to diſcover their moſt ſecret deſigns, only to betray them to the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Father <hi>Generall;</hi> out of a confidence, by that means, to get into their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and be advanc'd into ſome employment, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could never have expected. For among them, none are ever preferr'd to any Office of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and truſt, but only thoſe whom they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd moſi inclined to advance their Society to that height of Greatneſſe whereto they aſpire, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently none but ſuch as are known to be able and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the management of State-affairs.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, as from divers <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> by the means of an Alembick, a man may extract ſuch an oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ſhall have the Vertue to heal a mortall wound; and as from ſeveral <hi>bloſſomes</hi> Bees draw that which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becomes honey: ſo theſe <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> from the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account which they have of all Princes affaires, and of all the emergencies of every State, do by the power
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35086:153"/>
of their diſcourſe, extract from them what makes for their own advantage, which is in ſome meaſure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for their inſatiable avarice and ambition. And they are excellent Maſters in a certain Art, unknown to others, whereby they effect their deſignes equally from other mens either good or ill; but more often from their misfortunes then happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it unuſuall with them to enſnare the unwary Prince into whoſe ſecrets they have dived, propoſing to him, that they have in their hands the onely excellent means to make him maſter of his deſires. But when by theſe pretences they have made their advantages of him, if it do but come into their imagination that the ſpreading greatneſſe of that Prince may one day prove prejudiciall to them, they do, as Lawyers in their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, prolong the ſucceſſe of the buſineſſe what lyes in their power; till at laſt with ſtrange juggling, and an imperceptible kind of Legerdemaine they utterly ruine thoſe deſignes to which they had given birth.</p>
                  <p>The Ligue of France treated and concluded by them, they not long after baſely renounc'd all medling with, when they ſaw things proſper on the Kings ſide: and <hi>England,</hi> ſo often promiſed by them to the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, yet in ſuch manner performed, ſo confirms the preſent diſcourſe, that there needs no further proof.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, from what hath been already alledged, it neceſſarily follows, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have no ſincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards any Prince whatſoever, either tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or ſpirituall, but onely comply with them ſo farre as ſtands with their own convenience and advantage.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it may be yet further inferr'd, that no Prince, much leſſe any Prelates of an inferiour degree can make any effectuall uſe of them, becauſe they ſeem, at the ſame time to be equally affected to all, complying with the <hi>French</hi> as if they were <hi>French,</hi> with the <hi>Spanyards</hi> as if they were <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and ſo with all others, as the occaſion requires; from all which the onely rule of their <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is, to <hi>exact</hi> their own profit and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35086:154"/>
They never regard the prejudice of one more then another, and thence it comes that thoſe enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein they have intermedled, have ſeldome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well, becauſe they are no further embarqu'd therein then their own intereſt adviſes them. And as to this particular, the artifices they uſe are notorious; ſome of them pretending great inclinations for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of <hi>France,</hi> others of <hi>Spain,</hi> others of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and others of ſome other Princes of whom they deſire to be favoured.</p>

                     </gap>ſing proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their greatneſſe, would occaſion a world of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and trouble. Now, ſince there is nothing more ſubject to change then matters of State, it would be the aime of theſe Fathers, with all their power and policy, to alter the courſe of affaires, that they might at length introduce the forme and project of their own Government, and by that means abſolutely <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchize</hi> themſelves. It hath been long in their heads to cajoll into the <hi>Society</hi> the ſonne of ſome Soveraigne Prince, who ſhould be drawn in to make an abſolute reſignation of his eſtate and Dominions to them. And this they had long ſince effected, if ſome others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtrict notice of their deſigne, had not prevented them. But had they once made that ſtep, no doubt, but the next would have been to become Patrones of the State <hi>Eccleſiasticall;</hi> and being a ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very ſubtle and much inclined to plots, they would afterwards have found thouſands of wayes how to enlarge it. Thus would they not have omitted any thing to put their projects in execution; and if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe would have done it, the very jealo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>From all that hath been ſaid, it ſeems to follow as a thing moſt neceſſary, that for the preſervation of the publick peace, the tranquillity of all States, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Church, and the generall good of the

                  <p>And if ever I am commanded to write my opinion concerning an opportune remedy for the reformation of theſe Fathers, without any prejudice or diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, nay to their very great advantage (as wiſhing them rather Monarchs of Souls, which are the riches of Chriſt, then of the World or the enjoyments thereof, that are nothing but vileneſſe and dung) I ſhall be ready to do it with <hi>charity,</hi> and according to the beſt ofmy skill, as it ſhall pleaſe God to enable me.</p>

                  <head>A SHORT VIEW OF the Life of Saint HILDEGARD, Taken out of the XII. Century of the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of <hi>Magdenburg;</hi> cap. 10. pag. 1700. &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>SAint HILDEGARD was a Native of <hi>Spanheim,</hi> born of noble Parents, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named <hi>Hildebert,</hi> her Mother <hi>Matilda.</hi> Being arrived to the eighth yeare of her age, ſhe was ſent to <hi>Jutta,</hi> to the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Diſibod,</hi> to be inſtructed. Growing famous in that place for the Viſions and Revelations which ſhe frequently had, even from her infancy, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Emperours and Biſhops, and among others, the Patriarch of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> made their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to her, deſiring by their Letters to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in her prayers. But what was more obviouſly remarkable, was the ſtrange conflux of the more ſuperſtitious multitude to her, nay ſo far, as that many Ladies of noble extraction came, and both put on the fame habit, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves to the ſame courſe of life which
<pb facs="tcp:35086:161"/>
ſhe had engaged her ſelf in. Now the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid being too narrow for the entertainment of ſo great a number, ſhe was, by a certain reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven, commanded to remove thence to another, called the Mount of <hi>S. Rupert,</hi> not far from a Town now called <hi>Binghen,</hi> where the River <hi>Naba</hi> falls into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and to take thoſe of her Sodality or Inſtitution along with her. Whereupon chooſing out eighteen Virgins, ſhe left the Monaſtery of <hi>S. Iſibod,</hi> where ſhe had hitherto lived, to the great grief of the Monkes of that place, and planted her ſelf with the female attendance aforeſaid in another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery built upon the ſaid Mount by ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall aſſiſtance, where they lived after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Religious life, <hi>Hildegard</hi> being conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Abbeſſe thereof. She is alſo ſaid to have written many Books, whereof we are furniſhed with a Catalogue by <hi>Trithemius</hi> and others, as followeth.</p>

                  <p>She had no acquaintance at all with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue, as ſhe acknowledges her ſelf in the Book before mentioned, called the <hi>Sciviae,</hi> where ſhe expreſſes her ſelf to this effect. <q>Being come to the two and fortieth yeare of my age, and the ſeventh moneth of the ſaid yeare, a fiery light, of extraordinary bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, coming from the open heaven, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſelf all about my Braine, and all
<pb facs="tcp:35086:162"/>
about my heart, and all about my Breaſt, as a flame, yet not ſuch as burns, but ſuch as warmes, raiſing in me ſuch a warmth, as the Sun does in thoſe things whereon it ſheds its rayes. And immediately I was illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the underſtanding and expoſition of books, as for instance of the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> the <hi>Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels,</hi> and other Catholick Volumes as well of the <hi>Old</hi> as <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> yet not ſo as that I was any thing skilled in the interpretation of the words of the Text, or the diviſion of the Syllables, or underſtood ought of caſes or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</q> As may be found in her life, Lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But her manner was to make uſe of a Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a faithfull perſon, whoſe buſineſſe it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well skilled in the rules of Grammar, to do all things with obſervance of caſes, tenſes, and genders, yet with this caution, that, neither as to the ſence or underſtanding of what was written, he ſhould not detract from any thing, or adde ought. She is reported to have written to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and to have given him an account of what had been communicated to her in a Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion; as if a Voyce had ſaid to her, <q>What thou learneſt from above, thou ſhalt not according to the ordinary cuſtome pronounce in the Latine Tongue, for that priviledge is not given to thee; let him that is ſo qualifyed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for the apprehenſions of men.</q> In her life, lib. <hi>2.</hi>

And to <hi>Wibert,</hi> a Monk of the Monaſtery at <hi>Gemblours,</hi> ſhe thus writes of her Viſions. <q>God, ſaith ſhe, works all things in order to the manifeſtation of his glorious name, and not that man, born of the earth, ſhould be thereby exalted. For my part, I am alwayes in feare and trembling, becauſe I have not any ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty what I am able to do. But I lift up my hands to God, for that it is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor indeed dare I be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident of even the things which I ſee, while I am encompaſſed with a body, and the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attendant thereon, and reach not <hi>the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the</hi> Soul; for as to theſe two, <hi>there is a deficiency in</hi> man. Though the Viſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me in my infancy, even while my bones, my nerves, and my veines were not yet well knit together, yet do I ſee it in my ſoul at this very preſent, now that I am above ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age; and it is the pleaſure of God ſo to diſpoſe of me, as that my ſoul aſcends up into the height of the Firmanent, and is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through divers places, and takes notice of ſeverall Nations, though they are at a great diſtance from me. And whereas, it is after ſuch a manner that I ſee theſe things in my ſoul, it is alſo accordingly after certain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of clouds and other creatures that I
<pb facs="tcp:35086:163"/>
behold them. It is not therefore with my outward eyes that I ſee theſe things, nor with my outward ears that I hear them, nor is it with the thoughts of my heart, or any aſſiſtance of my five ſenſes that I apprehend them: but all is tranſacted in my ſoule, my outward eyes being open, ſo as that I never ſuffered any defect of exſtacy in them, but I conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee theſe things waking night and day.</q> See her Life, <hi>lib. 1. cap. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She is very Satyricall in inveighing againſt the vices and miſcarriages of the Clergy of her time. Whereupon it is that ſhe in a certain place ſaith: <q>But now is it come to paſſe, that the greateſt contemners of the Law are theſe who by their functions ought to be moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof, they neglect both the doing and teaching of that which is good. The Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Maſters, and the Prelates, juſtice being ſlighted and ſcorned, mind nothing but their own eaſe.</q> In a certain viſion ſhe had the Church appeared to her in the forme of a Woman making ſad complaints, that her face was all beſpattered with dirt by the Prieſts themſelves, and her garments rent in pieces, &amp;c. that they neither in their doctrine nor in their example were guides to the people; but rather did the contrary: that they forced away the innocent Lamb from them. She ſaid moreover, that all Eccleſiaſticall Inſtitutions grew worſe and worſe,
<pb facs="tcp:35086:163"/>
and that the Prieſts did not teach, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy the Law of God. And that for thoſe horrid wickedneſſes and impieties, ſhe threatens and foretells the heavy wrath and judgements of God that were like to fall upon them. See <hi>Catalogus teſtium Veritatis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She alſo foretells a restauration of Religion, and that it ſhall be to the great encouragement of the Godly. Then, ſaith ſhe, ſhall the ſacred badges of Apoſtolicall Honour be divided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Region ſhall be ſubject to the Apoſtolick See; but rather it ſhall come into contempt, through the dignity of that name, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall make other men and Arch-biſhops over them; inſomuch, that the Apoſtolick See ſhall at that time be brought ſo low in point of Soverain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that there will be onely <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome few places adjacent ſhall acknowledge its ſpirituall juriſdiction. Now theſe things ſhall come to paſſe, partly through warres and invaſions, and partly alſo through the common conſultations and conſent of both Eccleſiaſticall and ſecular Powers. Then ſhall Juſtice reaſſume its place and majeſty again, ſo that in thoſe dayes, men ſhall be made acquainted with the ancient cuſtomes and manner of living of thoſe that went before them, and ſhall accordingly obſerve them, and behave themſelves ſuitably thereto, as the Ancients did. <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
