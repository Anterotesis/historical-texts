            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all Whom it may concerne, with my kinde remembrance to the Posts, Carriers, Waggoners and Higglers.</head>
            <p>IF any man or woman whomsoever hath either oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion or patience to Read this following descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is no doubt but they shall find full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for as much as they laidout for the booke, if not, it is against my will, and my good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are lost and frustrate. I wrote it for three Causes, first for a generall and necessary good use for the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, secondly to expresse my gratefull duty to all those who have honestly paid me my mony which they owed me for my Bookes of the collection of Tavernes, in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and tenne shires or Counties next round about <hi>London,</hi> and I doe also thanke all such as doe purpose to pay me heereafter: thirdly, (for the third sort) that can pay me and will not; I write this as a document: I am well pleased to leave them to the hangmans tuition (as being past any other mans mending) for I would have them to know, that I am sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the too much losse that I doe suffer by their pride or cousenage, their number being so many, and my charge so great, which I paid for paper and printing of those bookes, that the base dealing of those sharks is Insupportable; But the tedious T oyle that I had in this Collection, and the harsh and unsavoury answers that I was faine to take patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from Hostlers, Carriers, and Porters, may move any man that thinks himselfe mortall to pitty me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18785:3"/>In some places I was suspected for a proiector, or one that had devised some tricke to bring the Carriers under some new taxation; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I was held to have been a man taker, a Serieant or baylife to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest or attach mens good or beasts; indeed I was scarce taken for an honest man amongst the most of them: all which suppositions I was inforced oftentimes to wash away, with two or three Iugges of Beere, at most of the Innes I came to; In some Innes or Hosteries, I could get no certaine Intelligence, so that I did take Instructions at the next Inne unto it, which I did oftentimes take upon trust though I doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it was indirect and imperfect,</p>
            <p>Had the Carriers hostlers and others knowne my harmelesse and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest intendments, I doe thinke this following relation, had beene more large and usefull, but if there be any thing left out in this first Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it shall be with diligence inserted hereafter, when the Carriers and I shall bee more familiarly acquainted, and they, with the hostlers, shall be pleased in their ingenerosity, to afford me more Ample directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the meane space, I hope I shall give none of my Readers cause to curse the Carrier that brought me to towne.</p>
            <p>Some may object that the Carriers doe often change and shift from one Inne or lodging to another, whereby this following direction may be heereafter untrue, to them I answer, that I am not bound to binde them, or to stay them in any place, but if they doe remove, they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for at the place which they have left or for saken, and it is an easie matter to finde them by the learned intelligence of some other Carrier, an hostler, or an understanding Porter.</p>
            <p>Others may obiect and say that I have not named all the townes and places that Carriers doe goe unto in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales:</hi> To whom I yeeld, but yet I answer, that if a Carrier of <hi>Yorke</hi> hath a letter or goods to deliver at any towne in his way thither, he serves the turne well enough, and there are carriers and messengers from <hi>Yorke</hi> to carry such goods and letters as are to be past any waies north, broad and wide as farre or further than <hi>Barwicke:</hi> so he that sends to <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> may from thence have what he sends conveyd to <hi>Kendall,</hi> or <hi>Cockermouth,</hi> and what a man sends to <hi>Hereford</hi> may from thence be passed to <hi>Saint Davids</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> the <hi>Worster</hi> carriers can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb facs="tcp:18785:3"/>
any thing as farre as <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> and those that goe to <hi>Chester</hi> may send to <hi>Carnarvan:</hi> the carriers or posts that goe to <hi>Exeter</hi> may send daily to Plimouth, or to the Mount in <hi>Cornewall, Maxfield, Chipnam, Hungerford, Newberry:</hi> and all those Townes betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bristow,</hi> the <hi>Bristow</hi> carriers doe carry letters unto them, so likewise all the townes and places are served, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Lincolne,</hi> or <hi>Boston, Yarmouth, Oxford, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Walsingham, Dover, Rye</hi> or any places of the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with safe and true carriage of goods and letters; as by this little bookes directions may be perceived. Besides, if a man at Constantinople or some other remote part or Region shall chance to send a letter to his parents, master, or friends that dwell at <hi>Nottingham, Derby, Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Exeter,</hi> or any other towne in <hi>England;</hi> then this booke will give instructions where the Carriers doe lodge that may convey the said letter, which could not easily be done without it: for there are not many that by hart or memory can tell suddenly where and when every carrier is to be found, I have (for the ease of the Reader &amp; the speedier finding out of every townes name, to which any one would send, or from whence they would receive, set them downe by way of Alphabet; and thus Reader if thou beest pleased, I am satisfied, if thou beest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, I am paid, if thou beest angry, I care not for it.</p>
