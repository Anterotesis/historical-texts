         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is common with many Poets to Varnish o're the defects of their
Poems either by a little a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or by the Nobility of the Patron; but for an under-graduate, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
Sanctuary to receive and protect his first fruits, shou'd be the Elder
Choire of Poets, for there the Subiect may more aptly improve his
Thoughts, and there (if any Genius glimmers through the Clowds) the
Gold is entertain'd, and the dross either refin'd or forgot. I speak not
this to excuse the many errors of this indigested, trifle (for indeed such
confusion and uncertainty attended it, both at it's conception, and birth,
that they became unavoidable,) but to render my boldness more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
at least more pardonable, in committing all together to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage.
But yet to intitle you to Poetry, were too mean an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
who have engrost all that can be call'd <hi>A description of Nature.</hi>
Poets at best but give a distant View of her to our purblinde imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her bare-face to our senses, the most proper and Adaequate Judges
of it. Here we see Art tryumphing over her, and waiting <hi>Cupids</hi> pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their mothers Charms into your Pencill; here we may behold
more Divinity in one draught, then in that Peice for which <hi>Apelles</hi>

the Court with so many Stars, which shall shine thro' your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
when time has faded, and the Grave immured their own. For
Painting being at such a noble height as you Sir have rais'd it to, carries
more prevailing influence, than all the languid efforts of our enervate
Pens. But it were as vain to attempt a particular <hi>Encomium</hi> of what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not, as to deny it's excellency, which the greatest Stupidity
must confess with silence, and the greatest malice with a forc'd admiration.</p>
            <p>Pardon me Sir, If in dwelling upon so pleasing a Subject, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that I am arguing for what is beyond the Verge of dispute, and kept
you long in the Portall, that I have reason to fear you may be tir'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you Survey the whole building; but if it affords you any diversion,
I shall not complain of any reception it has already, or may meet with

and what other casualties have obstructed it's wellcome, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
made up by Mr. <hi>Montfort, Quem semper honoratum, &amp;c.</hi> 'Twou'd
be Tautology to mention his extraordinary favours, which are already
sufficiently known, and need not my suffrage: but he that will sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

kindness, and generous pitty in every step. Nor shou'd I be backward
in acknowledging (I dare not call it the impartiall) favours of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
Audience. What can express a solid judgment, and sincere good
nature, more then to wink at faults, and applaud the least glimmering
of Wit. I have only one thing now to desire, which is, that upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, they who have seen the more publick representation, will not
wonder to find the Plot more thick, and severall Scenes which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
omitted in the Action, to modell it into the ordinary bulk of a
Play. And here's a fresh occasion for my gratitude to Mr. <hi>Montfort,</hi> who
in the fith Act has not only corrected the tediousness by cutting out a
whole Scene, but to make the Plot more clear, has put in one of his
own, which heightens his own Character, and was very pleasing to
the Audience. But in mentioning the brevity of the Play, I shall slip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
prolixity in the preface, and therefore leave the former to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

what a crowd of Cringers press there every day, gaping like so many

parts of their Patrimony in presenting, treating, and bribing this Lord

only a large sum of bare promises and shallow hopes (quite as shallow as
his Lordships little-witty quilted noddle:) therefore I'le have nothing
