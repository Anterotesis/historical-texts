            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere is one thing which I thought my ſelf obliged to give the Purchaſers of theſe Papers ſome ſatisfaction in, before they come to Read them; and that is, Why, ſince I am Imbarqued in a General Deſign of giving an Impartial Account of the Tranſactions of thoſe diſmal Revolutions, from the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Rebellion, to the Execrable Murder of this deplorable Prince, two Volumes whereof are already Extant, I ſhould anticipate that Work which cannot be compleat without this very Journal; and therefore why it ſhould come out ſingle, and in ſome ſort before the due time?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, I have much to ſay, and that which I hope may be very ſatisfactory to others, as well as it hath been to my ſelf. For, I did ſeriouſly conſider, by the ſlow Progreſs of that Heavy Work, which I wiſh had fallen upon more able Shoulders, that though I may without Vanity affirm, I have toiled in it with ſuch Aſſiduity and Zeal, as hath not been extreme propitious either to my Health or Eſtate, yet ſuch is the multiplicity of the ſwelling Matter; ſo great is the Difficulty of ſifting out Truth, notwithſtanding the little diſtance of Time; and the Materials for Compoſing thoſe Collections are to be drawn together from ſo many remote and diſtant Quarters, that it cannot be rationally expected by others, I am ſure from former tryal, it is not to be hoped by my ſelf, that a Work of that Nature and Proportion ſhould be finiſhed without the aſſiſtance of a conſiderable time, and even ſo much the more, becauſe I am obliged out of the deſire I have to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, to play the good Husband with the Oyl of both my Lamps of Life and Fortune, ſince if either of thoſe happen to be burnt out, the other will not light the Work to its Journeys End.</p>
            <p>I then further conſidered with my ſelf, how long this very Original Journal had ſlept in Obſcurity, and that there was nothing of that Nature ſo in every Circumſtance and Punctilio authentique and convincing of that Horrid Murther made Publique, I blamed thoſe who had ſo long concealed it, and conſidering how great a Wonder it was, that it had not been loſt, and <hi>quam multa cadunt inter Poculum ſuprema<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> labra</hi>; how poſſible it was ſtill to be loſt, I thought I ought not to be guilty of what I thought was blamable in others, but that it ought to be made Publique, leſt Poſterity ſhould loſe one of the moſt irrefragable Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Recorded Villany of thoſe Perſons and Principles, and for want thereof, come to call in queſtion the Truth of the Charge againſt theſe Factious Rebels and Regicides of the Diſſenting Separation. I ſaw with what unwearied Induſtry, the preſent Diſſenters, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independents, Baptiſts,</hi> and other Sects, indeavoured to palliate, extenuate, nay and even wholly deny the Guilt of that <hi>Royal Blood</hi>; I ſaw all this, and from their former Actions, and later Attempts, from
<pb facs="tcp:100519:4"/>
the ncceſſary Concluſions which follow from their Poſitions and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I could not but foreſee Dangerous Conſequences of permitting them to Seduce the Nation into an Opinion and Belief of their Innocence and Sanctity: And upon the ſtrength of theſe and many ſuch like Motives, I thought my ſelf under the moſt preſſing Obligations of Duty, of Intereſt, and of Conſcience, to do all that I was able towards the Preſervation of His Majeſties Royal Perſon, Dignity, and Government, the Safety of the moſt Glorious and Apoſtolical Church in the World, and the Eſtabliſhment of the Peace and Happineſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, of the Danger which threatned all theſe, I could not but entertain moſt terrible apprehenſions, if theſe their avowed and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies were quietly permitted to go on proſelyting the People to their Party, for want of a Faithful Diſcovery and Free Expoſure of their Horrible Wickedneſs, Hypocriſies, Treaſons, Rebellions, and Execrable Practices and Doctrines, which are Deſtructive and Ruinous of all Government, Religion, and even Humane Society. And this being to be proved by their own Writings, and under their own Hands, I thought I was not to neglect the Opportunity of doing this Service to the Publique, eſpecially conſidering that we have their own Words to confirm us in the juſt Apprehenſions we have of them, which aſſure us that our Fears and our Danger from them are very juſt and too well grounded, both upon their Confeſſion and our own Experience.</p>
            <p>Now many things herein recited would not ſo well have fallen in with the Hiſtorical Account of thoſe Times, and to give but even an Abſtract or a bare Catalogue of all the Seditious, Treaſonable, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sermons and Vile Pamphlets of that Age would fill ſome Volumes; and therefore I thought I might with greater decency to the Deſign of thoſe Collections, not only ſpare them there, but with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage alſo to the preſent Juncture of our Affairs, and the Circumſtances of the Nation, give a ſhort Account of them in the Introduction to the Tryal and Murder of the King, to which they were in reality the bloody Preface, and in a Book of a ſmaller Price, which therefore in probability would fall into more hands.</p>
            <p>This I hope will be ſufficient to preſerve me in the good Opinion of the Loyal and Ingenuous, who will not think it an Injury to indeavour by this Precaution to ſerve them though a little too forwardly for the Regular Courſe of the following Collections; and for any perſons of a different Character, ſince I am aſſured that this Diſcourſe whenever it ſhould come, would not be very agreeable to them, I am not ſo fooliſh as to be ſollicitous for the diſpleaſure of thoſe, whom I ſhould be much more fooliſh, if I ſhould ever hope to pleaſe.</p>

            <p>THERE have been few Ages or Regions of the World, which have not produced Monſters of Ingratitude and Cruelty, Treachery and Hypocriſie, the blackeſt and baſeſt of all Crimes; Popularity and Ambition have blown from every point of the Compaſs, and have raiſed ſuch Tempeſts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>But certainly, no Age, no Time, no Country, is able to afford us a <hi>Parallel</hi> to that horrible <hi>Tragedy</hi> which was ſo lately Acted upon our own <hi>Theatre:</hi> Never was there a more horrid, premeditated Conſpiracy, whoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were laid ſo deep, ſo ſecret, and with ſo much devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Art: Never was any <hi>Treaſon,</hi> after it once came to look abroad, and was fledg'd into the Cockatrice of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> more furious and impetuous: Never any <hi>Rebellion</hi> more

            <p>Nor was it the leaſt degree either of the Artifice or Villany of thoſe Execrable Conſpirators, that, like the <hi>Devil,</hi> they came clothed in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Mantle, and covered their Rebellion with the Popular Varniſh of Religion, which they did with that ſucceſs, that not <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf, that prodigious <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> ever ſeduced the wild <hi>Arabians,</hi> with his Pidgeon and pretended Inſpirations, to thoſe degrees, that theſe Sanctimonious Rebels did the credulous <hi>Herd</hi> (for they deſerve no better name) of their Partiſans and Followers: Nor was it a few Wild and Crazy <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> only, that made theſe pretenſions, and that wicked uſe of them, to ſuch extraordinary Commerces with <hi>Heaven,</hi> even when they were out-doing <hi>Hell</hi> in Miſchief, but the whole Lump and Maſs of the Faction, <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> the Aſſembly of their <hi>Divines,</hi> the Leading men of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the following Crow'd great and ſmall, of what Sects or denominations ſoever, however mortally diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other things, all of them according to their degrees, more or leſs, unanimouſly laid a claim to Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an immediate Familiarity with <hi>God Almighty</hi>: Nothing was more frequent in their Mouths, than <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> and they were ſure to find him in their <hi>Extempore Effuſions,</hi> which they arrogantly boaſted were the dictates of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and which, to depreſs the Eſtabliſhed <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> and ſtated Forms, was, by way of Eminence and Excellency, by them termed <hi>praying by the Spirit.</hi> The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, which, for reaſons beſt known to the Supreme Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, followed their Rebellious Arms, they boldly called <hi>the Return of thoſe Prayers,</hi> and by an impious inſolence, peculiar to them, they Intituled <hi>God</hi> to the moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wickedneſs, indeavouring to conſecrate <hi>Murder, Treaſon,

Sacrilege, Perjury</hi> and all their moſt horrible Impieties, by aſcribing them to the immediate direction, and almoſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cooperation of Divine Providence: And with this <hi>Deviliſh Hypocriſie,</hi> they ſo dazled the infatuated Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and leſs diſcerning minds of the People, that what they ſo arrogantly boaſted, came to be almoſt as eaſily, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed, <hi>That that Cauſe muſt needs be Gods, which was carried on by a praying People; and being ſucceſsful muſt needs be bleſſed</hi>; and that, as they fought for <hi>God,</hi> which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to proclaim, ſo he reciprocally ingaged in their Party, and fought for them. Thus the Famous <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Independents,</hi> could, with the utmoſt Effrontery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue the People at this rate, <hi>Where is the God of</hi> Marſton-Moor? <hi>and the God of</hi> Naſeby? <hi>is an acceptable Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in a Gloomy day.

            <p>But the Vizard by continual uſe was at laſt worn ſo thin, that the ugly and real <hi>Devil</hi> began to appear through the painted <hi>Angel</hi> of Light; and thoſe Reforming Saints, began to tread ſo heavy upon the neck of the <hi>Nation,</hi> that they found they had miſtaken ſhrewdly; and that it was a <hi>Cloven-foot,</hi> with which theſe high pretenders to the <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-tongues,</hi> trampled upon, and broke in pieces, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, Ancient Laws, Liberties, Properties, and even Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf, and that the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which before was ſaid to be <hi>God</hi>'s, was in reality at laſt nothing but their <hi>Own</hi>; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Foot-ſtool, by which they mounted themſelves to the <hi>Throne</hi> of Soveraign, boundleſs, and unaccountable <hi>Power.</hi> For the <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> the true ſupporter of the Peoples Liberties and Laws, being gone, and the Royal Party and Power broken, I find <note n="*" place="margin">Tomaſin<hi>'s</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Anno <hi>1647.</hi>

            <p>But the <hi>Faction</hi> wholly threw off the uſeleſs Mask them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when having entirely ſubdued the ſcattering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Loyal Party, the <hi>Army</hi> by their intereſt in the <hi>Commons-houſe,</hi> moſt of the Principal Officers having been obtruded upon the Nation, as their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> there, and none daring to oppoſe them, began not only to uſurp the Soveraign Power, but to ſubvert the very Foundations of the Ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and by the Deſtruction not only of the <hi>King,</hi> but of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> it ſelf, to erect a new <hi>Democratique Tyranny</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>The Common-wealth of England</hi>: In which the People, though nothing leſs was intended them, were in themſelves Originally, and by deputation in their <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> pretended to be the <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> of this Nation; but in reality theſe <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> who became ſuch by the prevailing Authority of the Sword, and not by free Elections, being juſt ſo many boundleſs and unlimited <hi>Tyrants,</hi> whoſe Will was a Law, and to whoſe imperious pleaſure all the reſt of the <hi>Nation</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſubmit, and take from their hands the moſt Arbitrary Yoke of Vaſſallage and <hi>Slavery</hi>; every thing lay at the diſcretion of their Mercy, the Laws, the Lives, the Liberties, the Eſtates of all, without diſtinction or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination, the <hi>Peer</hi> and the <hi>Peaſant</hi> were wholly and entirely ſubjugated to their uncontrolable <hi>Juriſdiction</hi>; and as to <hi>Religion,</hi> their firſt and great Pretence, that was left to ſhift for it ſelf, all men being left at Liberty to chuſe any or none; and it was all one now to theſe glorious <hi>Reformers,</hi> whether a man were an <hi>Infidel,</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> provided he had the wit to ſay it was his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and make Profeſſion to live peaceably, and acquieſce under

to introduce them, to fill the heads of the People with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fears, and raging Jealouſies, and at the ſame time both to alienate the Affections of his People from their King, and by Diſobedience to his Eccleſiaſtical Laws, to teach them a Contempt even of his Secular Power, and to put them even into the neareſt approaches to Sedition, and to ſeem to want nothing but a favourable occaſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate them into a new Rebellion; all this conſidered, one cannot but be tempted to think that this ingrateful impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, and obſtinacy, menaces theſe obdurate Sinners with ſome Uncommon and Remarkable Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all their other Arts, ſo dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the preſent Conſtitution of our Government, I cannot think it either the ſmalleſt or leaſt dangerous, which the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> from the Monarchick Government as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have made uſe of; for though nothing of Fact can be more notoriouſly true, than that they actually either Murther'd the late <hi>King,</hi> or were Aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Abetting, and Aſſiſting to ſuch as did, yet to preſerve ſome Reputation to their <hi>Party,</hi> and that they may be able to increaſe it, by ſuch as they can by their pretenſions to Purity and Sanctity delude, they conſtantly endeavour to ſhift all the Guilt of this Execrable <hi>Regicide</hi> from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and charge it upon others; the Fact, they are well aware, is ſo ugly and wicked in its own Nature, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo many aggravating Circumſtances, that there are few Natures, who would not at firſt ſight ſtart at it, as at the Apparition of ſome terrible <hi>Daemon</hi>; this therefore muſt be totally denied, where it may with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or palliated by making the <hi>King</hi> Guilty of the War, and of his own Murder, the Effect of it; full well do theſe <hi>Deceivers</hi> know, that if the poor infatuated People were really perſwaded and convinced, that the Leaders of their Party, and the precious Men their <hi>Teachers,</hi> had been Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch a deteſtable Murder, even the Dictates of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, Reaſon, and Natural Religion would inſtruct them, That ſuch Guilty <hi>Miſcreants,</hi> whoſe Hands bluſhed with Innocent Blood, muſt needs be unfit to lift up to Heaven, the juſt Avenger of it; and that ſuch Men muſt needs be very unfit and unproper Guides and Conductors
<pb n="IX" facs="tcp:100519:9"/>
of others to <hi>Heaven,</hi> who had travelled ſo far in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the High Road to <hi>Hell,</hi> without ever looking, or making one ſtep backwards by Repentance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> therefore in this particular have ever ſtood high upon their Juſtification, as being therefore Innocent of the Guilt of this <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> becauſe then when the Fatal Stroke was given, they were luckily diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Helm of State, by the prevailing Faction and Intereſt of the <hi>Independents:</hi> The <hi>Independents,</hi> when they are charged with this barbarous <hi>Fact,</hi> they endeavour to transfer all the blame from themſelves and Party, by throwing it upon a <hi>Junto</hi> of ill men, who then Governed, and had gotten all the Power; and though thoſe very bloody and infamous <hi>Traitors, Cromwel, Ireton, Peters, Nye, &amp;c.</hi> were, while living, eſteemed by them moſt <hi>Heroick</hi> and renowned Saints, and would have Pillars and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments erected to their immortal Memories, had they Power equal to their Kindneſs to thoſe Glorious Villains, who are ſtill the Idols of their Hearts; yet they would make this paſs for excuſe ſufficient for the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Perſwaſion, that they were not every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man of them actually upon the <hi>Trial</hi> and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>King,</hi> or ſet their Hands and Seals to the Warrant for his Execution: So that conſenting to, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and applauding the <hi>Fact</hi> when done, muſt paſs for Innocence, that ſo they may plead Not Guilty, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, the Survivers of thoſe differing Factions, and their Succeſſors in the ſame <hi>Principles,</hi> were never heard or known to manifeſt ſo much, as, in the cheap way of words, their unfeigned deteſtation, and abhorrence of that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which brought the King to that deplorable Death; and I think, without breach of Charity, I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce their Famous <hi>Baxter,</hi> who is the whole Schiſme in <hi>Epitome,</hi> neither <hi>Presbyterian, Independent, &amp;c.</hi> but both, and all of them, ſpeaking the true ſenſe of the whole body of the <hi>Separation</hi>; and I am confident, if they had all one Mouth, and he were the Tongue (the Office he would chuſe) he would ſpeak for them in his Language of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Common-wealth; <hi>I cannot ſee that I was miſtaken in the main</hi> Cauſe, <hi>nor dare I repent of it, nor forbear the ſame, if
<pb n="X" facs="tcp:100519:10"/>
it were to do again in the ſame ſtate of things.</hi> (Baxters <hi>Holy Common-wealth, pag.</hi> 486.)</p>
            <p>And therefore, if this Argument happens to be ſtarted, though the late <hi>Statute,</hi> which makes ſome ſorts of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage Treaſonable, render them more cautious and reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they will plead for themſelves, that Matters were carried to thoſe Extremities, much beyond the intention of thoſe who firſt took up Arms againſt the <hi>evil Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,</hi> and had no ill Deſign either againſt the Perſon of the <hi>King,</hi> or his juſt Power and <hi>Prerogative</hi>; but they will dye before they will acknowledge, that the <hi>War</hi> on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſide, let the pretended Reaſons be what they will, was unjuſt and unlawful, and that the taking up Arms by Subjects againſt their King, is not only unlawful but damnable: Now the maintaining of this <hi>Opinion</hi> of the Lawfulneſs of the War, was that which in reality cut off the <hi>Kings</hi> Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And will be the <hi>Eternal</hi> Parent of future <hi>Rebellions,</hi> ſo long as it is propagated and received. For if <hi>Subjects</hi> may upon any colourable pretenſions, which can never be wanting ſo long as Men are Wicked enough to invent them, be allowed to take up Arms againſt their <hi>King</hi>; it is morally impoſſible but things muſt proceed to the utmoſt Extremities; for he that draws his Sword againſt his <hi>King,</hi> muſt throw away the Scabbard; and it is a Crime of ſo high a Nature, that tho' there ſhould be found a <hi>King</hi> of ſo <hi>God-like</hi> a Temper, as really to pardon the greateſt <hi>Rebels,</hi> yet the Conſciouſneſs of their own Guilt, and the perpetual apprehenſions of deſerved Puniſhment, will never permit ſuch <hi>Rebels</hi> to believe his intentions real and ſincere, and therefore the uneaſineſs of their fears, naturally conducts them to cure their Fears, and conſult their future Safety, by removing the Cauſe of their diſtruſt and danger.</p>
            <p>But however theſe two Factions, and the Spawn of them, may endeavour to palliate this horrid Guilt, and, that they may be the better enabled to maintain their Party and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, may endeavour to acquit themſelves by crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating one another, nothing is more evident, than that both theſe Factions of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> and the other leſſer Sects and Schiſmaticks which ſprung
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:100519:10"/>
from their Roots, were actually Guilty of the <hi>Kings Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; and that not only by their fomenting and carrying on the War againſt him, whereby he was reduced to thoſe Extremities, that he was forced to throw himſelf upon the Perjured <hi>Scottiſh Presbyterians,</hi> who ſold him to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Independents,</hi> who Murdered him, but alſo by not hindring and preventing the doing of it. For it is a moſt certain Truth, <hi>Qui non prohibet, cum poteſt, jubet.</hi> For inſtance, Two Thieves bind an honeſt Man and rob him, one is for diſpatching him out of the way, that he may not ever be in a capacity to proſecute them, the other pretends, he does not ſo well approve of that laſt Extremity; while they are in the conteſt, the honeſt Mans Servant comes up, and finding his Maſter in that condition, puts himſelf in a poſture to attempt his Reſcue; now he who was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly againſt the Murder, though he could well enough di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with the Robbery, if he had meant ſincerely, ought rather to have aſſiſted the Loyal Servant in his Generous and Dutiful Deſign; and it had then been eaſie to have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſpoiled Priſoner, at leaſt from the danger of Death; but inſtead of this, he joyns with his former Companion, and aſſiſts him firſt to diſpatch the Servant, who indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his Maſters Deliverance, and then ſits him down, while his Companion ſends his Fetter'd Maſter to keep him Company. Now do I appeal to God and Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both theſe men were not involved in equal guilt, as well he, who help'd to bind, diſarm, and rob the Maſter, and oppoſed the honeſt indeavour of his Servant to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, as he who actually imbrued his Hands in their innocent Blood.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is exactly the ſame, but under this more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous aggravation, that <hi>Royal Blood</hi> is much more valuable and Sacred, than that which runs in Common veins. The Zealous <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Saints began the late Rebellion, and the <hi>Independents</hi> and other <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> being aſſociated with them in that Traiterous Combination or the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> they joyntly and unanimouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the War, and, by murdering of ſuch of his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects, as out of Duty and Conſcience came to his aſſiſtance, having ſubdued his Forces, they got his Perſon

the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which they alſo effected, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> all this while ſitting ſtill and looking on: Whereas, had they ever heartily oppoſed ſuch a deteſtable Wickedneſs, their Party was then ſo conſiderable, that, with the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Loyal Intereſt,</hi> which was not ſo dead, but that upon the leaſt hope it would have revived and joyned them, they might have given ſuch a ſhock to the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Faction, that they would difficultly, if ever, have been able to accompliſh or execute their Execrable Deſign againſt the Life of the <hi>King</hi>; but ſo far were they from this, that there was not the leaſt Attempt to oppoſe the <hi>Traytors,</hi> or prevent the <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Nay, had the Rabble of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs,</hi> which were much at the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Intereſt, had but half ſo much Zeal to hurry down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to oppoſe the Murder of the <hi>King,</hi> as they had before times to oppoſe him, and cry up <hi>Priviledge of Parliament,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Tumults,</hi> it is very diſputable, whether <hi>Cromwel,</hi> with all his black <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> would have had the Courage to ſtrike the Fatal Stroke.

            <p>Now all this is as demonſtratively true, as to the matter of former Fact, and future Conſequence, as God is true and juſt, and as that is True and Canonical <hi>Scripture,</hi> which from the Mouth of Gods infallible Spirit, aſſures us, without any Limitation or Reſervation, without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Diſpenſation, <hi>That whoſoever reſiſt the Higher Powers, reſiſt the Ordinance of God, and ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Damnation.</hi> Now, if Rebellion be reſiſting the Higher Powers, as certainly if that be not, nothing is, and if we be able to prove thoſe of the <hi>Separation,</hi> to a ſingle Man of them, Guilty of it, either in Fact or in Principles, or in Both, then are they certainly within the danger of this Terrible Sentence: Let the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. therefore ſhew us a Diſpenſation as Authentick, as this Command, to tolerate Them and their Diſciples, to raiſe Seditions, to defame their <hi>King</hi> and his Government, to cancel the Obligations of the <hi>Oaths</hi> of Allegiance and Supremacy, to contemn the Laws, to diſobey the lawful Commands of their Superiors, and at the laſt, if they have ſtrength and opportunity, to take up Arms and Rebel, and if they prevail to ſhake off the Yoke of Subjection and due Obedience, Impriſon and Murder their <hi>King,</hi> diſ-inherit his Lawful Heirs and Succeſſors, to all which, their Principles have led them, and Naturally and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally will lead them; and then indeed they may, as they preſumptuouſly do, promiſe Heaven to Themſelves, and Followers: But till they are able ſo to do, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>New Goſpel,</hi> with a Patent of Indulgence from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, to ſuperſede the Obligation of his former Commands, and to change not only the Names but the Nature of things, by turning <hi>Rebellion</hi> into <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and violating the Laws of God and Man into Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

they will remain under the unavoidable danger of the intolerable Penalty, annexed to Reſiſting the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers, and in concluſion, will moſt aſſuredly find a <hi>Hell</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Heaven,</hi> and Damnation in the place of that Happineſs, which the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Separation</hi> do as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently promiſe to their <hi>Followers,</hi> as they vainly expect from their <hi>Teachers.</hi>

            <p>Whether it have proceeded from miſtaken <hi>Charity,</hi> or, which is much worſe, from a <hi>Cowardly Timorouſneſs</hi> of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the Indignation of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of moſt ſevere Revenge, if ever they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to execute it, I cannot tell; but truly in my Opinion, the not preſſing of theſe neceſſary Truths upon the People, of the unlawfulneſs of Rebellion, upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and their danger of Damnation, in following theſe Helliſh Principles, of Popular Soveraignty, Reformation by Blood, Tumults, and the Power of the Sword, of the Lawfulneſs of Depoſing, Judging, and inflicting Capital Puniſhments upon Soveraign Princes; and the want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the neceſſary Conſequences of theſe and ſuch like Fatal Opinions, and ſhewing them the horrible Influences, they have formerly had upon the Peace and Happineſs of the <hi>Nation,</hi> it is to be feared, hath contributed too much to the increaſe of the Vulgar part of the Faction.</p>

argue a kind of Innocency in the Party: But let any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſider, that ſo great an undertaking, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this well-built Government, and the juſtifying of ſuch horrid Methods, by which it was to be begun, was never poſſibly to be effected by a few Heads or Hands; and that there being an abſolute neceſſity to ſecond the firſt <hi>Blow</hi> by a moſt conſiderable Force of Arms, and it will be impoſſible to doubt, but that the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> though they did not Communicate the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of their <hi>Treaſonous Deſign</hi> to every Individual perſon, from whom they expected aſſiſtance, yet made themſelves moſt aſſured of aſſiſtance, from a Powerful Party, which ſhould joyn with them to perfect their Execrable purpoſes.</p>
            <p>For it is impoſſible that ſo many Men, as are known to be of the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> both by their own Confeſſion, and the Teſtimony of ſo many unexceptionable Witneſſes, and Circumſtances, ſhould all of them by conſent become <hi>Ideots</hi> and Madmen, to think of accompliſhing ſuch ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Treaſons</hi> by <hi>Miracles</hi> or the Strength of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is true, a ſmall number of ſuch deſperate helliſh Villains, as were imbarqued in the moſt wicked Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, might (I am all horror to name it,) with their <hi>Blunderbuſſes</hi> have Aſſaſſinated the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Royal Brother</hi>; but it muſt be a numerous Party, who muſt have ſeconded that <hi>Curſed Blow,</hi> ſo as to inable them to overcome all the ſucceeding Difficulties and Oppoſitions, which they could not but foreſee they muſt encounter with, from the <hi>Loyal Party,</hi> who by the <hi>Shaftsbury Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> and the well known Malice of the <hi>Excluſioners,</hi> which comprehended the whole Faction of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> would quickly have diſcovered who were the <hi>Traytors,</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Brother,</hi> and would certainly moſt vigorouſly have oppoſed them, and the progreſs of their Deſigns of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from what Quarter of Heaven, or from what Subterranean Caverns muſt this aſſiſtance come? Did they expect any of <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Flaming Battalions, or an Army of Aery Combatants? or had they a promiſe of Forty Thouſand <hi>Black Bills,</hi> that would fight without hands, or a Levy of St. <hi>Jago Pilgrims,</hi> to make uſe of theſe
<pb n="XXIII" facs="tcp:100519:16"/>
               <hi>Black-Bills,</hi> to defend and ſupport their blacker Cauſe? They muſt certainly be all <hi>Lunaticks</hi> indeed and Madmen, if they relyed upon an inviſible Power. Nor is it to be doubted, but that, how much ſoever they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled God to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as their Anceſtors and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in Rebellion had done, yet, like them, they would not ſo abſolutely have repoſed their truſt in Him, but that they would wiſely have thought, the beſt of their way was to make uſe of the Arm of Fleſh, and a Sword of Steel, which they knew by experience would prove a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defence than the Shield of Faith, or their pretended Sword of the Spirit, and enable them to ſettle <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Throne</hi> (as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> uſe to cant it) by diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the <hi>King</hi> of His: But beſides the <hi>Old Army Officers,</hi> who were to command them, there muſt be an <hi>Army</hi> to be commanded; and who could theſe <hi>Levies</hi> conſiſt of, but the Factious Schiſmaticks and Diſſenters, who having liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves under <hi>Separation,</hi> the very Standard of the <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> no man in his Senſes can doubt, but, had her bloody Colours, wrought with Liberty of Conſcience, and <hi>Colledges</hi> Motto, <hi>No Popery, No Slavery,</hi> been once diſplaid in the Field, whole Troops of Zealous <hi>Volunteers</hi> would, in the Language of their Addreſſes, have offered their <hi>Lives and Fortunes,</hi> and hazarded their Souls and Bodies in her ſervice, againſt the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>King-ſhip,</hi> the uſeleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and danger of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and the <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> of <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Popery: Pentland Hills,</hi> and <hi>Bothwel Bridge</hi> give us good aſſurance of the Inclinations and Forwardneſs of theſe pretended Saints, to take up Arms and propagate the Goſpel by the wrong Sword; though if they were not infatuated, even to Perdition, the diſcovery of their <hi>Treaſons,</hi> and the baffling of their repeated attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gods Vicegerent,</hi> were ſufficient to convince them, how diſagreeable their Practices, and the Principles which lead them, are to the Divine <hi>Majeſtie</hi> and Supreme <hi>Monarch</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>But that which puts this matter out of all diſpute, is the Teſtimony of their own <hi>Conſciences. The Plot,</hi> ſaith <hi>Walcot,</hi> one of the Conſpirators, is laid broad and deep; and Collonel <hi>Sidney</hi> profeſſeth boldly, that he dies a <hi>Martyr</hi>
               <pb n="XXIV" facs="tcp:100519:17"/>
that <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> in which he had from his Youth been trained up: The Diſſenters eſteem him no leſs; Now do I appeal to themſelves, if they do not think the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> for which he Glories that he died a <hi>Martyr,</hi> a Righteous Cauſe? Nay, and Gods Righteous Cauſe too? If they do not think ſo, why do they ſo zealouſly embrace, and, ſo far as they may without danger of the Laws, encourage, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and defend it, by continuing ſo pertinaciouſly in their <hi>Separation,</hi> the very Badge and diſtinguiſhing <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of thoſe, who have devoted themſelves to it? Moſt aſſuredly, if they did not think ſo of it, they would for ever abandon it. And if they do think and believe, that it is <hi>Gods Righteous Cauſe,</hi> they will judge themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt powerful Obligations in the World, upon occaſion offered, to be aſſiſtant with their Perſons or Purſes to maintain it, and even to fight the Lords Battels againſt the Mighty: And were it poſſible to keep the Two <hi>Devils</hi> of Fear and Diſſimulation from jogging their Elbows, and pulling them by the Sleeves, to make them conceal the depth of their Hearts, I do ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelf, that they would boldly tell the World, and proclaim it by the ſound of Trumpet and beat of Drum, That they eſteem nothing they poſſeſs, not their very Lives, too precious, if they may be inſtrumental in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Glorious Reformation of the <hi>Old Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here are the Dimenſions of this late <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> the depth and breadth of the <hi>Plot,</hi> which <hi>Walcot</hi> mentions; which is not one hairs breadth narrower, or one inch ſhallower, than the united Strength, Power, and Intereſt of the whole Faction of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi>; who would once again have adventured not only Bodkins and Thimbles, Plate, Money, Horſes and Arms, but their Lives alſo, to ſet up this <hi>Golden Calf</hi> of their <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> had not God been more Gracious and Merciful to them and the whole Nation, than to ſuffer them, by Succeſs in this Wicked Enterprize, to run headlong to our <hi>Ruine,</hi> and their own <hi>Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice, That all Wiſe Men know, that the ſtrength of this deteſtable Conſpiracy was built upon no other Foundation, than the Hopes and Confidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the
<pb n="XXV" facs="tcp:100519:17"/>
Traytors had, from ſome of the Principal of them, of the Aſſiſtance, the Vigorous, Unanimous Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>; and that all Good, Honeſt, and Loyal men believe it; nay, that they who ſeem moſt to diſpute or doubt it, are conſcious to themſelves of their own good wiſhes, not only to the Principal <hi>Traytors,</hi> but even to the <hi>Treaſon</hi>; and ſince it is well known they have long ago abandoned all ſhame for ſuch Imputations, nothing but the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of their hopes and expectations, could be the Cauſe of that Univerſal damp, conſternation, amazement, and dejection which were ſo viſibly painted in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that one might know them by thoſe Marks from other men, as they walk't the Streets: And though they are ſomthing recovered out of the trance of their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and have reaſſumed ſome part of their wonted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and confidence, yet even that courage betrays their guilt, whileſt they wholly imploy it to diſcredit all belief of the truth of this <hi>Conſpiracy</hi>: And it is almoſt impoſſible, to give a more infallible Demonſtration for the certainty of any thing in this World than for this, and that they muſt of neceſſity be in ſome ſort or other Guilty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who Ridicule, Extenuate, Palliate, Applaud, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and uſe all the Arts imaginable, not only to make their Party appear Innocent, but to make the whole <hi>Plot</hi> an Artifice and a Contrivance, and to arraign the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power and the Juſtice of the Nation as Guilty, by the Condemnation and Execution of the Principal <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and Accomplices in the Treaſon: And certainly they have no thoughts of abhorrence and deteſtation of ſuch black and execrable Villanies, nor any intentions to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, who do ſo warmly hugg and cheriſh the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cauſe of this, and ſo many other Treaſons, Plots, and Conſpiracies both againſt the late <hi>King</hi> and his preſent <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> their wicked Principle of Separation, which is the Mother of all thoſe Seditions, Inſurrections, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, which to their coſt theſe Nations have ſo often felt.</p>
            <p>For when Men have once ſeparated themſelves from the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> they do at the ſame inſtant cut the Cords and Ligaments of Obedience to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="XXVI" facs="tcp:100519:18"/>
they, by uſurping Soveraign Power to diſpenſe with the Obligation of any one Law, bid open defiance to the very Eſſence of all Laws, and, without the conſent of <hi>King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> undertake to Abrogate, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and make not only void, but unlawful, and unjuſt, and intolerable ſuch <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> as were by the Common Conſent of the <hi>King</hi> and the Three Eſtates of the Realm, Enacted to retain the Subjects in their due Obedience, and cannot without ſhocking the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Government be cancelled by any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than that which at firſt gave them being: So that they are in actual Rebellion even at the firſt ſtep, though not in actual Arms, and open Hoſtility, againſt the <hi>King,</hi> the Laws, and the very Conſtitution and Life of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which conſiſts in the Power and Authority of making Laws, and exacting Obedience to them: Now this diſobedience to the Laws, and thereby diſowning the Authority which made them, naturally leads the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors to fear the Penalties of thoſe Laws which they have violated, and to dread the threatning edge of the Sword of Juſtice, the <hi>Guardian</hi> of thoſe Laws, with which the Supreme Magiſtrate is by God intruſted, to puniſh the Diſobedient, and preſerve the Peace and Tranquillity of Human Society; Now Fear is only ſo much the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother of Hatred, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was to <hi>Jacob,</hi> that ſmooth <hi>Supplanter,</hi> ever lays hold of the Heel of its hairy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when men are once advanced to hate what they fear, they do immediately proceed to wiſh, deſire, and indeavour to put themſelves out of the reach of danger, from what they both fear and hate. When theſe two Paſſions thus adopted into the Family of Religion, have once taken full poſſeſſion of Mens Minds, it is not long before they Precipitate them into the Search of all Ways and Contrivances how to ſecure themſelves; which becauſe they cannot immediately obtain, they preſently fall to accuſing the Laws of Injuſtice, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Tyranny and Perſecution,</hi> that ſo their diſobedience may find a Refuge under the ſhelter of their pretended Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for which they can have no other Foundation, but the Charging the Laws themſelves with want of Equity
<pb n="XXVII" facs="tcp:100519:18"/>
and Juſtice: Nor is the Government only to be thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed as unrighteous, and deſpiſed as unjuſt; and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its Laws renounced as unlawful, but their fear and hatred put them upon all the Out-ſide Acts of Hypocritical Piety, and diſſembled Sanctity, that by them they may win both Pity and gain a Party, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves in the Fortifications of Numbers, hoping for Impunity, at leaſt from the Multitude of Offenders, which when they have gained, they are not ſparing of their ſecret Menaces, how unſafe it may be to Exaſperate, and how Impolitique for the Government, by compelling them to Obedience, to force them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. No ſooner have they gained this Point, and that they apprehend that the Scale is turned, and that the Government, of which they before ſtood in ſo much Fear, begins now juſtly to be in fear of them, but they preſently become Inſolent in their Actions, Seditious in their words, Frequent in open Menaces, and <hi>Bold Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> to their <hi>Prince</hi> for ſuch Favours and Indulgences, as they are well aſſured, if he grants, he muſt be ruined, and if he denyes, they are reſolved to endeavour by Force to extort them from him, and the Sum of all their Deſires at the laſt centring in their being intruſted with the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> the difference at laſt comes to fall under the Fatal Deciſion and Arbitrement of the <hi>Sword.</hi> And how matters muſt be managed, when they come to that diſmal Period, and are referred to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire,</hi> I think little need to be ſaid, and it is yet too freſh in memory, to be again repeated; moſt certainly War, and eſpecially a Civil War, can never go unattended by the calamitous <hi>Legions</hi> of Miſery, Ruine, Oppreſſion, Murder, Deſolations, and all the Licentious Miſchiefs, which the Rude and Mercenary Spirits, of which the Inferior Military Men are always compoſed, can be guilty of.</p>
            <p>This is the Rare texture of the Spiders Web of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> in the <hi>Centre</hi> whereof the Devil of Rebellion ſits Enthroned, and though the out-lines of the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſeem all compoſed of Innocence, Purity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet when once men come but to touch and
<pb n="XXVIII" facs="tcp:100519:19"/>
buz about the ſmalleſt Cords of this Fatal Net, like fooliſh Flies they are intangled and caught, and the farther they proceed, and the more they ſtrive, the more are they wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and incloſed in the Snares of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus does <hi>Separation</hi> begin with miſtaken Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which by eaſie ſteps inſenſibly tranſports men to defend one Errour by a thouſand, and to commit the moſt horrid impieties and moſt dreadful ſins, to ſupport and maintain that, which they call their Religion: Thus have we ſeen the Tears of the Widows, and heard the Cries of the Orphans, robbed of their Husbands, Parents, and Eſtates, for the <hi>Glory of God</hi>: We have heard the groaning of the Priſoners, and thoſe appointed to die; we have ſeen ſo many Loyal Free-Subjects, without and againſt Law, Reaſon, and Humanity, brought to Axes, Gibbets, and Halters, and all pretended to be done for <hi>God's Righteous Cauſe and Glory</hi>: Robbing of Churches, and defacing of Temples, Crimes which Heathen <hi>Idolaters</hi> would have bluſh'd at, were all for the <hi>Glory of God too,</hi> and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Cauſe. Nay, there is ſcarce that horrible kind of Impiety, Blaſphemy, or any ſort of Wickedneſs to be named, which was not committed during the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion under this Pretence; and the moſt barbarous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Outrages, which the afflicted <hi>Royaliſts</hi> ſuffered from theſe pretended <hi>Saints,</hi> are ſo great and many, as it is impoſſible to recount them, all which were ſo far from being puniſhed by the <hi>

Well might the <hi>God</hi> of Peace and Purity ſend that diſmal Fire of <hi>London</hi> to purge thoſe <hi>Temples,</hi> whoſe Beams and Stones had been ſo tainted by the Leprous breath of Rebellious Preachers, that no whiting or ſcraping, according to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of cleanſing Leprous Houſes, was ſufficient to cleanſe them, ſo as to be fit for the offering up of the Sacrifices of
<pb n="XXIX" facs="tcp:100519:19"/>
Prayers and Praiſes to the everlaſting <hi>Prince</hi> of Peace, or to have the <hi>Holy Dove,</hi> condeſcend to dwell among men, and aſſiſt their Devotions in thoſe <hi>Holy Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that I may not ſeem falſly to accuſe them, I will give two or three Inſtances of this <hi>Bloody Divinity</hi>; though I could produce a thouſand, and they who delight to paddle among ſuch Bloody Tenents, may be ſufficiently furniſhed out of the Printed Sermons of the late Times, a conſiderable Collection of which may with little pains be ſeen in my very Excellent Friend, the <hi>Malleus Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticorum,</hi> Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> firſt and ſecond Books of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters Sayings,</hi> under the Heads of <hi>Reformation by Blood,</hi> and <hi>The War Juſtified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>But leſt the Authority of perverted <hi>Scripture</hi>-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts ſhould not be ſufficient to ſtimulate and inſtigate the Heads of the Faction to ſo much Cruelty, and ſo many indiſcriminating premeditated <hi>Murders,</hi> he proceeds to furniſh <hi>Preſidents</hi> to fortifie his bloody Doctrine; and firſt, ſaith he affirmatively, <hi>Phineas</hi> Executed Judgment on <hi>Zimri and Cozbi.</hi> Upon which Text, adds he, as Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Mellifluous Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> in his Sermon obſerves, That one man, by his Holy Zeal, may be a means to ſave a whole Kingdom; how much more then a whole <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> puniſhing Offenders in a Legal way by the Rule of Juſtice.

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> What is all this to us of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It concerns you all very much, and you alſo in the firſt place, even You, <hi>Reverend</hi> Gentlemen: Such as are Arch-Enemies to God and his moſt <hi>Righteous Cauſe,</hi> who have ſuck'd the Blood of Gods precious Ones, are now held in Priſon among us; they are only impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſome only pincht in their Purſes and ſet at Liberty, at leaſt from danger of Death: And this I ſay, nay God ſays, Juſtice is grievouſly neglected, and the juſt Wrath of God highly incenſed and exaſperated againſt us for the ſame. Now you, <hi>Reverend</hi> Gentlemen, are <hi>Sentinels</hi> and Watchmen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. and Chap. 33. Ver. 7, 8. And you are to give timely and ſerious warning to the Superior Magiſtrates, <hi>Eſa.</hi> Chap. 58. Ver. 1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up your voices like Trumpets,</hi> to Adviſe, Preach, Petition to purpoſe, our moſt Noble and Honorable <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary</hi> Worthies, to put in ſerious, zealous, and ſpeedy Execution, this God-pleaſing, Wrath-appeaſing Work of Severity, and exactly puniſhing all Grand Offenders, and Arch-Adverſaries of God and the Kingdom, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be.</p>
            <p>Then he reminds them, that Juſtice was done on the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> by the City of <hi>London</hi>'s means, who, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years ſince, with an Unanimous and Zealous conſent Aſſembled gravely and adviſedly together, and in a ſober and ſubſtantial manner by their moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition, craving and crying out for Juſtice againſt that pernicious <hi>Traytor,</hi> and Cruel Crafty Enemy of the State, the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> accordingly obtained the thing deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="XXXIV" facs="tcp:100519:22"/>And now he comes to intitle <hi>God</hi> to this <hi>Bloody Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and, as if he had adored ſome of the inhumane <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> to beſpeak <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Humane Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to honor and ſerve him with: Say, ſaith he, What Honor and Dignity hath been done to God for all the late Victories? Much by the Parliament; but whatever hath been, all is too little; and therefore ſome Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Eminent Work, tending to the High Honour of the Lord, our moſt glorious wonder-working God; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like deſtroying thoſe <hi>Achans</hi> and <hi>Agags,</hi> whether Great by Place, or Noble by Birth.</p>
            <p>But then again, his almoſt ſmothered <hi>Conſcience</hi> gets a little breath to croſs his ſanguinary <hi>Divinity</hi> with an Objection, whileſt he ſtops her Cries with an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſhuffling Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But what, ſaith he? Nothing but Blood and <hi>Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>? Make the <hi>Parliament</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> of Blood? May not Mercy be as Honourable, as thus fiercely ſhedding Blood?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I, or rather Gods Word ſaith, Who art thou that dareſt call that Act Bloody, which God himſelf calls Juſtice and Judgment, and wherein God is ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſay not all, but as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 15. Ver. 2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſuch as are for Death to Death; and ſuch as are for the Sword to the Sword, and ſuch as are for the Famine to the Famine, and ſuch as are for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the Captivity.</hi> (So that you ſee, the tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> are Cruelty, and the Merciful <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi> is not altogether for Hanging, Drawing, and Quartering; no, good Man! he is only for Sword, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Captivity, for ſome of them; and I dare ſay, had the abuſed <hi>Text</hi> had Plague, Fire, and Water in it, the Compaſſionate <hi>Creature</hi> would graciouſly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to ſpare the <hi>Malignants</hi> from Death, to have Committed them to thoſe other lingring Puniſhments: But here's no Quarter to be given, not one grain of Mercy to be found in his Heart, no Pardon to be had or hoped, and, in the Battel of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Vengeance, none are like to eſcape.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="XXXV" facs="tcp:100519:22"/>But now he comes to wind up his Bloody Bottoms, and concludes, That this Advice is given in ſingleneſs and ſincerity of heart, for that he may ſay with <hi>David, What have I done, is there not a Cauſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the very Heart, the Soul, the Conſcience of a <hi>True Proteſtant Schiſmatick,</hi> and indeed the very Spirit of <hi>Separation</hi> laid naked and open to the view of all Mankind. Here's a Window into the very Boſome of the Faction; where one may ſee Revenge and Cruelty, Malice and Murder, Hatred of Monarchy, and Contempt of Kings, and ten thouſand other Impieties lodged in every corner of his breaſt. How would theſe Cruel People now like the <hi>Lex Talionis, Adonibezek</hi>'s Law, not only to have their Toes and Thumbs cut off, but, according to their own Divinity, ſince they are moſt manifeſtly Guilty of what they falſly accuſe the Loyal Party, to be Condemned to all the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, which they have ſo uncompaſſionately allotted to others: But they are out of that danger, our Religion teaches us a far different <hi>Temper,</hi> and would they give the Government any tolerable aſſurance, that it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to be peaceable, and forbear pulling the Penalties of the Laws, made for its ſecurity, upon their own Heads, they might grow old, and go in quiet to their own, if they would let others hope to do ſo to their <hi>Graves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will add but one Inſtance more, and that ſhall be of Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> whoſe unpeaceful Zeal was one great occaſion of the breaking off the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge Treaty,</hi> by which means ſo many thouſands of poor Souls were ſent in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Wars, to Untimely and Bloody Deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who lye under the Guilt of much Innocent Blood are not meet perſons to be at Peace with, till all the Guilt of the Blood be expiated and avenged, either by the Sword of the Law, or the Law of the Sword.

            <p>
               <pb n="XXXVI" facs="tcp:100519:23"/>And ſo it happened; <hi>Providence</hi> it ſeems taking him at his Word; and ſome part of that Innocent Blood, which was ſhed by his incitement, being by thoſe of his own Party, according to his <hi>Oraculous,</hi> tho' otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, Prediction, avenged upon himſelf; which becauſe it fell out by a very uncommon accident, and known to very few, <hi>Providence</hi> ſeeming to interpoſe between him and a Pardon, which was intended for him, and to ſhew us, that <hi>vir ſanguinum non dimidiabit dies ſuos,</hi> Blood-thirſty Men ſhall not live out half their Days, I think it will not here be impertinent to my Deſign, or unprofitable either to the preſent or future Times, to make publick the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of it, which I had from the Mouth of a very Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Worthy, and Credible Perſon; which was thus.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Independents,</hi> after the Murder of the <hi>King,</hi> having made themſelves abſolute <hi>Conquerors,</hi> and Maſters of the Sword, and thereby ſnatched the Lawrels of Victory from the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brows, who had, together with them, born the heat and burthen of the Day, and ſweat ſo hard in the <hi>Common Cauſe</hi>; and that they had now every where cruſhed their fair hopes of Erecting their rigorous <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in the Eſtabliſhment of a National Church-Government, according to the <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Model, ſo that the Sneaking <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were even forced to content themſelves with a bare <hi>Toleration,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every hour affronted by the Huffing <hi>Independents,</hi> and every moment menaced with Ruine, by taking away the burthen of Tithes, the maintenance of their Cauſe and Miniſters; they began to conſult which way to retrieve themſelves from thoſe deſperate Events, which ſeemed, like black Clouds, to hang over their Heads, ready to diſcharge themſelves and all their Storms and Thunder upon them. And ſeeing no way more probable, than to follow the Example of their <hi>Dear Brethren</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they caſt their thoughts upon a <hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> then in Exile; but that this was out of pure kindneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not in the leaſt to the <hi>King</hi> or his Intereſt, it is moſt evident, both becauſe they utterly refuſed therein to joyn with the Loyal Party, and that even Mr. <hi>Love</hi> himſelf, with his lateſt Breath upon the Scaffold, aſſures us,
<pb n="XXXVII" facs="tcp:100519:23"/>
               <hi>That it was true, he did oppoſe in his Place and Calling, the Forces and Tyranny of the late King; and, were he alive again,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſhould I live longer, (the Cauſe being as then it was) I ſhould oppoſe him longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Crafty <hi>Independents,</hi> whoſe jealouſie of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Intereſt and Power made fearful of them, and thoſe fears vigilant, having their Spies, Emiſſaries, Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and Intelligencers in every Corner, even in the Kings Court, during his Exile, quickly got the ſcent of this <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Intrigue</hi>; and <hi>Love,</hi> as a Principal Man of the Presbyterian Faction, being moſt zealous and forward, and, by reaſon of his precipitate boiling temper of Spirit, leſs circumſpect and cautious, was immediately Diſcovered, Apprehended, Tryed, Convicted, and Condemned for this <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he being the <hi>Minion</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and they conſidering, what a wound of Infamy it would give to their, even expiring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reputation thorow the whole Nation, if he ſhould die for this Crime of ſuppoſed <hi>Loyalty,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore extraordinary Interceſſions and Applications were made to the <hi>Commons,</hi> then Styled <hi>The Supreme Authority of the Nation,</hi> for his Deliverance; all his faithful Zeal and memorable Services in former Times were recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the danger of diſobliging and loſing the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Intereſt and Kindneſs; and how hazardous it might be to the Common-wealth, not yet well ſetled, if, by ſuch ſeverities, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſhould be provoked to joyn with the <hi>Malignant Party,</hi> were among other Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons repreſented and inſinuated to the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> Party. But this <hi>Supreme Authority of the Nation</hi> having now ſtruck their Top-ſail to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who wore the Flag of Soveraignty, even over this goodly <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> till ſuch time as they had ſent a diſpatch to their Great <hi>Dictator Oliver,</hi> to conſult his Soveraign Will, and to know from his Lips, upon which all Mens Deſtinies now depended, their <hi>Supremeſhips</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> durſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to give <hi>Love</hi> a Pardon for his Life, only Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was reſpited for ſome little time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel,</hi> being then abſent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the Receipt of this Account from the <hi>Slaves,</hi> whom he was pleaſed to
<pb n="XXXVIII" facs="tcp:100519:24"/>
call his <hi>Maſters,</hi> having taken the matter into his grave De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, returns his Anſwer in a private Letter to one of his Confidents, but I cannot poſitively charge my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, whether <hi>Scot</hi> or <hi>Martin</hi>; and therein, according to his Politicks, conſidering, that at preſent his hands were full, and fearing, leſt the <hi>Engliſh Presbyterians</hi> ſhould riſe at his back, and joyn with the <hi>Scottiſh Kirk</hi>-Party, with whom he was now ingaged, he graciouſly Condeſcends, that <hi>Love</hi> ſhould be for a conſiderable time Reprieved, and, upon good Security from Him and his Party of their future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, Pardoned.</p>
            <p>Now by what Impulſe or Direction God only knows, two or three <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who had formerly been of the <hi>Kings</hi> Army, happening to travel the <hi>Northern</hi> Road, and meeting the <hi>Poſt,</hi> who, among others, was charged with this Letter, and inquiring of him, Whether he had; any <hi>Scotch Letters,</hi> to which he innocently replyed, He had; a Curioſity ſeized their Imagination to peep into the Secrets of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping Powers</hi>; and therefore taking the <hi>Poſt</hi> aſide out of the High Road, into a convenient place, and opening his <hi>Male,</hi> they took out and opened the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Pacquet, and, among others, this of <hi>Cromwels,</hi> which carried a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for a Reprieve for <hi>Love</hi>; upon the reading of which, one of them immediately cried out, <hi>Oh! that is the Rogue, that ruin'd us, by breaking off the Treaty at <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi>; and thereupon putting that Letter in his pocket, they reſtored the reſt to the <hi>Poſt,</hi> telling him, there were his Letters again, and immediately mounting, and putting Spurs to their Horſes, they purſued their intended Journey.</p>
            <p>The Pacquet arriving at <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral Letters from <hi>Cromwel</hi> to diverſe Perſons, without one ſingle Syllable concerning <hi>Love,</hi> the Party took it for granted, that this Silence was intended as an abſolute Denial: And therefore, not daring to draw upon themſelves the high diſpleaſure of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> either by a ſecond Importunity to ſave him, or by a Delay of Execution, in a few days after the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his diſpatch into the other World was ſigned, and he, who had been inſtrumental in bringing ſo many Noble Heads, and even the <hi>Kings,</hi> to that Infamous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death, had himſelf the Honour of the <hi>Axe,</hi> and to
<pb n="XXXIX" facs="tcp:100519:24"/>
have the blood of ſo many Innocents, as was ſhed by his Party, avenged upon himſelf, according to his Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Prophetick Divinity.</p>
            <p>But, while my Pen runs in this full Carreer againſt theſe Cruel and Sanguinary <hi>Principles,</hi> it is more than probable, that the uſual Courteſie of the <hi>Faction</hi> will beſtow the Title of a bloudy-minded <hi>Perſecutor</hi> upon me; and that the intent of this Expoſure of their Poſitions is deſigned purpoſely to Expoſe their Perſons to the Hatred and ſevereſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Laws and Government. Now though, while I keep my ſelf to the ſtricteſt Rules of Truth, I ſhould little value the worſt of their Imputations, yet conſidering, that they are wont to extend their Calumnies from ſingle Perſons to the whole <hi>Order</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> I have too much Duty and Tenderneſs, for the Reputation of that Glorious and truly <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Church, whereof I eſteem it my greateſt Honour to be one of her meaneſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to ſuffer the leaſt Spot, through my willing default, to ſully her Beauteous Face: I muſt therefore make my moſt Solemn <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> that, as I have not the leaſt Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity to any Mans Perſon, ſo I have not the leaſt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that prompts me to any kind of Cruelty; nay, it is my perfect abhorrence of Blood and Cruelty, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels me for the Satisfaction of the Importunities of my own Conſcience, to uſe my utmoſt Induſtry to prevent the effuſion of Humane Blood. It is to prevent the growth of theſe Fatal <hi>Principles,</hi> which, if not in time ſuppreſſed and ſubdued, threaten again to break out among us, and open the Veins of theſe Miſerable <hi>Nations</hi>: It is becauſe I would with my utmoſt Power hinder theſe deluded people, who become diſtracted with the Raving Poiſon of ſuch Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, either from Executing their Bloody Treaſons and Malice upon others, or running themſelves to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon the Sword of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> It is againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal miſchief of the <hi>Principles,</hi> and not the Mortal Lives of the deluded <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of them, that I level all my blows; and that our Grand-Children may learn Wiſdom from our harms and dangers; and know how to diſtinguiſh by their Fruits the <hi>Cedar</hi> Government of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> from the Bramble Government of Faction and <hi>

But our hope is, that the Parliament, being Men in whom the Lord hath put Wiſdom and Underſtanding, will for their Brethren and Companions ſake, yea, and for their own Souls ſakes too, prudently foreſee the Evil, and prevent the Motion, and not put Authority into their hands, who will be, if they have it, as great Perſecutors of the Saints, as the <hi>Prelates</hi> formerly have been, and ſo inſtead of one Lordly Domineering <hi>Biſhop</hi> in a <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> we ſhall then have one in every Pariſh, and in ſome more, to oppreſs and ſuppreſs all ſuch as walk up to their Light more Cloſely and Conſcionably in all Gods ways; and what we ſpeak, we ſpeak no more than what we have had wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Experience of, and can make good by Proof.

                     <p>Being required to make known to your Lordſhip my Judgment concerning ſome things propounded at my laſt being before your Lordſhip; from which Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions though I never diſſented, nor know any cauſe why I ſhould be ſuſpected; Yet being ready and willing to obey your Lordſhip in all things, eſpecially in ſo juſt a demand as this, I have conſulted Antiquity, and with our Modern <hi>Hooker</hi> and others, and humbly deſire your Lordſhip to accept the ſatisfaction following.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For the Church of <hi>England</hi> in General, I bleſs God, I am a Member of it; I was Baptized in it; and am not only moſt aſſured, it is a True Church, but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, it is the moſt Glorious and Flouriſhing Church this day under the Sun, which I deſire to be truly thankful for; and for the Faith, Doctrine, Articles of that Church, and the Maintenance of them, I hope the Lord will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to contend, <hi>tanquam pro Aris &amp; Focis,</hi> yea I truſt to lay down my Life, if I were thereunto called.</p>

and Charity, their Tenderneſs and Unity; theſe are their Thoughts of Monarchy and Epiſcopacy, of Order and Government, of Obedience and Subjection. Here is a taſte of their Divinity, Humanity, Morality, Politicks, Ethicks and Honeſty, though it is <hi>Canis ad Nilum,</hi> only a few Snaps and away, for fear of the <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Nilus</hi> is their proper Emblematical Parent, and they are the very <hi>Crocodiles</hi> of Religion, who are always Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till they are able to devour the Government: But certainly here is ſufficient Deformity, to perſwade all Good, Virtuous, and Religious People for ever to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them; not but that, if I thought it neceſſary, or that it would not Nauſeate rather than Divert the Reader, I could have blotted many more Pages out of their own Ink; but truly, meaſuring the Inclinations of others by my own, I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge that it gives me very ſlender diverſion to Traffick in ſuch Courſe Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch Ugly Colours; but there is a neceſſity, that he, who muſt Paint the Infernal Legions of Darkneſs, ſhould dip his Pencil in the deepeſt Black, and pourtray Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: And that he, who would, from the Life, draw the exact Picture of <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other <hi>Sects,</hi> muſt fetch the beſt Colours to do it with, from their own Shops. And truly it is a ſatisfaction to me, that I have not had this drudgery put upon me, but that theſe Monſters have drawn the Lineaments of their own hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Shapes and Figures: And whatever Opinion the preſent <hi>Separatiſts</hi> may have either of me or of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, I think, though I might have diſplaid their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are equally Monſtrous and Dangerous, in the proper Colours of Truth, yet I ſhould not have beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my ſelf at this groſs rate, to render them more ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And indeed, let who will dreſs theſe Principles in the Whiteſt Garb, they will look like <hi>Negro</hi>'s, who though Apparrelled in the cleaneſt Linnen, will be <hi>Negro</hi>'s ſtill: But certainly, as there can be no Exceptions againſt the Perſons who have given theſe Characters, they being the Principal Champions and <hi>Heroes</hi> of theſe two powerful Sects of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> ſo there can be no doubt of the Truth of their Characters; for like
<pb n="LXI" facs="tcp:100519:35"/>
skilful Combatants, as by long tryal they beſt knew each others defects, ſo they addreſſed themſelves moſt vigorouſly to attack each other in the weakeſt places, and one may well perceive by the mutual Wounds they give and receive, that they both wanted the Armour of Truth: And moſt aſſuredly, if all, they charge each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Guilty of, be true, <hi>Hell</hi> hath nothing able much to ſurpaſs them in Blackneſs, and if they be falſe, nothing that can equal them in Malice and Falſeneſs; ſo that let their Accuſations be true or falſe, they manifeſtly prove each Faction to be moſt intolerably Wicked, Faithleſs, Miſchievous, and Dangerous to all Mankind, and even to Humane Society: And for my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I cannot ſee, how it had been poſſible to have found any Arguments ſo capable to undeceive and deliver the deluded People of this <hi>Nation</hi> out of that ſtrange fond Opinion, which they have entertained of ſuch Sanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> as theſe, with which they themſelves have furniſhed us againſt themſelves; and this, I hope, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe excuſe the Repetition of ſuch Treaſonable Poſitions, ſuch unmannerly and bitter Invectives, ſuch fierce Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch horrible Crimes, as theſe two Factions are by their own Mouths and Pens convicted to be Guilty of.</p>
            <p>But their greateſt Guilt is ſtill behind, the very <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence</hi> of thoſe Envenomed Anti-Monarchical Principles refined into one <hi>Diſmal Act.</hi> For notwithſtanding all theſe mutual Quarrels, they were ſtill moſt Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſenting and united in the Proſecution of the <hi>King,</hi> as the Common Enemy: And after all the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a Cruel, Bloody, and Unnatural War, in which they had involved the Kingdom, they proceeded at the laſt to Conſummate all their former Wickedneſſes, by the moſt Execrable Deſign, that ever the Sun lent Beams to the Day to behold, the Murder of the Ornament of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the Miracle of Piety, and the Vice-gerent of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Earth, the <hi>King</hi>; their <hi>King</hi>; their Natural Liege Lord and Soveraign; ſeeking the Security of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaſons by his Ruine; and palliating their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, by Murdering firſt his Innocence, and then his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="LXIII" facs="tcp:100519:36"/>
Perſon, and indeavouring to cover all their Former Crimes by committing Greater.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Independent</hi> Faction, under <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Favour, who had now openly declared himſelf of that Party, having now got into their Poſſeſſion the uncontrolable Power of the Sword; they firſt Endeavour to get the King, now a Priſoner to the Parliament, into the hands of the Army, which was now wholly <hi>Independent,</hi> the <hi>Prebyterians</hi> being thruſt out of all Military Employs, this was in a little time, by <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Power, effected by one <hi>Joyce,</hi> a Creature of his, who when he had given him an Account of the Succeſs of that Commiſſion, <hi>That's well, ſaid</hi> Cromwel, <hi>for now I have the King in my Power, I have the Parliament in my Pocket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next ſtep was, to make ſure of the City of <hi>London,</hi> which, by the miſchief it had done the King, was of too great Importance to be ſlighted, and of great Neceſſity and Advantage to be gained: They were very ſenſible, ſhould <hi>London</hi> heartily and unanimouſly oppoſe them, that heavy Weight would be able to turn the Scale, and very much Traverſe, if not Hazard the intire Ruine of their Deſigns: This <hi>Cromwel</hi> knew ſo well, that he was wont to ſay to his Confidents, <hi>That London muſt be brought to more abſolute Obedience, or laid in the Duſt.</hi> A Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well worth the Conſideration of that Noble City, and a Caution to them for ever to be aware of theſe Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Factions,</hi> who, if their Intereſt required it, and their Power were able to effect it, would make no Difficulty to Execute the Menace of that Infamous <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, in order to the gaining of this Point, they firſt Court the City to a Neutrality, but the City declining that, and there being ſome Overtures of an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the King, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Party moſt dreaded, he Threatens to March up with the Army to <hi>London,</hi> whereupon, the Citizens Hearts miſgiving them, and the <hi>Independents</hi> having gained upon diverſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Members of it, it was Reſolved, to try to divert that Storm, whereupon they ſend <hi>Fowke, Gibbs, and Eſtwick,</hi> to Treat with the Army, who like perfidious and timerous <hi>Slaves,</hi> betrayed their Truſt, and thoſe that Employed
<pb n="LXIV" facs="tcp:100519:36"/>
them in that Affair. For the Reſult of their Negotiation was, That the City ſhould relinquiſh the Power of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> and leave the Eſtabliſhment of it to the Council of the Army; That they ſhould deliver up all their Forts, the Line of Communication, the Tower with all the Arms and Ammunition, to the Army; That they ſhould disband their Forces, demoliſh all their Out-works and Fortifications, and ſuffer the whole Army to March through the City; all which to the Eternal Diſhonor of thoſe Puſillanimous <hi>Cowards,</hi> only Valiant in Rebellion, they preſently after moſt Triumphantly put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>This great Rub being ſo fortunately ſurmounted, they now began to open the Diſmal Scene, and that, they might extinguiſh the leaſt remaining Sparks of Loyalty, they fall to Menacing ſuch, as durſt, in the leaſt, Oppoſe them. For upon the Debate, which happened concerning the Nulling of all Acts, Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>July</hi> 26. 1647. <hi>to Auguſt.</hi> 6. Sir <hi>Arthur Haſilrig</hi> openly declared in the Houſe, <hi>That ſome Heads muſt fly off, and that, he feared, the</hi> Parliament of England <hi>would not Save the Kingdom</hi> of England, <hi>that they muſt look another way for Safety:</hi> And many other threatning Speeches were made by Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi> Jun. Sir <hi>John Evelyn</hi> Jun. <hi>Prideaux, Gourdon, Mildmay, Scot,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Holland</hi>; and in concluſion, a Letter, with a Remonſtrance full of Invectives and Menaces, from the General <hi>Fairfax</hi> and the general Council of the Army, was produced, by which Means they gained that Point alſo.</p>
            <p>Upon the 24. of <hi>December</hi> the four Bills, whereby the King was to be Deveſted of every thing, but the Empty Name, were ſent to the King, as the Conditions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring him to his Liberty and Crown. And upon the third of <hi>January,</hi> the Kings anſwer was Read and Debated; upon which Sir <hi>Thomas Wroth</hi> broke out into this Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Speech, (fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> Himſelf, or rather <hi>Tyburn,</hi> than <hi>St. Stephen's</hi> Chappel,) <hi>That</hi> Bedlam <hi>was appointed for Mad-men, and</hi> Tophet <hi>for Kings: That our Kings of late had carried themſelves, as if they were fit for no place, but</hi> Bedlam; and therefore Moved, firſt to Secure
<pb n="LXIV" facs="tcp:100519:37"/>
the King, and keep him cloſe Priſoner in ſome Inland Caſtle, with ſtrong Guards. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to draw up Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Impeachment againſt him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to lay him aſide, and ſettle the Kingdom without him; and for his own particular, he ſaid, he valued not what Form of Government they ſet up, ſo it were not by <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was Seconded by <hi>Ireton,</hi> who ſpoke the Senſe of the Army, and ſaid, <hi>That the King had denyed Safety and Protection to his People, by denying the four Bills: That Subjection to his was but in lieu of Protection from him to the People; that This being denied by the King, they may well deny any more Subjection to him, and ſettle the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without him; That it was expected, after ſo long Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they ſhould now ſhew their Reſolution, and not deſert thoſe Valiant Men of the Army, who had ingaged for them beyond the poſſibility of retreat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to put the thruſt home to the very Heart of the King, towards the latter end of his Speech, laying his Hand upon the Hilt of his Sword, that <hi>Sorcerer Cromwel</hi> ſtood up, and ſpake to this Effect:
<q>That it was now expected, that the Parliament ſhould Govern and Defend the Kingdom by their own Power and Reſolution, and to teach the People no longer to expect Safety and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from an Obſtinate Man, whoſe Heart God had hardened; That, they who had defended the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from ſo many hazards, difficulties, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with the expence of their Blood, would defend them herein, with Fidelity and Courage, againſt all Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever; therefore, that they ought not to teach them, by neglecting their own and the Kingdoms Safety, in which their own is included, to think themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and left to the Rage and Malice of an irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Enemy, whom they had ſubdued for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſake, and therefore in probability likely to find his future Government of them inſupportable, and more inclined to Revenge than Juſtice, leſt otherwiſe Deſpair ſhould teach thoſe Valiant Men, to ſeek their Safety in ſome other means, than adhering to the Parliament, when they ſhall plainly ſee, you will not ſtick to your
<pb n="LXV" facs="tcp:100519:37"/>
ſelves: and how deſtructive ſuch a Reſolution in them may be to you all, added he, <hi>I tremble to think, and leave to you to Judge.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Queſtion was immediately put, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Two Houſes ſhould make no more Addreſſes or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the King; and, the Houſe being Divided, with the <hi>Yeas,</hi> were 141. with the <hi>Noes,</hi> 91. So it paſſed in the Affirmative.</p>

            <p>If you deſire to ſee a longer and more Bloody War, and <hi>London</hi> (as the Chief Seat thereof) weltring in its own Blood; your Wives, Children, and Families ſtarved and pined to death through Poverty, Famine, and want of Trade; if you would overthrow Parliaments for ever, and ſubject both them, and all People, to the Will of the <hi>King</hi> and his Courtiers; if you deſire to ſee Foreigners invade you on all Hands, and many Armies at once Quartered upon your Land, putting hard for a <hi>New Conqueſt</hi> of this miſerable divided Nation; and if you deſire to ſee your Wives and your Daughters raviſhed before your Faces, and

your Childrens Brains Daſht againſt the Stones by luſtful and Blood-thirſty <hi>Cavaleers</hi>; then follow the Steps of your Wealthy head-ſtrong <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Common-Council-Men,</hi> in their haſty purſuance of a <hi>Perſonal Treaty</hi> with the King, or which is all one, removing him out of the Armies Power: For if you do, flatter not your ſelves, but be aſſured, [moſt Impious Confidence,] <hi>as certain as God is in Heaven,</hi> you will ſee thoſe Miſeries come to paſs, and that ſwiftly too, you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be devoured in an inſtant without Hope of Remedy.</p>
            <p>But if you abhor, and would prevent thoſe Miſchiefs, then avoid and deteſt their Ingagement; fly from it as from a Serpent, it being a <hi>Viper</hi> bred in your own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to deſtroy you; and if you have unadviſedly ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it, Repent ſpeedily, and Recal your Hands.</p>
            <p>They moſt groſly delude you, and abuſe the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in pretending they are able, nay willing to Prevent or Suppreſs Tumults; Truſt them once, and they will deſire no more; they will ſoon make it paſt a <hi>Treaty</hi>: And when you lye at their Mercy, complaining of the Breach of their Ingagements, they'l Deride and Spurn you; and you ſhall not dare to open your Mouths againſt them, but if you do, it ſhall be your Death; Night nor Day, you ſhall not with Safety go out of your Doors, but Stabbing and Piſtoling will be common at Noon-day.</p>
            <p>Oh therefore, all ye that Honor God, ſee this Excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Danger</hi> before it be too late; have Patience; wait upon God in his Way; run not to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help; lean not on ſo broken a Reed; conſider how this <hi>City</hi> hath been threatned, and by whom; how often <hi>Plots</hi> have been covered under <hi>Treaties</hi>; deſtroy not all your Mercies through Impatience; forſake not a Juſt <hi>God</hi> (who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath Preſerved you,) for any <hi>

            <p>This is the Voice of the Conſcience of <hi>Separation,</hi> and how convincingly well it pleads fot the Kindneſs and Eſteem of all Loyal Subjects, and for the Favour and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Crowned Heads,</hi> let this Paper be an Eternal Witneſs. If this be Conſcience, all People, but Kings more eſpecially, had need to inſert it into their <hi>Litany,</hi> From the Tender Conſcience of Diſſenting Separatiſts, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera Nos Domine.</hi> And moſt aſſuredly, if the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> teach and enjoyn all men, for Conſcience ſake, and under the Penalty of Eternal Damnation, to be Subject to Lawful Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, though Heathens, Infidels, and Idolaters, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> was, when that Command was impoſed, nay, and a moſt cruel Perſecutor too; that muſt needs be a Falſe Religion, and an Evil and Wicked Conſcience, which does not only teach Rebellion, but is ſo Loud and Clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to incite Subjects, contrary to all the Obligations and Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, to ſeek the Ruine, Death, and Deſtruction of their Lawful, a Juſt, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King.</p>
            <p>But the Faction, who now were abſolutely reſolved upon the Kings Death, were not content with their Pens to incite the People to expect it; but, that they might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Execrable purpoſe, they fell again to Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Impeaching ſuch Gentlemen, as had but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of Loyalty, or had done any thing towards a <hi>Perſonal Treaty:</hi> And <hi>Skippon,</hi> who, from a pitiful Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner under Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> had by his lucky Rebellion advanced to be a Major General, a Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Governor of the City, Moved, That all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treaters</hi> might be Excluded. So ſaid, ſo done; and no ſooner ſaid and done, and the Coaſt on that ſide clear, but it was Moved in the Houſe to proceed Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally againſt the King. Whereupon <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the moſt Superlative <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in Nature, by whoſe forelaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance all this Affair was pre-concerted, ſtood up, and, as if he had been ſurprized, ſaid, <hi>That if any Man moved this upon Deſign, he ſhould think him the Greateſt</hi>
               <pb n="LXIX" facs="tcp:100519:39"/>
Traytor <hi>in the World; but ſince</hi> Providence and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>had caſt them upon it, he ſhould pray God to bleſs their</hi> Counſels, <hi>though he was not provided on the ſudden to give them Counſel in ſo Weighty an Affair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, upon this Motion, An Ordinance for the Tryal of the King was immediately brought in, Read and Paſſed that very day; and the next being the 28<hi>th. of December</hi> 1648. it was carried up to the Lords for their Concurrence. But the Remainder of that Houſe, how Undutyful ſoever they had formerly been, yet, moſt of them, for all had not, had ſo much Courage and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour left, as would not permit them, for their Own, and the ſake of their Poſterity, to give their <hi>Content</hi> to that Ordinance, which, by utterly ſtopping the Fountain of all Honour, muſt render them, who derived theirs from thence, not only moſt Ingrateful, but Infamous in all future Ages: And therefore after the Reading of it, This Ordinance was by the Major part Rejected, and the Houſe Adjourned themſelves for ſeven days.</p>
            <p>This Counterbuff, ſo little expected by the Faction, who thought they had humbled the whole Nation into that abject ſtate of Cowardly <hi>Slavery,</hi> that none could be found ſo hardy as to oppoſe them, did wonderouſly Gall and Sting theſe Conſcientious Traytors; but their Zeal, or rather Pride and Ambition, were now at the Spring-Tide, and being ſwell'd by the Tempeſt of Abſolute Power, they were reſolved to ſurmount all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and oppoſitions; and being about to Cut up the very Root of Majeſtie, it is no wonder, if they made no ſcruple of Lopping the Branches of Honour: And therefore, <hi>The Commons of</hi> England, as they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, many of whom were never born to an Inch <hi>of Freehold,</hi> immediately cut this Gordian Difficulty of the Negative, and indeed the whole Power of the Peerage by theſe Three Keen Votes.</p>

                  <p>I would know by what Power I am called hither. I was not long ago in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> how I came there, is a longer Story than I think is fit at this time for Me to ſpeak of: but there I entred into a Treaty with both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with as much Publick Faith as its poſſible to be had of any People in the World, I Treated there with a number of Honourable Lords and Gentlemen, and Treated honeſtly and uprightly; I cannot ſay but they did very Nobly with Me: We were upon a Concluſion of the Treaty.

If you do it by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Authority, you cannot anſwer it: There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you Power, to account. Satisfie me in that, and I will anſwer; otherwiſe I betray my Trust, and the Liberties of the People: And therefore think of that, and then I ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: For I do avow, That it is as great a Sin to withſtand Lawful Authority, as it is to ſubmit to a Tyrannical, or any other ways <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Authority. And therefore ſatisfie God, and Me, and all the World in that, and you ſhall receive my Anſwer. I am not afraid of the Bill.</p>

                  <p>Sir, You may remember, at the laſt Court you vvere told the occaſion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge read againſt you, containing a Charge of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and other High Crimes againſt this Realm of <hi>England</hi>; you have heard likewiſe that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ſhould give an Anſwer to that Charge, that thereupon ſuch Proceedings might be had, as ſhould be agreeable to Juſtice: You were then pleaſed to make ſome Scruples concerning the Authority of this Court, and knew not by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority you were brought hither: You did divers times propound your Queſtions, and were as often anſwered, That it was by Authority of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament, that did think fit to call you to Account for thoſe High and Capital Miſdemeanors wherewith you were then charged.</p>
                  <p>Since that, the Court hath taken into conſideration
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100519:63"/>
what you then ſaid: they are fully ſatisfied with their own Authority, and they hold it fit you ſhould ſtand ſatisfied with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a poſitive and particular Anſwer to this Charge that is exhibited againſt you. They do expect you ſhould either confeſs or deny it: If you deny, it is offered in the behalf of the Kingdom, to be made good againſt you. Their Authority they do avow to the whole World, that the vvhole Kingdom are to reſt ſatisfied in, and you are to reſt ſatisfied vvith it; and therefore you are to loſe no more time, but to give a poſitive Anſvver thereunto.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>When I was here last, 'tis very true, I made that Queſtion; and if it were only my own particular Caſe, I would have ſatisfied my ſelf with the Protestation I made the last time I was here, against the Legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be Tryed by any Superior Juriſdiction on Earth: But it is not my Caſe alone, it is the Freedom and the Liberty of the People of</hi> England; <hi>and do you pretend what you will, I ſtand more for their Liberties. For if Power without Law, may make Laws, may alter the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Subject he is in</hi> England <hi>that can be ſure of his Life, or any thing that he calls his own: Therefore, when that I came here, I did expect particular Reaſons, to know by what Law, what Authority you did proceed againſt Me here; and therefore I am a little to ſeek what to ſay to you in this Particular, becauſe the Affirmative is to be proved, the Negative often is very hard to do: But ſince I cannot perſwade you to do it, I ſhall tell you my Reaſons as ſhort as I can.</hi>

                     <hi>My Reaſons why in Conſcience, and the Duty I owe to God first, and my People next, for the Preſervation of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, I conceive I cannot anſwer this, till I be ſatisfied of the Legality of it.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you; vvhich I vvould not do, but that vvhat you do, is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Proceedings of any Court of Juſtice. You are about to enter into Argument and Diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authority of this Court, before vvhom you appear as a Priſoner, and are charged as an high
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100519:64"/>
Delinquent: If you take upon you to diſpute the Authority of the Court, we may not do it, nor will any Court give way unto it; you are to ſubmit unto it, you are to give a punctual and direct Anſwer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will anſwer your Charge or no, and what your Anſwer is.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, By your favour, I do not know the Forms of Law; I do know Law and Reaſon, though I am no Lawyer profeſſed: But I know as much Law as any Gentleman in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and therefore, under favour, I do plead for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People of</hi> England <hi>more than you do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhould impoſe a Belief upon any man without Reaſons given for it, it were unreaſonable: But I muſt tell you, that by that Reaſon that I have, as thus informed, I cannot yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you; you may not be permitted: You ſpeak of Law and Reaſon; it is fit there ſhould be Law and Reaſon; and there is both againſt you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> The Vote of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament, it is the Reaſon of the Kingdom; and they are theſe too that have given that Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which you ſhould have Ruled and Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Sir,</hi> You are not to diſpute our Authority, you are told it again by the Court; <hi>Sir,</hi> it will be taken notice of, that you ſtand in contempt of the Court, and your contempt will be recorded accordingly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I do not know how a King can be a Delinquent; but by any Law that ever I heard of, all men (Delinquents, or what you will) let me tell you, they may put in Demurrers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Proceeding as Legal; and I do demand that, and demand to be heard with my Reaſons: if you deny that, you deny Reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, You have offered ſomething to the Court; I ſhall ſpeak ſomething unto you the Senſe of the Court. Sir, neither you nor any man are permitted to diſpute that Point; you are concluded, you may not demur to the Juriſdiction of the Court; if you do, I muſt let you know that they over-rule your Demurrer: They ſit here by the Authority of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and all your Predeceſſors and you are reſponſible to them.</p>

                  <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You ought not to interrupt while the Court is ſpeaking to you. This Point is not to be debated by you, neither will the Court permit you to do it: If you offer it by way of Demurrer to the Juriſdiction of the Court, they have conſidered of their Juriſdiction, they do affirm their own Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <head>His Majeſty not being ſuffered to deliver his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the Juriſdiction of their Pretended Court, by word of Mouth, thought fit to leave them in Writing to the more impartial Judgment of Poſterity, as followeth;</head>
               <p>HAving already made my Proteſtations, not only againſt the Illegality of this Pretended Court, but alſo, <hi>That no Earthly Power can juſtly call Me</hi> (who am your King) <hi>in queſtion, as a Delinquent;</hi> I would not any more open My Mouth upon this Occaſion, more than to refer my ſelf to what I have ſpoken, were I in this Caſe alone concerned: But the Duty I owe to God in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the True Liberty of My People, will not ſuffer Me at this time to be ſilent: For, how can any Free-born Subject of <hi>England</hi> call Life or any thing he poſſeſſeth, his own, if Power without Right, dayly make New, and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Old Fundamental Law of the Land? Which I now take to be the preſent Caſe. Wherefore, when I came hither, I expected that you would have endeavoured to have ſatisfied Me concerning theſe Grounds which hinder Me to anſwer to your Pretended Impeachment: But ſince I ſee that nothing <hi>I</hi> can ſay, will move you to it (though <hi>Negatives</hi> are not ſo naturally proved as <hi>Affirmatives</hi>) yet <hi>I</hi> will ſhew you the Reaſon why <hi>I</hi> am confident you cannot Judge Me, nor indeed the meaneſt Man in <hi>England:</hi> For <hi>I</hi> will not (like you) without ſhewing a Reaſon, ſeek to impoſe a Belief upon My Subjects.</p>
               <p>There is no Proceeding juſt againſt any man,<note place="margin">Hereabout I was ſtopt, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſpeak any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
                  </note> but what is vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted either by God's Laws, or the Municipal Laws of the Countrey where he lives. Now <hi>I</hi> am most confident, This Days Proceeding cannot be warranted by God's Law; for, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, The Authority of Obedience unto Kings, is clearly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and ſtrictly commanded both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; which, if denied, <hi>I</hi> am ready inſtantly to prove.</p>
               <p>And for the Question now in hand, there it is ſaid, That, <hi>Where the Word of a King is, There is Power; and who may ſay unto Him, What doſt Thou?</hi> Eccl.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100519:66"/>
                  <hi>8.4.</hi> Then for the Law of this Land, <hi>I</hi> am no leſs confident, That no Learned Lawyer will affirm, That, <hi>An Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can lie againſt the King; they all going in His Name:</hi> And one of their Maxims is, That, <hi>The King can do no Wrong.</hi> Beſides, The Law upon which you ground your Proceedings, must either be Old or New; if Old, ſhew it; if New, tell what Authority warranted by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> can erect a Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was never one it ſelf, (as is well knovvn to all Lavvyers) <hi>I</hi> leave to God and the World to judge: And it vvere full as ſtrange, that they ſhould pretend to make <hi>Laws</hi> vvithout <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> to any that have heard ſpeak of the Lavvs of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And admitting, but not granting, That the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's</hi> Commiſſion could grant your <hi>Pretended Power, I</hi> ſee nothing you can ſhew for that; for certainly you never asked the Question of the <hi>Tenth Man</hi> in the Kingdom; and in this way you manifeſtly wrong even the <hi>Pooreſt Ploughman,</hi> if you demand not his free Conſent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your <hi>Pretended Commiſſion,</hi> vvithout the Conſent at least of the <hi>Major Part</hi> of every Man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of vvhatſoever Quality or Condition, vvhich <hi>I</hi> am ſure you never vvent about to ſeek; ſo far are you from having it. Thus you ſee that <hi>I</hi> ſpeak not for My ovvn Right alone, as <hi>I</hi> am <hi>your King,</hi> but alſo for the true Liberty of all <hi>My Subjects;</hi> vvhich conſiſts not in the <hi>Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but in <hi>Living under ſuch Laws, ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> as may give themſelves the beſt Aſſurance of their <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> of their <hi>Goods.</hi> Nor in this, must, or do <hi>I</hi> forget the <hi>Privileges</hi> of <hi>Both Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> vvhich this Days Proceedings do not only <hi>violate,</hi> but likevviſe <hi>occaſion</hi> the greateſt Breach of their <hi>Publick Faith,</hi> that (<hi>I</hi> believe) ever vvas heard of; with which I am far from Charging the <hi>Two Houſes;</hi> for all <hi>Pretended Crimes</hi> laid againſt Me, bear Date long before this Treaty at <hi>Newport;</hi> in which, <hi>I</hi> having conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as much as in Me lay, and hopefully expecting the <hi>Houſes</hi> Agreement thereunto, <hi>I</hi> was ſuddenly ſurprized, and hurried from thence as a Priſoner; upon which account <hi>I</hi> am againſt My Will brought hither; vvhere, ſince <hi>I</hi> am come, <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100519:66"/>
cannot but to My Power defend the Ancient Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdom, together with My own just Right. Then, for any thing I can ſee, the Higher Houſe is totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And for the Houſe of Commons, it is too well known that the Major part of them are detained or deterred from Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; ſo as, if I had no other, this were ſufficient for Me to protest against the Lawfulneſs of your <hi>Pretended Court.</hi> Beſides all this, the Peace of the Kingdom is not the leaſt in My Thoughts; and what hopes of Settlement is there, ſo long as Power reigns without Rule or Law, changing the whole Frame of that Government under which this Kingdom hath flouriſhed for many hundred Years? (nor will I ſay what will fall out, in caſe this lawleſs, unjuſt Proceeding against Me, do go on.) And believe it, the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will not thank you for this Change; for they will remember how happy they have been of late Years under the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King My Father, and My Self, until the beginning of theſe unhappy Troubles, and will have cauſe to doubt that they ſhall never be ſo happy under any New. And by this time it will be too ſenſibly evident, that the Arms I took up, were only to defend the Fundamental Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, against thoſe who have ſuppoſed My Power hath totally changed the Ancient Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons why I cannot ſubmit to your</hi> Pretended Authority, <hi>without violating the Truſt which I have from God for the Welfare and Liberty of My People, I expect from you either clear Reaſons to convince My Judgment, ſhewing Me that I am in an Error, (and then truly I will Anſwer) or that you will withdraw your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</hi>
               </p>

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is thereupon made for Silence, while the Pleas of the Commonwealth are in hand, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guard commanded by Proclamation, to take into cuſtody all that ſhall diſturb the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sollicitor <hi>Cooke</hi> addreſſing himſelf to the Court, repeated the former Delays and Contempts of the Priſoner, ſo as that no more needed on his part, but to demand Judgment; yet offered notwithſtanding the Notoriety of the Facts charged, mentioned in the Commons Act, appointing the Tryal, to prove the Truth of the ſame by Witneſſes, if thereto requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore prayed, and yet (he ſaid) not ſo much he, as the innocent Blood that had been ſhed, the cry whereof was very great, that a ſpeedy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Judgment might be pronounced againſt the Priſoner at the Bar according to Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Court putting the Priſoner in mind of former Proceedings, and that although by the Rules of Juſtice, if Advantage were taken of his paſt Contempts, nothing would remain but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Judgment againſt him, they had nevertheleſs determined to give him leave to Anſwer his Charge; which, as was told him in plain terms (for Juſtice knew no reſpect of Perſons) to plead <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty</hi> thereto.</p>
               <p>To which he made Anſwer as formerly, That he would not acknowledge the Juriſdiction of the Court, and that it was againſt the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; that there was no Law to make a King a Priſoner; that he had done nothing againſt his Truſt; and iſſued out into ſuch like Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Upon which, the Courts Reſolution was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to him, and he told, That he had now the third time publickly diſowned and affronted the Court; That, how good a Preſerver he had been of the Fundamental Laws, and Freedoms of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100519:69"/>
his Actions had ſpoken; that mens Intentions were uſed to be ſhewed by their Actions, and that he had written his Meaning in bloody Characters throughout the Kingdom, and that he ſhould find at laſt, though at preſent he would not underſtand it, that he was before a Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, in the manner appointed, the Clerk in the Name of the Court demanding the Priſoners Anſwer to his Charge, and the ſame refuſed, the Default was Recorded, the Priſoner remanded, and the Court Adjourned to the <hi>Painted Chamber.</hi>

               <p>This Court took into conſideration the managing of the Buſineſs of the Court this day, in the Hall, and the King's Refuſal to Anſwer, notwithſtanding he had been three ſeveral times demanded and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereunto, and have thereupon fully approved of what on the Courts part had then paſſed, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</p>
               <p>That, <hi>Notwithſtanding the ſaid Contumacy of the King, and refuſal to plead, which in Law amounts to a ſtanding mute, and tacit Confeſſion of the Charge, and notwithſtanding the Notoriety of the Fact charged, the Court would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs however examine Witneſſes, for the further and clearer ſatisfaction of their own Judgments and Conſciences; the manner of whoſe Examination was referred to further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the next Sitting, and Warrants were accordingly iſſued forth for ſummoning of Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> moveth the Court as a Meſſenger from the King, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King deſires he might ſpeak with his Chaplains that came unto him privately; but the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> having taken that into

               <p>But, <hi>My Lord,</hi> inſtead of making any Anſwer, he did then diſpute the Authority of this High Court. Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> was pleaſed to give him a further day to conſider, and to put in his Anſwer; which day being Yeſterday, I did humbly move, that he might be required to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer, either by Denying or Confeſſion of it: But, <hi>my Lord,</hi> he was then pleaſed for to Demur to the Juriſdiction of the Court; which the Court did then over-rule, and command him to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> Beſides this great Delay of Juſtice, I ſhall now humbly move your Lordſhip for ſpeedy Judgment against him. <hi>My Lord,</hi> I might preſs your Lordſhip upon the whole, That according to the known Rules of the Law of the Land, <hi>That, if a Priſoner ſhall ſtand as contumacious in contempt, and ſhall not put in an iſſuable Plea,</hi> Guilty <hi>or</hi> Not Guilty <hi>of the Charge given againſt him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may come to a fair Tryal,</hi> that as by an implicite Confeſſion it may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> as it hath been done to thoſe who have deſerved more favour than the Priſoner at the Bar has done: But beſides, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſs your Lordſhip upon the whole Fact. The <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> the Supreme Authority and Juriſdiction of the Kingdom, they have declared, That, <hi>it is notorious that the Matter of the Charge is true;</hi> as it is in truth, <hi>My Lord,</hi> as clear as Cryſtal, and as the Sun that ſhines at Noon-day: which, if your Lordſhip and the Court be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in, I have notwithſtanding, on the People of <hi>England</hi>'s behalf, ſeveral Witneſſes to produce.

               <p>Whereupon the Court proceeded, and remembred the great Aſſembly then preſent, of what had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paſſed betwixt the Court and the Priſoner, the Charge againſt him in the Name of the People of <hi>England,</hi> exhibited to them, being a Court conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Supream Authority of <hi>England,</hi> his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal three ſeveral days and times to own them as a Court, or to anſwer to the Matter of his Charge, his thrice recorded Contumacy, and other his Contempts and Defaults in the precedent Courts; upon which, the Court then declared, that they might not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, or to the Truſt repoſed in them, and that no mans Wilfulneſs ought to ſerve him to prevent Juſtice; and that they had therefore thought fit to take the ſubſtance of what had paſſed, into their ſerious conſideration, to wit, the Charge, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners Contumacy, and the Confeſſion which in Law doth ariſe upon that Contumacy, the Notoriety of the Fact charged, and other the Circumſtances material in the Cauſe; and upon the whole Matter, had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and agreed upon a Sentence then ready to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the Priſoner: But that in regard of his deſire to be further heard, they were ready to hear him as to any thing material which he would offer to their conſideration before the Sentence given, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Defence of himſelf concerning the Matter charged; and did then ſignifie ſo much to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; who made uſe of that leave given, only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt his reſpects to the Peace of the Kingdom, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject; and to ſay, That <hi>the ſame made

                  <p>Gentlemen, It is well known to all or moſt of you here preſent, That the Priſoner at the Bar hath been ſeveral times convented and brought before this Court, to make Anſwer to a Charge of Treaſon and other high Crimes exhibited againſt him in the Name of the People of <hi>England</hi>:<note place="margin">Here a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy interpos'd ſaying, <hi>Not half the People;</hi> but was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced with Threats.</note> To which Charge being required to Anſwer, he hath been ſo far from obeying the Commands of the Court, by ſubmitting to their Juſtice, as he began to take upon him to offer Reaſoning and Debate unto the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Court, and to the Higheſt Court, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100519:89"/>
pointed them to Try and Judge him: But being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled in that,, and required to make his Anſwer, he was ſtill pleaſed to continue contumacious, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the Court, that they might not be wanting to themſelves, nor the Truſt repoſed in them, nor that any mans Wilfulneſs prevent Juſtice, they have thought fit to take the Matter into their conſideration; they have conſidered of the Charge, they have conſidered of the Contumacy, and of that Confeſſion which in Law doth ariſe upon that Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; they have likewiſe conſidered of the Notorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Fact charged upon this Priſoner: And upon the whole Matter, they are reſolved, and are agreed upon a Sentence to be pronounced againſt this Priſoner. But in reſpect he doth deſire to be heard before the Sentence be read and pronounced, the Court hath reſolved that they will hear him.</p>
                  <p>Yet, <hi>Sir,</hi> Thus much I muſt tell you beforehand, which you have been minded of at other Courts, That if that which you have to ſay, be to offer any debate concerning the Juriſdiction, you are not to be heard in it. You have offered it formerly, and you have ſtruck at the Root, that is, the Power and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; which this Court will not admit a Debate of, and which indeed it is an irrational thing in them to do, being a Court that acts upon Authority derived from them. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you have any thing to ſay in Defence of your ſelf concerning the Matter Charged, the Court hath given me in command to let you know they will hear you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since I ſee that you will not hear any thing of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning that which I confeſs I thought most material for the Peace of the Kingdom, and for the Liberty of the Subject, I ſhall wave it, I ſhall ſpeak nothing to it: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I must tell you, That this many-a-day all things have been taken away from Me, but that that I call dearer to Me than My Life, which is</hi> My Conſcience, <hi>and</hi> My Honour: <hi>And if I had a reſpect to</hi> My Life <hi>more than the</hi> Peace <hi>of the</hi> Kingdom, <hi>and the</hi> Liberty <hi>of the</hi> Subject, <hi>certainly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100519:90"/>
I ſhould have made a particular Defence for my ſelf; for by that at leaſtwiſe I might have delayed an ugly Sentence, which I believe will paſs upon me. Therefore certainly,</hi> Sir, <hi>as a man that hath ſome underſtanding, ſome knowledge of the World, if that my true Zeal to my Countrey, had not overborn the care that I have for my own Preſervation, I ſhould have gone another way to work than that I have done. Now,</hi> Sir, <hi>I conceive that an haſty Sentence once past, may ſooner be repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, than recalled: And truly, the ſelf ſame deſire that I have for the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, more than my own particular Ends, makes me now at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> That I having ſomething to ſay that concerns both, before Sentence be given, that I may be heard in the <hi>Painted Chamber</hi> before the Lords and Commons. <hi>This Delay cannot be prejudicial unto you, whatſoever I ſay. If that I ſay no reaſon, thoſe that hear me muſt be Judges, I cannot be Judge of that that I have. If it be Reaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the Welfare of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, I am ſure on it, it is very well worth the hearing: Therefore I do conjure you, as you love that that you pretend, (I hope it is real) the Liberty of the Subject, the Peace of the Kingdom, that you will grant me this Hearing before any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be paſt. I only deſire this, That you will take this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your conſideration; it may be you have not heard of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. If you will, I will retire, and you may think of it: but if I cannot get this Liberty, I do proteſt, That theſe fair Shews of Liberty and Peace are pure Shews, and that you will not hear your King.</hi>

                  <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You have now ſpoken.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yes,</hi> Sir.</p>

                  <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                  <p>And this that you have ſaid, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declining of the Juriſdiction of this Court, which was the thing wherein you were limited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pray excuſe Me,</hi> Sir, <hi>for my interruption, becauſe you miſtake Me. It is not a declining of it; you do judge Me before you hear me ſpeak. I ſay it will not, I do not decline it; though I cannot acknowledge the Juriſdiction of the Court, yet,</hi> Sir, <hi>in this, give Me leave to ſay, I would do it, though I did not acknowledge it; in this I do proteſt, it is not the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, ſince, I ſay, if that I do ſay any thing but that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100519:90"/>
that is for the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the Subject, then the ſhame is Mine. Now I deſire that you will take this into your conſideration: if you will, I will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</hi>

                  <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, This is not altogether new that you have moved to us, not altogether new to us, though the firſt time in perſon you have offered it to the Court. <hi>Sir,</hi> You ſay you do not decline the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Court.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not in this that I have ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                  <p>I underſtand you well, <hi>Sir</hi>; but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that which you have offered, ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Saying of yours; for the Court are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give a Sentence. It is not as you ſay, <hi>That they will not hear their King</hi>; for they have been ready to hear You; they have patiently waited Your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for three Courts together, to hear what You would ſay to the Peoples Charge againſt You: To which You have not vouchſafed to give any Anſwer at all. <hi>Sir,</hi> this tends to a further Delay. Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſuch Delays as theſe, neither may the Kingdom nor Juſtice well bear. You have had three ſeveral days to have offered in this kind what You would have pleaſed. This Court is founded upon that Authority of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in whom reſts the Supream Juriſdiction. That which You now tender, is to have another Juriſdiction, and a co-ordinate Juriſdiction. I know very well You expreſs Your ſelf, <hi>Sir,</hi> That notwithſtanding that you would offer to the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> yet nevertheleſs You would proceed on here; I did hear You ſay ſo. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> that You would offer there, whatever it is, muſt needs be in Delay of the Juſtice here; ſo as if this Court be reſolved and prepared for the Sentence, this that You offer they are not bound to grant. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> According to that You ſeem to deſire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe You ſhall know the further Pleaſure of the Court upon that which You have moved, the Court will withdraw for a time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100519:91"/>This he did to prevent the diſturbance of their Scene by one of their own Members, Col. <hi>John Downes,</hi> who could not ſtifle the Reluctance of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when he ſaw his Majeſty preſs ſo earneſtly for a ſhort Hearing; but declaring himſelf unſatisfied, forced them to yield to the King's Requeſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You ſhall know the Pleaſure of the Court preſently.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Court withdraws for half an hour into the</hi> Court of Wards.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Serjeant at Arms.</speaker>
                  <p>The Court gives Command that the Priſoner be withdrawn; and they give Order for his Return again.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then withdrawing into the Chamber of the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> their Buſineſs was not to conſider of His Majeſties Deſire, but to chide <hi>Downes,</hi> and with Reproachs and Threats to harden him to go through the remainder of their Villany with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which done, they return; and being ſate,</hi> Bradſhaw <hi>commanded,</hi>

                  <hi>Who being come,</hi> Bradſhaw <hi>proceeded.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You were pleaſed to make a Motion here to the Court, to offer a Deſire of yours touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of ſomewhat to the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> for the Peace of the Kingdom. <hi>Sir,</hi> You did in effect receive an Anſwer before the Court Adjourned: Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> their Withdrawing and Adjournment was <hi>pro forma tantum</hi>; for it did not ſeem to them that there was any difficulty in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100519:91"/>
thing. They have conſidered of what you have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and have conſidered of their own Authority, which is founded, as hath been often ſaid, upon the Supream Authority of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Parliament</hi>: The Court acts accordingly to their Commiſſion. <hi>Sir,</hi> The Return I have to you from the Court is this, That they have been too much delayed by you already, and this that you now offer, hath occaſioned ſome little further Delay; and they are Judges appointed by the higheſt Authority, and Judges are no more to delay, than they are to deny Juſtice: They are good Words in the <hi>Great Old Charter</hi> of <hi>England, Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli deferemus Juſtitiam</hi>: There muſt be no Delay. But the truth is, <hi>Sir,</hi> and ſo every man here obſerves it, that you have much delayed them in your Contempt and Default, for which they might long ſince have proceeded to Judgment againſt you; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what you have offered, they are reſolved to proceed to Sentence and to Judgment, and that is their unanimous Reſolution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir, I know it is in vain for me to diſpute; I am no Sceptick for to deny the Power that you have; I know that you have Power enough.</hi> Sir, <hi>I must confeſs, I think it would have been for the Kingdoms Peace, if you would have taken the pains to have ſhewn the Lawfulneſs of your Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For this Delay that I have deſired, I confeſs it is a Delay; but it is a Delay very important for the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: For it is not My Perſon that I loook at alone, it is the Kingdoms Welfare, and the Kingdoms Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is an old Sentence,</hi> That we ſhould think on long before we reſolve of great Matters ſuddenly. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Sir, <hi>I do ſay again, that I do put at your doors all the inconveniency of a haſty Sentence. I confeſs I have been here now, I think, this Week, this day eight days was the day I came here first; but a little Delay of a Day or two further, may give Peace, whereas a haſty Judgment may bring on that trouble and perpetual inconveniency to the Kingdom, that the Child that is unborn may repent it. And therefore again, out of the Duty I owe to God and to My Countrey, I do deſire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the</hi> Painted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100519:92"/>
Chamber, <hi>or any other</hi> Chamber <hi>that you will appoint Me.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>You diſavow us as a Court, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for you to addreſs your ſelf to us, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us as a Court to judge of what you ſay, it is not to be permitted. And the truth is, all along from the firſt time you were pleaſed to diſavow and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own us, the Court needed not to have heard you one word; for unleſs they be acknowledged a Court, and engaged, it is not proper for you to ſpeak. <hi>Sir,</hi> we have given you too much liberty already, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of too much Delay, and we may not admit of any further.

But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſhall trouble you no longer; your Sins are of ſo large a dimenſion, that if you do but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think of them, they will drive you to a ſad

We are not here <hi>Jus dare,</hi> but <hi>Jus dicere</hi>: We cannot be unmindful of what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us; <hi>For to acquit the Guilty, is of equal abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to condemn the Innocent.</hi> We may not acquit the Guilty.

                  <p>HIS Children being come to meet Him, He firſt gave His Bleſſing to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and bade her remember to tell her Brother <hi>James,</hi> whenever ſhe ſhould ſee him, that it was his Fathers laſt Deſire, that he ſhould no more look upon <hi>Charles</hi> as his Eldeſt Brother only, but be obedient unto him as his Sovereign: And that they ſhould love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and forgive their Father's Enemies.

Being the laſt time I had the happineſs to ſee Him, He told Me, He was glad I was come; and although He had not time to ſay much, yet ſomewhat He had to ſay to me, which He had not to another, or leave in Writing, becauſe He feared their Cruelty was ſuch, as that they would not have permitted Him to write to me. He wiſhed me not to grieve and torment my ſelf for Him, for that would be a <hi>Glorious Death</hi> that He ſhould die, it being for the Laws and Liberties of this Land, and for maintaining the <hi>True Proteſtant Religion.</hi> He bid me read Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi>'s Sermons, <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Polity, and Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi>; which would ground me againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> He told me, He had forgiven all his Enemies, and hoped God would forgive them alſo; and commanded us, and all the reſt of my Brothers and Siſters to forgive them. He bid me tell my Mother, that His Thoughts had never ſtrayed from her, and that His Love ſhould be the ſame to the laſt. Withal He commanded me and my Brother to be obedient to Her, and bid me

               <head>Mr. <hi>Phelpes</hi> makes as ſhort Work of this part of the Narrative, as his <hi>Infamous Maſters</hi> had done of their <hi>Pretended Tryal</hi> of this <hi>Illuſtrious Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> and therefore to ſupply that Defect, take the following Account of the Concluſion of this Diſmal Tragedy.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> the Fatal Day, being come, the Commiſſioners met, and Ordered four or five of their Miniſters to attend upon the King at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where they then kept him; but his Majeſty well knowing what miſerable Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they were like to prove, refuſed to have Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them.</p>
               <p>That Morning, before his Majeſty was brought thence, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (who with much ado was permitted to wait upon him a day or two before, and to aſſiſt him in that ſad Inſtant) read Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his Preſence; in which the 27th. of St. <hi>Matt.</hi> (the Hiſtory of our Saviours Crucifixion) proved the Second Leſſon. The King ſuppoſing it to have been ſelected on purpoſe, thank'd him afterwards for his ſeaſonable Choice: But the Biſhop modeſtly declining that, undue Thanks, told him that it was the <hi>Leſſon</hi> appointed by the <hi>Calendar</hi> for that day, He alſo then and there received of the Biſhop the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and performed all his Devotions in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Which ended, about Ten of the Clock his Majeſty was brought from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Foot, with Colours flying and Drums beating, part marching before, and part behind, with a private Guard of Partiſans about him, the Biſhop on the one hand, and Col. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> (who had the Charge of him) on the other, both bare-headed, his Majeſty walking very faſt, and bidding them go fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, added,</p>
               <p>That, <hi>he now went before them to ſtrive for an Heavenly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100519:98"/>
Crown, with leſs ſolicitude than he had often encouraged his Soldiers to fight for an Earthly Diadem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to the end of the Park, he went up the Stairs leading to the <hi>Long Gallery</hi> in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> &amp; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Cabinet-Chamber,</hi> where he us'd formerly to lodge. There finding an unexpected Delay in being brought upon the Scaffold, which they had not as then fitted, he paſt the time, at convenient Diſtances, in Prayer.</p>
               <p>About Twelve of the Clock, his Majeſty refuſing to Dine,, only eat a Bit of Bread, and drank a Glaſs of Claret; and about an hour after, Col. <hi>Hacker,</hi> with other Officers and Soldiers, brought him, with the Biſhop and Col. <hi>Tomlinſon,</hi> through the <hi>Banquetting-Houſe</hi> to the Scaffold, to which, the Paſſage was made through a Window.</p>
               <p>Divers Companies of Foot and Troops of Horſe were placed on each ſide of the Street, which hindred the Approach of the very numerous Spectators, and the King from ſpeaking what he had premeditated, and prepared for them to hear.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, his Majeſty finding himſelf diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, omitted much of his intended Matter; and for what he meant to ſpeak, directed himſelf chiefly to Col. <hi>Tomlinſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall be very little heard of any body here; I ſhall therefore ſpeak a Word unto you here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think that holding my peace would make ſome men think that I did ſubmit to the Guilt as well as to the Puniſhment: But I think it is my Duty, to God first, and to my Country, for to clear my ſelf both as an honest Man, a good King, and a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall begin firſt with my <hi>Innocence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In troth, I think it not very needful for me to inſiſt long upon this; for all the World knows that I never did begin a War firſt with the</hi> Two Houſes of Parliament, <hi>and I call God to witneſs, to whom I must ſhortly make an Account, that I never did intend for to encroach upon their Priviledges; they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100519:99"/>
began upon me; it is the Militia they began upon; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Militia was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me. And to be ſhort, if any body will look to the Dates of Commiſſions, of their Commiſſions and mine, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Declarations, they will ſee clearly that they began theſe unhappy Troubles, not I. So that as to the guilt of theſe enormous Crimes that are laid againſt me, I hope in God that God will clear me of it. I will not (I am in Charity) God forbid that I ſhould lay it on the</hi> Two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>there is no neceſſity of either: I hope they are free of this Guilt. For I do believe that ill Inſtruments between them and me have been the chief Cauſe of all this Bloodſhed: So that by way of ſpeaking, as I find my ſelf clear of this, I hope and pray God that they may too. Yet for all this, God forbid that I ſhould be ſo ill a Christian as not to ſay that God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are juſt upon me; many times he does pay Juſtice by an unjuſt Sentence; that is ordinary. I will only ſay this, That</hi> an unjuſt Sentence that I ſuffered to take effect,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the E. of <hi>Strafford</hi>
                  </note> is puniſhed now by an unjuſt Sentence upon me. <hi>That is, — So far I have ſaid, to ſhew you that I am an</hi> Innocent Man.</p>
               <p>Now for to ſhew you that I am a <hi>good Chriſtian</hi>;</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pointing to the Biſhop.</note>
                  <hi>I hope there is a good Man that will bear me witneſs that I have forgiven all the World, and even thoſe in particular that have been the chief cauſers of my Death: Who they are, God knows, I do not deſire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my Charity muſt go further; I wiſh that they may repent; for indeed they have committed a great Sin in that Particular; I pray God with St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>that</hi> this be not laid to their Charge. <hi>Nay, not only ſo, but that they may take the right way to the Peace of the Kingdom: For my Charity commands me not only to forgive particular men, but my Charity commands me to endeavour to the last gasp the Peace of the Kingdom. So, Sirs, I do wiſh with all my Soul, (and I do hope there is ſome here will carry it further) that they may endeavour the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Turning to ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that wrote,</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now, Sirs, I must ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in a way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>You are out of the way: For certainly all the way
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100519:99"/>
you ever have had yet, as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conqueſt. Certainly this is an ill way; for Conqueſt, Sir, in my opinion, is never just, except there be a good just Cauſe, either for matter of wrong or juſt Title; and then if you go beyond it, the first Quarrel that you have to it, that makes it unjuſt at the end that was juſt at the firſt. But if it be only matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great</hi> Robbery, <hi>as a Pyrate ſaid to</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, That</hi> he was the great Robber, he was but a petty Robber. <hi>And ſo,</hi> Sir, <hi>I do think the way that you are in is much out of the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now,</hi> Sir, <hi>for to put you in the way; believe it, you will never do right, nor God will never proſper you, until you give</hi> God <hi>his Due, the</hi> King <hi>his Due (that is,</hi> My Succeſſors) <hi>and the</hi> People <hi>their Due: I am as much for</hi> Them <hi>as any of you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You must give</hi> God <hi>his Due, by Regulating rightly his Church according to his Scripture, which is now out of Order. For to ſet you in a way particularly, now I cannot, but only this, a</hi> National Synod, freely Called, freely Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among themſelves, <hi>muſt ſettle this, when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>For the</hi> King, <hi>indeed I will not.</hi>—</p>
               <p>(Then turning to a Gentleman that touched the Axe, he ſaid,</p>

                  <hi>For the</hi> King, <hi>The Laws of the Land will clearly inſtruct you for that; therefore, becauſe it concerns my own Particular, I only give you a Touch of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the</hi> People: <hi>And truly I deſire their Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as much as any body whomſoever; but I muſt tell you that their Liberty and Freedom conſiſts in having of Government, thoſe Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be moſt their own. It is not for having ſhare in Government,</hi> Sir; <hi>that is nothing pertaining to them: a Subject and a Sovereign are clear different things. And therefore until they do that, I mean, that you do put the People in that Liberty as I ſay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they will never enjoy themſelves. Sirs, it was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100519:100"/>
Arbitrary way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your Charge) that I am the</hi> MARTYR <hi>of the</hi> People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In troth, Sirs, I ſhall not hold you much longer; for I will only ſay this to you, That</hi> in truth I could have deſired ſome little time longer, becauſe that I would have put this that I have ſaid in little more order, and a little better digeſted than I have done, <hi>and therefore I hope you will excuſe me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have delivered my Conſcience, I pray God that you do take thoſe courſes that are beſt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own Salvation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>King</hi> replied,</p>

                  <hi>In troth,</hi> Sirs, <hi>My Conſcience in Religion, I think is very well known to all the World; and therefore I declare before you all, That</hi> I die a Chriſtian according to the Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I found it left me by my Father;<note place="margin">Pointing to the <hi>Biſhop.</hi>

               <p>Then having ſaid a few Words to himſelf, as he ſtood, with hands and eyes lift up, immediately ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, he laid his Neck upon the Block, and the <hi>Executioner</hi> again putting his Hair under his Cap, his Majeſty thinking he had been going to ſtrike bad him</p>

               <p>After a very ſhort pauſe, his Majeſty ſtretching forth his Hands, the <hi>Executioner</hi> ſevered his head from his Body: Which being held up and ſhewed to the People, was with his Body put into a Coffin covered with Velvet, and carried into his Lodging.</p>
               <p>His Blood was taken up by divers Perſons for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ends: By ſome as trophies of their Villany, by others as Reliques of a Martyr; and in ſome hath had the ſame effect by the Bleſſing of God, which was often found in his Sacred Touch when living.</p>
               <p>The Malice of his Enemies ended not with his Life: For when his Body was carried to St. <hi>James</hi>'s to be opened, they directed their Empiricks to ſearch for ſuch Symptoms as might diſgrace his Perſon or his Poſterity; but herein they were prevented by an honeſt Intruder, who gave a true account of his Sound and Excellent Temparament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100519:101"/>Being imbalmed and laid in a Coffin of Lead, to be ſeen for ſome dayes by the People, at length upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the ſeventeenth of <hi>February,</hi> it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to four of His ſervants, <hi>Herbert, Mildmay, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Joyner,</hi> who with ſome others in mourning Equipage attended the Herſe that night to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and placed it in the Room which was formerly the Kings Bed-Chamber.</p>
               <p>Next day it was removed into the Deans Hall, which was hung with black and made dark, and Lights were ſet burning round the Herſe. About three Afternoon the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> (others that were ſent, to refuſing that laſt ſervice to the beſt of Princes) came thither with two Votes paſſed that morning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ordering of the Kings Burial was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Duke, provided that the Expences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of exceeded not Five Hundred Pound. This Order they ſhewed to Colonel <hi>Whichcot</hi> the Governour of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deſiring the interment might be in St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chappel, and according to the Form of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>: The latter Requeſt the Governour denied, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was improbable the Parliament would permit the uſe of what they had ſo ſolemnly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therein deſtroy their own Act.</p>
               <p>The Lords replied.</p>
               <p>That there was a difference betwixt deſtroying their own Act, and diſpenſing with it, and that no power ſo binds its own hands, as to diſable it ſelf in ſome caſes. But all prevailed not.</p>
               <p>The Governour had cauſed an ordinary Grave to be digged in the Body of the Church of <hi>Windſor</hi> for the interment of the Corps; which the Lords diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found means by the direction of an Honeſt Man, one of the old Knights, to uſe an Artifice to diſcover a Vault in the middle of the Quire, by the hollow ſound they might perceive in knocking with a ſtaff upon that place; that ſo it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100519:102"/>
might ſeem to be their own accidental finding out, and no perſon receive blame for the diſcovery. This place they cauſed to be opened, and entring ſaw one large Coffin of Lead in the middle of the Vault cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Velvet Pall, and a leſſer on one ſide (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and his beloved Queen <hi>Jane Saint-Maure</hi>) on the other ſide was room left for another (probably intended for Queen <hi>Katherine Parre,</hi> who ſurvived him) where they thought fit to lay the King.</p>
               <p>Hither the Herſe was born by the Officers of the Garriſon, the four Lords bearing up the Corners of the Velvet Pall, and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> following. And in this manner was this great King, upon <hi>Fryday</hi> the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> about three, afternoon, Silently and without other Solemnity then of ſighs and tears, committed to the Earth, the Velvet Pall being thrown into the vault over the Coffin, to which was faſtned an Inſcription in Lead of theſe Words,</p>

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THus fell the moſt Glorious <hi>Monarch,</hi> and moſt Admirable <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the whole Univerſe. By theſe Hands were the Manacles of Slavery, and the Yoke of the moſt Arbitrary Servitude put upon the Neck and Hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and the ſame Blow which ſevered that Royal Head and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cut the very Nerves and Ligaments of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty; and even thoſe men who begun that dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Rebellion, upon the moſt Solemn Pretences of freeing the Nation from the imminent Dangers of <hi>Popery</hi> and Arbitrary Power, erected the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Tyranny, and gave the greateſt Advantages to <hi>Popery,</hi> and the moſt mortal Wound to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, that ever it received ſince <hi>Rome</hi> firſt left us, becauſe we left her unwarrantable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and unprimitive Practices and Doctrines, ſome of which have ſuch a Treaſonable Conformity with thoſe of our bloody Regicides, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe were ſufficient to excuſe the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> from the imputation of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Theſe were the men, who to amuſe the People, and animate them to Rebellion, made ſuch horrid Exclamations againſt <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and yet themſelves Acted what the very worſt men of thoſe Orders had ever written; who reduced thoſe Fatal Doctrines of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>Reſisting,</hi> even by Armed Force; of <hi>Depoſing</hi> and <hi>Murdering</hi> Crowned Heads; from the dull Theory whereof they ſo cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſly accuſed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> into the execrable <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi>; theſe were the glorious Founders, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters and Encouragers of the <hi>Separation,</hi> who ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little Villanies of a <hi>Clement,</hi> or a <hi>Ravailac,</hi> or the more ſecret Methods of murdering Princes, made the very Sun bluſh to behold their Triumphant and Daring Wickedneſs; being reſolved to eternize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the moſt <hi>Renowned Villains,</hi> by ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all that ever went before them; and to outdo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100519:104"/>
even <hi>Caſſius</hi> and ingrateful <hi>Brutus</hi> with the ſneaking three and twenty Daggers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators, who to recover their <hi>Commonwealth-Liberty,</hi> murdered <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by ſolemnly murdering a moſt Lawful Sovereign; whereas the others, wretchedly enough, took away only the Life of a bold <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Principles which lead men inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from Conſcientious Diſobedience, to a Rebellious Conſcience; and by the falſe Pretences of <hi>Religious Zeal,</hi> to commit ſuch <hi>Impieties</hi> as modeſt <hi>Heathens,</hi> nay even ſome <hi>Atheiſts</hi> would bluſh at, and be aſhamed to be guilty of.</p>
               <p>Nor is it for one tranſient Act that we accuſe them, but it is the eternal inſeparable Miſchiefs and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe Principles of Separation which we are for ever to dread; for aſſoon ſhall the Ocean quit its treacherous inſtability, and forget to Rage and Foam, and overthrow all its Banks upon the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of every impetuous Tempeſt, as theſe Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Principles ceaſe to be dangerous to the Peace and Repoſe of Mankind, or the ſafety of Government. Aſſoon, nay ſooner ſhall we ſee Lyons and Tygers, Wolves and Panthers become as tame, harmleſs and ſerviceable as our domeſtick Animals, as ſee their ſavage Principles permit thoſe who come to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with them, continue to be <hi>Innocent</hi> longer then they are <hi>Impotent</hi>: For <hi>Rebellion</hi> with its portentous Retinue, is as naturally included in <hi>Separation</hi> as Fire in a Flint, and though it may ſleep there ſo as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Ignorant, who never beleive there is fire but when their fingers are burnt, it will alwayes be ready upon the Summons of Steel to ſhew it ſelf; and the Tinder Conſcience of Diſſenters is as obedient as Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, to catch every Spark of Rebellion that falls into it, and improve it into a Combuſtion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration both of Church and State.</p>
               <p>Now though Sovereign Princes have the greateſt Stake in this World, their Crowns and Scepters, their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100519:105"/>
Dignity, Lives and Honour, all which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly in hazzard, where theſe Principles prevail; and therefore it would be a fooliſh preſumption to think they do not know their own Intereſt, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Arrogance and Vanity to pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and inſtruct them; yet ſince they can never ſuffer alone, and that Private perſons of all Ranks, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Qualities, have Life, Liberty and Eſtates, which if their Poſſeſſors be Loyal, cannot avoid run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame courſe with the fortune of their Prince: Nay even thoſe who propoſe to themſelves the greateſt advantages in Rebellion, ſhould it prove ſucceſsful, in the Concluſion are like to be the greateſt Loſers, the gains which they ſhall make by ſuch Godlineſs, being the loſs of their Souls and Bodies, Heaven and Eternal Happineſs: Certainly it is the True intereſt of all <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> even for their own ſecurity and preſervation, to endeavour to ſuppreſs the further growth and progreſs of their pernicious Principles of <hi>Separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it leſs the intereſt of the Diſſenters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to abandon thoſe Diſloyal and Ruinous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Practices and Opinions, which are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the Peace, Happineſs and Proſperity of this <hi>Nation</hi>; and by a timely repentance to attone Heaven for the former Guilt, and moſt eſpecially that of the Blood of this <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> which as it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lies at their Door, ſo it cryes aloud in the Ears of the Almighty Avenger of Blood for Vengance; and let them be aſſured, that though hand joyn in hand, it ſhall not go unpuniſhed, if they continue obſtinately impenitent. Nay their Confederacies and Common Union againſt the King and the Church, will be their ruine, and their <hi>Aſſociating</hi> themſelves in the Cloſeſt Conſpiracies, will be but the <hi>Prologue</hi> to their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then that they may be broken in pieces: and truly if they were not infatuated to deſtruction, they could not but ſee the Miraculouſly Viſible effects of Providence in the wonderous repeated Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100519:105"/>
of his Majeſtyes Sacred Perſon, this Church and Monarchy from ſo many attempts, and Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enterprizes of all their implacable Enemies: And if they do ſee all this, and will notwithſtanding Run upon their own deſtruction, and the very mouth of Hell charged with Damnation, ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Rage, as it renders them more formidable, ſo ought it to render all honeſt Loyal Perſons more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and cautious againſt them; and to inſpire them with the ſame, but more Noble <hi>Zeal</hi> to ſave their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from Ruine, with which their Enemies are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to ſeek its Deſtruction; and though <hi>Charity</hi> for them, commands us to pity them, yet that true <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which begins at home, does at the ſame time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to preſerve our ſelves, as we would do from <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Tygers,</hi> and other Furious Beaſts of Prey, who are ready to devour us.</p>
               <p>I know this naked Expoſure of theſe Men and Principles, will expoſe me to the Rage, and entitle me to the Revenge of the Party; but if I have abuſed them, if I have miſrepreſented them, if I have traduced them, or if they are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of Fiction or Falſhood, let them do it; I beg no Quarter, no Mercy from them; but if what I have written be Truth, <hi>Magna est Veritas, &amp; praevalebit,</hi> I cannot fear the Rage neither of Men nor Devils; but muſt let them know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that it will to their eternal Horror, Shame and Confuſion, ſtand the Teſt and abide the Tryal of the God of Truth, to whoſe infallible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal and definitive Sentence I ſubmit my ſelf; and let but the moſt angry of the Faction ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in retired thoughts, ſtate themſelves, their Principles and Actions, as they muſt one day, as if they were before the Almighty Judge, and I perſwade my ſelf, they would find occaſion to return me Thanks for my ſevere Truths, rather than to any of their Deluders for their dangerous Flattery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:100519:106"/>Be it as it will, <hi>liberavi Animam</hi>; I waſh my Hands of all the Miſeries and Miſchiefs which for want of <hi>Precaution,</hi> may happen either to, or from thoſe of the <hi>Separation,</hi> by reaſon of theſe horrible Poſitions, Principles and Practices.</p>
