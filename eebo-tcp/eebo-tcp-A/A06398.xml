            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>False-hearted man adue, quoth she,</l>
                  <l>disloyall and unkind,</l>
                  <l>And if I dye for love of thée,</l>
                  <l>thou shalt not know my mind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Woe to the time I did beléeve,</l>
                  <l>that flattering looke of thine,</l>
                  <l>Would God that I had never séene,</l>
                  <l>the teares of thy false eyne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Hard hap had I to set my love,</l>
                  <l>on one that mocked me,</l>
                  <l>Sure all the countrey doth not yéeld,</l>
                  <l>a man so false as he.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus was she brought to weak estate</l>
                  <l>all comforts from her fled,</l>
                  <l>She did desire to speake with him.</l>
                  <l>before that she was dead.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Her friends did séek to chéere her heart</l>
                  <l>and to make glad her mind,</l>
                  <l>But she was kild with loving him,</l>
                  <l>that prov'd to her unkind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>False-hearted man, may never maid</l>
                  <l>love thée as I have done,</l>
                  <l>But may my death remembred be,</l>
                  <l>to time that is to come.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And may all maids example take,</l>
                  <l>by this my mournefull death,</l>
                  <l>And now sweet Lord receive my soule</l>
                  <l>to thee I yeeld my breath.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus dy'd the patterne of true love,</l>
                  <l>thus dy'd a vertuous maid,</l>
                  <l>Thus dy'd as good a harmelesse Lasse</l>
                  <l>as ever Love betray'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Sir maids in white as custome is,</l>
                  <l>did bring her to the grave,</l>
                  <l>Her parents grieve, lament &amp; mourn,</l>
                  <l>no child at all they have.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When as her Lover understood,</l>
                  <l>for truth that she was dead,</l>
                  <l>He rag'd, and ready was to teare</l>
                  <l>his haire from off his head.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But when he came into the towne,</l>
                  <l>whereas his true Loue lay,</l>
                  <l>He straightway ran unto her graue,</l>
                  <l>and these words there did say.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Susan</hi> (quoth he) Ile kisse thy grave,</l>
                  <l>upon my bended knée,</l>
                  <l>Whereby Ile shew to all the world,</l>
                  <l>how deare I loued thée.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And as he lay upon the graue,</l>
                  <l>he heard a voyce to say,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Iohn True</hi> if ere thou lou'dst me deare,</l>
                  <l>make hast and come away.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then started he up from the graue,</l>
                  <l>and stood like one strucke dumb,</l>
                  <l>But when he had regain'd his spéech,</l>
                  <l>he cryed, I come, I come.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus like one out of his wits,</l>
                  <l>he rag'd in piteous sort,</l>
                  <l>That all the neighbours presently,</l>
                  <l>were grieu'd at this report.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus with sorrow &amp; grief of heart,</l>
                  <l>he lay a whole fortnight:</l>
                  <l>But when he had confest his fault,</l>
                  <l>he yéelded up his spright.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>According to his hearts desire,</l>
                  <l>and as he did request,</l>
                  <l>They dig'd his graue, &amp; laid him down</l>
                  <l>by her whom he lou'd best.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>You yong men all that haue true loues</l>
                  <l>proue true unto your friend,</l>
                  <l>And if you loue, be sure your loue</l>
                  <l>be true unto the end.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus I end my story true,</l>
                  <l>so full of griefe and woe.</l>
                  <l>May neuer any séeke againe,</l>
                  <l>to wrong each other so.</l>
