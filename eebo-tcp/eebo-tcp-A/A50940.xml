            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF Men within themſelves would be govern'd by Reaſon, and not generally give up their Underſtandings to a double <hi>Tyranny,</hi> of Cuſtom from without, and blind Affections within, they would diſcern better what it is to favour and uphold the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of a Nation. But being Slaves within Doors, no wonder that they ſtrive ſo much, to have the publick State conformably govern'd to the inward vicious Rule by which they govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for indeed none can love <hi>Freedom</hi> heartily but good Men, the reſt love not <hi>Freedom</hi> but <hi>Licenſe,</hi> which never hath more Scope or greater <hi>Indulgence</hi> than under <hi>Tyrants</hi>: Hence it is that <hi>Tyrants</hi> are not often offended with, nor ſtand much in doubt of bad Men, as being all <hi>naturally Servile,</hi> but in whom Virtue and true Worth is moſt eminent, them they fear in earneſt, as by <hi>right</hi> their <hi>Maſters,</hi> againſt them lies all their Hatred and Suſpicion. Conſequently neither do bad Men hate <hi>Tyrants,</hi> but have been always readieſt, with the falſified Names of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> to colour over their baſe <hi>Servile Compliances.</hi> And although ſometimes for ſhame, and when it comes to their own Grievances of Purſe or Profit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, they would ſeem good <hi>Patriots,</hi> and ſide with the <hi>better Cauſe,</hi> yet when others, for the deliverance of their <hi>Country,</hi> indu'd with Fortitude and Heroick Virtue, to fear nothing but the Curſe againſt thoſe <hi>that do the work of the Lord negligently,</hi> Jer. 48.10. would go on to remove not only the Calamities and Thraldoms of a <hi>People,</hi> but the Roots and Cauſes whence they ſpring; ſtraight theſe Men, as if they hated the <hi>Miſeries,</hi> but not the <hi>Miſchiefs,</hi> after they have Juggled and paltred with the World, reflected on their <hi>King,</hi> and provok'd Perſons to bear Arms againſt him; nay, forc'd him to fly the Land, and curs'd him all over it, to the engaging of ſincere and real Men beyond what is poſſible or honeſt to retreat from; not only turn <hi>Revolters</hi> from thoſe Principles which only could at firſt move them, but lay the ſtain of <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> and worſe, on thoſe Proceedings, which juſt before, themſelves ſeem'd to deſire and promote, and which are the neceſſary Conſequences of their own late Actions; nor would they now perhaps ſhew any diſlike to, did they not fear they will not be managed intirely to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of their own <hi>Faction,</hi> not conſidering the while, that he, toward whom they would boaſt their reviv'd and almoſt loſt <hi>Loyalty,</hi>

counts them <hi>acceſſary,</hi> and will, if ever he gets Power, by thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> which they have frequently and inhumanly <hi>brandiſh'd</hi> againſt others, <hi>doom</hi> them to the death of <hi>Traytors,</hi> for what they have done already.</p>
            <p>Others there are too, who not long ago ſeem'd fierce againſt their <hi>King,</hi> under the juſt Notions of a <hi>Tyrant, an Jncroacher on the Rights of the People, a Diſpencer with the Laws, and a Promoter of all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and Illegal Actions</hi>; Yet when <hi>God,</hi> out of his merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſingular Love, hath deliver'd him over to follow ſuch <hi>Councils</hi> and Methods, as have induc'd him to rid us of ſuch an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Publick Good</hi> as himſelf was, on a ſudden, and in a new Garb of <hi>Allegiance</hi> (which their late doings ſeem'd to have cancel'd) plead for him, pitty him, extol him, and proteſt againſt thoſe that talk of <hi>Excluding</hi> him from the <hi>Government</hi> of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> which by his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Actings he has juſtly <hi>Forfeited.</hi> But certainly if we conſider who, and what theſe are, on a ſudden grown ſo pittiful; we may conclude their pitty can be no True and Chriſtian Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, but either Lenity or Shallowneſs of Mind, or elſe a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal admiring of that Worldly Pomp and Greatneſs from whence they ſee him fallen; or rather, laſtly, a <hi>diſſembled and Seditious Pitty, feigned of Induſtry to beget new Commotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Mercy, if it be to a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> undoubtedly it is the Mercy of Wicked Men, and their Mercies (we read) are Cruelties, who would <hi>hazard</hi> the <hi>Wellfare</hi> of a whole <hi>Nation</hi> to ſave him, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than have fail'd in the <hi>Accompliſhment</hi> of his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Deſigns</hi> (had it lain in his Power) would have ſet the whole <hi>World</hi> on <hi>Fire.</hi> There is yet another ſort, who coming in the courſe of their Affairs, or by choice of the <hi>People,</hi> to have a ſhare in great great Actions now in Agitation, at leaſt to give their Voice and Approbation therein, begin to <hi>ſwerve</hi> and almoſt ſhiver at the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> and <hi>Grandeur of this Noble Deed,</hi> as if they were newly entered into a great Sin, diſputing <hi>Preſidents, Forms and Circumſtances,</hi> when the Commonwealth nigh Periſhes for want of Deeds in Subſtance, done with juſt and faithful Expedition. To theſe I wiſh better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Virtue equal to their Calling; the former of which (that is to ſay Inſtruction) I ſhall endeavour, as my duty is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on them; but conſidering what Attempts are daily made to withdraw the <hi>Nation</hi> from their <hi>Duty,</hi> and cauſe them to miſtake their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> I will crave leave briefly to exhort them all not to ſtart from the neceſſary, juſt, and pious Reſolution, of adhering

Neither let mild and tender Diſpoſitions be Fooliſhly ſoftened from their Duty and Perſeverance, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſculine Rhetorick of any puling Prieſt, Chaplain, or Prelate, either in their Pulpits (which have conſtantly been made the place whence Revilings and Curſes, inſtead of Chriſtian Doctrine and Exhortations, have been paſſionately emitted) or in their Papers, pretended to be ſent as Friendly Letters of Advice; or the like, for faſhion-ſake in private, and forthwith publiſh'd by the Sender himſelf, that we may know how much of Friend there was in it, to caſt an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Envy on him, to whom it was pretended to be ſent in Charity.</p>
            <p>Nor laſtly, Let any man be deluded by either the Ignorance, or notorious Hypocriſie, and Self-repugnance of ſome of our Dancing Clergy, who have the Conſcience and the Boldneſs to come with Scripture in their Mouths, gloſ'd and fitted for their turns, with a double contradictory Senſe; transforming the Sacred Verity of God to an Idol with two Faces, looking at once two ſeveral ways, and with Quotations to charge others, which in the ſame Cauſe, they have at other times made ſerve to juſtifie themſelves; for, while the hopes to have that unlawful and unlimited Power, which their late Kings gave them (as finding them the moſt fit and chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſerve their Arbitrary ends) continued to them by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Powers led them on, then to Write and Fight againſt the Kings Party was Lawful, it was no reſiſting of Superior Powers, they only were Powers not to be, reſiſted, who countenanc'd the Good, and puniſh'd the Evil: But now that they are (we hope) juſtly afraid their unſufferable and unchriſtian Domineering, Perſecuting, Lordly Power will be abridg'd and taken away, and themſelves depriv'd of thoſe vaſt Revenues which the moſt of them conſume Riotouſly,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94894:4"/>
and Pluralities to be now no more, now to talk of bringing all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents</hi> without Exception or Exemption to a fair Tryal, is to be no leſs than <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> He, who but ere while was induſtriouſly by them reported to be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> an enemy to <hi>Cod,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of People,</hi> is now (though not one jot more Penitent, or altered from his Principles) a Lawful Magiſtrate, a Sovereign Lord, the Lords Anointed, not to be touch'd, though by themſelves forc'd to fly. Good God! what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, what Folly and Madneſs poſſeſſes the Breaſts of this People, to what a miſerable Slavery would they lead us, and how fond and eager do they ſeem, to have him rule over us, who (like the Stork in the Fable) has, and would make it his greateſt delight, to devour the beſt of Free-born Subjects? But hoping all their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, to bring us to our old Slavery, will be blaſted, and that their eagerneſs in proſecuting them, will make us the more reſolv'd to confound both them and their Devices, I ſhall leave this Subject, and (according to my promiſe) endeavour to give ſuitable Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on to thoſe laſt and fearful ſort of People I mentioned but now. To begin then, who in particular is a Tyrant, cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd in a general Diſcourſe, otherwiſe than by Suppoſition, his particular charge, and the ſufficient proof of it muſt determine that, which I leave to Magiſtrates, at leaſt to the uprighter ſort of them, and of the People (though in number leſs by many) thoſe in whom Faction and Intereſt leaſt have prevailed above the Law of Nature and right Reaſon, to judge as they find: But this I dare own as part of my Faith, that if ſuch a one there be, by whoſe Commiſſion Cities have been burnt, Royal Relations Murther'd, Multitudes of Innocent Subjects Butcher'd, Nobles taken off by Sham-Plots, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Perjuries or Maſſacres; part of his Kingdom promiſed as their ſhare, whom he had ſollicited to help him to deſtroy his Proteſtant Subjects, and an Impoſtor put on the Nation to deprive the next Heir of the Crown; I ſay if ſuch a one there is, be he <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> or <hi>Emperor,</hi> the Sword of Juſtice is above him, in whoſe hand ſoever is found ſufficient Power to avenge the Effuſion of ſo much Innocent Blood, and thoſe other unſpeakable wicked Tyrannies.</p>
            <p>For if all Humane Power to execute, not accidentally but intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, the Wrath of God upon Evil Doers without Exception, be of God; then that Power, whether Ordinary, or if that fail, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, ſo executing that intent of God is lawful, and not to be reſiſted. But to unfold more at large this whole Queſtion, though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94894:4"/>
with all expedient Brevity, I ſhall here ſet down, from the firſt beginning, the Original of <hi>Kings</hi>; how and wherefore exalted to that Dignity above their <hi>Brethren</hi>; and from thence ſhall prove, that turning to <hi>Tyranny</hi> they may be as lawfully Depos'd and Puniſh'd, as they were at firſt Elected: This I ſhall do by Authorities and Reaſons, not learn'd among Schiſms and Hereſies, as our doubting Divines are ready to calumniate, but fetch'd out of the midſt of choiceſt and authentick Learning, and no prohibited, nor many Heathen, but Moſaical, Chriſtian, and Orthodoxal Authors.</p>
            <p>No man that knows any thing, can be ſo ſtupid to deny, that all men naturally were born Free, being the Image and reſemblance of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and were by Priviledge above all the Creatures, born to command, and not to obey; and that they lived ſo, till from the root of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, falling among themſelves to do Wrong and Violence, and foreſeeing that ſuch courſes muſt needs tend to the deſtruction of them all, they agreed by <hi>common League,</hi> to bind each other from mutual Injury, and joyntly to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt any that gave diſturbance or oppoſition to ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Hence come Cities, Towns and Commonwealths. And becauſe no Faith <hi>in all</hi> was found ſufficiently binding, they ſaw it needful to ordain ſome Authority, that might reſtrain by Force and Puniſhment, what was violated againſt Peace and common Right: The Authority and Power of Self-defence and Preſervation, being originally and naturally in every one of them, and united in them all, for eaſe and for order. And, left each man ſhould be his own partial Judge, they communicated and derived either to one, whom for the eminency of his Wiſdom and Integrity they choſe above the reſt, or to more than one, whom they thought of equal deſerving: The firſt was called a <hi>King,</hi> the other <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> Not to be their <hi>Lords and Maſters</hi> (though afterwards thoſe Names in ſome places, were given voluntarily to ſuch as had been Authors of ineſtimable good to the People) but, to be their Deputies and Commiſſioners, to execute by virtue of their intruſted Power, that Juſtice which elſe every Man, by the Bond of Nature and of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, muſt have executed for himſelf, and for one another. And to him that ſhall conſider well, why among Free Perſons, one Man by civil Right ſhould bear Authority and Juriſdiction over another, no other end or reaſon can be imaginable. Theſe, for a while, governed well, and with much Equity decided all things at their own Arbitrement; till the Temptation of ſuch a Power left abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94894:5"/>
in their hands, perverted them at length to injuſtice and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Then did they who now by tryal had found the danger and inconveniencies of committing Arbitrary Power to any, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Laws either framed or conſented to by all, that ſhould confine and limit the Authority of whom they choſe to govern them: that ſo man, of whoſe failing they had proof, might no more rule over them, but Law and Reaſon abſtracted as much as might be from perſonal Errors and Frailties. When this would not ſerve, but that the Law was either not executed, or miſapplied, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from that time, the only Remedy left them, to put Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and take Oaths from all <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> at their firſt Inſtallment, to do impartial Juſtice by Law; who upon thoſe terms and no other, received Allegiance from the People, that is to ſay, Bond or Covenant, to obey them in Execution of thoſe Laws which they the People had themſelves made or aſſented to. And this often times with expreſs warning, that if the King or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate proved unfaithful to his Truſt, the People would be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. They added alſo <hi>Counſellors</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> not to be only at his beck, but with him or without him, at ſet times, or at all times, when any Danger threatned, to have care of the Publick Safety. Therefore, ſaith <hi>Claudius Seſell</hi> a French Stateſman, <hi>The Parliament was ſet as a bridle to the King</hi>; which I inſtance rather, becauſe that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is granted by all to be a far more Abſolute than ours. That this and the reſt of what hath hitherto been ſpoken, is moſt true, might be copiouſly made appear throughout all Stories Heathen and Chriſtian, even of thoſe Nations where Kings and Emperors have ſought means to aboliſh all Ancient Memory of the Peoples Right, by their Encroachments and Uſurpations. But I ſpare long Inſertions, appealing to the German, French, Italian, Arragonian, Engliſh, and not leaſt the Scottiſh Hiſtories: Not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting this only by the way, that <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> though a pretended Conqueror, and not unſworn at his Coronation, was compelled a ſecond time to take Oath at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> ere the People would be brought to yield Obedience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It being thus manifeſt that the Power of Kings and Magiſtrates is nothing elſe, but what is only derivative, transferr'd and committed to them in truſt from the People to the common good of them all, in whom the Power yet remains Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally, and canot be taken from them, without a violation of their natural Birth-right: And ſeeing that from hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94894:5"/>
the beſt of Political Writers have defin'd a King, him who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns to the good and profit of his People, and not for his own ends, it follows from neceſſary cauſes, that the Titles of Soveraign Lord, Natural Lord, and the like, are either Arrogancies or Flatteries, not admitted by Emperors and Kings of beſt Note, and diſliked by the Church both of Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.13. and ancient Chriſtians, as appears by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others. Although generally the People of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and with them the Jews alſo, eſpecially ſince the time they choſe a King, againſt the advice and counſel of God, are noted by wiſe Authors much inclinable to Slavery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That to ſay, as is uſual, the King hath as good right to his Crown and Dignity as any Man to his Inheritance, is to make the Subject no better than the King's Slave, his Chattel or his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion that may be bought and ſold: And doubtleſs, if hereditary Title were ſufficiently enquired, the beſt Foundation of it would be found but either in Courteſie or Convenience. But ſuppoſe it to be of right hereditary, what can be more juſt and legal, if a Subject for certain Crimes, be to forfeit by Law from himſelf and Poſterity, all his Inheritance to the King, than that a King for Crimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional, ſhould forfeit all his Title and Inheritance to the People, unleſs the People muſt be thought Created all for him, he not for them, and they all in one Body Inferior to him ſingle; which were a kind of Treaſon againſt the dignity of Mankind to affirm.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It follows, that to ſay Kings are accountable to none but God, is the overturning of all Law and Government. For if they may refuſe to give account, then all Covenants made with them at Coronation; all Oaths are in vain, and meer Mockeries; all Laws which they ſwear to keep, made to no purpoſe; for if the King fear not God, (as how many of them do not?) We hold then our Lives and Eſtates, by the tenure of his meer Grace and Mercy, as from a God, not a mortal Magiſtrate; a poſition that none but Court Paraſites or Men Beſotted would maintain. And no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince not drunk with high mind, and prouder than thoſe Pagan <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that Deifi'd themſelves, would arrogate ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably above human condition, or derogate ſo baſely from a whole Nation of Men his Brethren, as if for him only ſubſiſting, and to ſerve his Glory, valuing them in compariſon of his own brute will and pleaſure, no more than ſo many Beaſts or Vermin under his feet, not to be reaſoned with, but to be injur'd among whom there might be found ſo many thouſand men, for Wiſdom, Vertue, noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94894:6"/>
of mind, and other reſpects, but the fortune of his Dignity, of above him. Yet ſome would perſwade us, that this abſurd opinion was King <hi>David</hi>'s; becauſe in the 51 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he crys out to God, <hi>Againſt thee only have I Sinned</hi>; as if <hi>David</hi> had imagined, that to Murther <hi>Uriah</hi> and Adulterate his Wife, had been no ſin againſt his Neighbour, when as that Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to the King expreſly; <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. not to think ſo highly of himſelf above his Brethren. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> therefore by thoſe words, could mean no other, than either that the depth of his guiltineſs was known to God only, or to ſo few as had not the will or power to queſtion him, or that the ſin againſt God was greater beyond compare, than againſt <hi>Uriah.</hi> What ever his meaning were, any wiſe Man will ſee, that the pathetical words of a Pſalm can be no certain deciſion to a point that hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more certain rules to go by. How much more rationally ſpake the Heathen King <hi>Demophoon,</hi> in a Tragedy of <hi>Enripides,</hi> than theſe Interpreters would put upon King <hi>David; I rule not my People by Tyranny, as if they were Barbarians, but am my ſelf liable, if I do unjuſtly, to ſuffer juſtly.</hi> Not unlike was the Speech of <hi>Trajan</hi> the worthy Emperor, to one whom he made General of his Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Forces. Take this drawn Sword, ſaith he, to uſe for me, if I Reign well, if not, to uſe againſt me. Thus <hi>Dion</hi> relates, and not <hi>Trajan</hi> only. But <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, a Chriſtian Emperor, and one of the beſt, cauſed it to be Enacted as a rule undeniable, and fit to be acknowledged by all Kings and Emperors, That a Prince is bound to the Laws; that on the Authority of Law the Authority of a Prince depends, and to the Laws ought to ſubmit. Which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of his remains yet unrepealed in the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Juſtinian, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 24. as a ſacred Conſtitution to all the Succeeding Emperors. How then can any King in <hi>Europe</hi> maintain and write himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to none but God, when Emperors in their own Imperial Statutes, have written and decreed themſelves accountable to Law. And indeed where ſuch account is not fear'd, he that bids a Man Reign over him above Law, may bid as well a Savage Beaſt.</p>
            <p>It follows laſtly, That the King or Magiſtrate holds his Authority of the People, both Originally and Naturally, for their good in the firſt Place, and not his own; then may the People as oft as they ſhall judge it for the beſt, either chuſe him, or reject him, retain him, or depoſe him, though no <hi>Tyrant,</hi> meerly by the Liberty and Right of free-born Men, to be Govern'd as ſeems to them beſt. This, though it cannot but ſtand with plain reaſon, ſhall be made good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94894:6"/>
alſo by Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. <hi>When thou art come into the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, like as all the Nations about me.</hi> Theſe words confirm us, that the right of chooſing, yea of changing their own Government, is by the Grant of God himſelf in the People. And therefore when they deſired a King, though then under another form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and though their changing diſpleaſed him, yet he that was himſelf their King, and rejected by them, would not be a hindrance to what they intended, further than by perſwaſion, but that they might do therein as they ſaw good, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. only he reſerv'd to himſelf the nomination of who ſhould Reign over them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did that exempt the King as if he were to God only accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, though by his eſpecial command Anointed. Therefore <hi>David firſt made a Covenant with the Elders of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſo was by them anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. And <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> the Prieſt, making <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> King, made a Covenant between him and the People, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 11.17. Therefore, when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> at his coming to the Crown, rejected thoſe conditions which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought him; hear what they anſwer him, <hi>What portion have we in</hi> David, <hi>or Inheritance in the Son of</hi> Jeſſe? <hi>See to thine own houſe</hi> David. And for the like conditions not perform'd, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> before that time, Depoſed <hi>Samuel</hi>; not for his own default, but for the miſgovernment of his Sons. But ſome will ſay to both theſe Examples, it was evilly done. I anſwer, that not the latter, becauſe it was expreſly allow'd them in the Law to ſet up a King if they pleas'd; and God himſelf joyn'd with them in the Work; though in ſome ſort it was at that time diſpleaſing to him, in reſpect of old <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had govern'd them uprightly. As <hi>Livy</hi> praiſes the Romans who took occaſion from <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> a wicked Prince, to gain their Liberty, which to have extorted ſaith he, from <hi>Numa</hi> or any of the good Kings before, had not been ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. Nor was it in the former Example done unlawfully; for when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had prepar'd a huge Army to reduce the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he was forbidden by the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your Brethren, for this thing is from me.</hi> He calls them their Brethren, not Rebels, and forbids to be proceeded againſt them, owning the thing himſelf; not by ſingle Providence, but by approbation, and that not only of the Act, as in the former Example, but of the fit Seaſon alſo; he had not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe forbid to moleſt them. And thoſe grave and wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors whom <hi>Rehoboam</hi> firſt advis'd with, ſpake no ſuch thing, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94894:7"/>
our old gray headed Flatterers now are wont; ſtand upon your Birth-right, ſcorn to capitulate, you hold of God, and not of them; for they know no ſuch matter, unleſs conditionally, but gave him politick Counſel, as in a civil Tranſaction. Therefore Kingdom and Magiſtracy, whether Supream or Subordinate, is called <hi>a human Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which we are there taught, is the will of God, we ſhould ſubmit to, ſo far as for the puniſhment of Evil doers, and the encouragement of them that do well. <hi>Submit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as Free-men.</hi> And <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. as much as to ſay, God put it into mans heart to find out that way at firſt, for common Peace and Preſervation, approving the exerciſe thereof; elſe it contradicts <hi>Peter,</hi> who calls the ſame Authority an Ordinance of Man. It muſt be alſo underſtood of Lawful and Juſt Power, elſe we read of great power in the Affairs and Kingdoms of the World permitted to the Devil: For ſaith he to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.6. <hi>All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them, for it is delivered to me, and to whomſoever I will, I give it:</hi> Neither did he lie, or Chriſt gainſay what he affirm'd: For in the 13. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> we read how the Dragon gave to the Beaſt <hi>his power, his ſeat, and great authority:</hi> Which Beaſt ſo authorized, moſt expound to be the tyrannical Powers and Kingdoms of the Earth. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fore-cited Chapter tells us, that ſuch Magiſtrates, he means, as are not a terror to the good, but to the evil, ſuch as bear not the Sword in vain, but to puniſh Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to encourage the Good. If ſuch only be mentioned here as powers to be obeyed, and our ſubmiſſion to them only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, then doubtleſs thoſe powers that do the contrary, are no powers ordained of God, and by conſequence no obligation laid upon us to obey, or not to reſiſt them. And it may be well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that both theſe Apoſtles, when ever they give this Precept, expreſs it in terms not <hi>concret,</hi> but <hi>abſtract,</hi> as Logicians are wont to ſpeak, that is, they mention the Ordinance, the Power, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority before the Perſons that execute it, and what that power is, left we ſhould be deceived; they deſcribe exactly. So that if the power be not ſuch, or the Perſon execute not ſuch power, neither the one nor the other is of God, but of the Devil, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be Reſiſted. From this expoſition <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> alſo on the ſame Place diſſents not, explaining, that theſe words were not written in behalf of a Tyrant. And this is verified by <hi>David,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a King, and likelieſt to be Author of the, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94.20. which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94894:7"/>
ſaith, <hi>Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowſhip with thee</hi>? And it were worth the knowing, ſince Kings, and that by Scripture, boaſt the juſtneſs of their Title, by holding it immediately of God, yet cannot ſhew the time when God ever ſet on the Throne them or their Forefathers, but only when the People choſe them; why, by the ſame reaſon, ſince God aſcribes as often to himſelf the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of Princes from the Throne, it ſhould not be thought as Lawful, and as much from God, when none are ſeen to do it but the People, and that for juſt Cauſes. <hi>For if it needs muſt be a ſin in them to Depoſe, it may as likely be a ſin to have Elected.</hi> And Contrary, if the Peoples Act in Election be pleaded by a King, as the Act of God, and the moſt juſt Title to Enthrone him, why may not the Peoples Act of Rejection be as well pleaded by the People, as the Act of God, and the moſt juſt Reaſon of Depoſe him? So that we ſee the Title and juſt Right of Reigning or Depoſing, in reference to God, is found in Scripture to be all one; viſible only in the People, and depending meerly upon Juſtice and Demerit. Thus far hath been conſidered briefly the Power of Kings and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, how it was, and is originally the Peoples, and by them conferred in Truſt only to be imployed to the common Peace and Benefit; with Liberty therefore and Right remaining in them to reaſſume it to themſelves, if by Kings and Magiſtrates it be abus'd; or to diſpoſe of it by any Alteration, as they ſhall judge moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>We may from hence, with more eaſe and force of Argument, determine what a Tyrant is, and what the People may do againſt him. A Tyrant, whether by wrong or by right coming to the Crown, is he who regarding neither Law nor the Common Good, Reigns only for himſelf and his Faction: Thus St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> among others, defines him. And becauſe his Power is great, his Will bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and exorbitant, the fulfilling whereof is for the moſt part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with innumerable Wrongs and Oppreſſions of the People, Murders, Maſſacres, Rapes, Adulteries, Deſolation, and Subverſion of Cities and whole Provinces; look how great a good and happineſs a Juſt King is, ſo great a Miſchief is a Tyrant; as he the publick Father of his Country, ſo this the Common Enemy; againſt whom, what the People lawfully may do, as againſt a common Peſt, and deſtroyer of Mankind, I ſuppoſe no Man of clear judgment need go farther to be guided, than by the very Principles of Nature in him. But becauſe it is the Vulgar Folly of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94894:8"/>
Men to deſert their own Reaſon, and ſhutting their Eyes, to think they ſee beſt with other Mens, I ſhall ſhew by ſuch Examples as ought to have moſt weight with us, what hath been done in this caſe heretofore. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as their prime Authors witneſs, held it not only lawful, but a Glorious and Heroick Deed, rewarded publickly with Statues and Garlands, to kill an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Tyrant at any time without tryal; and but reaſon, that he who trod down all Law, ſhould not be vouchſafed the benefit of Law. Inſomuch that <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian brings in <hi>Hercules</hi> the grand Suppreſſor of Tyrants, thus ſpeaking,</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>—Victima haud ulla amplior</l>
                  <l>Poteſt, magiſque opima mactari Jovi</l>
                  <l>Quàm Rex iniquus—</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>—There can be ſlain</l>
                  <l>No Sacrifice to God more acceptable</l>
                  <l>Than an unjuſt and wicked King—</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>But of theſe I name no more, leſt it be objected they were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and come to produce another ſort of Men that had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true Religion. Amongſt the Jews this Cuſtom of Tyrant-killing was not unuſual. Firſt, <hi>Ehud,</hi> a Man whom God had raiſed to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ruled over them eighteen years, being ſent to him as an Ambaſſador with a Preſent, ſlew him in his own Hoaſe. But he was a Forreign Prince, an Enemy, and <hi>Ehud</hi> beſides had ſpecial warrant from God. To the firſt I anſwer, it imports not whether Forreign or Native, for no Prince ſo Native, but profeſſes to hold by Law, which when he himſelf overturns, breaking all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Oaths that gave him Title to his Dignity, and were the Bond and Alliance between him and his People, what differs he from an Outlandiſh King or from an Enemy? For look how much Right the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath to govern us at all, ſo much Right hath the King of <hi>England</hi> to govern us Tyrannically. If he, though not bound to us by any League, coming from <hi>Spain</hi> in Perſon to ſubdue us, or to deſtroy us, might lawfully, by the People of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> either be ſlain in Fight, or put to Death in Captivity, what hath a Native King to plead, bound by ſo many Covenants, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Honours to the wellfare of his People, why he through the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94894:8"/>
contempt of all Laws and Parliaments, the only tye of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, for his own wills ſake, and a boaſted Prerogative unaccountable, after unſpeakable Damages done by him to the People of <hi>Great Britain</hi> for theſe many years, and being now fled to our greateſt Enemy, ſhould think to ſcape unqueſtionable, as a thing Divine, in reſpect of whom ſo great a number of Chriſtians deſtroy'd ſhould lye unaccounted for, polluting with their ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Carcaſſes all the Land over, and crying for Vengeance againſt the Living that ſhould have righted them. Who knows not that there is a mutual Bond of Amity and Brotherhood between Man and Man over all the World, neither is it the Engliſh Sea that can ſever us from that Duty and Relation: A ſtraiter Bond yet there is between Fellow-ſubjects, Neighbours, and Friends: But when any of theſe do one to another ſo as Hoſtility could do no worſe, what doth the Law Decree leſs againſt them, than open Enemies and Invaders? Or if the Law be not preſent, or too weak, what doth it warrant us to leſs than ſingle Defence or Civil War? and from that time forward the Law of civil defenſive War differs nothing from the Law of Forreign Hoſtility. Nor is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place that makes Enmity, but Enmity that makes diſtance. He therefore that keeps Peace with me near or remote of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Nation, is to me as far as all Civil and Human Offices an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> and a Neighbour; but if an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> forgetting all Laws, Humane, Civil and Religious, offend againſt Life and Liberty, to him offend and to the Law in his behalf, though born in the ſame Womb, he is no better than a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Saracen,</hi> a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> This is Goſpel, and this was ever Law among Equals, how much rather then in Force againſt any King whatſoever, who in reſpect of the People is confeſs'd Inferior and not Equal: to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh therefore of a Tyrant by Outlandiſh or Domeſtick, is a weak Evaſion. To the ſecond, That he was an Enemy, I anſwer, what Tyrant is not? Yet <hi>Eglon</hi> by the Jews had been acknowledged as their Sovereign, they had ſerved him eighteen years, as long almoſt as we our <hi>William</hi> the pretended Conqueror, in all which time he could not be ſo unwiſe a Stateſman, but to have taken of them Oaths of Fealty and Allegiance, by which they made themſelves his proper Subjects, as their Homage and Preſent ſent by <hi>Ehud</hi> teſtified. To the Third, That he had ſpecial Warrant to kill <hi>Eglon</hi> in that manner, it cannot be granted, becauſe not expreſſed; it is plain that he was raiſed by God to be a Deliverer, and went
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94894:9"/>
on juſt Principles, ſuch as were then and ever held allowable, to deal ſo by a Tyrant that could no otherwiſe be dealt with. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Samuel,</hi> though a Prophet, with his own hand abſtain from <hi>Agag,</hi> a Forreign Enemy no doubt, but mark the reaſon, <hi>As thy Sword hath made women childleſs</hi>; a cauſe that by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Law it ſelf, nullifies all Relations. And as the Law is between Brother and Brother, Father and Son, Maſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, wherefore not between King, or rather Tyrant and People? And whereas <hi>Jehu</hi> had ſpecial command to ſlay <hi>Jeboram</hi> a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and Hereditary Tyrant, it ſeems not the leſs imitable for that; for where a thing grounded ſo much on natural reaſon, hath the addition of a command from God, what does it but eſtabliſh the lawfulneſs of ſuch an Act. Nor is it likely that God, who had ſo many ways of puniſhing the Houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> would have ſent a Subject againſt his Prince, if the Fact in it ſelf, as done to a Tyrant, had been of bad Example. And if <hi>David</hi> refuſed to lift his hand againſt the Lords Anointed, the matter between them was not Tyranny, but private Enmity, and <hi>David,</hi> as a private Perſon, had been his own Revenger, not ſo much the Peoples; but when any Tyrant at this day can ſhew to be the Lords Annointed, the only mentioned reaſon why <hi>David</hi> withheld his hand, he may then, but not till then, preſume on the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
            <p>We may paſs therefore hence to Chriſtian times. And firſt our Saviour himſelf, how much he favour'd Tyrants, and how much intended they ſhould be found or honour'd among Chriſtians, declares his mind not obſcurely; accounting their abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority no better than Gentiliſm; yea, though they flouriſh'd it over with the ſplendid name of Benefactors; charging thoſe that would be his Diſciples to uſurp no ſuch dominion; but that they who were to be of moſt Authority among them, ſhould eſteem themſelves Miniſters and Servants to the Publick. <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.25. <hi>The Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them</hi>; and <hi>Mark</hi> 10.42. <hi>They that ſeem to Rule,</hi> ſaith he, either ſlighting or accounting them no lawful Rulers; <hi>but ye ſhall not be ſo, but the greateſt among you ſhall be your Servant.</hi> And although he himſelf were the meekeſt, and came on Earth to be ſo, yet to a Tyrant we hear him not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe and humble word: But, <hi>Tell that Fox, Luke</hi> 13. And wherefore: did his Mother the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> give ſuch praiſe to God in her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Song, that he had now by the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Cut down
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94894:9"/>
Dynaſta's or proud Monarchs from the Throne</hi>; if the Church when God manifeſts his power in them to do ſo, ſhould rather chooſe all miſery and vaſſalage to ſerve them, and let them ſtill ſit on their potent Seats, to be Ador'd for doing Miſchief. Surely it is not for nothing that Tyrants by a kind of natural inſtinct, both hate and fear none more than the true Church and Saints of God, as the moſt dangerous Enemies and Subverters of Monarchy, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Tyranny: Hath not this been the perpetual cry of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and Court Prelates? whereof no likelier cauſe can be alledg'd but that they well diſcern'd the mind and principles of moſt devout and zealous Men, and indeed the very diſcipline of Church, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſſolution of all Tyranny. No marvel then if ſince the faith of Chriſt receiv'd in purer or impurer times, to Depoſe a King and put him to Death for Tyranny, hath been accounted ſo juſt and requiſite, that neighbour Kings have both upheld and taken part with Subjects in the Action. An <hi>Ludovicus Pius,</hi> himſelf an Emperor, and Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, being made Judge, (<hi>Du Haillan</hi> is my Author) between <hi>Milegaſt</hi> King of the <hi>Vultzes</hi> and his Subjects, who had depos'd him, gave his Verdict for the Subjects, and for him whom they had choſen in his room. Note here, that the right of Electing whom they pleaſe, is by the impartial teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of an Emperor in the People. For, ſaid he, <hi>A juſt Prince ought to be preferr'd before an unjuſt, and the end of Government before the Prerogative.</hi> And <hi>Conſtantinus Leo,</hi> another Emperor in the <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Laws ſaith, <hi>That the end of a King is for the general good which he not performing, is but the counterfeit of a King.</hi> And to prove that, ſome of our own Monarchs have acknowledg'd, that their high Office ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them not from Puniſhment; they had the Sword of St. <hi>Edward</hi> born before them by an Officer, who was called Earl of the Palace, even at the times of their higheſt Pomp and Solemnity, to mind them, ſaith <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> the beſt of our Hiſtorians, that if they err'd, the Sword had power to reſtrain them. And what reſtraint the Sword comes to at length, having both edge and point, if any <hi>Sceptick</hi> will needs doubt, let him feel. It is alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd from diligent ſearch made in our ancient Books of Law, that the Peers and Barons of <hi>England,</hi> had a legal right to judge the King: Which was the cauſe moſt likely, for it could be no ſlight cauſe, that they were call'd his Peers, or Equals. This however may ſtand immovable, ſo long as Man hath to deal with no better than Man; that if our Law judge all Men to the loweſt by their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94894:10"/>
Peers, it ſhould in all Equity aſcend alſo, and judge the Higheſt. And ſo much I find both in our own and Foreign Story, that Dukes, Earls, and Marqueſſes, were at firſt not heriditary, not empty and vain Titles, but names of truſt and office, and with the office ceaſing, as induces me to be of Opinion, that every worthy man in Parliament, for the word Baron imports no more, might for the publick good be thought a fit Peer and judge of the King; without regard had petty Cavears and Circumſtances, the chief impediment in high Affairs, and ever ſtood upon moſt by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial men. Whence doubltleſs our Anceſtors who were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant with what rights either Nature or ancient Conſtitution had endowed them, when Oaths both at Coronation and renew'd in Parliament would not ſerve, thought it no way illegal to Depoſe and put to Death their Tyrannous Kings; inſomuch, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament drew up a Charge againſt <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and the Commons requeſted to have Judgment decree'd againſt him, that the Realm might not be endangered. And <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a Divine of foremoſt rank, on the third of <hi>Judges</hi> approves their doings. Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> alſo, a Proteſtant and States man in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England,</hi> putting the queſtion, Whether it be Lawful to riſe againſt a Tyrant? anſwers, That the Vulgar judge of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the event, and the Learned according to the purpoſe of them that do it, But far before thoſe days, <hi>Gildas</hi> the moſt Ancient of all our Hiſtorians, ſpeaking of thoſe times wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire decaying, quitted and relinquiſh'd what right they had by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to this Iſland, and reſign'd it all into Peoples hands teſtifies that the People thus reinveſted with their own Original Right, about the Year 446, both Elected them Kings, whom they thought beſt; (the firſt Chriſtian <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings that ever Reign'd here ſince the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>) and by the ſame Right, when they apprehended Cauſe, uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Depos'd and put them to Death. This is the moſt fundamental and ancient Tenure that any King of <hi>England</hi> can produce or pretend to; in compariſon of which, all other Titles and Pleas are but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. If any object that <hi>Gildas</hi> condemns the <hi>Britains</hi> for ſo doing, the Anſwer is as ready; that he condemns them no more for ſo doing, than he did before for chuſing ſuch; for ſaith he, <hi>They anointed them Kings; not of God, but ſuch as were more Bloody than the reſt.</hi> Next, he condemns them not at all for Depoſing or putting them to Death, but for doing it over hastily, without Tryal or well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cauſe, and for Electing others worſe in their room. Thus
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94894:10"/>
we have here both Domeſtick and moſt Ancient Examples, that the People of <hi>Britain</hi> have Depoſed and put to Death their Kings in thoſe Primitive Chriſtian times. And to couple Reaſon with Example, if the Church in all Ages, Primitive, Romiſh, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, held it ever no leſs their Duty, than the power of their Keys, though without expreſs warrant of Scripture, to bring indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently both King and Peaſant under the utmoſt rigor of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Cenſures Eccleſiaſtical, even to the ſmiting him with a final Excommunication; if he perſiſt Impenitent, what hinders but the Temporal Law both may and ought, though without a ſpecial Text or Preſident, extend with like indifference the Civil Sword, to the cutting off without exemption, him that capitally offends, ſeeing that Juſtice and Religion are from the ſame God, and works of Juſtice oft-times more acceptable. Yet becauſe ſome of our late <hi>Paſſive Obèdience Men</hi> have wrote, That proceedings againſt Kings are without Preſidents, from any Proteſtant State or Kingdom, I will briefly rehearſe a few (of many) Examples, which ſhall be all Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>In the year 1546. the Duke of <hi>Saxony, Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and the whole Proteſtant League raiſed open War againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth their Emperor, ſent him a Defiance, renounced all Faith and Allegiance toward him, and debated long in Council, whether they ſhould give him ſo much as the Title of <hi>Caeſar. Sleidan l.</hi> 17. Let all Men judge what this wanted of Depoſing or of Killing, but the Power to do it.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1559. the <hi>Scotch</hi> Proteſtants claiming Promiſe of their Queen Regent for Liberty of Conſcience, ſhe anſwering, That Promiſes were not to be claimed of Princes, beyond what was commodious for them to grant; told her to her Face in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then at <hi>Sterling,</hi> that if it were ſo, they renounced their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and ſoon after betook them to Arms. <hi>Buchanan, Hiſt.</hi> l. 16. Certainly when Allegiance is renounced, that very hour the King or Queen is in effect Depoſed.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1564. <hi>John Knox</hi> a moſt Famous Divine, and the Reformer of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at a general Aſſembly, maintained openly in a Diſpute againſt <hi>Lethington</hi> the Secretary of State, that Subjects might and ought execute Gods Judgments upon their King; that the Fact of <hi>Jehu</hi> and others againſt their King, having the Ground of Gods ordinary Command, to put ſuch and ſuch Offenders to Death, was not Extraordinary, but to be imitated of all that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94894:11"/>
the Honour of God to the affection of Fleſh and wicked Princes; that Kings, if they offend, have no Priviledge to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the Puniſhments of Law, more than any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſo that if the King be a Murtherer, Adulterer or Idolater, he ſhould ſuffer not as a King, but as an Offender; This Poſition he repeats again and again before them. Anſwerable was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>John Craig</hi> another Learned Divine; and that Laws made by the Tyranny of Princes, or the Negligence of People, their Poſterity might Abrogate, and Reform all things according to the Original Inſtitution of Commonwealths; and <hi>Knox</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Nobility to write to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Learned Men, for their Judgements in that Queſtion, refuſed; alledging, that both himſelf was fully reſolved in Conſcience, and had heard their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had the ſame opinion under Hand writing of many the moſt Godly, and moſt Learned that he knew in <hi>Europe</hi>; that if he ſhould move the Queſtion to them again, what ſhould he do but ſhew his own Forgetfulneſs and Inconſtancy? All this is far more largely in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Scotland,</hi> lib. 4. with many other Paſſages to this effect all the Book over; ſet out with Diligence, by <hi>Scotch-men,</hi> of beſt Repute among them, to let the World know, that the whole Church, and Proteſtant State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in thoſe pureſt times of Reformation, were of the ſame Belief, three years after, they met in the Field <hi>Mary</hi> their Lawful and Hereditary Queen, took her Priſoner, yielding before Fight, kept her in Priſon, and the ſame year Depoſed her. <hi>Buch. Hiſt.</hi> lib. 18. And four years after that, the <hi>Scots,</hi> in Juſtification of their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in a Written Declaration alledg'd, that they had uſed towards her more Lenity than ſhe deſerved; that their Anceſtors had heretofore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd their Kings by Death or Baniſhment; that the <hi>Scots</hi> were a Free Nation, made King whom they Freely Choſe, and with the ſame Freedom Unking'd him if they ſaw cauſe, by Right of ancient Laws and Ceremonies, yet remaining, and Old Cuſtoms yet among the High-landers, in chooſing the Head of their Clans or Families; all which, with many other Arguments, bore witneſs, that Regal Power was nothing elſe but a mutual Covenant, or Stipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King and People. <hi>Buchan. Hiſt.</hi> lib. 20. Nor did our Queen, at the earneſt Desires of both Houſes of Parliament, forbear to <hi>take off her Head, though a Crown'd one,</hi> and the Reaſons which were urged by our Learned <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and others, for the Queens Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94894:11"/>
in, and ſpeedy Execution of that great act of Juſtice, being ſo very Remarkable, and Convincing, I think it not amiſs to tranſcribe a few of them (which may be read more at large in Sir. <hi>S. D'Ewes</hi> Journal) which are as follow, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that they had a long time, to their intolerable Grief, ſeen by how manifold moſt dangerous and execrable Practices, the ſaid Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>had compaſſed the Deſtruction of her Majeſties Perſon, thereby not only to bereave them of the Sincere and True Religion of Almighty God, bringing them and this Noble Crown back again into the Thraldom of the</hi> Romiſh Tyranny, <hi>but alſo utterly to ruinate and overthrow the happy State and Commonweale of this moſt Noble Realm; to baniſh and deſtroy the Profeſſors and Profeſſing of the True Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Ancient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Land, and to bring this whole State and Common-weale to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Subjection, and to utter Ruine and Confuſion; which Malicious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes would never ceaſe to be proſecuted by all poſſible Means, ſo long as the ſaid Queens Confederates, but Miniſters, and Favourites had their Eyes and Imaginations fixed upon the ſaid Queen, the only Ground of their Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hopes and Conceits, and the only Seed-plot of all Dangerous and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Devices and Practices againſt her Majeſties Sacred Person. And for that, upon adviſed and great Conſultation, they could not find any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to provide for her Majeſties Safety, but by the juſt and ſpeedy Execution of the ſaid Queen, the neglecting whereof might procure the heavy Diſpleaſure and Puniſhment of Almighty God, as by ſundry ſevere Examples of his great Juſtice in that behalf left us in Sacred Scripture, doth appear; and that if the ſame were not put in Execution, they ſhould thereby (ſo far as Man's Reaſon could reach) be brought into utter Deſpair of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance amongſt them of the true Religion of Almighty God, and of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties. Life, and of the Safety of all her Subjects, and of the Good Eſtate of this flouriſhing Common weale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that ſhe (the ſaid Queen of</hi> Scots) <hi>had continually breathed the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and Suppreſſion of the</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>being poyſoned with</hi> Popery <hi>from her tender Youth, and at her Age joyning in that falſe termed</hi> Holy League, <hi>and had been ever ſince, and was then a powerful Enemy of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that ſhe reſted wholly upon Popiſh hopes, to be delivered and advanced, and was ſo devoted, and doted in that Profeſſion, that ſhe would (as well for the ſatisfaction of others, as for the feeding her own humour) ſupplant the Goſpel where and whenſoever ſhe might; which Evil was ſo much the greater, and the more to be avoided, for that it ſlayeth the Soul, and would ſpread it ſelf not only over</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>but alſo into all Parts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94894:12"/>
beyond the Sea, where the Goſpel of God is maintained, the which cannot but be exceedingly weakened, if Defection ſhould be in theſe two moſt violent Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that if ſhe prevailed, ſhe would rather take the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>for Slaves than for Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that ſhe had already provided them a Foſter father and a Nurſe, the</hi> Pope <hi>and the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>into whoſe hands if it ſhould happen them to fall, what would they elſe look for, but Ruin, Deſtruction, and utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpation of Goods, Lands, Lives, Honours and all</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that as ſhe had already by her poyſon'd Baits, brought to Deſtruction more Noble-men and their Houſes, and a greater multitude of Subjects, during her being here, than ſhe would have done if ſhe had been in Poſſeſſion of her own Country, and arm'd in the Field againſt them, ſo would ſhe be ſtill continually the cauſe of the like ſpoil, to the greater loſs and peril of this Eſtate; and therefore this Realm neither could nor mought endure her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that her Sectaries both Wrote and Printed, that the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>would be at their Wits end, Worlds end, if ſhe ſhould out-live Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth; <hi>meaning thereby, that the end of the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>World was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their own; and therefore if ſhe the ſaid Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>were taken away, their World would be at an end before its beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that ſince the ſparing of her in the Fourteenth year of Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths <hi>Reign, Popiſh Traytors and Recuſants had multiplied exceedingly: And if ſhe were now ſpared again, they would grow both innumerable and invincible alſo: And therefore Mercy in that caſe would prove Cruelty againſt them all:</hi> Nam eſt quaedam crudelis miſericordia; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſpare her Blood, would be to ſpill all theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for Gods Vengeance againſt</hi> Saul, <hi>for ſparing the life of</hi> Agag, <hi>and againſt</hi> Ahab <hi>for ſparing the life of</hi> Benhadad <hi>was moſt apparent, for they were both by the juſt Judgement of God, deprived of their Kingdoms, for ſparing thoſe wicked Princes, whom God had delivered into their hands. And thoſe Magiſtrates were much commended; who put to death thoſe miſchievous and wicked Queens,</hi> Jezabel <hi>and</hi> Athaliah.</p>
            <p>So much for theſe Reaſons, which I leave to the peruſal of our preſent Prelates who have extreamly degenerated from the good and laudable Principles of their Fore-fathers.</p>
            <p>I will now return to the Hiſtory, and after having mentioned one Preſident more of Proteſtants Revolution from their Kings, will conclude this Subject.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1581. the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> in a General Aſſembly at the <hi>Hague,</hi> abjured all Obedience and Subjection to <hi>Philip</hi> King
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94894:12"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi>; and in a Declaration juſtifie their ſo doing; for that by his Tyrannous Government againſt Faith ſo often given and broken, he had loſt his Right to all the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces; that therefore they depoſed him, and declared it lawfull to chooſe another in his ſtead. <hi>Thuan.</hi> lib. 14. <hi>From that time to this no State or Kingdom in the World hath equally proſpered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what need theſe Examples to any who have but ſenſe enough to conceive what monſtrous Inconveniences and Miſeries the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Submiſſion to a Tyrannical Power brings along with it? Thereby the Property of all Subjects, and the Laws of all Countries are deſtroyed together; and we are (contrary to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, and Chriſtianity) obliged to fit ſtill while our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Murthered, Wives Raviſh'd, Eſtates conſumed, and our own Throats cut, beſides an unſpeakable deal more of Barbarity commited by the Irregular Partizans of Inhumane Tyrants. In a word, the Lawfulneſs of raiſing War againſt, and Depoſing of a Tyrant in Defence of Religion and Liberty, has not been denied, but conſtantly warranted and maintained by all the Proteſtant Churches round, from the firſt <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>Having now, I think, ſufficiently cleared what the People by their juſt Right may do in change of Government and Governor, beſides other ample Authority, even from the Mouths of Princes themſelves, give me leave to add further, That ſurely they who ſhall boaſt as we do, to be a Free Nation, and yet not have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the power to remove, or to aboliſh any Governor, Supream, or Subordinate, with the Government it ſelf, upon urgent Cauſes, may pleaſe their fancy with a ridiculous and painted freedom, fit to cozen Babies, but are indeed under Tyranny and Servitude, as wanting that power which is the Root and Source of that Liberty, to diſpoſe and oeconomize in the Land, which God hath given them, as Maſters of Families in their Houſes, and free Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Without which natural and eſſential Power of a Free Nation, (how high ſoever they bear their heads) they can in due eſteem, be thought no better than Slaves and Vaſſals, Born in the Tenure and Occupation of another Inheriting Lord, whoſe Government though not Illegal or Intolerable, hangs over them as a Lordly Scourge, not as a free Government, and therefore to be Abrogated. How much more juſtly may they fling off Tyranny, or Tyrants? who having once forſaken the Kingdom, and being juſtly Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94894:13"/>
can be no more than Private Men, as ſubject to the reach of Juſtice and Arraignment as any other Tranſgreſſors, as <hi>Grotius</hi> affirms, <hi>de jur. &amp; Bell. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Si Rex aut alius quis Imperium abdicavit, aut manifeſte habet pro derelicto, in eum poſt tempus omnia li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent qua in privatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly if Men (not to ſpeak of Heathen) both Wiſe and Religions, have done Juſtice upon Tyrants what way they could ſooneſt, how much more mild and human then is to Dethrone them, and diveſt them of their Prerogative, nay, to bring them to Legal and open Tryals? to teach Lawleſs Kings, and all that ſo much adore them, that not Mortal Man or his Imperious will, but Juſtice is the only true Soveraign and Supream Majeſty upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Let Men therefore ceaſe out of Faction and Malice to make Outcries and report horrid things of things ſo juſt and honourable as our moſt Renowned Convention hath acted hitherto agaiſt our common Adverſary, and we hope they will go on, to act upon him ſuch Juſtice as may be a Preſident to future Ages to imitate, who if they prove not too degenerate, ſhall look up with Honour, and aſpire towards thoſe exemplary deeds of their Anceſtors, as the higheſt top of their Glory and Emulation, which heretofore in the purſuance of Fame and Foreign Dominion, ſpent it ſelf Vaingloriouſly abroad, but ſhall heceforth learn a better Fortitude, to dare Execute the higheſt Juſtice on them that ſhall by force of Arms endeavour the oppreſſing and bereaving Men of their Religion and Liberty at home; that no ubridled Potentate or Tyrant, but to his Sorrow, for the future may preſume ſuch high and irreſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Licence over Mandkind, to havock and turn upſide down whole Kingdoms of Men, as though they were no more in reſpect of his perverſe Will, than a Nation of Piſmires.</p>
            <p>I conclude all with one word of Advice to that Party called Prelatical, many of whom I believe to be Honeſt Men, though they have been ſtrangely miſled by ſome of corrupt Principles and Proſecuting Turbulent Spirits: I wiſh them earneſtly and calmly not to affect Rigor and Superiority over Men, nor juſtly under them; not to compell unlawful and unmerciful things in Religion, eſpecially if not voluntary becomes a Sin, nor to aſſiſt the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and malicious drifts of Men, who they themſelves have judg'd to be the worſt of Men, the obdurate Enemies of God and his Church, nor to dart againſt the Actions of their Brethren, (for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94894:13"/>
want of other Arguments) thoſe Laws and Scripture, which tho' they hurt not otherwiſe, yet taken up by them to the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own late doings, give Scandal unto all Men, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in themſelves either extream Paſſion or Apoſtaſy. Let them not oppoſe their beſt Friends and Aſſociates, who moleſt them not at all, nor Infringe the leaſt of their Liberties, unleſs they call it their Liberty to bind other Mens Conſciences, but are ſtill ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to live at Peace with them and Brotherly accord.</p>
            <p>Let them beware an old and implacable Enemy, though he hopes by ſowing Diſcord, to make them his Inſtrument, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear a minute the open threatened Revenge upon them, when they have ſerved his Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Let them fear therefore if they be wiſe, rather what they have done already, than what remains to do, and be warned in time to put no confidence in Princes whom they have provoked, leſt they be added to the Examples of thoſe that miſerably have taſted the Event.</p>
            <p>Stories can inform them how <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> not much above a hundred years paſt, driven out by his Subjects, and received again upon new Oaths and Conditions, broke through them all, to his moſt Bloody Revenge; Slaying his chief Oppoſers when he ſaw his time, both them and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren invited to a Feaſt for that purpoſe. How <hi>Maximilian</hi> dealt with thoſe of <hi>Bruges,</hi> though by Mediation of the <hi>German</hi> Princes reconciled to them by ſolemn and publick Writing drawn and ſealed.</p>
            <p>How the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> was the effect of that credulous Peace with the French Proteſtants, made with <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth their King; and that the main viſible cauſe which to this day hath ſaved the <hi>Netherlands</hi> from utter ruine, was their final not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the perfidious Cruelty, which as a conſtant Maxim of State, hath been uſed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings on their Subjects that have taken Arms, and after truſted them; as no latter Age but can teſtifie, heretofore in <hi>Belgia</hi> it ſelf, and not many years ago in <hi>Naples.</hi> And further they may remember, how the preſent <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> has, after all his many Edicts, Oaths and Grants, to maintain the Proteſtants in all their Priviledges, beſides the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations they have laid on him, moſt inhumanly and perfidiouſly Baniſh'd, Dragoon'd, Murther'd and made away moſt, if not all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94894:14"/>
his Protestant Subjects; nay, what might be more convincing, would they but lay it to Heart, how our late <hi>Tyrant,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the manifold Obligations they heaped upon him, and Oaths he laid himſelf under, to maintain them and their Grandeur, has nevertheleſs violated all, and with all his Power (as if Ingratitude was his chiefeſt Delight) endeavoured their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation and Ruine, as well as other his Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>And to conclude with one paſt Exception, though far more Ancient, <hi>David,</hi> after once he had taken Arms, never after that truſted <hi>Saul,</hi> though with tears and much relenting, he twice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed not to hurt him. Theſe Inſtances, few of many, might admoniſh them, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> not to let their own ends, and the driving on of a Faction, betray them blindly into the ſnare of those Enemies whoſe Revenge looks on them as the Men who firſt begun, fomented and carried on beyond the cure of any ſound of ſafe Accommodation, all the evil which hath ſince unavoidably fallen upon them and <hi>their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſomething alſo to the Clergy, though brief to what were needful; not to be Diſturbers of the Civil Affairs, being in hands better able, and more belonging to manage them, but to Study harder, and to attend the Office of Good Paſtors, knowing that he whoſe Flock is leaſt among them, hath a dreadful Charge, not performed by mounting frequently in the Desk to repeat their Prayers; or into the Pulpit with a Formal Preachment hudled up at the old hours of a whole lazy Week, but by inceſſant Pains and Watching <hi>in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, from Houſe to Houſe,</hi> over the Souls of whom they have to feed. Which if they ever well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how little leiſure would they find to be the moſt Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sides-men of every popular Tumult and Sedition? And all this while are to learn what the true end and reaſon is of the Goſpel which they teach; and what a world it differs from the Cenſorious and Supercilious Lording over Conſcience.
