            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SAcramental work is ſolemn work indeed: And all thoſe helps are valuable and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whereby the furniture of our minds, the temper of our hearts, and the conduct of our lives may be anſwerable to the ſolemnity of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Table. A mind that is barren or perplext; an heart that is falſe or ſtupid; and the conſcience of a diſordered converſation, are bad
<pb facs="tcp:59454:3"/>
Companions to attend us to the Holy Supper of our Lord. The Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to be diſcerned, his Death ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, his tender'd ſelf and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received, and his next Coming ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly thought on, and throughly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for, and joyfully expected by us; and all this is to be influenced and actuated by this Memorial which Chriſt hath left with us: Such helps as theſe, are the more uſeful by being brief, if brevity do not render them defective and obſcure, as here I think they will not. No Directory can be better than the Inſtitution, if well diſcerned and attended to.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Memorable Perſon</hi> is the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> in his perfections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and deſigns. Here therefore let him be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> As <hi>Man,</hi> to render him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſufferings, ſervice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb facs="tcp:59454:3"/>
with that Enemy of God and Man, who once deceived and enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> the chief of Humane Race, for Tryals, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Advancement.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> As the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and moſt intimately one with God; as Lord of the Univerſe, Head over all things to his Church, and of the Church it ſelf.

            <p n="2">II. His <hi>Sufferings</hi> are the things here next to be commemorated. Great were his Tryals, from <hi>God,</hi> from <hi>Hell,</hi> and from <hi>this World.</hi> With great compoſedneſs and gallantry of ſpirit did he endure them, and work his
<pb facs="tcp:59454:4"/>
paſſage through them to that exalted ſtate, wherein he had ſo much to do with God for us: In all theſe and in his preparations for them, doth he appear moſt exemplary to us, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and urging our Conformity to his obedient, ſubmiſſive, and reſolved ſelf. And in his Meritorious Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Expiatory Death, muſt we diſcern and think ſeverely on, what there and thence was evident; <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Wiſdom, Majeſty, Holineſs, and his Governing Juſtice, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives; the ſinfulneſs of ſin, the miſery of Revolted Man, the equity and power of God's Violated Law; and the eminence of the <hi>Divine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Animal</hi> Life, Nature, and Concerns.</p>

            <head>A Monthly Preparation for our Holy Communion with Chriſt and his Church, in the Lord's Supper.</head>
            <p>THIS is a holy Feaſt that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely provided by the King of Saints, for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Family; for the refreſhing of the weary, and the making glad the mournful Soul. The night before his bitter Death, he inſtituted this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Feaſt; He cauſed his <hi>Diſciples to ſit down with him,</hi> and when they had partaked of the Paſſover, the <hi>Sacrament of Promiſe,</hi> and had their taſte of the <hi>old wine,</hi> he giveth them the <hi>new,</hi> even the <hi>Sacrament of the better Covenant,</hi> and of the <hi>fuller Goſpel-Grace:</hi> He teacheth them that <hi>his Death</hi> is <hi>Life to them:</hi> and that which is his <hi>bittereſt ſuffering,</hi> is their <hi>Feaſt:</hi> and his <hi>ſorrows</hi> are their <hi>Joyes;</hi> as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59454:7"/>
our <hi>ſinful pleaſures</hi> were his <hi>ſorrows.</hi> The <hi>ſlain Lamb of God our paſſover that was Sacrificed for us, that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> was the pleaſant food; which <hi>Sacramentally</hi> he himſelf then delivered to them, and <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> the next day offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. <hi>The bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world,</hi> John 6. 33. <hi>He is the living bread which came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: If any man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever: and the Bread which he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is his fleſh which he hath given for the life of the world.</hi> verſe 50, 51. <hi>Except we eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, we have no life in us: Whoſo eateth his fleſh and drinketh his blood, hath eternal life, and he will raiſe him up at the laſt day: For his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed: He that eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood, dwelleth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him: As the living Father hath ſent the Son, and he liveth by the Father, ſo he that eateth him, ſhall live by him. This is that bread that came down from Heaven: not as the Fathers did eat Manna and are dead: he that eateth this bread ſhall live for ever.</hi>

I ſhall here only give you ſome brief <hi>Directions</hi> for your private duty herein.</p>
            <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Underſtand well the proper ends, to which this Sacrament was inſtituted by Chriſt; and take heed that you uſe it not to ends, for which it never was appointed.</hi> The true ends are theſe, 1. To be a ſolemn Commemoration of the <hi>Death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. Mar. 14. 24. Luke 22. 20. to keep it, as it were, in the eye of the Church, in his bodily abſence till he come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26. 2. To be a ſolemn renewing of the Holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which was firſt entred in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Receiver;</hi> and in that Covenant it is on Chriſt's part, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn delivery of himſelf firſt, and with himſelf the benefits of <hi>Pardon, Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Adoption,</hi> and right to <hi>Life eternal.</hi> Heb. 9. 15, 16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 24. And on <hi>mans part,</hi> it is our ſolemn accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his <hi>Benefits,</hi> upon his terms, and a delivering up our ſelves to him, as his <hi>Redeemed ones,</hi> even to the <hi>Father</hi> as our <hi>reconciled Father,</hi> and to the <hi>Son</hi> as our <hi>Lord and Saviour,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> as our <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> with

               <hi>Profeſſed Thankfulneſs</hi> for ſo great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. 3. It is appointed to be a lively <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective means,</hi> by which the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould work to ſtir up and exerciſe, and increaſe the <hi>Repentance, Faith, Deſire, Love, Hope, Joy, Thankfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>New-Obedience</hi> of <hi>Believers;</hi> by a lively <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of the <hi>evil of ſin,</hi> the <hi>infinite love of God in Chriſt,</hi> the firmneſs of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> or <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the <hi>greatneſs and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the <hi>Mercy</hi> given, and the <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> purchaſed and promiſed to us, and the great <hi>obligations</hi> that are laid upon us. And that herein <hi>believers</hi> might be ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called out to the moſt ſerious exerciſe of all theſe Graces, 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28, 29, 31. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17, 21. 1 Cor. 11. 25, 26. 2 Cor. 6. 4. and might be provoked and aſſiſted to ſtir up themſelves to this Communion with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; to pray for more as through a ſacrificed <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 4. It is appointed to be the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Profeſſion of Believers, of their Faith, and Love, and Gratitude, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>God the Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and of continuing firm in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And a Badge of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59454:8"/>
Church before the World. Acts 2. 42, 46. &amp; 20. 7. 5. And it is appointed to be a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>Unity, Love,</hi> and <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> and their readineſs to Communicate to each other.</p>
            <p>The falſe miſtaken ends, which you muſt avoid, are theſe. 1. You muſt not with the Papiſts, think that the end of it is to turn Bread into no Bread, and Wine into no Wine, and to make them really the true <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For if ſenſe (which telleth all Men that it is ſtill <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine)</hi> be not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, then we cannot believe that ever there was a <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or a <hi>Pope,</hi> or a <hi>Man,</hi> or any thing in the <hi>World.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſly calleth it <hi>Bread three times,</hi> in three Verſes together, after the <hi>Conſecration,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26, 27, 28. and he telleth us, that the uſe of it is (not to make the <hi>Lords Body really preſent,</hi> but) <hi>to ſhew the Lords Death till he come;</hi> that is, As a viſible repreſenting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating ſign, to be <hi>inſtead of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor muſt you with the Papiſts uſe this <hi>Sacrament</hi> to <hi>ſacrifice Chriſt again
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59454:9"/>
really unto the Father,</hi> to propitiate him for the quick and dead, and eaſe Souls in Purgatory, and deliver them out of it. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> having died once dieth no more, and without killing him, there is no ſacrificing him: By <hi>once offering</hi> up himſelf, <hi>he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified;</hi> and now there <hi>remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin:</hi> Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed the ſacrificing work on Earth, he is now paſſed into the <hi>Heavens,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>Redeemed ones.</hi> Ro. 6. 9. 1 Cor. 15. 3. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. Heb. 9. 26. and 10. 12, 26. and 9. 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is it any better than odious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſome Confederacies or Oaths of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie,</hi> for rebellions or other unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; as the <hi>Powder-Plotters</hi> in <hi>England</hi> did.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor is it any other than impious prophanation of theſe ſacred Myſteries for the Prieſt to <hi>conſtrain</hi> or <hi>ſuffer</hi> notoriouſly ignorant, and ungodly perſons, to receive them, either to make themſelves believe that they are indeed the Children of God,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59454:9"/>
or to be a means which ungodly men ſhould uſe to make them godly; or, which Infidels or Impenitent perſons muſt uſe to help them to Repentance and Faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For though there is that in it which may become a means of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, (as a Thief that ſtealeth a <hi>Bible</hi> or <hi>Sermon Book,</hi> may be converted by it,) yet is it not to be uſed by the Receiver to that end. For that were to tell God a lie, as the means of their Converſion; for whoſoever cometh to receive a ſetled par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, doth thereby profeſs repentance, as alſo by the words adjoyned he muſt do; And whoſoever <hi>taketh,</hi> and <hi>eateth,</hi> and <hi>drinketh</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally profeſs thereby, that he taketh and applieth <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf by Faith: And therefore, if he do neither of theſe, he lieth openly to God; and lies and falſe Covenants are not the appointed means of Converſion. Not that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> is a lier in his delivery of it: For he doth but conditionally ſeal and deliver <hi>Gods Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> to the Receiver, to be his, if he <hi>truly Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe:</hi> But the <hi>Receiver</hi> himſelf lieth, if he do not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59454:10"/>
               <hi>actually Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe,</hi> as he there profeſſeth to do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Alſo it is an impious prophanation of the Sacrament, if any Prieſt for the love of filthy lucre, ſhall give it to thoſe that ought not to receive it, that he may have his Fees or Offerings; or, that the Prieſt may have ſo much money that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed for the ſaying a Maſs for ſuch or ſuch a Soul.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And it is odious prophanation of the Sacrament, to uſe it as a League or Bond of Faction, to gather perſons in to the <hi>party,</hi> and tie them faſt to it, that they may depend upon the Prieſt, and his Fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and Inereſt may thereby be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and he may ſeem to have many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And it is a dangerous abuſe of it, to receive it, that you may be pardoned, or ſanctified, or ſaved, barely by the work done, or by the outward exerciſe alone. As if God were there obliged to give you Grace, while you ſtrive not with your own hearts, to ſtir them up to love, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or faith, or obedience, by the means that are before you; or as if God would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59454:10"/>
pardon and ſave you for eating ſo much Bread and drinking ſo much Wine, when the Canon biddeth you; or, as if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conveyed Grace, like as Charms are ſuppoſed to work, by ſaying over ſo many words.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, It is no appointed end of this Sacrament, that the Receiver thereby profeſs himſelf certain of the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of his own <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> (For it is not managed on the ground of ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty only by the Receiver; much leſs by the miniſter that delivereth it.) But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he profeſſeth that as far as he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern by obſerving his own heart, he is truly willing to have Chriſt, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on the terms that they are offered; and that he doth conſent to the Covenant which he is there to renew. Think not therefore, that the Sacrament is inſtituted for any of theſe (miſtaken) ends.</p>
            <p>Direct. 2. <hi>Diſtinctly underſtand the parts of the Sacrament, that you may diſtinctly uſe them, and not do, you know not what.</hi> This Sacrament containeth theſe three parts. 1. The <hi>Conſecration</hi> of the <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> which maketh it the <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59454:11"/>
Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 2. The <hi>Repreſentation</hi> and <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the Sacrifice of Chriſt. 3. The <hi>Communion:</hi> Or, <hi>Communication</hi> by Chriſt, and <hi>Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by the people.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Conſecration,</hi> the Church doth firſt offer the <hi>Creatures</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> to be accepted of God, to this Sacred uſe: And God accepteth them, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to this uſe; which he ſignifieth both by the words of his own Inſtitution, and by the Action of his Miniſters, and their <hi>Benidiction.</hi> They being the <hi>Agents of God</hi> to the People, in this <hi>Accepting</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> as they are the <hi>Agents</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>offering</hi> or <hi>dedicating</hi> the Creatures to this uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>Conſecration</hi> having a ſpecial reſpect to <hi>God the Father,</hi> in it we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his three grand Relations. 1. That he is the <hi>Creator,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Owner</hi> of all the <hi>Creatures;</hi> for we offer them to him as his own. 2. That he is <hi>our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Governor,</hi> whoſe Law it was, that <hi>Adam</hi> and we have broken, and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſatisfaction, and hath received the Sacrifice and atonement, and hath diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59454:11"/>
with the ſtrict and proper execution of that Law; and will rule us hereafter by the Law of Grace. 3. That he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Benefactor who hath freely given us a Redeemer, and the Covenant of Grace, whoſe Love and Favor we have forfeited by ſin, but deſire &amp; hope to be reconciled by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As Chriſt himſelf was <hi>Incarnate</hi> and true Chriſt, before he was <hi>ſacrificed to God,</hi> and was <hi>ſacrificed to God,</hi> before that <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> be communicated for life and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Souls: So in the Sacrament, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration</hi> muſt firſt make the Creature to <hi>be the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative;</hi> and then the ſacrificing of that <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> muſt be repreſented and commemorated; and then the ſacrificed fleſh and blood communicated to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers for their ſpiritual life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Commemoration</hi> chiefly (but not only) reſpecteth <hi>God the Son:</hi> For he hath ordained, that theſe <hi>conſecrated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations</hi> ſhould in their manner and meaſure, ſupply the room of his bodily preſence; while his body is in Heaven: And that thus as it were <hi>in effigy, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59454:12"/>
he might be ſtill Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Churches eyes; and they might be affected, as if they had ſeen him on the Croſs. And that by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> they might, as it were, offer him up to God, that is, Might ſhew the Father that ſacrifice once made for ſin, in which they truſt; and for which it is, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all the acceptance of their perſons with God, and hope for audience when they beg for mercy, and offer up prayer or praiſe to him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In the <hi>Communication,</hi> though the Sacrament have reſpect to the <hi>Father,</hi> as the principal <hi>Giver;</hi> and to the <hi>Son</hi> as both the <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Giver;</hi> yet hath it a ſpecial reſpect to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as being that <hi>ſpirit</hi> given in the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> which quickeneth Souls; without which, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> will profit nothing: And whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations muſt convey and apply Chriſts ſaving benefits to us. <hi>John</hi> 6. 63. &amp; 7. 39.</p>
            <p>Theſe three being the parts of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in whole, as comprehending that ſacred <hi>Action</hi> and participation which is eſſential to it. The <hi>Material parts,</hi> called
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59454:12"/>
the <hi>Relate</hi> and <hi>Correlate,</hi> are. 1. Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Qualitative. 2. <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive.</hi> 1. The firſt are the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> as ſigns, and the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with his <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Benefits,</hi> as the things ſignified and given. The ſecond are the <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Breaking, Pouring out,</hi> and <hi>Delivering</hi> on the Miniſters part, (after the Conſcration) and the <hi>Taking, Eating,</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> by the Receivers, as the ſign: And the ſignified is, the Crucifying or Sacrificing of Chriſt, and the Delivering himſelf with his Benefits to the Believer, and the Receivers thankful <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting,</hi> and uſing the ſaid gift. To theſe add the <hi>Relative Form,</hi> and the <hi>Ends,</hi> and you have the definition of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Look upon the miniſter as the Agent or Officer of Chriſt, who is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by him to ſeal and deliver to you the Covenant and its benefits: And take the Bread and Wine, as if you heard Chriſt himſelf ſaying to you, Take my Body and Blood,</hi> and the <hi>Pardon, and Grace which is thereby purchaſed.</hi> It is a great help in the Application, to have mercy and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59454:13"/>
pardon brought us by the hand of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned Officer of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Direct. 4. <hi>In your preparation before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, take heed of theſe two extreams.</hi> 1. <hi>That you come not prophanely and careleſly, with common hearts, as to a common work:</hi> For God will be ſanctified in them that draw near to him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. And they that eat and drink unworthily, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Body from common Bread; but eating as if it were a common meal, do eat death to themſelves, inſtead of life. 2. <hi>Take heed leſt your miſtakes of the nature of this Sacrament, ſhould poſſeſs you with ſuch fears of unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and the following dangers, as may quite diſcompoſe, and unfit your Souls for the joyful exerciſes of Faith, and Love, and Praiſe, and Thanksgiving, to which you are invited.</hi> Many that are ſcrupulous of receiving it in any, ſave a <hi>feaſting geſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,</hi> are too little careful and ſcrupulous of receiving it in any, ſave a <hi>feaſting frame of mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt extream is cauſed by prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and negligence, or by groſs ignorance of the nature of the Sacramental work.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59454:13"/>
The latter extream is frequently cauſed as followeth; 1. <hi>By ſetting this Sacrament</hi> at a greater diſtance from other <hi>parts of God's worſhip,</hi> than there is cauſe: So that the exceſs of Reverence doth overwhelm the minds of ſome with terrors. 2. By ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the terrible words of <hi>eating and drinking damnation to themſelves,</hi> if they do it <hi>unworthily,</hi> than all the expreſſions of Love and Mercy, which that Bleſſed Feaſt is furniſhed with. So that when the viewes of infinite Love ſhould raviſh them, they are ſtudying wrath and vengeance to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them, as if they came to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. By not underſtanding what maketh a <hi>Receiver</hi> worthy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, but taking their unwilling infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities for condemning unworthineſs. 4. By receiving it ſo ſeldom, as to make it ſtrange to them, and increaſe their fear, whereas, if it were adminiſtred every Lords day, as it was in the Primitve Churches, it would better acquaint them with it, and cure that fear that cometh from ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 5. By imagining, that none that want aſſurance of their own ſincerity, can receive in Faith. 6. By contracting an ill
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59454:14"/>
habit of miſtaken Religiouſneſs, placing it all in poring on themſelves, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their corruptions, and not in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Love of God in Chriſt, and living in the daily praiſes of his Name, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thankſgiving for his exceeding Merc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. 7. And if beſides all theſe the Body contract a weak or timorous melancholly diſtemper, it will leave the mind capable of almoſt nothing, but fear and trouble, even in the ſweeteſt works. From many ſuch cauſes it cometh to paſs, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper is become more terrible, and uncomfortable to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch diſtempered Chriſtians, than any other Ordinance of God; &amp; that which ſhould moſt comfort them doth trouble them moſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>But is not this Sacrament more holy and dreadful, and ſhould it not have more preparation, than other parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the degree indeed, it ſhould have very careful preparation: And we cannot well compare it with other parts of worſhip; as Praiſe, Thankſgiving, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59454:14"/>
that all theſe other parts are here compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and performed. But doubtleſs, God muſt alſo be ſanctified in all his other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and his Name muſt not be taken in vain. And when this Sacrament was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every Lords day, and often in the week beſides, Chriſtians were ſuppoſed to live continually in a ſtate of <hi>general preparation,</hi> and not to be ſo far from a due <hi>particular preparation,</hi> as many poor Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians think they are.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How often ſhould the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be now adminiſtred, that it neither grow into contempt nor ſtrangeneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ordinarily in well Diſplined Churches it ſhould be ſtill every Lord's day. For, 1. We have no reaſon to prove, that the Apoſtles example and appointment in this caſe, was proper to thoſe times, any more than that praiſe and thankſgiving daily is proper to them: And we may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the obligation of other Inſtitutions or Apoſtolical Orders as that. 2. It is a part of the ſettled order for the Lords day's worſhip: and omitting it, <hi>maimeth and altereth the worſhip for the day;</hi> and occaſioneth the omiſſion of the thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59454:15"/>
and praiſe, and lively commemorations of Chriſt, which ſhould be then moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: And ſo Chriſtians by uſe, grow habited to ſadneſs, and a mourning melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Religion, and grow unacquainted with much of the Worſhip and Spirit of the Goſpel. 3. Hereby the Papiſts la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable corruptions of this Ordinance have grown up, even by an exceſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and fear, which ſeldom receiving doth increaſe; till they are come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>Bread</hi> as their God. 4. By ſeldom communicating, Men are ſeduced to think all proper <hi>Communion of Churches</hi> lieth in that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and to be more prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bold in abuſing many other parts of worſhip. 5. There are better means (by Teaching and Diſcipline) to keep the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> from contempt, than the omitting or diſplacing of it. 6. Every Lord's day is no oftener than Chriſtians need it. 7. The frequency will teach them to <hi>live prepared,</hi> and not only to make much ado once a Month or Quarter, when the ſame work is neglected all the year beſide; even as one that liveth in continual expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, will live in continual prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59454:15"/>
When he that expecteth it but in ſome grievous ſickneſs, will then be frightned into ſome ſeeming preparations, which are not the habit of his Soul, but laid by again when the diſeaſe is over.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet I muſt add, that in ſome indiſciplined Churches, and upon ſome occaſions it may be longer omitted, or ſeldomer uſed; no duty is a duty at all <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imes: And therefore extraordinary caſes may raiſe ſuch impediments, as may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us a long time from this, and many other Priviledges. But the ordinary faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tneſs of our imperfect hearts, that are apt <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o grow cuſtomary and dull, is no good reaſon why it ſhould be ſeldom; any more than why other ſpecial duties of Worſhip and Church-Communion ſhould be ſeldom. Read well the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and you will find that the<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All are not to <hi>ſeek</hi> it, or to <hi>take</hi> it, becauſe many may know their own unfitneſs, when the Church or Paſtors know it not: But all that come and ſeek it, are to be admitted by the Paſtors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch <hi>Children, Idiots, ignorant perſons,</hi> or <hi>Heriticks,</hi> as know not what they are to receive and do; and ſuch as are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wicked or ſcandalous, and have not manifeſted their repentance. But then it is preſuppoſed, that none ſhould be numbr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the adult members of the Church but thoſe that have perſonally owned their Baptiſmal Covenant, by a <hi>Credible Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of true Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>May a Man that hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and civility, and common gifts, come and take this Sacrament, if he know that he is yet void of true repentance, and other ſaving Grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; for he then knoweth himſelf to be one that is uncapable of it in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>May an ungodly Man receive
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59454:16"/>
this Sacrament, who knoweth not himſelf to be ungodly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; For he ought to know it; and his ſinful ignorance of his own condition, will not make his ſin to be his duty; nor excuſe his other faults before God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>Muſt a ſincere Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that is uncertain of his ſincerity, and in continual doubting?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two preparations are neceſſary to this Sacrament; the <hi>general preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is a ſtate of Grace, and this the doubting Chriſtian hath; and the <hi>particular preparation,</hi> which conſiſteth in his preſent actual fitneſs: And all the queſtion is of this. And to know this, you muſt further diſtinguiſh, between <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate duty</hi> and <hi>more remote;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the degrees of doubtfulneſs in Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians. 1. The <hi>neareſt immediate duty</hi> of the doubting Chriſtian is, to uſe the means to have his doubts reſolved, till te know his caſe; and then his next duty is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament; and both theſe ſtill remain his duty, to be performed in this order: And if he ſay, <hi>I cannot be reſolved,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59454:17"/>
when I have done my beſt.</hi> Yet certainly it is ſome ſin of his own, that keepeth him in the dark, and hindereth his aſſurance; and therefore <hi>duty</hi> ceaſeth not to be <hi>duty:</hi> The Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtill obligeth him, both to get aſſurance, and to receive; and the want both of the knowledge of his ſtate, and of <hi>Receiving</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> are his continual ſin, if he lie in it never ſo long through theſe ſcruples, though it be an infirmity that God will not condemn him for. (For he is ſuppoſed to be in a ſtate of Grace.) But you will ſay, <hi>What if ſtill he cannot be reſolved whether he have true Faith and Repentance, or not? What ſhould he do while he is in doubt?</hi> I anſwer, It is one thing to ask, what is his duty in this caſe? and another thing to ask, <hi>Which is the ſmaller or leſs dangerous ſin?</hi> Still his duty is both to get the <hi>knowledge</hi> of his heart, and to <hi>communicate: But while he ſinneth</hi> (through infirmity) <hi>in the failing of the firſt, were he better alſo omit the other, or not?</hi> To be well reſolved of that, you muſt diſcern, 1. Whether his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, do rather incline to think and hope that <hi>he is ſincere in his repentance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59454:17"/>
and Faith,</hi> or, <hi>that he is not?</hi> 2. And whether the <hi>conſequents</hi> are like to be good or bad to him. If his hopes that <hi>he is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> be as great or greater <hi>than his fears</hi> of the contrary, then there is no ſuch ill conſequent to be feared as may hinder his communicating; but it is his beſt way to do it, and wait on God in the uſe of his Ordinance. But if the perſwaſion of his graceleſneſs be greater than the hopes of his ſincerity, then he muſt obſerve how he is like to be affected, if he do communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. If he find that he is like to clear up his mind, aed increaſe his hopes by the actuating of his Grace, he is yet beſt to go: But if he find that his heart is like to be over whelmed with horror and ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpair, by running into the ſuppoſed guilt of unworthy receiving, then it will be worſe to do it, than to omit it. Many ſuch fearful Chriſtians I have known, that are fain many years to abſent themſelves from the Sacrament; becauſe if they ſhould receive it while they are perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their utter unworthineſs, they would be ſwallowed up of deſperation, and think that they had taken their own damnatioa,

(as the Twenty fifth Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaith, the <hi>unworthy receivers do.)</hi> So that the chief ſin of ſuch a <hi>doubting receiver,</hi> is not that he <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth though he doubt;</hi> for doubting will not excuſe us for the ſinful omiſſion of a duty (no more of this than of Prayer or Thankſgiving:) But only <hi>Prudence</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſuch a one to forbear that, which through his own diſtemper would be a means of his deſpair and ruine: As that Phyſick or Food (how good ſoever) is not to be taken which would kill the taker: Gods Ordinances are not appointed for our deſtruction, but for our edification; and ſo muſt be uſed as tendeth thereunto. Yet to thoſe Chriſtians, who are in this caſe, and dare not communicate, I muſt put this Queſtion, How dare you ſo long refuſe it? He that conſenteth to the Covenant, may boldly come and ſignifie his conſent, and receive the ſealed Covenant of God; for <hi>conſent</hi> is your preparation, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary condition of your Right: If you <hi>conſent</hi> not, you refuſe all the Mercy of the Covenant. And dare you live in ſuch a ſtate? Suppoſe a Pardon be offered to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59454:19"/>
a condemned Thief, but ſo, that if he after caſt it in the dirt, or turn Traytor, he ſhall die a ſorer death; will he rather chuſe to die than take it, and ſay, I am afraid I ſhall abuſe it? To refuſe <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> is certain death; but to <hi>conſent</hi> is your preparation and your life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>Wherein lieth the ſin of an Hypocrite, and ungodly perſon, if he do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> His ſin is, 1. In <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie;</hi> in that he profeſſeth to <hi>repent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly of his ſin, and to be reſolved</hi> for a holy life, and to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to accept him on his Covenant-terms, and to give up himſelf to God, as his Father, his Saviour, and his Sanctifier, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> when indeed, he never did any of this, but ſecretly abhorreth it at his heart, and will not be perſwaded to it: And ſo all this <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and his very <hi>Covenanting</hi> it ſelf, and his <hi>Receiving,</hi> as it is a <hi>Profeſſing-covenanting-ſign,</hi> is nothing but a very lie. And what it is to lie to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> telleth us. 2. It is uſurpation to come and lay claim
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59454:20"/>
to thoſe Benefits, which he hath no title to. 3. It is a prophanation of theſe holy Myſteries, to be thus uſed; and it is a taking of Gods Name in vain, who is a jealous God, and will be ſanctified of all that draw near unto him. 4. And it is a wrong to the Church of God, &amp; the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, &amp; the honour of the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Religion, that ſuch ungodly Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes intrude as Members: As it is to the Kings Army, when the Enemies Spies creep in amongſt them; or to his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-feaſt to have a gueſt in rags. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it is no lie, becauſe they think they ſay true in their Profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is through their ſinful negligence and ſelf-deceit: And he is a lier that ſpeaks a falſhood, which he may and ought to know to be a falſhood, though he do not know it. There is a lier in <hi>raſhneſs</hi> and <hi>negligence,</hi> as well as of <hi>ſet purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 8: <hi>doth all unworthy receiving make a man liable to damnation? Or, what unworthineſs is it that is ſo threatned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are three ſorts of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59454:20"/>
(or unfitneſs) and three ſorts of Judgment anſwerably to be feared. 1. There is the utter unworthineſs of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, or impenitent, ungodly Hypocrite. And damnation to Hell fire, is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſuch muſt expect, if Converſion prevent it not. 2. There is an unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through ſome great and ſcandalous crime, which a regenerate perſon falleth into; and this ſhould ſtop him from the Sacrament for a time, till he have repented and caſt away his ſin: And if he come before he riſe from his fall by a particular <hi>repentance,</hi> (as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that ſinned in the very uſe of the Sacrament it ſelf) they may expect ſome notable temporal judgment at the preſent; (and if Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance didnot prevent it, they might fear E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhment.) 3. There is that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of unworthineſs which conſiſteth in the ordinary infirmities of a Saint; and this ſhould not at all deter them from the Sacrament, becauſe it is accompanied with a greater worthineſs; yea, though their weakneſs appear in the time and manner of their receiving: But yet ordinary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections may follow theſe ordinary infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This bringeth me up to the next Direction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let your preparation to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſist of theſe particulars following,</hi> 1. <hi>In your duty with your own conſciences and hearts.</hi> 2. <hi>In your duty towards God.</hi> 3. <hi>And in your duty towards your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>

Which may be done by theſe inquiries, and diſcerned by theſe Signs. 1.

Whether you truly love that degree of holineſs in others which you have not yet attained your ſelves, and love Chriſt in his Children, with ſuch an unfeigned love, as will cauſe you to relieve them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your abilities, and ſuffer for their ſakes, when it is your duty? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. &amp; 3 8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 40. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5.

17, 21, 22. 9. Whether the world, and all its honour, wealth, and pleaſures appear to you ſo ſmall and contemptible a thing, as that you eſteem it as dung, and nothing in compariſon of Chriſt, and the love of God and Glory? and are reſolved, that you will rather let go all, than your part in Chriſt?

Whether you are reſolved upon a courſe of holineſs and obedience, and to uſe thoſe means which God doth make known to you, to be the way to pleaſe him, and to ſubdue your corruption; and yet feeling the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your hearts, and the burden of your ſins, do truſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as your Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs before God, and in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whoſe Grace alone can illuminate, ſanctifie, and confirm you? <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 57, 63, 69, 106. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. By theſe Signs you may ſafely try your ſtates.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When this is done you are alſo to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59454:23"/>
try the ſtrength and meaſure of your Grace; that you may perceive your weakneſs, and know for what help you ſhould ſeek to Chriſt. And to find out what inward <hi>corruptions</hi> and <hi>ſinful inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are yet ſtrongeſt in you, that you may know what to lament, and to ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of, and help againſt. My Book called <hi>Directions for weak Chriſtians,</hi> will give you fuller advice in this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You are alſo to take a ſtrict account of your <hi>lives;</hi> and to look over your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with God and Men, in ſecret and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, eſpecially of late, ſince the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of your Covenant with God, and to hear what God and Conſcience have to ſay about your ſins and all their aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And you muſt labour to get your hearts affected with your condition, as you do diſcover it. To be humbled for what is ſinful, and to be deſirous of help againſt your weakneſs, and thankful for the Grace which you diſcern.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, you muſt conſider of all the work that you have to do, &amp; all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which you are going to receive, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59454:23"/>
what Graces are neceſſary to all this, and how they muſt be uſed; and accordingly lock up all thoſe Graces, and prepare them for the exerciſe to which they are to be called out. I ſhall name you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars anon.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Your duty towards God in your preparation for this Sacrament, is, 1. To caſt down your ſelves before him in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble penitent confeſſion, and lamentation of all the Sins which you diſcover; and to beg his pardon in ſecret, before you come to have it publickly ſealed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. 2. To look up to him with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Love, and Joy, as becomes one that is going to receive ſo great a mercy from him; and humbly to beg that Grace which may prepare you, and quicken you to, and in the work.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Your duty towards others in this your preparation, is, 1. To forgive thoſe that have done you wrong, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your fault to theſe whom you have wronged, and ask them forgiveneſs, and make them amends and reſtitution ſo far as is in your power; and be reconciled to thoſe with whom you are fallen out; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59454:24"/>
to ſee, that you love your neighbours as your ſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23, 24, 25, 26, 44. <hi>James</hi> 5. 16. 2. That you ſeek ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your Paſtors, or ſome fit perſons, in caſes that are too hard for your ſelves to reſolve, and where you need their ſpecial help. 3. That you lovingly admoniſh them that you know do intend to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unworthily, and to come thither in their ungodlineſs, and groſs ſin unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: That you ſhew not ſuch hatred of your Brother, as to ſuffer ſin upon him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. But tell him his faults, as Chriſt hath directed you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. And do your parts to promote Chriſts Diſcipline, and keep pure the Church. See 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5. throughout.</p>
            <p>Direct. 6. <hi>When you come to the holy Communion, let not the over-ſcrupulous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the perſon of the Miniſter, or the company, or the imperfections of the miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, diſturb your meditations, nor call away your minds from the high and ſerious imployment of the day.</hi> Hypocrites who place their Religion in bodily exerciſes, have taught many weak Chriſtians to take up uneceſſary ſcruples, and to turn their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59454:24"/>
eye and obſervation too much to things without them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſhould we have no regard to the due celebration of theſe ſacred Myſteries, and to the Miniſter, and communicants, and manner of Adminiſtration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes: You ſhould have ſo much regard to them, 1. As to ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be amiſs through your default, which is in your power to amend. 2. And that you joyn not in the committing of any known ſin. But, 1. Take not every ſin of another for your ſin, and think not that you are guilty of that in others, which you cannot amend; or, that you muſt forſake the Church and worſhip of God, for theſe corruptions which you are not guilty of; or deny your own mercies, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uſurp them or abuſe them. 2. If you ſuſpect any thing impoſed upon you to be ſinful to you, try it before you come thither; and leave not your minds open to diſturbance, when they ſhould be wholly imployed with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what if my conſcience be not ſatisfied, but I am ſtill in doubt, muſt I not forbear? Seeing he that doubteth is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59454:25"/>
condemned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not in Faith; for whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> The Apoſtle there ſpeaketh not of eating in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but of eating meats, which he doubteth of whether they are lawful, but is ſure, that it is lawful to forbear them. And in caſe of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about things indifferent, the ſurer ſide is to forbear them, becauſe there may be ſin in doing; but there can be none on the other ſide in forbearing. But in caſe of <hi>Duties,</hi> your doubting will not diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige you; elſe men might give over praying, and hearing Gods Word, and believing, and obeying their Rulers, and maintaining their Families, when they are but blind enough to doubt of it. 2. Your erring Conſcience is not a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and cannot make it your duty to obey it. For God is your King, and the Office of your Conſcience is to <hi>diſcern his Law;</hi> and urge you to obedience, and not to <hi>make you Laws</hi> of its own: So that if it ſpeak falſly, it doth not oblige you, but deceive you. It doth only <hi>ligate,</hi> or inſnare you, but not <hi>obligare,</hi> or make

a ſin a duty. It caſteth you into neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinning more or leſs till you relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the error: But in caſe of ſuch duties as theſe, it is a ſin to do them with a doubting Conſcience, but (ordinarily) it is a greater ſin to forbear.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſome Divines write, that Conſcience being Gods Officer; when it err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, God himſelf doth bind me by it to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that error, and the evil which it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth becometh my duty.</hi>

And if you ignorantly miſtake him, will you lay the blame on him, and draw him into participation of your ſin, when he forbiddeth you both the error and the ſin? And doth he at once forbid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſame thing?

            <p>Direct. 7. <hi>In the time of adminiſtration go along with the Miniſter throughout the work, and keep your hearts cloſe to Jeſus Chriſt, in the exerciſe of all thoſe Graces, which are ſuited to the ſeveral parts of the adminiſtration.</hi> Think not that all the work muſt be the Miniſter's. It ſhould be a buſie day with you, and your hearts ſhould be taken up with as much diligence, as your hands be in your common labor; but not in a toilſome weary diligence, but in ſuch delightful buſineſs as becometh the gueſts of the God of Heaven, at ſo ſweet a feaſt, and in the receiving of ſuch unvaluable gifts.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhould diſtinctly ſhew you, I. What Graces they be that you muſt there exerciſe. II. What there is obiectively preſented before you in the Sacrament, to exerciſe all theſe Graces. III. At what ſeaſons in the adminiſtration each of theſe inward works are to be done.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Graces to be exerciſed are theſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59454:26"/>
(beſides that holy fear and reverence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all worſhip) 1. A humble ſenſe of the odiouſneſs of <hi>ſin,</hi> and of our <hi>undone condition</hi> as in our ſelves, and a diſpleaſure againſt our ſelves, &amp; loathing of our ſelves, and melting Repentance for the ſins we have committed; as againſt our <hi>Creator,</hi> and as againſt the Love and Mercy of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and as againſt the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of Grace. 2. A <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirſting deſire</hi> after the Lord Jeſus, and his Grace, and the favour of God and communion with him, which are there repreſented and offered to the Soul. 3. A <hi>lively Faith</hi> in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, his death, reſurrection and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; and a <hi>truſting</hi> our miſerable ſouls upon him, as our ſufficient Saviour and help; And a <hi>hearty acceptance</hi> of him and his benefits upon his offered terms. 4. A <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>gladneſs</hi> in the ſenſe of that unſpeakable mercy which is here offered us. 5. A <hi>thankful heart</hi> towards him, from whom we do receive it. 6. A <hi>fervent Love</hi> to him that by ſuch Love doth ſeek our Love. 7. A <hi>triumphant Hope of life eternal,</hi> which is purchaſed for us, and ſealed to us. 8. A <hi>willingneſs</hi> and <hi>reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59454:27"/>
to deny our ſelves, and all this world, and ſuffer for him that hath ſuffered for our Redemption. 9. A Love to our Brethren, our Neighbours and our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with a readineſs to relieve them, and to forgive them when they do us wrong. 10. And a firm <hi>Reſolution</hi> for future o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, to our Creator, and Redeemer, and Sanctifier, according to our Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In the naming of theſe Graces, I have named their objects: which you ſhould obſerve as diſtinctly as you can, that they may be operative. 1. To help your Humiliation and Repentance, you bring thither a loaden miſerable Soul, to receive a pardon and relief: And you ſee before you the Sacrificed Son of God, who made his ſoul an offering for ſin, and became a Curſe for us to ſave us who were accurſed. 2. To draw out your deſires, you have the moſt excellent gifts and the moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercies preſented to you that this world is capable of: Even the pardon of ſin, the Love of God, the Spirit of Grace, and the hopes of Glory, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with whom all this is given. 3. To exerciſe your Faith you have Chriſt here
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59454:27"/>
firſt repreſented as crucified before your eyes: and then with his benefits, freely given you, and offered to your acceptance, with a Command that you refuſe him not. 4. To exerciſe your delight and gladneſs, you have this Saviour and this Salvation tendered to you; and all that your ſouls can well deſire ſet before you. 5. To exerciſe your Thankfulneſs, what could do more than ſo great a Gift, ſo dearly purchaſed, ſo ſurely ſealed, and ſo freely offered? 6. To exerciſe your Love to God in Chriſt, you have the fulleſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his attractive Love, even offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your eyes, and taſte, and heart, that a ſoul on earth can reaſonably expect; in ſuch wonderful condeſcenſion, that the greatneſs and ſtrangneſs of it ſurpaſſeth a natural mans belief. 7. To exerciſe your hopes of life eternal, you have the price of it here ſet before you; you have the Gift of it here ſealed to you; and you have that Saviour repreſented to you in his ſuffering, who is now there reigning, that you may remember him, as <hi>expectants</hi> of his Glorious coming to judge the world, and glorifie you with himſelf. 8. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59454:28"/>
your ſelf-denyal and reſolution for ſuffering, and contempt of the world and fleſhly pleaſures, you have before you both the greateſt example and obligation, that ever could be offered to the world; when you ſee and receive a Crucified Chriſt, that ſo ſtrangely denyed himſelf for you; and ſet ſo little by the world and fleſh. 9. To exerciſe your love to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yea, and Enemies, you have his example before your eyes, that loved you to the death when you were Enemies: And you have his holy ſervants before your eyes, who are amiable in him through the workings of his Spirit, and on whom he will have you ſhew your love to himſelf. 10. And to excite your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for future odedience, you ſee his double Title to the Government of you, as Creator and as Redeemer; and you feel the obligations of Mercy and Gratitude; and you are to renew a Covenant with him to that end; even openly where all the Churches are witneſſes. So that you ſee here are powerful object before you to draw out all theſe Graces, and that they are all but ſuch as the work requireth you then to exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59454:28"/>
III. But that you may be the readier when it cometh to practice, I ſhall as it were lead you by the hand through all the parts of the adminiſtration, &amp; tell you when and how to exerciſe every grace, and thoſe that are to be joyned together I ſhall take together, that needleſs diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do not trouble you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When you are called up and going to the Table of the Lord, exerciſe your Humility, Deſire and Thankfulneſs, and ſay in your hearts, <hi>What Lord, doſt thou call ſuch a wretch as I? What! me that have ſo oft deſpiſed thy mercy? and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offended thee, and preferred the filth of this world and the pleaſures of the fleſh before thee? Alas, it is thy wrath in Hell that is my due: But if love will chooſe ſuch an unworthy gueſt, and Mercy will be honoured upon ſuch ſin and miſery, I come Lord at thy call: I gladly come: Let thy will be done; and let that mercy which inviteth me, make me acceptable, and graciouſly entertain me; and let me not come without the wedding Garment, nor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59454:29"/>
unreverently ruſh on holy things, nor turn thy mercies to my bane!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Miniſter is confeſſing ſin, proſtrate your very ſouls in the ſenſe of your unworthineſs, and let your particular ſins be in your eye, with their hainous ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations; The whole need not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but the ſick. But here I need not put words into your mouths or minds, becauſe the Miniſter goeth before you, and your hearts muſt concurr with his Confeſſions, and put in alſo the ſecret ſins which he omitteth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When you look on the Bread and Wine which is provided and offered for this holy uſe, remember that it is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things, on whom you live, whoſe Laws you did offend; and ſay in your hearts, <hi>O Lord, how great is my offence? who have broken the Laws of him that made me, and on whom the whole Creation doth depend? I had my Being from thee, and my daily Bread; and ſhould I have requited thee with diſobedience? Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59454:29"/>
4. When the words of the Inſtitution are read, and the Bread and Wine are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly conſecrated, by ſeparating them to that ſacred uſe, and the acceptance and bleſſing of God is deſired, admire the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that prepared us a Redeemer, and ſay, <hi>O God how wonderful is thy wiſdom and thy love? How ſtrangely doſt thou glorifie thy mercy over ſin that gave advantage to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy juſtice? Even thou our God whom we have offended, haſt out of thy own Treaſury ſatisfied thy own juſtice, and given us a Saviour by ſuch a Miracle of Wiſdom, Love, and Condeſcention, as men or Angels ſhall never be able fully to comprehend: ſo didſt thou love the ſinful world, as to give thy Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. O thou that haſt prepared us ſo full a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo pretious a gift, ſanctifie theſe Creatures to be the Repreſentative Body and Blood of Chriſt, and prepare my heart for ſo great a gift, and ſo high and holy and honourable a work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When you behold the Conſecrated <hi>Bread and Wine, diſcern the Lords Body, and reverence it as the Reprſentative Body
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59454:30"/>
and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and take heed of <hi>Prophaning</hi> it, by looking on it as <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bread and VVine;</hi> Though it be not Tranſubſtantiate, but ſtill is very <hi>Bread and VVine</hi> in its <hi>Natural being,</hi> yet it is <hi>Chriſts Body and Blood in repreſentation and effect.</hi> Look on it as the conſecrated <hi>Bread of life,</hi> which with the quickning Spirit muſt nouriſh you to life eternal.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When you ſee the <hi>Breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and the <hi>Pouring</hi> out of the <hi>VVine,</hi> let <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Deſire;</hi> and <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> thus work within you. <hi>O wondrous Love! O hateful ſin! How merciful, Lord, haſt thou been to ſinners? &amp; how cruel have we been to our ſelves &amp; thee? Could Love ſtoop lower? Could God be merciful at a dearer rate? Could my ſin have done a more horrid deed, than put to death the Son of God? How ſmall a matter hath tempted me to that, which muſt coſt ſo dear before it was forgiven? How dear payed my Saviour for that, which I might have avoided at a very cheap rate? At how low a price have I valued his Blood, when I have ſinned and ſinned again for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59454:30"/>
nothing! This is my doing! My ſins were the Thorns, the Nails, the Spear! Can a Murderer of Chriſt be a ſmall offender? O dreadful juſtice! It was I and ſuch other ſinners that deſerved to bear the puniſhment who were guilty of the ſin; and to have been fewel for the unquenchable flames for ever. O pretious Sacrifice! O hateful ſin! O gracious Saviour! how can mans dull and narrow heart, be duly affected with ſuch tranſcendent things? or Heaven make its due impreſſion upon an inch of fleſh! Shall I ever again have a dull apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Love? Or ever have a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thought of ſin? Or ever have a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thought of juſtice? O break or melt this hardened heart, that it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conformed to my crucified Lord! The tears of Love and true Repentance are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the flames from which I am redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. O hide me in theſe wounds, and waſh me in this pretious blood! This is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in which I truſt: This is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which I muſt be juſtified, and ſaved from the Curſe of thy violated Law! As thou haſt accepted this, O Father, for the world, upon the Croſs, Behold it (till on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59454:31"/>
the behalf of ſinners; and hear his Blood that cryeth unto thee for mercy to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and pardon us, and accept us as thy Reconciled Children, for the ſake of this Crucified Chriſt alone. We can offer thee no other Sacrifice for ſin; and we need no other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. When the Miniſter applyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God by prayer, for the efficacy of this Sacrament, that in it he will give us Chriſt and his benefits, and pardon, and juſtifie us, and accept us as his reconciled Children joyn heartily and earneſtly in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, as one that knoweth the need and worth of ſuch a mercy.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When the Miniſter delivereth you the conſecrated Bread and Wine, look upon him as the meſſenger of Chriſt, and hear him as if Chriſt by him ſaid to you, <hi>Take this my broken body and blood, and feed <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

the poſſeſſion of Houſe or Lands, the deliverer giveth a Key, and a Twig and a Turf, and ſaith, <hi>I deliver you this houſe, and I deliver you this Land:</hi> So doth the Miniſter by Chriſt's Authority deliver you Chriſt and pardon and title to eternal life. Here is an Image of a ſacrificed Chriſt of Gods own appointing, which you may lawfully uſe: And more than an Image; even an inveſting Inſtrument, by which theſe higheſt mercies are ſolemnly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in the name of Chriſt. Let your hearts therefore ſay with <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> O <hi>matchleſs bounty of the eternal God! what a gift is this! and unto what unworthy ſinners! and will God ſtoop ſo low to man? and come ſo near him? and thus reconcile his worthleſs enemies? Will he freely pardon all that I have done? and take me into his family and love, and feed me with the fleſh and blood of Chriſt? I believe; Lord help mine unbelief. I humbly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept thy gifts! Open thou my heart, that I may yet more joyfully and thankfully accept them: Seeing God will glorifie his Love and mercy by ſuch incomprehenſible
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59454:32"/>
gifts as theſe, behold, Lord, a wretch that needeth all this mercy! And ſeeing it is the offer of thy Grace and Covenant, my Soul doth gladly take thee for my God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for my Saviour and my Sanctifier: And here I give my up ſelf unto thee, as thy Created, Redeemed and (I hope) Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one; as thy Own, thy Subject and thy Child, to be ſaved and Sanctified by thee, to be beloved by thee and to Love thee to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: O ſeal up this Covenant and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by the Spirit, which thou ſealeſt and delivereſt to me in thy Sacrament: that, without reſerve, I may be entirely and for ever thine!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. When you ſee the Communicants receiving with you, let your very hearts be united to the Saints in love, and ſay, <hi>How goodly are thy Tents,</hi> O Jacob! <hi>How amiable is the Family of the Lord!

               <p>O My God, I look to Thee, I come to Thee, to thee alone: No man, no worldly creature made me; none of them did redeem me; none of them did renew my ſoul, none of them will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me at thy Bar, nor forgive my ſin, nor ſave me from the penal Juſtice: none of them will be a full or a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual felicity or portion for my ſoul. I am not a ſtranger to their promiſes and performances: I have truſted them too far, and followed them too long! O that it had been leſs, (though I muſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge, that Mercy did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew me their deceit, and turn my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring thoughts to thee:) to thee I <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> my ſelf, for I am <hi>thine own!</hi> to thee I <hi>ſubject</hi> all powers of my Soul and body,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59454:36"/>
for thou art my Rightful Sovereign Governour: from thee I <hi>thankfully</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of all the benefits and comforts of my life: in thee I expect my true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and content: to know thee, and love thee, and delight in thee, muſt be my bleſſedneſs, or I muſt have none. The little taſtes of this ſweetneſs which my thirſty ſoul hath had, do tell me that there is no other real joy. I feel that thou haſt <hi>made</hi> my mind to <hi>know thee,</hi> and I feel thou haſt made my heart to love thee, my tongue to praiſe thee, and all that I am and have to ſerve thee! And even in the panting languiſhing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and motions of my ſoul, I find that thou, and only thou, art its reſting place: and though Love do now but <hi>ſearch,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>cry,</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> and in reaching upward, but cannot reach, the glorious light, the bleſſed knowledge, the perfect love, for which it longeth; yet by its eye, its aim, its motions, its moans, its groans, I know its meaning, where it would be, and I know its end. My diſplaced ſoul will never be <hi>well,</hi> till it come near to thee, till it know thee better, till it love thee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59454:36"/>
more. It loves it ſelf, and juſtifieth that ſelf-love, when it can love thee: it loaths it ſelf, and is weary of it ſelf as a lifeleſs burden, when it feels no pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after thee. Wert thou to be found in the moſt ſolitary deſart, it would ſeek thee; or in the uttermoſt parts of the earth, it would make after thee: thy preſence makes a croud, a Church: thy converſe maketh a cloſet, or ſolitary wood or field, to be kin to the Angelical Chore. The creature were dead, if thou wert not its life; and ugly, if thou wert not its beauty; and inſignificant, if thou wert not its ſenſe. The ſoul is deformed, which is without thine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and lifeleſs, which liveth not in love to thee, if love be not its pulſe, and prayer, and praiſe, its conſtant breath: the Mind is unlearned which readeth not thy Name on all the World, and ſeeth not HOLINESS TO THE LORD engraven upon the face of every creature. He doteth that doubteth of thy Being or Perfections, and he dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who doth not live to thee. O let me have no other portion! no reaſon, no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59454:37"/>
love, no life, but what is devoted to thee, employed <hi>on</hi> thee, and <hi>for</hi> thee here, and ſhall be perfected in thee, the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect final object, for evermore. Upon the holy Altar erected by thy Son, and by his hands, and his mediation, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly devote and offer thee <hi>THIS HEART:</hi> O that I could ſay with greater feeling, <hi>This flaming, loving, longing-Heart!</hi> But the ſacred fire which muſt kindle on my ſacrifice, muſt come from thee; it will not elſe aſcend unto thee: let it conſume this droſs, ſo the nobler part may know its home. All that I can ſay to commend it to thine acceptance, is, that I hope it's waſh'd in precious blood, that there is ſomething in it that is thine own; it ſtill looketh towards thee, &amp; groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to thee, &amp; followeth after thee, and will be content with gold, and mirth, and honour, and ſuch inferiour fooleries no more: it lieth at thy doors, and will be entertain'd or periſh. Though alas, it loves thee not as it would, I boldly ſay, it longs to love thee, it loves to love thee; it ſeeks, it craves no greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs than perfect endleſs mutual love:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59454:37"/>
it is vowed to thee, even to thee alone; and will never take up with ſhadows more; but is reſolved to lie down in ſorrow and deſpair, if thou wilt not be its <hi>REST</hi> and <hi>JOY.</hi> It hateth it ſelf for loving thee no more; accounting no want, deformity, ſhame or pain ſo great and grievous a calamity.</p>
               <p>For thee the Glorious bleſſed GOD, it is that I come to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If he did not reconcile my guilty ſoul to thee, and did not teach it the heavenly art and work of Love, by the ſweet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thy love, he could be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for me. Thou art my only ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end; it is only a guide and way to thee that my anxious ſoul hath ſo much ſtudied: and none can teach me rightly to know thee, &amp; to love thee, and to live to thee, but thy ſelf: it muſt be a Teacher ſent from thee, that muſt conduct me to thee. I have long-looked round about me in the world, to ſee if there were a more lucid Region, from whence thy will and glory might be better ſeen, than that in which my lot is fallen: But no Traveller that I can ſpeak with, no Book
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59454:38"/>
which I have turn'd over, no Creature which I can ſee, doth tell me more than Jeſus Chriſt. I can find no way ſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my ſoul, no medicine ſo fitted to my miſery, no bellows ſo fit to kindle love, as faith in Chriſt, the Glaſs and Meſſenger of thy love. I ſee no doctrine ſo divine and heavenly, as bearing the image and ſuperſcription of God; nor any ſo fully confirmed and delivered by the atteſtation of thy own Omnipotency; nor any which ſo purely pleads thy cauſe, and calls the Soul from <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> and condemns its ſin and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth it, and leadeth it directly unto thee; and though my former ignorance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to look back to the Ages paſt, and to ſee the methods of thy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and when I look into thy Word, diſabled me from ſeeing the beauteous methods of thy Truth; thou haſt given me a glimpſe of clearer light, which hath diſcovered the reaſons and methods of grace, which I then diſcerned not: and in the midſt of my moſt hideous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perplexed thoughts, thou kepſt alive the root of faith, and kepſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59454:38"/>
alive the love to thee and unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which it had kindled. Thou haſt mercifully given me the <hi>witneſs</hi> in my ſelf; not an <hi>unreaſonable perſwaſion</hi> in my <hi>mind,</hi> but that <hi>renewed nature,</hi> thoſe holy and heavenly deſires and delights, which ſure can come from none but thee. And O how much more have I perceived in many of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than in my ſelf! thou haſt caſt my lot among the Souls whom Chriſt hath healed. I have daily converſed with thoſe whom he hath raiſed from the dead. I have ſeen the power of thy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel upon ſinners: All the love that ever I perceived kindled towards thee, and all the true obedience that ever I ſaw performed to thee, hath been effected by the word of Jeſus Chriſt: how oft hath his ſpirit helped me to pray! and how often haſt thou heard thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! what pledges haſt thou given to my ſtaggering faith, in the works which prayer hath procured, both for my ſelf and many others? And if Confidence in Chriſt be yet deceit, muſt I not ſay that thou haſt deceived
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59454:39"/>
me? who I know canſt neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or by any falſhood or ſeduction deceive.</p>
               <p>On thee therefore, O my dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, do I caſt and truſt this ſinful ſoul! with <hi>Thee</hi> and with thy <hi>holy Spirit</hi> I renew my Covenant; I <hi>know</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I <hi>have</hi> no other; I <hi>can</hi> have no other Saviour but thy ſelf: To thee I deliver up this ſoul which thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, not to be advanced to the wealth, and honours, and pleaſures of this world; but to be delivered from them, and to be healed of ſin, and brought to God; and to be ſaved from this preſent evil world, which is the portion of the ungodly and unbelievers: to be waſhed in thy Blood, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, quickened and confirmed by thy SPIRIT; and conducted in the ways of holineſs and love: and at laſt to be preſented juſtified and ſpotleſs to the Father of ſpirits, and poſſeſſed of the glory which thou haſt promiſed. O thou that haſt prepared ſo dear a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for the cleanſing of polluted guilty ſouls, leave not this unworthy ſoul in its
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59454:39"/>
guilt, or in its pollution! O thou that knoweſt the Father, and his Will, and art neareſt to him, and moſt beloved of him, cauſe me in my degree to know the Father; acquaint me with ſo much of his will, as concerneth my duty, or my juſt encouragement: leave not my ſoul to grope in darkneſs, ſeeing thou art the Sun and Lord of Light. O heal my eſtranged thoughts of God! is he my light, and life, and all my hope? and muſt I dwell with him for ever? and yet ſhall I know him no better than thus? ſhall I learn no more that have ſuch a Teacher? and ſhall I get no near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er him, while I have a Saviour and a Head ſo near? O give my faith a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proſpect into that better world! and let me not be ſo much unacquainted with the place in which I muſt abide for ever! And as thou haſt prepared a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for holy ſouls, prepare this too-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared ſoul for Heaven, which hath not long to ſtay on earth. And when at death I reſign it into thy hands, receive it as thine own, and finiſh the Work which thou haſt begun, in placing it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59454:40"/>
among the bleſſed Spirits, who are filled with the ſight and love of God. I truſt thee living; let me truſt thee dying, and never be aſhamed of my truſt.</p>
               <p>And unto Thee, the Eternal Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, the Communicative LOVE, who condeſcendeſt to make <hi>Perfect</hi> the Elect of God, do I deliver up this dark imperfect ſoul, to be further renewed, confirmed and perfected, according to the holy Covenant. Refuſe not to bleſs it with thine indwelling and operations; quicken it with thy life; irradiate it by thy light; ſanctifie it by thy love; actuate it purely, powerfully and conſtantly by thy holy motions. And though the way of this thy ſacred influx be beyond the reach of humane apprehenſion; yet let me know the reality and ſaving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, by the happy effects. Thou art more to ſouls, than ſouls to bodies, than light to the eyes. O leave not my ſoul as a carrion deſtitute of thy life; nor its eyes as uſeleſs, deſtitute of thy light; nor leave it as a ſenſeleſs block without thy motion. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membeance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59454:40"/>
of what <hi>I</hi> was without thee, doth make me fear leſt thou ſhouldeſt with-hold thy grace. Alas, <hi>I</hi> feel, <hi>I</hi> daily feel that <hi>I</hi> am dead to all good, and all that's good is dead to me, if thou be not the life of all. Teachings and reproofs, mercies and corrections, yea, the Goſpel it ſelf, and all the livelieſt Books and Sermons, are dead to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am dead to them: yea, God is as no God to me, and Heaven as no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Chriſt as no Chriſt, and the cleareſt evidences of Scripture verity are as no proofs at all, if thou repreſent them not with light and power to my ſoul: Even as all the glory of the world is as nothing to me without the light by which it's ſeen. O thou that haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and given me thoſe heavenly <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> and <hi>deſires,</hi> which fleſh and blood could never give me, ſuffer not my folly to quench theſe ſparks, nor this brutiſh fleſh to prevail againſt thee, nor the powers of hell to ſtifle and kill ſuch a heavenly ſeed. O pardon that folly and wilfulneſs, which hath too often, too obdurately and too unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59454:41"/>
ſtriven againſt thy grace; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from an unkind and ſinful ſoul! I remember with grief and ſhame, how I wilfully bore down thy motions; pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh it not with deſertion, and give me not over to my ſelf. Art thou not in Covenant with me, as my <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and <hi>Confirmer,</hi> and <hi>Comforter?</hi> I never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to do theſe things for my ſelf; but I conſent that thou ſhouldeſt work them on me. As thou art the Agent and Advocate of Jeſus my Lord, O plead his cauſe effectually in my ſoul, againſt the ſuggeſtions of Satan and my unbelief; and finiſh his healing ſaving work; and let not the fleſh or world prevail. Be in me the reſident witneſs of my Lord, the Author of my prayers, the Spirit of Adoption, the Seal of God, and the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of mine inheritance. Let not my nights be ſo long, and my days ſo ſhort, nor ſin eclipſe thoſe beams, which have often illuminared my ſoul. Without thee, Books are ſenſeleſs ſcrawls, ſtudies are dreams, learning is a Glow-Worm, and wit is but wantonneſs, impertinency and folly. Tranſcribe thoſe ſacred precepts
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59454:41"/>
on my heart, which by thy dictates and inſpiration are recorded in thy holy word. I refuſe not thy help for tears and groans: but O ſhed abroad that love upon my heart, which may keep it in a continual life of love. And teach me the work which I muſt do in Heaven: refreſh my ſoul with the delights of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; the joys which ariſe from the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hopes of the everlaſting joys: Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe my heart and tongue in the holy praiſes of my Lord. Strengthen me in ſufferings; and conquer the terrors of Death and Hell. Make me the more heavenly, by how much the faſter I am haſtening to Heaven: and let my laſt thoughts, words and works on earth, be likeſt to thoſe which ſhall be my firſt in the ſtate of glorious immortality; where the Kingdom is delivered up to the Father, and GOD will for ever be <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>In all:</hi> of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things, To whom be glory for ever.</p>

            <head>A Pathetical Meditation on the Paſſion of Chriſt; to be read by Communicants before their reception of the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper.</head>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>WHat is the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It conſiſts of two viſible ſigns, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which by the Lords appointment was to repreſent to the receiver his bloody death, that ſo his Diſciples may keep it freſh in their memories.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is it only to remember that there was a Chriſt, and that he was crucified, and no more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Experience tells us that ſuch a bare remembrance as that, doth little move upon the heart and upon the affections, and ſo will do little or no good. It is not the remembrance of any mans death that doth of it ſelf affect me, but as I conſider him as a <hi>Father,</hi> or as a <hi>Husband,</hi> or as a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59454:42"/>
               <hi>Friend,</hi> with many other expreſſions of his love to me when living, this will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly work upon the heart, ſo as to cauſe ſorrow and grief, and the like.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is it then that I muſt call to mind when I think upon a bleeding and dying Chriſt, ſo as to affect my heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The cruel and bloody <hi>nature</hi> of his Death; here you may conſider the whole ſtory of his Arraignment, his being betrayed by his own Apoſtle, his being ſpit upon and crowned with thorns, his being mocked and jeered by putting a <hi>reed</hi> into his hand inſtead of a <hi>ſcepter,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his bearing of a Croſs, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nailed to it in his hands and feet; after that, his being pierced through with a <hi>ſp<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59454:43"/>
and to give unto us eternal life with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in glory, and this upon our faith and ſincere repentance. Now from all theſe things are your Meditations to be raiſed, before you come to this Sacrament, and when you are receiving of it.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Example of Meditation</hi> I have here ſet you down as followeth.</p>
            <p>Away theſe wanton wandering wordly <hi>thoughts,</hi> you are clogs to my ſoul. Away all trifling worldly <hi>buſineſs,</hi> I cannot now attend your call, my heart hath now ſomething elſe to do. Adieu my <hi>Friends,</hi> farewell my <hi>Husband, Wife</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> I muſt go ſee <hi>my bleeding Lord,</hi> that's dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to me than you all. Come now my ſoul, thou art alone, thou knoweſt the way make haſt and ſeed; look yonder, ſee how the people flock; croſs but this <hi>vale,</hi> and climb but up this <hi>mount,</hi> thou wilt ſoon arrive at bloody <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where thou ſhalt ſee thy bleeding and dying Siviour to ſigh and linger out a dying life on the Croſs in love for thee. This, this might, <hi>Oh my Soul,</hi> have been thy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59454:43"/>
day, and thou might'ſt have been the priſoner; this I ſay <hi>might have been</hi> the day in which thou might'ſt have drunk the bitter cup of the fierce anger of God. But look yonder! there <hi>he</hi> goes that muſt drink up the dregs, and all for <hi>thee.</hi> Look again! there he goes that muſt lay down his life that thou maiſt be reprieved. But come, <hi>my ſoul,</hi> draw up a little nearer, thou canſt not ſee him well at ſo great a diſtance; ſtand here and thou wilt ſee him paſſing; look, there he goes with a train of Virgins following. But ſee how cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe barbarous <hi>Jews</hi> do uſe him, they make him bear his Croſs himſelf, and preſs his wearied fainting limbs above his ſtrength; ſee how they laugh and ſcoff, and wag their heads as if he were their <hi>May-game.</hi> Methinks my heart boils up with rage to ſee theſe cruelties revenged: Oh! how could the bleſſed God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſee his bleſſed Son thus wronged? Why did he not ſend twelve Legions of Angels for his reſcue? Why doth he not ſend down fire from Heaven upon the heads of theſe his Sons enemies, and ſo conſume them? But ſtay <hi>my fooliſh heart,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59454:44"/>
thou knoweſt not what ſpirit thou art of;</hi> this debt was owing, and it muſt be paid; God requires <hi>ſo much,</hi> and it muſt be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, or thou canſt not be ſaved. Thy Lord did know this well enough, for this he came from Heaven, and committed himſelf to the rage of men; he knew he muſt endure all theſe revilings, and doth it grieve thy ſoul to ſee him thus abaſed? Stay but a while, and thou ſhalt ſee him more; look up, <hi>my ſoul,</hi> come, tell me what thou ſeeſt? Oh I cannot, ſorrow tyes my tongue, I cannot ſpeak; I ſee and hear thoſe things that I want a power to utter. I ſee a <hi>troop of Virgins</hi> following him, their <hi>weeping Eyes,</hi> their <hi>blubbering lips,</hi> their <hi>ſighs</hi> and <hi>throbbings</hi> ſpeak them mourners. I ſee my Lord looks towards them, and kindly chides their loving ſorrow, <hi>Why weep ye, Oh ye Daughters of Jeruſalem? weep not for me.</hi> My Lord! what need was there for that queſtion? Should not they <hi>weep</hi> when thou muſt <hi>bleed?</hi> Would not their eyes have been flints if that <hi>then</hi> they ſhould not drop <hi>tears</hi> for thee, when as thou wert about to pour out thy <hi>life</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> for them? Ah! could they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59454:44"/>
chuſe, or do leſs than weep to ſee thine innocent ſelf among a herd of <hi>Tygers!</hi> what ſhould a <hi>Lamb</hi> do there? they ſaw thee in their ravenous jaws about to tear thy heart, to ſuck out all thy blood, and leave thee dead. Have I not ſat and read, and read and wept viewing over the ſtory; and could they forbear that with their watry eyes ſaw this ſcene then <hi>acted?</hi> But whither, O whither, O ye blinded <hi>Jews,</hi> are ye dragging this my Lord? My ſpirit begins to faint, I now can look no longer, my heart now begins to ſwell with grief, it muſt now break, or I muſt vent it at mine eyes in ſtreams! Look! ſee the Hammer and Nails, the Hammer lift up to ſtrike. Bloody man! thou durſt not ſure; ſurely thou doſt not know <hi>whoſe</hi> hands and feet thou art now piercing; it is the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour of the World</hi> Fooliſh heart! ſee how thou art miſtaken; look, ſee it's done, the nails are driven to the head! ſee how the <hi>crimſon tears</hi> run trickling down his hands and feet, and ſee how hardened hearts be laughing at it! Oh ſilly fooliſh blinded men! what laugh you at? This very <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59454:45"/>
now you mock, ſhall be your <hi>Judge;</hi> this very man <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom you have <hi>thus abuſed</hi> ſhall come attended with thouſands of Angels, with the ſound of Trumpets, and ſhall ſit upon your <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> Him whom you now have nailed to a Croſs, <hi>hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour.</hi> What then will you do when that great and terrible day of the Lord ſhall come? How will you look him in the face whom you have <hi>ſpit on?</hi> How will you dare to ſpeak a word for your ſelves to him whom you have <hi>nailed to a tree</hi> and <hi>crucified?</hi> His wounds in <hi>hands, ſide</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> ſhall all bear witneſs againſt you, and his <hi>innocent blood</hi> that you have ſpilt ſhall cry aloud about the throne for vengeance againſt you; your <hi>flouts</hi> ſhall then be turned into <hi>tears,</hi> and your <hi>taunts</hi> into <hi>lamentations.</hi> And how will you then look and cry when God paſſeth ſentence on you, and thruſts you down to Hell to bear the puniſhment of your ſins? this is the Lord that came to ſpare your lives, yet your wickedneſs ſpared not his; and how at length can you think to eſcape with yours?</p>

But once again, look up <hi>my ſoul,</hi> and ſee what is become of thy <hi>nailed</hi> and <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord:</hi> Ah me! he is not <hi>quite</hi> dead, look how he gaſps and pants for life! Oh how his looks are changed! How pale and wan do I ſee his cheeks! the blood and all the ſpirits are quite drawn from them. Methinks he ſhould be dead, for ſee how weak his <hi>neck</hi> is grown, that it is not able to ſupport his <hi>head</hi> that lyes a dying on his <hi>bleeding breaſt.</hi> What yet not <hi>dead!</hi> ſee how he ſhakes and ſtirs his dying limbs! what <hi>gaſps</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> do I hear him fetch, as if his ſoul were ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to get out? Hark, hark, he <hi>ſpeaks!</hi> Oh let me catch the leaſt breath of my dying Saviour. What ſaith my Lord? Hark, what doſt thou not hear! What? <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I am amazed to hear theſe words. How couldſt thou ſuſpect thy Fathers love? How could he be <hi>far from thee,</hi> who was <hi>one with thy ſelf?</hi> But Oh! this is but the voice of his <hi>Manhood,</hi> and not of his <hi>Godhead.</hi> It was the voice of the dying and bleeding <hi>Man Jeſus,</hi> not the voice of the <hi>God Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>

ſent thee to the <hi>ſlaughter-houſe of Hell,</hi> where thou ſhouldeſt have been weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of thy teeth.

Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I feel my bowels turn, my ſpirits melt within me; was ever love like to his love? he was a ſtranger to me: why did he not let me die? It was his Father I did wrong, why did he not let me ſuffer? What if my puniſhment was as great as Hell? ſurely I did deſerve it. What if my pains and ſcreeches were eternal? Ah! I was a creature, a worm, a fly, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him, and what need he have cared? but he loved me; and could he love a priſoner at the Bar? I was a <hi>ſinner,</hi> a <hi>vile polluted</hi> one, methinks he ſhould have <hi>loathed</hi> me; but he did <hi>waſh</hi> thee, and make thee clean again. Ay, but I was

his Fathers <hi>enemy,</hi> and ſo no friend to him; or would he love an enemy? or did he not know ſo much? but how could that be when he ſaw my heart, and the enmity that was in it? yes, he did, and yet he loved thee; <hi>even while we were enemies he died for us.</hi> But why did he love an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy? or how could he do it? I know not why, it is paſt my reaſon to imagine it: <hi>Oh inexpreſſible love!</hi> Oh love paſt <hi>thought!</hi> I cannot fathom thee with my reaſon, thy ways are unaccountable; <hi>he loves becauſe he will love.</hi> And though his love diſpleaſeth us, yet it pleaſeth him to love us. What ails my heart? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find it ſtir? What, dead under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving thoughts of thy deareſt Redeemer! I juſt now ſaid, he loved thee though an enemy, and when thou lovedſt not him; I ſee the enmity is not quite remov'd, thou canſt not love him yet: Ariſe, ſhake up thy ſelf, and look about thee, thou doſt not ſure ſee thy mercy; ſurely thou underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what thou oughteſt to underſtand.

What's this <hi>I</hi> hear! I muſt now anſwer for my life: O what ſhall I ſay! I know not what; I have ſinned, my Conſcience tells me that I have ſinned, the witneſs within will caſt me, I ſee the Inditement writ with blood on my heart; the pride, ſenſuality, and the earthlineſs of which I am charged with, I am not able to deny one tittle. Oh for a mountain to cover me: Oh whither ſhall I go, wither ſhall I flie? That Bed, theſe Curtains, this cloſet cannot hide me.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59454:52"/>
My Mother, Father, Wife or Child, can not help me: O who then ſhall? I run, whither, I know not; vengeance will find me out where ever I go.

Think once again, think that this were the day, and this the very place in which God ſhould come and ſit in Judgement on thee. Methinks I ſee the Heavens bow themſelves: Oh what a crackling do I hear in the Clouds; look yonder! ſee who comes! it is <hi>my Judge;</hi> his countenance is as a flame of fire, he utters his voice like Thunder, the mountains skip, or rather ſhake, or rather tremble. Now, now, is the time of my utter deſtruction near at hand. Oh how ſhall <hi>I</hi> look him in the face! his looks do already affright me! I ſhall not ſay one word, and I have not one Friend

that will ſay one word for me. It's true, I ſee a terrible glorious Troop of Angels that do attend him, but they are all his friends, and therefore all my enemies: I dare not ſpeak a word to them; and alas! if I ſhould, they are all but his ſervants, and fellow-creatures with my ſelf; alas! they cannot, yea they will not help me.

What not ſee it! ſurely thou art blind: If he had not told as much from his own mouth, his eyes and looks beſpeak his love and favour loud and clear enough to thee. But doth he not tell thee, to put thee out of all doubt, this is my well-beloved Son, hear him, hear him: What's that? believe him whatſoever he ſays, why, what ſaith he? O dull and ſtupid heart! haſt thou forgot already! He ſaid he will pay his life for thine; and doth not his Father bid thee hear him? He ſaid he would reconcile thee, love thee, and make thee friends again; And is it not comfort when the Father bids thee believe him: he ſaid, he will pardon, waſh and cleanſe thee, and take thee to himſelf, &amp; betroth thee to him for ever, and after all will give thee to ſee his Glory, even the ſame Glory which he had before the World.

Why do they attend thee from room to room, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee down ſtairs, and out of doors, if it were not but that thou art ſome great Princeſs, nearly allied to their Lord and Maſter?

Bleſſed God I thank thee, for thy Son, thou haſt given his life for the ſpoiler, thou haſt bowed his back to the enemies, long furrows have they plowed upon it, and the day of his calamity they laughed at.

Theſe ſpeak the depth of thy counſels, and the ways of thy mercy paſt finding out, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of thy bowels. Thou haſt made him my Rock, and my ſhield, and my ſtrong tower, and in the day of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row through him thou wilt hear me. To thee, O God, will <hi>I</hi> make my vows, and to thee will I pay them; I will humble my ſelf before thee. I will always lye at the feet of my Redeemer. Lord! his Groſs and his ſhame ſhall be no more a ſtumbling-block to me, I will take it up and follow him, it ſhall be my Crown, my Song, and the glory of my rejoicing. I will enter into thy Courts with joy, and in the Congregations of thy Saints ſhall be my delight; I will remember thy loving-kindneſſes of old, and the days in which thou didſt afflict thy only Son for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59454:67"/>
the ſins of my Soul. I will call to mind the Covenant of thy Grace; and my heart ſhall praiſe thee, when I ſee it founded on blood. Then will I betroth my ſelf to thy Son; join thou, Lord, both our hands and hearts, and we will ſtrike up a match for ever. Praiſe thou the Lord, Oh my ſoul, and all you that love and fear him, praiſe his holy name.</p>

But where are my <hi>ſilken golden twiſts of Faith to hang the jewels of joy and love, and humility upon?</hi> I am never dreſt till they be on. Oh where, where are they?

            <p>BUT is he dead? Oh ſad! yet joyful news! how ſtrangely is my ſoul amazed, and diverſly mov'd and troubl'd by theſe contrary paſſions! methinks <hi>I</hi> could pull up the floodgates of my ſorrow, and vent it out in tears; but ſomething bids me hold. Shall I mourn for him that's juſt now paſt his ſtate of mourning? He's dead! and what of that? And ſo are all his griefs, his bloody ſweats, his ſighs and groans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>He hath drunk on the brook in the way;</hi> bitter while they were in his mouth, and he was living; but ſweet now they have ſunk into his belly, and he in Heaven. Sweet to him, becauſe it was his work, &amp; he hath finiſht it; and ſweet to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59454:75"/>
it was the portion of ſorrow, death, hell, that <hi>I</hi> muſt have taken. And canſt thou mourn! methinks if thou didſt love, thine heart ſhould rather ſympathize with his: He is ſinging, and ſhalt thou be ſighing? <hi>He</hi> is joying that his work is done, and now is welcomed into Heaven by God his Father, and ſhouting up by Angels voices, as the great Conquerour of the hearts of men on earth, and that now in triumph he is returned. And will a mournful weed, a wet eye, and a cloudy brow, become thee at theſe times of Feſtivals? Shall the Heavenly Angels be joyful, and thou ſad? How ſtrangely will this be conſtrued! Will it not be ſaid, thou doſt not love him? or thou doſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy his recovered glory that he had left, and now again hath taken? Or that thou canſt not endure to ſee him wear his Princes Crown in Heaven, that for a time he had laid aſide to come down to the earth to fetch thee thence to Heaven? But ah! my Lord, thou wilt not ſure interpret ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thus; thou haſt not ſure forgot to give a meaning unto tears, to teach a ſigh to ſpeak, and then to know its language!
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59454:76"/>
Hath my Lord forgot ſo ſuddenly that he was on earth, and that he ſweat, and groan'd, and wept, and bled, as well as I do now? What though now all tears, and ſorrow, and ſighing is done away, and he ceaſeth to be any longer ſubject to our infirmities? yet ſure he knows it is not thus with us. I am not yet in Heaven, nor am I yet quite paſt the vale of ſorrow; and it cannot then be ſtrange to him, if he ſees ſometimes our faces look of a ſadder hue than thoſe that are in Heaven. But why ſhould thus my tears be check'd, and my throbbing heart be chidden; were it for a thing of nought <hi>I</hi> might be counted fool or child; but ſhall my Saviour die, and vent his Soul in a ſtream of blood, and all in love to me? and ſhall he thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the world, and die and then be laid in the grave, and I be denied the liberty of following him thither as a mourner? Shall it be ſaid of the Prince of Glory, that he died and had the burial of an Aſs? becauſe there was none to ſorrow forth thoſe words of, <hi>Ah my Lord!</hi> What! ſhall it be granted to a Wife to mourn for the death of a beloved Husband? and to

And ſhall their friends come in and confeſs the loſs and the ground of their ſorrow juſt, and rather ſit them down and bear them company in their grief? And muſt <hi>I</hi> of all be thus cenſur'd? Away with an Husband, Wife, or Child to me: Is he not more to me than ten Husbands? Might I not have had an hundred that would have never done half ſo much for me as he hath done? That firſt left his glory for my ſake, and then laid down his life, and took the ſtroke upon himſelf that I my ſelf deſerved, and all becauſe he lov'd me? Was ever friend like this friend! and ever love, like this love! Many waters cannot quench love; but neither waters, blood, death, nor many deaths could quench his love to me. But ſhall he love, and die in love, and thus be forc'd to leave me, becauſe he lov'd me, and I not mourn the abſence of my beſt Beloved? How unreaſonable may any this deny me! But ah! what a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-worded check did <hi>I</hi> even now receive; as if my ſorrow would ariſe from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying

of his now glorious ſtate, and not from any love <hi>I</hi> bare him! Oh! what needle-pointed words are thoſe! methinks they have pierc'd mine heart in every part and from each prick hath ſtarted forth a drop, that hath ſet it o're with a bloody dew! But how can it once be thought that envy ſhould get a room in an heart that's full of love, with which it ſwells, it bubbles up, and runs all over? it cannot be. Bear witneſs heavens! <hi>I</hi> do not grieve that you contain him, but that <hi>I</hi> on earth have loſt him! Oh my God! I am not ſorry that thy Son hath paſt his ſufferings, and is arriv'd to reſt, and got again into thy boſom, his ancient neſt of love and pleaſure. Oh you bleſſed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Seraphim &amp; Cherubims,</hi> and you <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of the ſpirits of the juſt men made perfect! I</hi> do not envy that you have my Lord with you, that you ſee his face, and live and walk, and joy in the light of his countenance: Alas! we your poor Brethren could not make him ſo welcome here on earth, as you can there: we lov'd him as ſincerely as you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in him, and took delight too in him;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59454:77"/>
but yet nothing near ſo much as you. You know him better than we do; for you know him as you are known, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know better how to prize him. We know him but in part, and the value, price, &amp; love could but be in the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. He is therefore far much better there than here; and how ſhall I then either envy him or you! And what, my ſoul! ſhould <hi>I</hi> wiſh him back again? what if I thought I could prize and love him more, and could promiſe the like for all his beloved diſciples? <hi>I</hi> could not alike engage for the wicked, envious, malicious, unbelieving world; I could not promiſe he ſhould meet with no other <hi>Herod</hi> to ſeek his life, or that the hard-hearted <hi>Jews</hi> would give him better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom they dare yet curſe with the name of Conjurer, though <hi>Moſes</hi> and their Prophets bore witneſs to him, and though they received a ſeal from Heaven in voices, thunders, ſigns, and an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of real Miracles. Oh no! my Lord! though I could wiſh to ſee thy face again on earth, yet not in ſuch a ſtate of miſery in the midſt of a den of

Bears, and Lions, as not long ſince thou waſt. Ah! thou knoweſt I took no delight to hear that traiterous news of thine own <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that had betray'd thee; &amp; that it fill'd mine heart with anguiſh to hear how ſhamefully and ſcornfully thou waſt abuſed. Thou ſaweſt me bluſh when <hi>I</hi> heard thy face was ſpit on; my head did ake when thine was crowned with thorns. Anguiſh and indignation did looſe my nerves, and with a palſie ſhook mine hands, when thine had a Mock Scepter put into them, a reed, and a ſcoff, <hi>Hail Jeſus King of the Jews.</hi> And did not mine heart break and bleed to hear that thine was pierced! Ah my Lord! and ſhall I yet find an heart to wiſh thee here again! No, no, I am glad thou haſt eſcap'd their bloody hands, and now got quite without their reach. I am glad thou haſt got to perfect eaſe and reſt; and know'ſt no pains, nor griefs, nor ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.

What good got you to ſtand and laugh to ſee him ſorrowful? to ſcoff and jeer to hear his lamentations? what curſed rage was that to make ſuch haſte to fetch him vinegar and gall to prolong his life, to lengthen out his dolors? How could you find ſuch barbarous hearts to triumph over a bleeding dying lamb, that was ſo innocent?

ah! but that I know an unbelieving heart my ſelf, and underſtand what hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs means, I ſhould ſtand and wonder!

And when I ſerved my fleſh, how little did I mind them! And when they have been preſented to me in the Goſpel, or in a Sermon told that all theſe tortures he endur'd for me, and I in part believed it too, yet, was <hi>I</hi> not as a man bereft of my ſenſes, and <hi>I</hi> was no more mov'd in mine heart, as if I had not heard or underſtood, and were quite bereav'd of ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But had I thus continued in my ſenſeleſs unbelieving ſtate, and as I liv'd ſo died; yet how deſervedly ſhould I have born the wrath of God, and have been ſent to Hell as a recompence of mine unbelief? And yet, you careleſs ſecure <hi>Jews,</hi> can you think to eſcape when God comes to make inquiſition for blood? How will you do if this ſin ſhall find you out? <hi>If</hi> God requires blood for blood, what will become of yours? If he had

been no more than a common man, the Law would then have required your lives for payment. But how if in the end he prove a <hi>Prophet?</hi> nay more than that, the Son of the moſt high God, the Prince and Saviour whom God had promiſed to raiſe, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets bare witneſs to, and him that you ſo long'd and wiſht to ſee!

In that time of love thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veredſt my nakedneſs, and enteredſt into a Covenant with me, and I became thine own. Thou didſt deliver me from the power of Darkneſs, and tranſlate me into the Kingdom of thy dear Son; and gaveſt me remiſſion of ſin, through his blood. But I am a grievous Revolter, I have forgotten the Covenant of the Lord my God, I was engaged to love thee with all my heart, and to hate iniquity, and ſerve thee diligently, and thankfully to ſet forth thy praiſe. But I have departed from thee, and corrupted my ſelf by ſelf-love, and by loving the world, and the things that are in the world, and have fulfilled the deſires of the fleſh, which I ſhould have crucified. I have neglected my duty to thee, and to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the neceſſary care of my own Salvation. I have been an unprofitable Servant, and have hid thy Talents, and have diſhonoured thee, whom in all things I ſhould have pleaſed and glorified.

I have not duly diſcerned the Lord's Body, but have prophaned thy holy Name and Ordinance, as if the Table of the Lord had been contemptible. And when thou hast ſpoken peace to me, I returned again to folly; I have deſerved, O Lord, to be caſt out of thy preſence, and to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, as I have forſaken thee, and to hear to my confuſion, Depart from me, I know thee not, thou worker of iniquity. Thou mayeſt juſtly tell me, thou haſt no pleaſure in me, nor wilt receive an Offering at my hand. But with thee there is abundant mercy. And my Advocate Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, is the Propitiation for my ſins; who bare them in his Body on the Croſs, and made himſelf an Offering for them, that he might put them away by the Sacrifice of himſelf; have mercy upon me,

Give me to know thy Love in Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge. Though I have not ſeen him, let me love him. And though now I ſee him not, yet believing let me rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory; though I am unworthy of the crumbs that fall from thy Table, yet feed me with the Bread of Life, and ſpeak and ſeal up Peace to my ſinful wounded ſoul.
