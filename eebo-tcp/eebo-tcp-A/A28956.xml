            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may poſsibly in this Volume have expected the <hi>Appendix</hi> which the Author heretofore promiſed, and has intended ſhall contain ſome additional Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to thoſe which were formerly publiſh'd, and are here now reprinted in this Second Edition. Theſe following Anſwers to <hi>Franciſcus Linus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in compenſation of the delay, and for your forbearance of that <hi>Appendix,</hi> which ere long you may expect in kind. For the Author having hinted the Promiſe ſeems thereby to acknowledge the Debt, and to be content to continue the Obligation to ſee it performed. And theſe ought the rather to be his excuſe, becauſe the writing theſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> and publiſhing the <hi>Sceptical Chymiſt,</hi> and ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, have been the principal hindrances to that Piece; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo near a readineſs, that part of it has lyen at the Preſs theſe ſix Moneths: But yet it being not all perfected, the Stationer was loth to delay any longer the Publication of theſe, for which he has been ſo frequently call'd upon. And they (though a <hi>Latine</hi> Edition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) appear now the rather in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they may accompany the Second Edition of the Original Experiments, which were printed firſt in that Language in <hi>Octavo;</hi> and that inſtead of the promiſed <hi>Appendix</hi> they may complete the bulk of the <hi>Quarto</hi> Volume.</p>
            <p>As for that part of this Piece that concerns Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> it might have been larger: but the information that the Author had that the
<pb facs="tcp:57681:3"/>
learned Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> was writing againſt ſome paſſages in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his <hi>Dialogues</hi> (as well that <hi>concerning the Air</hi> as the reſt) was the occaſion why his H. would make no animadverſion on ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therein, and thought it not fit to enlarge upon others. And for the <hi>Errata</hi> of the Preſs I hope they will not be many: however the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor as to theſe is to be excuſed, who never (in regard to his Eyes and Impediments on other occaſions) gives himſelf the trouble of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> and <hi>Reviſes;</hi> neither could the Publiſher much attend the Preſs, it being printed in a diſtant place from his uſual abode. If, as I wiſh, you ſhall find this jealouſie of mine to have been cauſleſs, you will have reaſon to give the Piece that is ſo kindly offered, and leads you ſuch rare and untrodden paths in the beſt way of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the fairer entertainment and acceptance.

               <hi>THE AVTHOR's</hi> PREFACE AND DECLARATION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey that know how indiſpos'd I naturally am to Contentiouſneſs, will, I preſume, wonder to ſee me publickly engaged in two Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies at once. But that I am ſtill as averſe as ever from entering into Diſputes that may handſomly be declin'd, the way wherein I have managed the following Controverſies will, I hope, evince. And the Inducements I now have to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick are ſuch, that it would be hard for me to reſiſt the being prevail'd on by them.</p>
            <p>For, in the firſt place, I was (by Name, as it were) challenged by a perſon, who undertook to diſprove not one or two of my Conjectures, but as much of the whole Body of my Treatiſe as concern'd the Spring of the Air, which moſt of my Explications ſuppoſe. And this being done by a Learned Man, who writes very confidently of the goodneſs of his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Book being ſoon after follow'd by another written by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> a man of Name in the World; there ſeem'd to be ſome danger that ſo early an Oppoſition might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Doctrine I had propos'd, before it was well underſtood and duly ponder'd. Wherefore I fear'd I might be wanting to the Truth and my ſelf, if I ſhould at ſuch a time be altogether ſilent; eſpecially ſince I might probably divert many who would otherwiſe be forward to appear againſt us, by letting them ſee how defenſible our Doctrine is even againſt ſuch Adverſaries as
<pb facs="tcp:57681:4"/>
hoſe I have reply'd to. And this courſe I the rather choſe, that in caſe I ſhould henceforward comply with thoſe who would have me forbear to write any further of theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, it might not be preſently inferr'd from my ſilence, that a good Cauſe cannot enable a Pen no better then mine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</p>
            <p>But I ſcarce doubt but that intelligent Readers, eſpecially thoſe that are imbued with the Principles of the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy, will be much more apt to think that I had reaſon to write the following Diſcourſes, then to think that I had any to make them ſo prolix: And eſpecially ingenious men, that are accuſtomed to admit nothing that either is not intelligible, or is precarious, will think divers of the Objections I reply to needed no Anſwers, or at leaſt no ſolemn ones. But to theſe I have four things to repreſent.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, That which not a little ſwells the bulk of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſes, is the inſerting thoſe paſſages of my Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that I examine in their own words: which being a Practice that I expect from any that ſhall think fit to animadvert upon any Opinion or Argument of mine; I thought it but equitable to do what I deſir'd to have done to me, though oftentimes I could not do it in a little room.</p>
            <p>Next, I was the more willing to proſecute ſome of <hi>Franciſcus Linus</hi> his Objections, becauſe the fear of being reduc'd to grant a <hi>Vacuum</hi> has ſo prevail'd with many eminent perſons bred up in the received Philoſophy of the Schools, that though they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree both with him and among themſelves about the particular manner of ſolving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet they agree in aſcribing them to ſome extremely-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refi'd ſubſtance that fills up the ſpace deſerted by the Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So that this Opinion, as to the main, being approved by many eminent Schoalrs, eſpecially of that moſt learned Order of the Jeſuites, (to whom perhaps its Congruity to ſome Articles of their Religion chiefly recommends it) I was willing to pay them that reſpect, as not to diſſent from perſons, divers of whom
<pb facs="tcp:57681:4"/>
for their eminence in Mathematicks and other Learning I much eſteem, without ſhewing that I do it not but upon Conſiderations that I think weighty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though the Examiners <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> have but few, and not very conſiderable, Arguments to countenance it; yet his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt our Doctrine (the Reply to which takes up the firſt Part of the following Treatiſe) are ſuch, as though they may be ſolidly anſwered by any that throughly underſtands our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> yet they may chance puzzle ſuch Readers as do not, and theſe poſſiblywill prove more then a few.</p>
            <p>And, Laſtly, becauſe that ſometimes when the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment objected did not perhaps deſerve to be much inſiſted on, the Argument treated of deſerv'd to be conſidered; I thought it not amiſs to make uſe now and then of ſome ſuch opportunities to illuſtrate the matter it ſelf under conſideration: Which I the rather did for theſe two Reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe I find that, except by ſome able Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and very few other contemplative men, the Doctrine of the Spring of the Air, at leaſt as I have propoſed it, is not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently apprehended, (and therefore needs to be inclucated.) Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that through a great part of ſome late Diſcourſes of men otherwiſe eminently learned, (written againſt other Elateriſts, not me) there ſeems to run ſo great and clear a miſtake, perhaps for want of skill in the <hi>Hydroſtaticks,</hi> that I can ſcarce impute it to any thing, but to their not throughly underſtanding the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> they would confute.</p>
            <p>And, next, becauſe I was willing to lay down in my Anſwer to the Objections I examin'd, the grounds of anſwering ſuch other Arguments as may be built upon the ſame or the like Principles. And perhaps I may truly enough ſay, that in the following Treatiſe I have already in effect anſwered ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, written ſome before and ſome ſince mine, by learned men, about the <hi>Torricellian</hi> and other new Experiments relating to a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> though I forbore to mention the names or words of the Authors, becauſe I found not that my Writings or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:57681:5"/>
were as yet known to them. To theſe things I may adde, that I thought the Diſcourſes of <hi>Linus</hi> the fitter to be inſiſted on, becauſe he ſeems to have more diligently then ſome others, (who yet venture to diſpute againſt it) enquired into our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And I ſhall not ſcruple to ſay thus much of an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (and one to whom I gave no provocation to be ſo) that though I dare not ſpeak in general of thoſe that have written ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Weight of the Air, or elſe For or Againſt a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> becauſe (as I acknowledge in the firſt Chapter following) I cannot yet procure the Books of divers learned men, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe great Perſonages, <hi>Robervall, Balianus</hi> and <hi>Caſatus;</hi> yet among the Writers I have hitherto met with, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Ariſtotelean</hi> Rarefaction and Condenſation in the Controverſies under debate, ſcarce any ſeems to have contrived his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> better then our <hi>Linus.</hi> Not that I think his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is either true, or (at leaſt to ſuch as I) intelligible; but that the <hi>Funiculus</hi> he aſſumes being allow'd him, he may, for a Reaſon to be touch'd a little below, make out, though not all the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of my Experiments, yet many more of them then moſt other Pleniſts, that deny the Spring of the Air, can deduce from their <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> if granted. And in regard that, whereas we aſcribe to the Air a Motion of Reſtitution outwards, he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to it the like Motion inwards, it cannot but happen that, though the Principles cannot both be true, yet many of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> may be explicable by which of them ſoever is granted: becauſe of this, I ſay, it is not ſo eaſie as many ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may be apt to think, to draw pertinent Objections from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience againſt the Adverſary I have to deal with. Which Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, leſt, as ſome may think I have employ'd more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then I needed, ſo others ſhould think I have omitted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; as indeed I have omitted ſome, that I might pertinently have employ'd.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſort of Perſons beſides thoſe I mention'd at the beginning of this Preface, to whom I muſt addreſſe the remaining part of it; namely, to thoſe who ſeem troubled,
<pb facs="tcp:57681:5"/>
that I ſuffer my ſelf to be diverted either by <hi>Linus</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> from perfecting thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental <note place="margin">About the Hiſtory of Flame, of Heat, of Colours, of the Origine of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Forms, &amp;c.</note> Treatiſes that are lying by me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt promis'd by the learned Publiſher of the Latine Edition of my <hi>Eſſays;</hi> and from proſecuting thoſe wayes of enquiry into the Nature of things, wherein they are pleas'd to think I may be more ſerviceable to reall Learning and the Lovers of it. And I confeſs that theſe Mens Reaſons and Perſwaſions have ſo far prevailed with me, that after what I have done in the two following Treatiſes, to Vindicate my Writings from the Objections made againſt them by two Learned men of very differing <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> and thereby to ſhew in ſome meaſure that I am not altogether unacquainted with the way of defending oppos'd Truths, I have laid aſide the thoughts of writing any more diſtinct or entire <hi>Polemicall</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes about the Subjects already diſputed of. And to this I am invited by ſeveral other Reaſons (beſides what I have newly intimated.)</p>
            <p>For firſt, as I elſewhere declare, it was not my chief Deſign to eſtabliſh Theories and Principles, but to deviſe Experiments, and to enrich the Hiſtory of Nature with Obſervations faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made and deliver'd; that by theſe, and the like Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by others, men may in time be furniſh'd with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtock of Experiments to ground <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> and <hi>Theorys</hi> on. And though in my <hi>Phyſico-Mechanicall</hi> Epiſtle and my <hi>Specimens</hi> I have ventur'd ſome Conjectures alſo at the Cauſes of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> I relate, leſt the Diſcourſe ſhould appear to inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Readers too jejune; yet (as I formerly ſaid) I propos'd my Thoughts but as Conjectures deſign'd (though not only, yet chiefly) to excite the Curioſity of the Ingenious, and afford ſome hints and aſſiſtance to the Diſquiſitions of the Speculative. And accordingly I have not forborn to mention divers things, which judicious Readers may eaſily perceive I foreſaw that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would think unfavourable to the Opinions I inclin'd to. So that for me to leave Experimental for Controverſial Studies,
<pb facs="tcp:57681:6"/>
were a courſe unſuitable to the principal ſcope of my Writings.</p>
            <p>Next, though I have adventur'd to improve the Doctrine of the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Weight</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> by ſome Supplements where I found it deficient, and to recommend it by ſome new Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Arguments deduc'd from my Experiments: yet the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> themſelves (for the main) being the Opinions alſo of far learneder Men then I, it might be thought injurious both to them and to our common Cauſe, if I ſhould needleſly go about to hinder them from the Honour of Vindicating the Truths we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in; eſpecially, ſome of them being Excellent <hi>Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and others Eminent <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> whoſe Concern to maintain the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> againſt Objections, if any ſhall ariſe, is equal to mine, and whoſe leiſure and abilities far exceed thoſe of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who both is ſickly, and hath other employments enough, and who (if he were far better skil'd in <hi>Geometry</hi> then he pretends to be) hath ſuch a weakneſs in his Eyes, as makes him both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and unfit to engage in any Study where the converſing with Mathematical Schemes is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, nor do I ſee much cauſe to doubt that the things I have deliver'd will notwithſtanding my ſilence be left undefended: The forwardneſs I have already obſerv'd in divers <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate thoſe Writings, which they are pleas'd to ſay have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd them, and to ſave me the labour of penning the following Treatiſes, ſcarce permitting me ſuch an Apprehenſion. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince there are ſome things that will much facilitate their Task, if not keep men from putting them upon it. For though Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Linus</hi> have examin'd my Writings upon Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherein they differ as much from each other as from me; yet neither have they ſeen cauſe to deny any thing that I deliver as Experiment, nor have their Objections been conſiderable, whether as to Number or to Weight, againſt the Applications I have made of my Principles to ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> So that uſually without objecting any Incongruity to my particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, they are fain to fall upon the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> themſelves: in whoſe Defence I think I may with the more Reaſon expect to
<pb facs="tcp:57681:6"/>
be ſeconded, becauſe not only I have endeavour'd, as I formerly noted, to lay the grounds of anſwering ſuch Objections as I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw might ariſe; but I have alſo, to prevent or eaſe their labour, written the two firſt Parts of my Defence againſt <hi>Linus,</hi> without being oblig'd to do ſo for the Vindicating of my Explications, which are particularly maintain'd in the third Part.</p>
            <p>I know not whether I may venture to adde on this Occaſion, That thoſe who have taken notice of the uſefulneſs of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to true Philoſophy, and have obſerv'd that nevertheleſſe the Difficulty, Trouble, and Charge of making them is ſuch, that even in this Learned Age of ours there are very few <hi>Bacon's</hi> or <hi>Merſennus's</hi> to be met with, and thoſe who have either made themſelves, or at leaſt ſeen others make Experiments, even ſuch as thoſe I have publiſh'd, with the care I am wont to think my ſelf oblig'd to employ on ſuch Occaſions; will perhaps not only believe that they coſt me far more time and pains then they that have not made or ſeen ſuch tryals are apt to imagine, but will poſſibly think it enough for a Perſon that is not by Profeſſion a Scholar, to make them carefully, and ſet them down faithfully, and will allow him to let others Vindicate the Truths he may have the good fortune to diſcover, eſpecially, when there are ſo many fitter for it then he, who have (as well as his Adverſaries) more leiſure to write Diſputations then opportunity to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Experiments; the latter of which to be perform'd as it ought to be, doth in many caſes, beſides ſome Dexterity ſcarce to be gain'd but by Practice, require ſometimes more Diligence, and oftentimes too more Coſt, then moſt are willing, or then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are able, to beſtow upon them.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, though if any thing very worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by me be ſuggeſted againſt any of my chief Opinions or Explications, I may either take an occaſion to ſay ſomewhat to it elſewhere, or at leaſt have an opportunity to conſider it in a Review, wherein I may alter, mend, ſupply, vindicate or retract divers Paſſages of my other Writings: yet I would not have it expected that I ſhould exchange a Book with every one that is
<pb facs="tcp:57681:7"/>
at leiſure to write one againſt a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or about the <hi>Air.</hi> Which Declaration I make, not that I think it will or ought to hinder any man from making uſe of his liberty to expreſſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if he ſees cauſe; but for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>one,</hi> That my ſilence might not injure either the Truth or my ſelf, by tempting men to think, that whatever I do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I cannot; but might give unbiaſs'd and judicious Readers a Caution to allow as little of Advantage to the Writings of my adverſaries upon the account of their being unanſwer'd by me, as if I were no longer in the World. And the <hi>other,</hi> That I may not hinder thoſe who would reply to ſuch Adverſaries, by leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them an apprehenſion that either I may prevent them, or they me. To conclude, I ſee no cauſe to deſpair, that whether or no my Writings be protected, the Truths they hold forth will in time in ſpite of oppoſition eſtabliſh themſelves in the Minds of men, as the Circulation of the Bloud, and other formerly much conteſted Truths have already done. My Humour has na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally made me too careful not to offend thoſe I diſſent from, to make it neceſſary for any man to be my Adverſary upon the account of Perſonal Injuries or Provocations. And as for any whom either Judgment or Envy may invite to contend, that the things I have communicated to the World deſerved not ſo much Applauſe as they have had the luck to be entertain'd with; that ſhall make no Quarrel betwixt us: For perhaps I am my ſelf as much of that mind as he; and however I ſhall not ſcruple to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs my ſelf one of thoſe who is more deſirous to ſpend his time uſefully, then to have the Glory of leaving nothing that was ever written againſt him unanſwer'd; and who is more ſollicitous to purſue the wayes of diſcovering Truth, then to have it thought that he never was ſo much ſubject to Humane Frailties as to miſs it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Newly publiſhed Treatiſe, <hi>De Corporum inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate,</hi> being brought to my Hands, I find ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chapters of it employ'd to oppoſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications I ventur'd to give of ſome of my <hi>new Experiments touching the Spring of the Air.</hi> Wherefore though I am very little delighted to be engag'd in Controverſies, and though I be not at preſent without Employments enough (of a private, and of a publick
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57681:8"/>
Nature) to make it unſeaſonable for me, to be by a Work of this ſort diverted from them; yet for the Reaſons ſpecified in the Preface, I hold it not amiſs to examine briefly what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the thing I have delivered: and the rather, partly, becauſe the Learned Author, whoever he be (for 'tis the Title-Page of his Book that firſt acquainted me with the name of <hi>Franciſcus Linus)</hi> having forborne provoking Language in his Objections, allowes me in anſwering them to comply with my Inclinations &amp; Cuſtom of exerciſing Civility, even where I moſt diſſent in point of Judgement. Beſides, the Author himſelfe has ſomewhat facilitated my Reply to him, by directing me in the ninth Page to ſome Books and Paſſages that I had not, when I publiſht my Epiſtle, either ſeen or taken notice of. As indeed there are beſides ſome of theſe ſeveral other Diſcourſes that treat of the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiments, which though by the names of their Authors I gueſs to be learnedly written, I have not to this day had opportunity to peruſe, my ſtay in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> (whither Philoſophical Books were not, in that time of publick Confuſion, brought) having kept me from hearing of divers of them, till they were all bought up. Which I here mention, to excuſe my ſelf if I have not taken notice of ſome things or paſſages to be met with in theſe Writings, which their Learned Authors or Inquiſitive Readers might juſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps expect I ſhould take ſome notice of, in caſe thoſe Writings had fallen into my hands. But to digreſs no further.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, and it ſomewhat troubles me that it is ſo, that I can ſcarce promiſe my ſelf to make my Adverſary a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte, ſince he without ſcruple aſſumes thoſe very things as Principles, that to me ſeem almoſt as great Inconveniences as I would deſire to ſhew any Opinion I diſlike, to be liable unto. But ſince whatever Operation the following Diſcourſe may have upon the Perſon that occaſion'd it, I hope it may bring ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to thoſe Philoſophers who can as little as I underſtand the <hi>Ariſtotelean</hi> Rarefaction, and who will as well as I be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to admit what they cannot underſtand; it ſhall ſuffice me
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57681:8"/>
to defend the Truths I have deliver'd, if I cannot be ſo happy as to convince my acute Adverſary of them; and I ſhall not believe my labour loſt, if this Diſcourſe can contribute to the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Notions in Philoſophy that I think not inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in the minds of thoſe whoſe clear Principles make me the moſt reſpect their Judgements, and for whoſe ſakes I principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly write.</p>
                  <p>Now though I be not in ſtrictneſs oblig'd to defend any more then ſuch of my own Explications as the Examiner has thought fit to queſtion, and thoſe Particulars which I have added by way of Improvement to the two <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the Spring and Weight of the Air: yet that I may the more effectually proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what I lately intimated I aim at in this Writing, and may as well illuſtrate my Doctrine as defend it, I ſhall divide the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe into three Parts; whereof the firſt is deſign'd to anſwer my Adverſaries Objections againſt our Principles; the ſecond ſhall examine the Funicular <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> he would ſubſtitute in their ſtead; and the third ſhall contain particular Replyes to what he alledges againſt ſome of my particular Explications.</p>

                  <p>ALthough our Author confeſſes in his ſecond Chapter, that the Air has a Spring as well as a Weight, yet he reſolutely denies that Spring to be near great enough to perform thoſe things which his Adverſaries (whom for brevities ſake we will venture to call <hi>Elateriſts)</hi> aſcribe to it. And his whole fourth Chapter, as the Title declares, is imploy'd to prove that the Spring of the Air is unable in a cloſe place to keep the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſuſpended in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment. The proof of this Aſſertion he ſayes is eaſie: But alledges two or three Arguments for it, which I think will be more eaſily anſwer'd then his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion evinc'd.</p>
                  <p>In the Firſt he ſayes that thoſe Experiments concerning the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57681:9"/>
Adheſion of ones finger, &amp;c. which he had mentioned in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>eodem modo ſe habent in loco clauſo ac in aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> But the anſwering of this we ſhall ſuſpend till anon; partly, becauſe it may then be more conveniently examin'd, and partly, becauſe our Author ſeems not to build much upon it, his chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument being that which he propoſes in theſe words, <hi>Cum tota vis hujus Elaterii pendeat à refutato jam aëris aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondio cum digitis 29½ argenti vivi, ita ut nec plus, nec</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>minus faciat hoc elaterium in loco occluſo, quam fit per il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud aequipondium in loco aperto; manifeſtum est, cum jam oſtenſum ſit fictitium planè eſſe hujuſmodi aequipondium, fictitium quoque eſſe tale elaterium.</hi> Wherefore ſince all the validity of his Objection againſt the Spring of the Air depends upon his former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein he thinks he has diſprov'd the Weight of the Air; it will behove us to look back into the former Chapter, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the four Arguments which he there propoſes. But I muſt crave leave to vary from his method, and conſider the third in the firſt place, becauſe the removal of that Objection will faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate and ſhorten the anſwer to the reſt. His Third Argument therefore is thus ſet down. <hi>Nam ſi Tubus viginti tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum digitorum (quo uſi ſumus in primo Argumento) non</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note>

Unde ſi loco illius aëris ponatur aqua, aliuſve liquor qui non tam facilè extenditur, deſcenſus nullus erit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hinc, inquam, contra hanc ſententiam formatur argumentum: nam ſi externus ille aër neque at velhos viginti digitos argenti à lapſu ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentare, uti jam vidimus, quomodo quaeſo ſuſtentabit 29½? Certè haec nullatenus reconciliari poſſunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to this Argument, which he thinks ſo irreconcilable with his Adverſaries <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> he has himſelf furniſht them with an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57681:9"/>
Anſwer in theſe words, <hi>Dices forte ideo argentum in hoc caſu de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendere, quia deorſum truditur ab aëre illo ſeſe per ſuum Elaterium dilatante.</hi> Which Anſwer I think ſufficient for the Objection, notwithſtanding the two exceptions he takes at it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, whereas he ſayes, that <hi>ſic deberet digitus potius à tubo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelli, quam eidem affigi, cum non minus ſurſum quam deorſum fiat hujuſmodi dilatatio:</hi> He conſiders not, that though the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the included Air to expand it ſelfe be at firſt every way alike, yet the expanſion it ſelfe in our caſe muſt neceſſarily be made downward, and not upward; becauſe the Finger that ſtops the Tube being expos'd on the upper parts and the ſides to the external Air, has the whole Weight and preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> upon it; and conſequently cannot be thruſt away but by a force capable to ſurmount that preſſure: whereas on the lower ſide of the Included Air there is the Weight of the whole <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> to aſſiſt the Spring of the Air, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the Weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> that gravitates upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury.</hi> So that the Air included and endeavouring to expand it ſelfe, finding no aſſiſtance to expand it ſelf upward, and a conſiderable one to expand it ſelfe downward, it is very natural that it ſhould expand it ſelfe that way whence it finds leſs reſiſtance. As accordingly it will happen, till the Spring of the Air be ſo far debilitated by its Expanſion, that its preſſure, together with the weight of the <hi>Mercury</hi> that remains ſuſpended, will but counter-balance, not overcome, the preſſure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury.</hi> And this Explication may be confirm'd by this trial that I have purpoſely made, namely, that if in ſtead of Quickſilver you employ Water, and leave as before in the Tube an Inch of Air, and then inverting it, open it under Water, you will perceive the included Inch of Air not to dilate it ſelfe any thing near (for I need not here define the Proportion) halfe ſo far as it did when the Tube was almoſt fill'd with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> becauſe the Weight of ſo ſhort a <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Water does but equal that of between an Inch and an Inch and an halfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Quickſilver, and conſequently the inward Air is far leſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57681:10"/>
aſſiſted to dilate it ſelf and ſurmount the preſſure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air by the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Water then by that of <hi>Mercury.</hi> And as for what our Author ſayes, that if inſtead of Air, Water or ſome other Liquor be left at the top of the Tube, the Quick-ſilver will not deſcend: the <hi>Elateriſts</hi> can readily ſolve that <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> by ſaying that Water has either no Spring at all, or but an exceeding weak one; and ſo ſcarce preſſes but by its Weight, which in ſo ſhort a <hi>Cylinder</hi> is inconſiderable. Now the ſame ſolution we have given of our Examiners Objection, gives us alſo an account why the Finger is ſo ſtrongly faſtned to the upper part of the Orifice of the Tube it ſtops; for the included Air being ſo far dilated that an Inch, for example, left at firſt in the upper Part of the Tube, reaches twice or thrice as far as it did before the deſcent of the Quick-ſilver, its ſpring muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably weakned. And conſequently that part of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is within the Tube will have much leſs preſſure againſt it from the dilated Air within, then the upper part of the ſame Finger will have from the unrarefi'd Air without. By which means the Pulp of the Finger will be thruſt in (which our Author is pleas'd to call ſuckt in) as we ſhall ere long have occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>in our Anſwer</hi> to his ſecond Argument.</p>
                  <p>And having ſaid thus much to our Authors firſt exception againſt the ſolution he foreſaw we would give of his third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; we have not much to ſay at preſent to his ſecond. For whereas he ſayes, <hi>Concipi non poſſe quomodo aër ille ſic ſe dilatet, argentumque deorſum trudat, niſi occupando</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>majorem locum: Quod tamen hi Autores quam maxime refugiunt, aſſerentes rarefactionem non aliter fieri, quam per cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcula aut vacuitates:</hi> I wiſh he had more clearly expreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſince as his words are couch'd I cannot eaſily gueſs what he means, and much leſs eaſily diſcern how they make an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt his Adverſaries. For, ſure he thinks them not ſo abſurd, as to imagine that the Air can dilate it ſelf, and thruſt down the <hi>Mercury,</hi> without in ſome ſenſe taking up more room then it did before: For the very word <hi>Dilatation,</hi> and the effect
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57681:10"/>
they aſcribe to the included Air, clearly imply as much; ſo that I ſee not why he ſhould ſay that they are ſo averſe from granting the Air to take up more Place then before, eſpecially ſince he takes notice in the former Chapter, that we compare the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of the Air to that of compreſs'd Wooll; and ſince he here alſo annexes that we explicate Rarefaction either by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles or Vacuities. But this later Clauſe makes me ſuſpect his meaning to be, that the <hi>Elateriſts</hi> do not admit that the ſame Air may <hi>adequately</hi> fil more of Place at one time then at another; which I believe to be as true as that the ſelf-ſame lock of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Wooll has no more Hairs in it, nor does adequately fill more Place with them, when it is permitted to expand it ſelf, then whileſt it remain'd compreſs'd. But againſt this way of Rarefaction our Author here has not any Objection, unleſs it be intimated in theſe words, <hi>Concipi non poteſt:</hi> Which if it be, I ſhall need only to mind him in this place, that whereas many of the chiefeſt Philoſophers, both of Ancient and our own times, have profeſt they thought not the <hi>Ariſtotelean</hi> way of Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>conceivable;</hi> and he acknowledges (as we ſhall ſee anon) that it is not <hi>clear;</hi> what the ableſt of his Party (the modern <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts)</hi> are wont to object againſt the way of Rarefaction he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, is, that it is not <hi>true,</hi> not that it is not <hi>intelligible.</hi>

                  <p>OUr Authors Second Objection (for ſo I reckon it) is thus propos'd by him. <hi>Si ſumatur tubus utrinque apertus, ſed longior, put a digitorum 40. Argentoque impleatur, eique</hi>

                  <p>Thus far our Authors objection, in anſwer whereunto I have divers things to repreſent, to ſhew, that a good account may be given of this Experiment in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Elaterists,</hi> which is ſufficient to manifeſt how far the argument is from being ſo unanſwerable as the propoſer of it would perſwade his Reader.</p>
                  <p>I deny then that the Finger is drawn downward, or made by ſuction to adhere to the Tube; but I explicate that which he calls the ſuction of the Finger, as I lately did in anſwer to his third Argument, as we ſhall more particularly ſee anon.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes indeed, that the Air which thruſt up the Quickſilver cannot ſo ſtrongly draw down the Finger. As if the Air were not a fluid body, but a ſingle and entire pillar of ſome ſolid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But to ſhorten our reply to his objections, the beſt way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will be briefly to explicate the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>When the Tube is fill'd with Quickſilver, the Finger that ſtops the upper Orifice is almoſt equally preſs'd above and at the ſides by the contiguous Air; but when the lower Finger is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, then the Cylinder of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which before gravitated upon the Finger, comes to gravitate upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and by its intervention to preſs againſt the outward Air: ſo that againſt thoſe parts of the Finger that are contiguous to the Air there is all the wonted preſſure of the outward Air; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as againſt that pulp that is contiguous to the <hi>Mercury</hi> there is not ſo much preſſure as againſt the other parts of the Finger by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57681:12"/>
two thirds. I ſay by two thirds, or thereabout, becauſe the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial</hi> Cylinder in this Experiment is ſuppos'd to be twenty Inches high; and if it were but a little more then thirty Inches high, (which is a third more) then the weight of the Quickſilver would take off not two thirds onely, but the whole preſſure of the outward Air, from the above-mentioned pulp of the Finger. For in that caſe the Quickſilver would quite deſert it, and ſettle beneath it. Wherefore ſince it has appeared by our Anſwer to the Examiners third Argument, That the preſſure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air is taken off from the body that remains in the upper part of the Tube, according to the weight of the liquor ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Tube; and ſince in our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the preſſure of the outward Air is able to keep thirty Inches of Quickſilver, or two or three and thirty foot of Water, ſuſpended in a Tube; it need be no great wonder, if a preſſure of the ambient Air, equal to the weight of a Cylinder of Water of near twenty two foot long, ſhould be able to thruſt in the pulp of the Finger at the upper Orifice of the Tube, and make it ſtick cloſely enough to the lip of it.</p>
                  <p>I know the Examiner affirms, That no thruſting or preſſure from without can ever effect ſuch an adheſion of the Finger to the Tube. But this ſhould be as well prov'd as ſaid. But, firſt, though I am willing to think the Examiner would not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly relate any thing he is not perſwaded of; yet as far as I and another perſon very well vers'd in theſe Experiments have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely tryed, I could not find the Adheſion of the Finger to the Tube to be near ſo ſtrong as our Author hath related. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you carefully endeavour by preſſure and otherwiſe to thruſt the pulp of your Finger into the Orifice of the Tube, you may through the Glaſs perceive it to be manifeſtly tumid in the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pipe. And if by preſſing your Finger againſt the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Tube, you ſhould not make the pulp adhere quite ſo ſtrongly to the Tube, nor ſwell quite ſo much within it, as may happen in ſome <hi>Mercurial</hi> Experiments; it is to be conſider'd, that the Air being a fluid as well as a heavy body, it does not (as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57681:12"/>
groſſer Weights would) preſs only againſt the upper part of the Finger, but preſſing as much of the finger as is expos'd to it almoſt every where, and almoſt uniformly, as well as ſtrongly, it does by its lateral preſſure on every ſide thruſt in the Pulp of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the hole where there is not any reſiſtance at all, or at leaſt near ſo much preſſure againſt the Pulp as that of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air againſt the parts of the Finger contiguous to it.</p>
                  <p>By this it may appear that we need not borrow the Objection our Author offers to lend us; namely, that in the Experiment under conſideration the Quickſilver is preſs'd downward by the Spring of ſome Air lurking betwixt it and the Finger. (Though I am prone to think that unleſs the Experiment be made with a great deal of care, ſuch a thing may eaſily happen, and contribute to the ſtronger Adheſion of the Finger to the Tube.) This I ſay may appear notwithſtanding what our Author Objects, that the Air expanding it ſelf wil thruſt away the Finger upwards, ſince the contrary of that pretence we have lately manifeſted in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Third Argument. And as for what he adds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Argumentation in theſe Words, <hi>Quod vel inde confirmatur, Quia cum praponderans ille aër ſuccedat</hi>

So that although both the lower Finger do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed keep up the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube, and the preſſure of the outward Air would do ſo too; yet there is this difference, that the preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> depending upon its Weight, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be intended and weakned as we pleaſe, as can that of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt Finger.

                  <p>This Experiment I remember I made ſome years ago, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly 'tis alledg'd in the Fourth Eſſay of the Treatiſe (I was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57681:13"/>
then writing) to prove againſt the Vulgar Opinion, that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors do not to prevent a <hi>Vacuum</hi> ſpontaneouſly aſcend, which I preſume will be ſo far allow'd of by our Author, who would have Liquors ſuppos'd to be rais'd by Suction violently drawn up by the contraction of his <hi>Funiculus.</hi> But to examine this Experiment, as it concerns the preſent Controverſie, we may recal to mind that we formerly ſhew'd in the Anſwer to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Third Argument, That when the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> that leans upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> has at the other end of it Air, kept from any entercourſe with the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> that included Air has ſo much of the Preſſure of the external Air taken off from it as counterpoiſes the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder.</hi> And the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is expos'd to the whole Preſſure of the ambient Air in ſome of its Parts, and in others but to the much fainter Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the included Air, endures an unuſual Preſſure from the preponderating Power of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may conſider alſo that there is againſt the <hi>Thorax</hi> and thoſe Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> that are ſubſervient to Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Preſſure of the whole ambient Air. Which Preſſure, notwithſtanding the Muſcles deſign'd for the uſe of Reſpiration, are able without any conſiderable reſiſtance to dilate the <hi>Thorax</hi> at pleaſure; becauſe, as faſt as they open the Cheſt, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it weaken the Spring of that Air which is then within the Body, the external Air by flowing in, for want of finding the uſual reſiſtance there, keeps that within the <hi>Thorax</hi> in an <hi>Aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi> of force with that without. Theſe things premiſed, 'tis not difficult in our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to give an Anſwer to the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Experiment. For we ſay when a <hi>Cylinder</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> is rais'd in the Tube to any conſiderable height, the Preſſure of the Air in the <hi>Thorax</hi> is leſſen'd by the whole weight of that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Cylinder,</hi> and conſequently the Reſpiratory Muſcles are thereby diſabled to dilate the Cheſt as freely as they were wont, by reaſon of the Prevalency of the undiminiſh'd Preſſure of the external Air againſt the weakned Preſſure of the internal: But if in ſtead of <hi>Mercury,</hi> you ſubſtitute Water, ſo ſhort a <hi>Cylinder</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57681:14"/>
of that comparatively light Liquor takes off ſo little of the Preſſure of the included Air, that it comes into the Lungs with almoſt its uſual Strength, and conſequently with almoſt as much Force as the outward Air preſſes with againſt the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on this occaſion there occurrs to my thoughts a noble Experiment of the moſt Ingenious <hi>Monſieur Paſchal,</hi> which clearly ſhews, that if we could free the upper Part of ſuch a Tube as we are now conſidering from the Preſſure of all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air, it would follow, as the Examiner ſayes it ſhould, that the Quickſilver would by the Preſſure of the outward Air be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd up into the Tube as well as Water, till it had attain'd a height great enough to make its Weight not inferiour but equal to that of the <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> The Experiment it ſelf being ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and conſiderable, we ſhall annex it in the ſame words wherein it is related by his Country-man and Acquaintance, the Learned and Candid <hi>Gaſſendus.

So that as to the Examiners Experiment, we may well explicate it in our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> by ſaying, that agreeably to it it happens, that in a more forcible Reſpiration the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> is raiſed higher then in a more languid; becauſe, in the former Caſe, the Cheſt being more dilated, the included Air is alſo more expanded; whereby its debilitated Spring cannot as before enable the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> to counterpoiſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57681:14"/>
the Preſſure of the ambient Air. And that the Reaſon why the Quickſilver is not by Reſpiration rais'd as high as it is kept ſuſpended in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, is not, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the outward Air is unable to raiſe it ſo high, but becauſe, as we have already declar'd, the free Dilatation of the <hi>Thorax</hi> is oppoſed by the Preſſure of the ambient Air; which Preſſure being againſt ſo great a Superficies, and being but imperfectly reſiſted by the debilitated Preſſure of the Air within the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> will be eaſily imagined to be very conſiderable by him who conſiders that in our Engine, the Preſſure of the external Air againſt the Sucker of leſs then three Inches Diameter was, as we relate in the 33. Experiment, able to thruſt up a Weight of above a hundred pound. And here we may obſerve upon the By in Confirmation of our former Doctrine, that when we ſtrongly ſuck up Quickſilver in a Glaſs Tube, though the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Quickſilver be according to our Author perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med likewiſe by his <hi>Funiculus</hi> contracting it ſelfe every way, and though there be a Communication betwixt the internal Surface of the Lungs, and the Cavity of the Tube; yet we feel not in our Lungs any endeavour of the ſhrinking <hi>Funiculus</hi> to tear off that Membrane they are lin'd with.</p>

For beſides that we ſhall in

For the Corpuſcles of Light that permeate that ſpace may be ſo numerous, as to leave no ſenſible part of it un-inlightned; and yet may have ſo many little empty Intervals betwixt them, that, if all that is corporeal in the ſpace we ſpeak of were united into one lump, it would not perhaps adequately fill the one half (not to ſay the tenth, or even the hundredth part) of the whole ſpace: According to what we have noted in the 17. Experiment, that a Room may appear full of the ſmoke of a Perfume, though if all the Corpuſcles that compoſe that ſmoke were re-united, they would again make up but a ſmall Paſtil. To which purpoſe I remember I have taken <hi>Camphire,</hi> of which a little will fill a Room with its odour, and having in well-clos'd diſtillatory Glaſſes caught the ſumes dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over by hear, I thereby reduc'd them to re conjoyn into true <hi>Camphire,</hi> whoſe bulk is very inconſiderable in compariſon of the ſpace it fills as to ſenſe, when the odorous Corpuſcles are ſcattered through the free Air.</p>
                  <p>To which I might adde, that the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment being made in a dark night, or in a Room perfectly darken'd, if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (as there is little cauſe to ſuſpect it will not) it may well be doubted whether our Authors Argument will there take place. For if he endeavour to prove that the place in queſtion was full in the dark, becauſe upon the letting in of the Day, or the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a Candle, the light appears within it; the Vacuiſts may
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57681:18"/>
reply according to their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That that light is a new one, flowing from the lucid body that darts its corporeal beams quite through the Glaſs and Space we diſpute about, which for want of ſuch Corpuſcles were not juſt before viſible.</p>
                  <p>And ſuppoſing light not to be made by a trajection of Atoms through Diaphanous bodies, but a propagation of the impulſe of lucid bodies through them; yet it will not thence neceſſarily follow, that the deſerted part of the Tube muſt be full: As in our 27. Experiment (though many of thoſe groſs Aerial Particles that appear'd neceſſary to convey a languid ſound were drawn out of our Receiver at the firſt and ſecond Exſuction; yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſo many of the like Corpuſcles, that thoſe that were wanting were not miſs'd by the ſenſe, though afterwards, when a far greater number was drawn out, they were) ſo there may be matter enough remaining to tranſmit the impulſe of light; though betwixt the Particles of that matter there ſhould be ſtore of vacuities intercepted. Whereas our Author pretends to prove, not onely that there is no <hi>coacervate</hi> Vacuity in the ſpace ſo often mentioned, but abſolutely that there is <hi>none.</hi> For 'tis in this laſt ſenſe, as well as the other, that the Schools and our Author, who defends their Opinion, deny a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding what we have now diſcours'd, as in our 17. Experiment we declin'd determining whether there be a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> or no; ſo now what we have ſaid to the Examiners Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has not been to declare our whole ſenſe of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, but onely to ſhew, that though his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſuppoſes there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> yet his Arguments do not ſufficiently prove it: which may help to ſhew his Doctrine to be precarious; for otherwiſe the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> though Pleniſts, may plauſibly enough (whether truly or no I now diſpute not) decline the neceſſity of admitting a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the deſerted ſpace of the Tube, by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it fill'd with their ſecond and firſt Element, whoſe Particles they imagine to be minute enough freely to paſs in and out through the Pores of Glaſs. But then they muſt allow the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the outward Air to be the cauſe of the ſuſpenſion of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57681:19"/>
Quickſilver: for though the <hi>materia coeleſtis</hi> may readily fill the ſpaces the <hi>Mercury</hi> deſerts; yet that within the Tube cannot binder ſo ponderous a liquor from ſubſiding as low as the reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Mercury;</hi> ſince all the parts of the Tube, as well the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt as the uppermoſt, being pervious to that ſubtile matter, it may with like facility ſucceed in whatever part of the Tube ſhall be for ſaken by the Quickſilver.</p>
                  <p>The Examiners ſecond Argument in the ſame place is, That ſince the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> is not ſuſtain'd by the outward Air, it muſt neceſſarily be, that it be kept ſuſpended by his internal ſtring. But ſince for the proof of this he is content to refer us to the third Chapter; our having already examin'd that, allows us to proceed to his third Argument, which is, That the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Cylinder,</hi> reſting in its wonted ſtation, does not gravitate: as may appear by applying the Finger to the immers'd or lower Orifice of the Tube. Whence he infers, that it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be ſuſpended from within the Tube. And indeed if you dexterouſly apply your Finger to the open end of the Tube, when you have almoſt, but not quite, lifted it out of the reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Mercury,</hi> (which circumſtance muſt not be neglected, though our Author have omitted it) that ſo you may ſhut up no more Quickſilver then the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> is wont to conſiſt of, you will find the Experiment to ſucceed well enough: (Which makes me ſomewhat wonder to find it affirm'd, that the learned <hi>Maignan</hi> denies it) not but that you will feel upon your Finger a gravitation or preſſure of the Glaſs-Tube, and the contained <hi>Mercury,</hi> as of one body; but that you will not feel any ſenſible preſſure of the <hi>Mercury</hi> apart, as if it endeavoured to thruſt away your Finger from the Tube. But the reaſon of this is not hard to give in our <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> for according to that, the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> and the Air counterpoiſing one another, the Finger ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains not any ſenſibly-differing preſſure from the ambient Air that preſſes againſt the Nail and ſides of it, and from the included Quickſilver that preſſes againſt the Pulp. But if the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> ſhould exceed the uſual length, then the Finger would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57681:19"/>
feel ſome preſſure from that ſurpluſage of Quickſilver, which the Air does not aſſiſt the Finger to ſuſtain. So that this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> may be as well ſolv'd in our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as in the Examiners: in which if we had time to clear an Objection, which we fore-ſee might be made, but might be anſwer'd too; we would demand why, when the <hi>Mercury</hi> included in the Tube is but of a due altitude, it ſhould run out upon the removal of the Finger that ſtops it beneath, in caſe it be ſuſtain'd onely by the internal <hi>Funiculus,</hi> and do, according to his Doctrine, when the <hi>Funiculus</hi> ſuſtains it, emulate a ſolid body, if the preſſure of the external Air has not (as our Author teaches it not to have) any thing to do in this matter.</p>
                  <p>And if ſome inquiſitive perſon ſhall here object, That certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Finger muſt feel much pain by being ſqueez'd betwixt two ſuch preſſures, as that of a Pillar of thirty Inches of Quick-ſilver on the one ſide, and an equivalent preſſure from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical Pillar on the other, it may readily be repreſented, that in fluid bodies (ſuch as are thoſe concern'd in our Difficulty) a ſolid body has no ſuch ſenſe of preſſure from the ambient bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as (unleſs Experience had otherwiſe inſtructed us) we ſhould perhaps imagine. For, not to mention that having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a famous Diver, whether he found himſelf ſenſibly compreſſed by the water at the bottom of the Sea; he agreed with the generality of Divers in the Negative: I am inform'd that the learned <hi>Maignan</hi> did purpoſely try, that his hand being thruſt three or four Palmes deep into Quickſilver, his fingers were not ſenſible, either of any weight from the incumbent, or of any preſſure from the ambient, Quickſilver. The reaſon of which (whether that inquiſitive man have given it or no) is not neceſſary in our preſent Controverſie to be lookt after.</p>
                  <p>To theſe three Arguments the Examiner addes not a fourth, unleſs he deſign to preſent it us in this concluding paſſage: <hi>Huc etiam faciunt inſignes librationes quibus argentum ſubito deſcendens agitatur: Idem enim hic fit quod in aliis Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulis</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; ab alto demiſsis fieri ſolet.</hi> But of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> alſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57681:20"/>
'tis eaſie to give an account in our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> by two ſeveral wayes; whereof the <hi>Firſt</hi> (which is proper chiefly when the Experiment is made in a cloſe place, as our Receiver) is, That the Quickſilver by its ſudden deſcent acquires an <hi>impetus</hi> ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the preſſure it has upon the ſcore of its wonted gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; whereby it for a while falls below its ſtation, and thereby compreſſes the Air that leans upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury.</hi> Which Air by its own Spring again forcibly dilating it ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its former extenſion, and (as is uſual in Springs) haſtily fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, expands it ſelf beyond it, and thereby impells up the Quickſilver ſomewhat above its wonted ſtation, in its fall from whence it again acquires ſomewhat (though not ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) of <hi>impetus</hi> or power, to force the Corpuſcles of the Air to a Sub-ingreſſion; and this reciprocation of preſſure betwixt the Quickſilver and the outward Air decreaſing by degrees, does at length wholly ceaſe, when the <hi>Mercury</hi> has loſt that ſuperadded preſſure, which it acquired by its falling from parts of the Tube higher then its due ſtation. But this <hi>firſt</hi> way of explicating theſe Vibrations is not neceſſary in the free Air: for if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ambient Air onely as a weight, and remember what we have newly ſaid of the <hi>impetus</hi> acquir'd by deſcent; this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> may be eaſily enough explain'd, by taking notice of what happens in a Balance, when one of the equiponderant Scales chancing to be depreſs'd, they do not till after many Vibrations ſettle <hi>in aequilibrio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on this occaſion I ſhall adde this Experiment: I took a Glaſs Pipe, whoſe two legs (very unequal in length) were paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel enough, and both perpendicular to that part of the Pipe that connected them, (ſuch a <hi>Syphon</hi> is deſcrib'd in our 36. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to find the proportion of the gravity of <hi>Mercury</hi> and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) into this Quickſilver was pour'd till 'twas ſome Inches high, and equally high in both legs: then the Pipe being inclin'd till the moſt part of the Quickſilver was fallen into one of the legs, I ſtopt the Orifice of the other leg with my Finger, and erecting again the Pipe, though the Quickſilver were forc'd to aſcend a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57681:20"/>
little in that ſtopt leg; yet by reaſon my Finger kept the Air from getting away, the Quickſilver was kept lower by a good deal in that ſtopt leg then in the other; but if by ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving my Finger I gave paſſage to the included and ſomewhat compreſt Air, the preponderant Quickſilver in the other leg would with the <hi>Mercury</hi> in this unſtopt leg, make divers undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations before that liquor did in both legs come to reſt in an <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium.</hi> Of which the Reaſon may be eaſily deduc'd from what has been newly deliver'd; and yet in this caſe there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be made of a <hi>Funiculus</hi> of violently diſtended Air to effect the Vibrations of the <hi>Mercury.</hi>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THirdly, But though our Examiner have not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> yet perhaps it may be in its own nature ſo like to be true, as to deſerve to be imbrac'd as ſuch. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will now take notice of ſome of thoſe many things that to our apprehenſion render it very improbable.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, whereas our Author acknowledges that Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Water, Wine, and other liquors, will, as well one as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſcend in Tubes exactly ſealed at the top, in caſe the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of liquor exceed the weight of a Mercurial Cylinder of 29½. Inches; and will ſubſide no longer then till it is come to equiponderate a Cylinder of Quickſilver of that height; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, I ſay, the Examiner is by the ingenious Monſieur <hi>Paſchall</hi>'s, and other Experiments, induc'd to admit this; it cannot but ſeem ſtrange that, whatever the liquor be, there ſhould be juſt the ſame weight or ſtrength to extend them into a <hi>Funiculus:</hi> though Water, for inſtance, and Quickſilver be near fourteen times as heavy one as the other, and be otherwiſe of very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57681:21"/>
natures; and though divers other liquors, as Oyle and Water, be likewiſe of Textures very differing. And this may ſomewhat the more be wondred at, becauſe our Author (in his Animadverſions upon our 31. Experiment) is pleaſed to make ſo great a difference betwixt the diſpoſition of bodies of various conſiſtences, as fluid and firm, to be extenuated into a <hi>Funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that he will not allow any humane force to be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one, by the divulſion of two flat Marbles, in caſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of their Surfaces were ſo exquiſite as quite to exclude all Air; though in the ſame place his Ratiocination plainly enough teaches (which Experience however does) that adhering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, though with extraordinary difficulty, may be forcibly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and according to him the ſuperficial parts may be diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> that prevents a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of his Adverſaries is not at all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with this difficulty. For the weight of the outward Air being that which keeps liquors ſuſpended in Tubes ſealed at the top; it matters not of what nature or texture the ſuſpended li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is, provided its weight be the ſame with that of a Mercurial Cylinder equiponderant to the Aerial one: As if there be a pound of Lead in one Scale, it will not deſtroy the <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> whether what be put in the other be Gold, or Quickſilver, or Wooll, or Feathers, provided its weight be juſt a pound.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we may take notice, That the account our Examiner gives us of his <hi>Funiculus</hi> in the tenth Chapter, (where he takes upon him to explicate it) is much more ſtrange then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, and not made out by any ſuch parallel operations of Nature, as his Adverſaries will not (and may not well do it) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the truth of. Whereas the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of the Air may be inferr'd from ſuch unqueſtion'd Experiments as are not concern'd in our preſent Controverſie. For the gravity of the Air may be manifeſted by a pair of Scales, &amp; the Spring of it diſcloſes it ſelf ſo clearly in wind-guns and other Inſtruments, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary (as we have already had occaſion to inculcate) does not deny it. But to conſider his Explication of his <hi>Funiculus,</hi> he

As for what he addes concerning the reaſon why Water, and Quickſilver aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by ſuction, we have already taught what is to be anſwered to it, by aſcribing that aſcenſion to the preſſure of the external Air: without any need of having recourſe to a <hi>Funiculus;</hi> or imagining with him in this place, That becauſe nothing beſides the Water or Quickſilver can in ſuch caſes ſucceed, the Air, (which yet is not eaſie to be prov'd in reference to a thin Aethere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubſtance) therefore, <hi>Partes ipſius aëris</hi> (to uſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) <hi>ſic tubo incluſae (quae aliàs tam facile ſeparantur)</hi>

But I wiſh he had more clearly expreſt what he means in this place by that Rarefaction, which he ſayes is to be made by diſtenſion, or a <hi>vis divulſiva,</hi> whereof he tells us there are innumerable inſtances. For, as far as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the three Examples he ſubjoyns, 'tis onely the Air that is capable of being ſo extended as his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> requires Quickſilver and even Stones muſt be. And I know not how it will be proved, that even Air may be thus extended ſo far, as in the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiment, to fill a place more then two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times as big as that it fill'd before. For that the ſame Air in this and his two foregoing Inſtances does adequately fill more ſpace at one time then another, he proves but by the ruſhing in of water into the evacuated Glaſs, and filling it within a little quite full, which, he ſayes, is done by the diſtended Air that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it ſelf draws up the water with it. Which Explication how much leſs likely it is, then that the water is in ſuch caſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd up by the preſſure of the Atmoſphere, we ſhall anon (when we come to diſcuſs his way of Rarefaction and Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) have occaſion to examine.

For, not to repeat our Animadverſions upon the firſt of the two <hi>Notandum's,</hi> on which the Explication is grounded, I muſt demand by what force, upon the bare ſeparation of the Quickſilver and the top of the Tube, the new body he mentions comes to be produc'd; or at leaſt how it appears that the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> leaves any ſuch thing as he ſpeaks of behind it. For the ſenſe perceives no ſuch matter at the top of the Tube, nor is it neceſſary to explicate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> as we have formerly ſeen. It may alſo be marvell'd at, that the bare weight of the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mercury</hi> ſhould be able to extend a Surface into a Body. And beſides, it ſeems precariouſly affirm'd, that there is ſuch a ſucceſſive leaving behind of one Surface after another as is here imagin'd: Nor does it at all appear how, though ſome of the Quickſilver were turn'd into a thin ſubtile ſubſtance, yet that ſubſtance comes to be contriv'd into a <hi>Funiculus</hi> of ſo ſtrange a nature, that ſcarce any weight (for ought appears by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) can be able to break it; that contrary to all other ſtrings it may be ſtr<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

Though it be the onely Example whereby he endeavours to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the generation of his <hi>Funiculus,</hi> yet (I preſume) he ſcarce expects we ſhould think it an appoſite one. For, beſides that there here intervenes a conſpicuous and powerful Agent, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an actual Fire to ſever and agitate the parts of the Candle; and beſides that there is a manifeſt waſting of the Wax or Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low turn'd into flame; beſides theſe things, I ſay, we muſt not admit, that the Fuel when turn'd into a flame does really fill (I ſay not, with our Author) more then a thouſand times, but ſo much as twice more of genuine ſpace then the Wax 'twas made of. For it may be ſaid that the flame is little or nothing elſe then an aggregate of thoſe Corpuſcles which before lay upon the upper ſuperficies of the Candle, and by the violent heat were divided into minuter particles, vehemently agitated and brought from lying as it were upon a flat to beat off one another, and make up about the Wiek ſuch a figure as is uſual in the flame of Candles burning in the free Air. Nor will it neceſſarily follow, that the ſpace which the flame ſeems to take up ſhould contain neither Air nor <hi>Aether,</hi> nor any thing elſe, ſave the parts of that flame, becauſe the eye cannot diſcern any other body there: For even the ſmoke aſcending from the ſnuff of a newly-extinguiſh'd Candle appears a dark pillar, which to the eye at ſome diſtance ſeems to conſiſt of ſmoke; whenas yet there are ſo many Aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and other inviſible Corpuſcles mingled with it, as if all thoſe parts of ſmoke that make a great ſhow in the Air were collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contiguous, they would not perhaps amount to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Pins head: as may appear by the great quantity of ſteams that in Chymical Veſſels are wont to go to the making up of one drop of Spirit. And therefore it does not ill fall out for our turn, that the Examiner, to inforce his former Example, alledges the turning of a particle of Quickſilver into vapour, by putting fire under it: for if ſuch be the Rarefaction of <hi>Mercury,</hi> 'tis not at all like to make ſuch a <hi>Funiculus</hi> as he talks of, ſince thoſe Mercurial Fumes appear by divers Experiments, to be <hi>Mercury</hi> divided and thrown abroad into minute parts, whereby

though the body obtain more of Surface then it had before, yet it really fills no more of true and genuine ſpace, ſince if all the particular little ſpaces fill'd by theſe ſcatter'd Corpuſcles were reduc'd into one, (as the Corpuſcles themſelves often are in Chymical Operations) they would amount but to one total ſpace, equal to that of the whole <hi>Mercury</hi> before rarefaction. But theſe Objections againſt this Explication are not all that I have to ſay againſt our Adverſaries <hi>Funiculus</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For I farther demand how the <hi>Funiculus</hi> comes by ſuch hooks or graple-irons, or parts of the like ſhape, to take faſt hold of all contiguous bodies, and even the ſmootheſt, ſuch as Glaſs, and the calm ſurfaces of Quickſilver, Water, Oyle, and other fluids: And how theſe ſlender and inviſible hooks cannot onely in the terſeſt bodies find an innumerable company of ears or loops to take hold on, but hold ſo ſtrongly that they are able not alone to lift up a tall Cylinder of that very ponderous metall of Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but to draw inwards the ſides of ſtrong Glaſſes ſo forcibly, as to break them all to pieces. And 'tis alſo ſomewhat ſtrange, that Water and other fluid bodies (whoſe parts are wont to be ſo eaſily ſeparable) ſhould, when the <hi>Funiculus</hi> once layes hold on the ſuperficial Corpuſcles, preſently emulate the nature of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent bodies, and be drawn up like Maſſes each of them of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire piece; though even in the exhauſted Receiver they appear by their undulation (when they are ſtir'd by Bubbles that paſs freely through them) and many other ſigns to continue fluid bodies.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems alſo very difficult to conceive how this extenuated ſubſtance ſhould acquire ſo ſtrong a ſpring inward as the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all along his book aſcribes to it. Nor will it ſerve his turn to require of us in exchange an Explication of the Airs ſpring outward, ſince he acknowledges, as well as we, that it has ſuch a ſpring. I know, that by calling this extenuated ſubſtance a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus,</hi> he ſeems plainly to intimate that it has its ſpring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, upon the ſame account that Lute-ſtrings and Ropes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ſtretch'd have theirs. But there is no ſmall diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57681:24"/>
them: for whereas in ſtrings there is requir'd either wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or ſome peculiar and artificial texture of the component parts; a rarefaction of Air (were it granted) does not include or infer any ſuch contrivance of parts as is requiſite to make bodies Elaſtical. And if the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Notion of the cauſe of Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be admitted, then our extenuated ſubſtance having no Pores to be pervaded by the <hi>materia ſubtilis</hi> (to which beſides our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alſo makes Glaſs impervious) will be deſtitute of Springi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And however, ſince Lute-ſtrings, Ropes, &amp;c. muſt, when they ſhrink inwards, either fill up or leſſen their Pores, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in thickneſs as they diminiſh in length; our Examiners <hi>Funiculus</hi> muſt differ very much from them, ſince it has no Pores to receive the ſhrinking parts, and contracts it ſelf as to length, without increaſing its thickneſs. Nor can it well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that this ſelf-contraction is done <hi>ob fugam vacui,</hi> ſince though it ſhould not be made, a <hi>Vacuum</hi> would not enſue. And if it be ſaid that it is made that the preternaturally ſtretch'd body might reſtore it ſelf to its natural dimenſions: I anſwer, That I am not very forward to allow acting for ends to bodies inanimate, and conſequently devoid of knowledge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould gladly ſee ſome unqueſtionable Examples produc'd of Operations of that nature. And however to me, who in Phyſical enquiries of this nature look for efficient rather then final cauſes, 'tis not eaſie to conceive how Air by being expanded (in which caſe its force (like that of other rarify'd bodies) ſeems principally to tend outwards, as we ſee in fired Gun-powder, in <hi>Aeolipiles,</hi> in warm'd Weather-glaſſes, &amp;c.) ſhould acquire ſo prodigious a force of moving contiguous bodies inwards. Nor does it to me ſeem very probable, that, when for inſtance part of a poliſh'd Marble is extended into a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> that <hi>Funiculus</hi> does ſo ſtrongly aſpire to turn into Marble again. I might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wiſh our Author had more clearly explicated, how it comes to paſs (which he all along takes for granted) that the acceſs of the outward Air does ſo much and ſo ſuddenly relax the tenſion of his <hi>Funiculus;</hi> ſince that being (according to him) a real and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57681:24"/>
Poreleſs body, 'tis not ſo obvious how the preſence of another can ſo eaſily and to ſo ſtrange a degree make it ſhrink. But I will rather obſerve, that 'tis very unlikely that the ſpace which our Adverſary would have repleniſh'd with his <hi>Funicular</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſhould be full of little highly-ſtretcht ſtrings, that lay faſt hold of the Surfaces of all contiguous bodies, and alwayes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently endeavour to pull them inwards. For we have related in our 26. Experiment, that a <hi>Pendulum</hi> being ſet a moving in our exhauſted Receiver, did ſwing to and fro as freely, and with the ſtring ſtretch'd as ſtreight, as for ought we could perceive it would have done in the common Air. Nay, the Balance of a Watch did there move freely and nimbly to and fro; which 'tis hard to conceive thoſe bodies could do, if they were to break through a <hi>medium</hi> conſiſting of innumerable exceedingly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretch'd ſtrings. On which occaſion we might adde, that 'tis ſomewhat ſtrange that theſe ſtrings, thus cut or broken by the paſſage of theſe bodies through them, could ſo readily have their parts re-united, and without any more ado be made intire again. And we might alſo take notice of this as another ſtrange peculiarity in our Authors <hi>Funiculus,</hi> That in this caſe the two divided parts of each ſmall ſtring that is broken do not, like thoſe of other broken ſtrings, ſhrink and fly back from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but (as we juſt now ſaid) immediately redintegrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Whereas, when in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment the Tube and contain'd <hi>Mercury</hi> is ſuddenly lifted up out of the reſtagnant Quickſilver into the Air, the <hi>Funiculus</hi> does ſo ſtrangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf, that it quite vaniſhes; inſomuch that the aſcending <hi>Mercury</hi> may riſe to the very top of the Tube. Theſe, I ſay, and divers other difficulties might on this occaſion be inſiſted on; but that, ſuppoſing our ſelves to have mentioned enough of them for once, we think it now more ſeaſonable to proceed to the remaining Part of our Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The <hi>Ariſtotelean Rarefaction</hi> (propoſed by the Adverſary) examin'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt this is not all that renders the Examiners <hi>Hypotheſis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable:</hi> For, beſides thoſe already mentioned particulars, upon whoſe ſcore it is very <hi>difficult</hi> to be <hi>underſtood;</hi> it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſes ſuch a Rarefaction and Condenſation, as is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, to me, as well as to many other conſidering perſons, <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better diſcernment of the force of this Objection we muſt briefly premiſe, That a body is commonly ſaid to be rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd or dilated, (for I take the word in a larger ſenſe then, I know, many others do, for a reaſon that will quickly appear) when it acquires greater dimenſions then the ſame body had before; and to be condens'd, when it is reduc'd into leſs dimenſions, that is, into a leſſer ſpace then it contain'd before: (as when a dry Spunge being firſt dipp'd in water ſwells to a far greater bulk, and then being ſtrongly ſqueez'd and held compreſſed, is not onely reduced into leſs room then it had before it was ſqueezed, but into leſs then it had even before it was wetted.) And I muſt further premiſe, That Rarefaction (as alſo Condenſation) being amongſt the moſt obvious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, there are three (and for ought we know but three) wayes of explicating it: For, either we muſt ſay with the Atomiſts and Vacuiſts, that the Corpuſcles whereof the rarefied body conſiſts do ſo depart from each other, that no other ſubſtance comes in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to fill up the deſerted ſpaces that come to be left betwixt the incontiguous Corpuſcles; or elſe we muſt ſay with divers of the ancient Philoſophers, and many of the moderns, eſpecially the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> that theſe new Intervals produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Particles of the rarefied body are but dilated Pores, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57681:25"/>
in like manner as thoſe of the tumid Spunge are by the imbibed water, by ſome ſubtile Aethereal ſubſtance, that inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf betwixt the disjoyned Particles: or, laſtly, we muſt imagine with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and moſt of his followers, that the ſelf-ſame body does not onely <hi>obtain</hi> a greater ſpace in Rarefaction, and a leſſer in Condenſation, but adequately and exactly <hi>fill it,</hi> and ſo when rarefied acquires larger dimenſions without either lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any vacuities betwixt its component Corpuſcles, or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between them any new or extraneous ſubſtance whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis to this laſt (and, as ſome call it, <hi>rigorous)</hi> way of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction that our Adverſary has recourſe in his <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> Though this, I confeſs, appear to me ſo difficult to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that I make a doubt whether any <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> can be <hi>explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by it; ſince to <hi>explain</hi> a thing is to deduce it from ſomething or other in Nature more known then it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>He that would meet with full Diſcuſſions of this <hi>Ariſtotelean</hi> Rarefaction, may reſort to the learned writings of <hi>Gaſſendus, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius</hi> and <hi>Maignan,</hi> who have accuſed it of divers great abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But for my part, I ſhall at preſent content my ſelf to make uſe to my purpoſe of two or three paſſages that I meet with (though not together) in our Author himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſuppoſe, that in the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiment he ſo often (though I think cauſleſly enough) urges to prove his <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> let us (I ſay) for eaſier conſiderations ſake ſuppoſe, that the undilated Air, which (as he tells us) poſſeſſed about half an Inch of ſpace, conſiſted of a hundred Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, <note place="margin">Pag. 42.</note> or (if that name be in this caſe diſliked) a hundred parts; (for it matters not what number we pitch upon) and 'twill not be denyed, but that as the whole parcel of Air, or the Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of this hundred Corpuſcles, is adequate to the whole ſpace it fills, ſo each of the hundred parts, that make it up, is likewiſe adequately commenſurate to its peculiar ſpace, which we here ſuppoſe to be a hundredth part of the whole ſpace. This premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, our Author having elſewhere this paſſage, <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re occupante locum verbi gratia duplo majorem, neceſſe eſt</hi>

                        </expan> duplo majorem occupet;</hi> prompts us to ſubjoyn, that in the whole capacity of the Globe (which according to him was two thouſand times as great as the room poſſeſſed by the unexpanded Air) there muſt likewiſe be two hundred thouſand parts of ſpace commenſurate each of them to one of the fore-mentioned hundredth parts of Air; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when he affirms that that half Inch of Air poſſeſſed the whole cavity of the Globe, if we will not admit (as he does not) either Vacuities or ſome intervening ſubtile ſubſtance in the Interval of the Aeriall parts, he muſt give us leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that each part of Air does adequately fill two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand parts of ſpace. Now that this ſhould be reſolutely taught to be not onely <hi>naturally poſsible,</hi> (for we diſpute not here of what the Divine Omnipotence <hi>can</hi> do) but to be really and regularly <hi>done</hi> in this <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiment, will queſtionleſs appear very <hi>abſurd</hi> to the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and thoſe other Philoſophers, who take Extenſion to be but notionally different from Body, and conſequently impoſſible to be acquir'd or loſt without the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or detraction of Matter; and will, I doubt not, appear <hi>ſtrange</hi> to thoſe other Readers, who conſider how generally Naturaliſts have looked upon Extenſion as inſeparable, and as immediately flowing from matter; &amp; upon Bodies, as having neceſſary relation to a commenſurate ſpace. Nor do I ſee, if one portion of Air may ſo eaſily be brought exactly to fill up a ſpace two thouſand times as big as that which it did <hi>but</hi> fill before without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any new ſubſtance; I ſee not (I ſay) why the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every of theſe two thouſand parts of ſpace may not be further brought to fill two thouſand more, and ſo onwards, ſince each of theſe newly-replen ſhed ſpaces is preſumed to be exactly filled with Body, and no ſpace, nor conſequently that which the unrarefied Air repleniſhed, can be more then adequately full. And ſince, according to our Adverſary, not onely fluid bodies, as Air and Quickſilver, but even ſolid and hard ones, as Marble, are capable of ſuch a Diſtenſion as we ſpeak of, why may not the World be made I know not how many thouſand times bigger
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57681:26"/>
then it is, without either admitting any thing of Vacuity betwixt its parts, or being increaſed with the addition of one Atome of new matter? Which to me is ſo difficult to conceive, that I have ſometimes doubted, whether in caſe it could be proved, that in the exhauſted Globe we ſpeak of there were no Vacuities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor any ſubtile matter permitted to enter from without, it were not more intelligible to ſuppoſe that God had created a new matter to joyn with the Air in filling up the Cavity, then that the ſelf-ſame Air ſhould adequately fill two thouſand ſpaces, whereof one was exactly commenſurate to it even when it was uncompreſſed. For divers eminent Naturaliſts, both ancient and modern, believing upon a Phyſical account the Souls of men to be created and infuſed, will admit it as intelligible that God does frequently create ſubſtances on certain emergent occaſions. But I know that many of them will not likewiſe think it concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that without his immediate interpoſition an acceſſion of new, real Dimenſions ſhould be had without either vacuities or acceſſion of matter.</p>
                  <p>And indeed when I conſidered theſe difficulties and others, that attend the Rarefaction our Examiner throughout his whole book ſuppoſes, and when I found that ever and anon he remits us to what he teaches concerning Rarefaction; I could not but with ſome greedineſs reſort to the Chapters he addreſſed me to. But when I had peruſed them, I found the Difficulties remained <hi>ſuch</hi> ſtill, and that 'twas very hard even for a witty man to make more of a ſubject then the nature of it does bear. Which I ſay, that by profeſſing my ſelf unſatisfied with what he writes, I may not be thought to find fault with a man for not doing what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is not to be done, and for not making ſuch abſtruſe Notions <hi>plain,</hi> as are ſcarcely (if at all) ſo much as <hi>intelligible.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as he has handled this ſubject modeſtly enough, ſo in ſome places his Expreſſions are to me ſomewhat dark; which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to impute it as a Crime in him, that he wrote in a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and doubtful ſtrain of ſo difficult a matter, but to excuſe my ſelf if I have not alwayes gueſſed aright at his meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57681:27"/>
The things he alledges in favour of the Rarefaction he would perſwade are two: The one, That the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction <hi>cannot</hi> be explicated either by Vacuities or the ſubingreſſion of an Aethereal ſubſtance; and the other, That there are two wayes of explicating the rigorous Rarefaction he contends for.</p>
                  <p>His Objections againſt the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Carteſian</hi> wayes of making out Rarefaction are ſome of them more plauſible then moſt of thoſe that are wont to be urged againſt them; yet not ſuch as are not capable enough of Anſwers. But whileſt ſome of the paſſages appeared eaſie to be replyed to by the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> they oppoſe, before I had fully examined the reſt, chancing to mention theſe Chapters to an ingenious Man, hereafter to be further mentioned in this Treatiſe; he told me he had ſo far conſidered them more then the reſt of the book, that he had thought upon ſome <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> whereby the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction might be made out either according to the Vacuiſts, or according to the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> adding, that he had alſo examined the Inſtance our Adverſary pretends to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him of his Rarefaction by what happens in the <hi>Rota Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelica.</hi> Wherefore being ſufficiently diſtreſſed by Avocations of ſeveral ſorts, and being willing to reſerve the Declaration of my own thoughts concerning the manner of Rarefaction and Condenſation for another Treatiſe, I ſhall refer the Reader to the ingenious Conjectures about this ſubject, which the writer of them intends to annex to the preſent Diſcourſe; and onely adde in general, That whereas the Examiners Argument on this occaſion is, That his way of Rarefaction muſt be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither of the other two can be well made out, his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries may with the ſame reaſon argue that one of theirs is to be allowed, ſince his is incumbred with ſuch manifeſt difficulties. And they may enforce what they ſay by repreſenting, that the inconveniences that attend his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> about Rarefaction are inſuperable, ariſing from the unintelligible nature of the thing itſelf; whereas thoſe to which the other wayes are obnoxious, may ſeem to ſpring but from mens not having yet diſcovered
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57681:27"/>
what kind of Figures and Motions of the ſmall Particles may beſt qualifie them to make the body that conſiſts of them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a competent expanſion.</p>
                  <p>After our Authors Objections againſt the two wayes of Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction propoſed, the one by the <hi>Vacuiſts,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and others, that admit the ſolideſt bodies, and even Glaſs itſelf, to be pervious to an Aethereal or ſubtile matter; he attempts to explicate the <hi>manner</hi> by which that rigorous Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction he teaches is perform'd: and having premiſed, that the Explication of the way how each part of the rarefy'd body becomes extended, depends upon the quality of the parts into which the body is ultimately reſolv'd; and having truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that they muſt neceſſarily be either really indiviſible, or ſtill endleſly diviſible; he endeavours to explicate the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telean</hi> Rarefaction according to thoſe two <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi> But, though he thus propoſe two wayes of making out his Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet beſides that they are irreconcilable, he ſpeaks of them ſo darkly and doubtfully, that it ſeems leſs eaſie to diſcern which of the two he would be content to ſtick to, then that he himſelf ſcarce acquieſces in either of them.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, having told us how Rarefaction may be explain'd, in caſe we admit bodies to be diviſible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> he does him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf make ſuch an Objection againſt the infinity of parts in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuum,</hi> as he is fain to give ſo obſcure an Anſwer to, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I do not underſtand it; and preſume, that not onely the moſt part of unprejudiced Readers will as little acquieſce in the Anſwer as I do; but even the Author himſelf will not marvel at my confeſſion, ſince in the ſame place he acknowledges the Anſwer to be ſomewhat <hi>obſcure,</hi> and endeavours to excuſe its being ſo, becauſe in that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it can ſcarce be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I ſhall onely adde on this occaſion, that 'tis not clear to me, that even ſuch a diviſibility of a <hi>continuum</hi> as is here ſuppoſed would make out the Rarefaction he contends for. For, let the integrant parts of a <hi>continuum</hi> be more or leſs finite or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57681:28"/>
infinite in number, yet ſtill each part, being a corporeal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, muſt have ſome Particle of ſpace commenſurate to it; and if the whole body be rarefied, for inſtance, to twice its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bigneſs, then will each part be likewiſe extended to double its former dimenſions, and fill both the place it took up before, and another equal to it, and ſo two places.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument alledged to recommend the hitherto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned way of explicating Rarefaction is, That many learned men, amongſt whom he names two, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> have taught that the ſame corporeal thing may naturally be, and <hi>de facto</hi> often is, in the ſouls of Brutes really indiviſible and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally extended. But, though I pay thoſe two Authors a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for their great skill in Scholaſtical and Metaphyſical lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet the Examiner cannot ignore, that I could make a long Catalogue of Writers, both ancient and modern, at leaſt as well vers'd in natural Philoſophy as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> who have <hi>ſome</hi> of them in expreſs words denyed this to be naturally poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and <hi>others</hi> have declared themſelves of the ſame judgment by eſtabliſhing principles, with which this Conceit of the virtual extenſion of the indiviſible Corpuſcles is abſolutely inconſiſtent. And though no Author had hitherto oppoſed it, yet I, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not what <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man thought, but what 'tis rational to think, ſhould nevertheleſs not ſcruple to reject it now; and ſhould not doubt to find ſtore of the beſt Naturaliſts of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with me, and perhaps among them the Examiner himſelf, who (however this acknowledgment may agree with the three following Chapters of his book) tells us, <hi>(pag.</hi> 160.) that <hi>Juxia probabiliorem ſententiam hujuſmodi virtualis extenſio rei corporea concedenda non eſt, ut pote ſoli rei ſpirituali propria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to conclude at length this tedious Enquiry into the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelean</hi> way of Rarefaction, (which is of ſo obſcure a nature that it can ſcarce be either propoſed or examined in few words) I will not take upon me reſolutely to affirm which of the two wayes of explicating it (by Atomes or by Parts infinitely diviſible) our Author declares himſelf for. But which of them ſoever it be,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57681:28"/>
I think I have ſhown that he has not intelligibly made it out : And I make the leſs ſcruple to do ſo, becauſe he himſelf is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous as (at the cloſe of his diſcourſe of the two wayes) to ſpeak thus of the Opinion he prefers; <hi>Praeſtat communi &amp; receptae hactenus in Scholis ſententiae inſiſtere, quae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 169.</note>

                  <p>As for the other way of explicating Rarefaction, namely, by ſuppoſing that a body is made up of parts indiviſible; he will not, I preſume, deny, but that the Objections we formerly made againſt it are weighty.

For the eaſier conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this matter, let us reſume what we lately ſuppoſed, namely, that in the <hi>Magdeburgick</hi> Experiment the half Inch of undilated Air conſiſted of a hundred Corpuſcles; I demand how
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57681:29"/>
the indiviſibility of theſe Corpuſcles will qualifie them to make out ſuch a Rarefaction as the Author imagines. For what does their being indiviſible do in this caſe, but make it the leſs intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible how they can fill above a hundred parts of ſpace? 'Tis eaſie to fore-ſee he will anſwer, That they are virtually extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But not here to queſtion how their indiviſibility makes them capable of being ſo; I demand, whether by an Atoms being vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually extended, its corporeal ſubſtance do really (I mean ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately) fill more ſpace then it did before, or whether it do not: (for one of the two is neceſſary.) If it do, then 'tis a true and real, and not barely a virtual extenſion. And that ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion will not ſerve the turn, what we have formerly argued againſt the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Rarefaction will evince; and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſeems to confeſs as much, by deviſing this virtual extenſion to avoid the inconveniences to which he ſaw his Doctrine of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction would otherwiſe plainly appear expos'd. But if it be ſaid, That when an Atome is virtually extended, its corporeal ſubſtance fills no more ſpace then before: This is but a Verbal ſhift, that may perhaps amuſe an unwary Reader, but it will ſcarce ſatisfie a conſidering one. For I demand how that which is not a ſubſtance can fill place; and how this improper and but Metaphorical Extenſion will ſalve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as how the half Inch of Air at the top of the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Globe ſhall without a corporeal extenſion fill the whole Globe of two thouſand times its bigneſs when the water is ſuck'd out of it, and act at the lower part of the Globe. Which laſt Clauſe I therefore adde, becauſe not onely our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor teaches <hi>(pag.</hi> 91. &amp; 92.) that the whole Globe was filled with a certain thin ſubſtance, which by its contraction violently ſnatch'd up the water into which the neck of the Glaſs was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd; but in a parallel caſe he makes it his grand Argument to prove, that there is no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the deſerted part of the Tube in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, That the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Finger cannot be performed but by ſome <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> real body. Wherefore till the Examiner do intelligibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57681:29"/>
how a virtual Extenſion, as it is oppoſed to a corporeal, can make an Atome fill twice, nay, two thouſand times more ſpace then it did before; I ſuppoſe this device of virtual Extenſion will appear to unbiaſs'd Naturaliſts but a very unſatisfactory evaſion.</p>
                  <p>Two Arguments indeed there are which our Adverſary offers as proofs of what he teaches. The firſt is, That they commonly teach in the Schools, that at leaſt <hi>divinitus</hi> (as he ſpeakes) ſuch a thing as is pleaded for may be done, and that conſequently it is not repugnant to the nature of a body. But, though they that either know me, or have read what I have written about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Theological, will, I hope, readily believe, that none is more willing to <hi>acknowledge</hi> and <hi>venerate</hi> Divine Omnipotence; yet in ſome famous Schools they teach, that it is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. And that men who think ſo, and conſequently look not upon it as an object of Divine Omnipotence, may (whatever he here ſay) without <hi>impiety</hi> be of a differing mind from him about the poſſibility of ſuch a Rarefaction as he would here have, our Author may perchance think fit to grant, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he himſelf ſayes a few Pages after, <hi>Cum tempus ſit Ens eſſentialiter ſucceſsivum, it a ut ne divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

                     <hi>quidem poſsint duae ejus partes ſimul existere, &amp;c.</hi> But, not now to diſpute of a power that I am more willing to adore then queſtion, I ſay, that our Controverſie is not what <hi>God can do,</hi> but about what can be done by <hi>Natural Agents,</hi> not elevated above the ſphere of Nature. For though <hi>God</hi> can both create and annihilate, yet <hi>Nature</hi> can do neither: and in the judgment of true Philoſophers I ſuppoſe our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> would need no other advantage to make it be preferred before our Adverſaries, then that in ours things are explicated by the ordinary courſe of Nature, whereas in the other recourſe muſt be had to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                  <p>But though our Authors way of explicating <hi>Rarefaction</hi> be thus improbable, yet I muſt not here omit to take notice, that his <hi>Funiculus</hi> ſuppoſes a <hi>Condenſation</hi> that to me appears incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57681:30"/>
with no leſs manifeſt difficulties. For, ſince he teaches that a body may be condens'd without either having any vacuities for the compreſt parts to retire into, or having Pores filled with any ſubtile and yielding matter that may be ſqueez'd out of them; it will follow, that the parts of the body to be condens'd do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately touch each other: which ſuppoſed, I demand how bodies that are already contiguous can be brought to farther Approximations without penetrating each other, at leaſt in ſome of their parts. So that I ſee not how the Examiners Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation can be perform'd without <hi>penetration of dimenſions.</hi> A thing that Philoſophers of all Ages have looked upon as by no means to be admitted in Nature. And our Author himſelf ſpeaks ſomewhere at the ſame rate, where to the Queſtion, Why the walls that incloſe fired Gun-powder muſt be blown aſunder? <hi>Reſpondeo</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>haec omnia inde accidere, quod pulvis ille ſic accenſus &amp; in flammam converſus,</hi>

Unde fit, ut cum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cubiculum antea fuerit pleniſsimum, diſrumpantur ſic parietes, ne detur corporum penetratio.</hi> In the <hi>Magdeburgick</hi> Experiment he tells us (as we have heard already) that the whole capacity of the Globe is filled with an extremely thin body. But not now to examine how properly he calls that a <hi>rare</hi> body, which according to him intercepts neither Pores nor any heterogeneous ſubſtance, the greater or leſſer abſence of which makes men call a body more or leſs <hi>denſe;</hi> not to inſiſt on this, I ſay, let us conſider, that before the admiſſion of water into the exhauſted Globe there was, according to him, two thouſand half Inches of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which, however it was produc'd or got thither, <hi>was</hi> a true and real body; and that after the admiſſion of the water there remained in the ſame Globe, beſides the water that came in, no more then one half Inch of body. Since then our Author does not pretend (which if he did, might be eaſily diſproved) that the one thouſand nine hundred ninety nine half Inches of Matter, that now appear no more, traverſed the body of Water; ſince he will not allow that it gets away through the Pores of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57681:30"/>
Glaſs, I demand, what becomes of ſo great a quantity of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For that 'tis annihilated I ſuppoſe he is too rational a man to pretend, (nor, if he ſhould, would it be at all believ'd) and to ſay, that a thouſand and ſo many hundred parts of Matter ſhould be retir'd into that one part of ſpace that contains the one half Inch of Air, is little leſs incredible: For that ſpace was ſuppos'd perfectly full of body before, and how a thing can be more then perfectly full, who can conceive? To diſpatch: According to our Authors way of Condenſation, two, or perhaps two thouſand, bodles may be crouded into a ſpace that is adequately fill'd by one of them apart. And if this be not Penetration of Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I deſire to be informed what is ſo; and till then I ſhall leave it to any unprepoſſeſs'd Naturaliſt to judge, whether an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that needs ſuppoſe a thing ſo generally concluded to be impoſſible to Nature, be <hi>probable</hi> or not; and whether to tell us that the very ſame parcel of Air, that is now without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence contain'd in half an Inch of ſpace, ſhall by and by fill two thouſand times as much room, and preſently after ſhrink again into the two thouſandth part of the ſpace it hewly poſſeſs'd, be not to turn a Body into a Spirit, and, confounding their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, attribute to the former the diſcriminating and leaſt eaſily conceivable properties of the later. And this Argument is, I confeſs, with me of that weight, that this alone would keep me from admitting the Examiners <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> yet if any happier Contemplator ſhall prove ſo ſharp-ſighted, as to deviſe and clearly propoſe a way of making the Rarefaction and Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hither to argued againſt, intelligible to me, he is not like to find me obſtinate. Nor indeed is there ſufficient cauſe why his ſucceeding in that attempt ſhould make our Adverſaries <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> preferrable to ours, ſince that would not prove it either <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>ſufficient,</hi> but onely anſwer <hi>ſome</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that tend to prove 'tis not <hi>intelligible.</hi> And that we have other Arguments on our ſide then thoſe that relate to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction and Condenſation, may appear partly by what has been diſcours'd already, and partly by what we have now to ſubjoyn.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Conſideration (pertinent to the preſent Controverſie) of what happens in trying the <hi>Torricellian</hi> and other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at the tops and feet of Hills.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere remain then yet a couple of Conſiderations to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd againſt the Examiners <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which, though the paſt Diſcourſe may make them be look'd upon as needleſs, we muſt not pretermit, becauſe they contain ſuch Arguments as may not onely be imployed againſt our Adverſaries Doctrine, but will very much tend to the confirmation of ours.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then further, that the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> I am oppoſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a kind of Inverſion of ours, and ſuppoſing the ſpring or motion of Reſtitution in the Air to tend inwards, as according to us it tends outwards; it cannot be, that if the ſuppoſition it ſelf were (what I think I have prov'd it is not) true, many of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> would be plauſibly enough explicable by it: the ſame motions in an intermediate body being in many caſes producible alike, whether we ſuppoſe it to be thruſt or drawn; provided both the endeavours tend the ſame way. But then we may be ſatisfied whether the effect be to be aſcribed to Pulſion or to Traction, (as they commonly ſpeak, though indeed the later ſeems reducible to the former) if we can find out an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein there is reaſon ſuch an effect ſhould follow, in caſe Pulſion be the cauſe inquired after, and not in caſe it be Tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſuch an <hi>Experimentum Crucis</hi> (to ſpeak with our <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Verulam)</hi> is afforded us by that noble Obſervation of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Paſchall,</hi> mentioned by the famous <hi>Pecquet,</hi> and out of him by our Author: namely, that the <hi>Torricellian</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> Experiment being made at the foot and in divers places of a very high Mountain, (of the altitude of five hundred fathom or three thouſand foot) he found, that after he had aſcended a hundred
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57681:31"/>
and fifty Fathom, the Quickſilver was fallen two Inches and a quarter below its ſtation at the Mountains foot; and that at the very top of the Hill it had deſcended above three Inches below the ſame wonted ſtation. Whence it appears that the Quickſilver being carried up towards the top of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> falls down the lower, the higher the place is wherin the obſervation is made: of which the reaſon is plain in our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> namely, that the nearer we come to the top of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> the ſhorter and lighter is the Cylinder of Air incumbent upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury;</hi> and conſequently the leſs weight of Cylindrical <hi>Mercury</hi> will that Air be able to counter-poiſe and keep ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ſince this notable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> does thus clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon ours, and not upon our Adverſaries <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> this Experiment ſeems to determine the Controverſie betwixt them: becauſe in this caſe the Examiner cannot pretend, as he does in the ſeventeenth and divers other of our Experiments, that the Deſcent of the Quickſilver in the Tube is caus'd, not by the Diminution of the external Airs preſſure, but from the preternatural Rarefaction or Diſtenſion of that external Air (in the Receiver) when by ſeeking to reſtore it ſelf, it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to draw up the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury:</hi> For in our preſent caſe there appears no ſuch forcible Dilatation of that Air, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Engine he is pleas'd to imagine.</p>
                  <p>It need therefore be no great wonder, if his Adverſaries do, as he obſerves, make a great account of this Experiment, to prove that the <hi>Mercury</hi> is kept up in the Tube by the reſiſtance of the external Aire. Nor do I think his Anſwers to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from hence will keep them from thinking it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. For to an Objection upon which he takes notice that they lay ſo much ſtreſs, he replyes but two things; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingly nor together will near amount to a ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> he queſtions the truth of the Obſervation it ſelf; becauſe having made tryal in a low Hill, the event did no wayes anſwer his Expectation. But though, in ſtead of diſapproving,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57681:32"/>
I am willing to commend his Curioſity, to make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf, and eſpecially ſince 'twas both new and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and though alſo I like his Modeſty, in rather ſuſpecting ſome miſtake in the manner of the Obſervation, then that the Experimenters did not ſincerely deliver it: yet, ſince there muſt be an Error ſomewhere, I muſt rather charge it upon the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners obſervation (I ſay his Obſervation, not his want of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity) then upon <hi>Monſieur Paſchals.</hi> For beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations that the <hi>learned Gaſſendus,</hi> who relates the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives to that ingenious Gentleman <hi>(Monſieur Paſchal)</hi> by whoſe direction he ſuppoſes it to have been try'd: the ſame <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus</hi> relates, that the like Obſervation was five times repeated, <hi>partim intra ſacellum, partim aëre libero, &amp;</hi>

                     <hi>nunc quidem flante, nunc ſilente vento.</hi> Which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſufficiently argue the Diligence wherewith the Experiment was try'd in <hi>Auvergne.</hi> Eſpecially ſince I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm theſe Obſervations by two more made on diſtant Hills in <hi>England:</hi> the one of which I procur'd from that known <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> Mr. <hi>J. Ball,</hi> whom I deſir'd to make the Experiment at a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> on the ſide whereof he dwelt; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> by that ingenious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Rich. Townley.</hi> Both which Obſervations, ſince I have mention'd them at large in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Phyſico Mechanical</hi> Treatiſe, ſhall not now repeat; contenting my ſelf to obſerve to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, that however the proportion of the Deſcent of the Quickſilver may vary, according to the differing conſiſtence and other Accidents of the neighbouring Air, in the particular places and times of the Experiments being made, yet all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations agree in this, That nearer the top of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> the Quickſilver falls lower then it does further from it. To all this I ſhall adde two things that will very much confirm our <hi>Hypotheſis. The one</hi> is, that the freſhly-nam'd Mr. <hi>Townley,</hi> and divers ingenious Perſons that aſſiſted at the Tryal, bethought themſelves of ſo making the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment at the top of the Hill, as to leave a determinate quantity of Air in the
<pb facs="tcp:57681:32"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57681:33"/>
                     <figure/>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57681:33"/>
Tube, before the mouth of it was open'd under the veſſell'd <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> and taking notice how low ſuch a quantity of that Air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder, they likewiſe obſerv'd, that at the Mountains foot the included Air was not able to depreſs the Quickſilver ſo much. Whence we inferre, that the Cylinder of Air at the top of the Hill being ſhorter and lighter, did not ſo ſtrongly preſs againſt the included Air, as did the ambient Air at the bottom of the Hill, where the <hi>Aereal</hi> Cylinder was longer and heavier.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe that though Experiments made in very elevated places are noble ones, and of great importance in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about the Air, yet there are but very few of thoſe that are qualified to make Experiments of that Nature, who have the opportunity of making them upon high Mountains; we did with the aſſiſtance of an ingenious man attempt a Tryal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we hoped to find a ſenſibly-differing Weight of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpere,</hi> in a far leſs height then that of an ordinary Hill. But in ſtead of a common Tube we made uſe of a kind of Weather-glaſs, that the included Air might help to make the event notable, for a reaſon to be mentioned ere long; and in ſtead of Quickſilver we employ'd common Water in the Pipe belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Weather-glaſs, that ſmall changes in the Weight or reſiſtance of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> in oppoſit on of the included Air might be the more diſcernable. The Inſtrument we made uſe of conſiſted only of a Glaſs with a broad Foot and a narrow Neck (A B) and a ſlender Glaſs-Pipe (C D) open at both ends: which Pipe was ſo placed, that the bottom of it did almoſt, but not quite, reach to the bottom of the bigger Glaſs (A B) within whoſe Neck (A) it was faſtned with a cloſe cement, that both kept the Pipe in its place, and hindred all communication betwixt the inward (I I) and outward (K K) Air, ſave by the cavity of the Pipe (C D). Now we choſe this Glaſs (A B) more then ordinarily capacious, that the effect of the dilatation of the included Air (I I) might be the more conſpicuous. Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a convenient quantity of Water (H H) into this Glaſs,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57681:34"/>
we carried it to the Leads of the lofty Abby-Church at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and there blew in a little Air to raiſe the Water to the upper part of the Pipe, that being above the Veſſel (A B) we might more preciſely mark the ſeveral ſtations of the Water then otherwiſe we could. Afterward having ſuffered the Glaſs to reſt a pretty while upon the Lead, that the Air (I I) within might be reduc'd to the ſame ſtate, both as to coldneſs and as to preſſure, with (K K) that without, having marked the ſtation of the Water (F), we gently let down the Veſſel by a long ſtring to the foot of the Wall, where one attended to receive it; who having ſuffer'd it to reſt upon the ground, cry'd to us that it was ſubſided about an Inch below the mark (F) we had put: whereupon having order'd him to put a mark at this ſecond ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it (E), we drew up the Veſſel again; and ſuffering it to reſt a while, we obſerv'd the Water to be re-aſcended to or near the firſt mark (F), which was indeed about an Inch above (E) the other. And this we did that Evening a ſecond time with almoſt a like ſucceſs: though two or three dayes after, the wind blowing ſtrongly upon the Leads, we found not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment to ſucceed quite ſo regularly as before; yet the Water alwayes manifeſtly fell lower at the foot of the Wall then it was at the top: which I ſee no cauſe to aſcribe barely to the differing temperature of the Air above and below, as to Heat and Cold, ſince according to the general eſtimate, the more elevated Region of the Air is, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> colder then that below, which would rather check the greater expanſion of the included Air at the top of the Leads then promote it. But the better to avoid miſtakes and prevent Objections, we thought fit to try the Experiment within the Church, and got into a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the ſame height with the Leads: but the upper part of the Pipe being caſually broken off, we thought fit to order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo, that the ſurface (G) of the remaining Water in the Pipe ſhould be about an Inch higher then the ſurface of the Water in the Veſſel. And then my above-mentioned Correſpondent letting down the Glaſs, almoſt as ſoon as it was ſetled upon the

pavement, kneeling down to ſee how far it was ſubſided, I found that not only it was fallen as low as the other Water, but that the outward Air depreſt it ſo far, as whileſt I was looking on, to break in beneath the bottom of the Pipe, and aſcend through the Water in bubbles: after which the Glaſs being drawn up again, my Correſpondent affirm'd, that the Water was very manifeſtly re-aſcended. But becauſe by the unlucky breaking of a Glaſs, we were hindred to obſerve, as we deſigned, what would happen as well in a Weather-glaſs, ſo contriv'd that the weight or preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> ſhould make no change in it, as in another whoſe included Air was at the top, (whereas in that we imploy'd the included Air was in the lower part,) and becauſe there happened in our Tryals a Circumſtance or two that ſeem'd not ſo devoid of difficulties, but that we think it may require further examination, we deſign to ſet down a more particular account of this Experiment, (as how it ſucceeds with Quickſilver inſtead of Water, together with the capacity of the Veſſel (A B) and the bore of the Pipe (C D) with ſome other variety of Circumſtances) together with the event of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity we had (which ſeemed very ſucceſsful) to try the <hi>Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi> Experiment upon the above-mentioned Leads, and then let down the Tube together with the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> to the ground, to obſerve the increaſing altitude of the Quickſilver, in the formerly-mentioned <hi>Appendix</hi> to the Epiſtle we have been defending. And it ſhall ſuffice us in the mean time that the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als already mentioned ſeem to make it evident enough that the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> gravitates more, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> neer the ſurface of the Earth, then in the more elevated parts of the Air. For the Leads on which we made our Tryals were found by meaſure to be in perpendicular height but threeſcore and fifteen Foot from the ground. To which we ſhall only add this at preſent, that once being deſirous to obſerve what we could touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the ſubſidence of the Water to the height of its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtations from the ground, purpoſely carrying down the Veſſel ſo as not conſiderably to heat it, from the Leads down
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57681:35"/>
the ſtaires to a little window that we gueſt to be almoſt half way to the bottom, we there perceived the water to have already ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided about a Barley-Corns length, notwithſtanding that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in ſpight of our care, the veſſel were a little warmed by the heat of his body that carried it, ſince by that time we were come to the foot of the Wall, the Water ſtood almoſt at the higheſt mark; but after the Veſſel was ſuffered to reſt a while, it relapſed by degrees to the loweſt. And thus much for the firſt of the things I had to repreſent in favour of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>The other Particular I ſhall mention for confirmation of our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> is that Experiment (which, though it be needleſs, ſeems yet more cogent and proper to prevent Evaſions) made by the ſame <hi>Monſieur Paſchal,</hi> of carrying a weakly-blown Foot-ball from the bottom to the top of an high Mountain. For that Foot-ball ſwell'd more and more, the higher it was carried, ſo that it appeared as if it were full blown at the top of the Mountain, and gradually growing lank again, as it was carried; downwards; ſo that at the foot of the Hill it was flaccid as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This, I ſay, having thus happened, we have here an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to prove our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> wherein recourſe cannot be had to any forcibly and preternaturally diſtended Body, ſuch as that is pretended to be which remaines in the deſerted ſpace of the Tube in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment.</p>
                  <p>The other thing which the Examiner alledges againſt our Argument from <hi>Monſieur Paſchals</hi> Tryals, is, that ſuppoſing it to be true, yet it cannot thence be inferr'd, that the ſubſidence of the <hi>Mercury</hi> at the top of the Hill proceeded from the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical</hi> Cylinder's being there lighter and leſs able to ſuſtain the Quickſilver. <hi>Sed dici poteſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ideo ſic in vertice Montis magis deſcendiſſe, quod ibidem eſſet</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag 68.</note> 
                     <hi>Aura frigidior, aut ex alio Temperamento hujuſmodi deſcenſum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante.</hi> But this ſolution will not ſerve the turn: For the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ambient Air (which yet the Experimenters take not notice of) would rather contract the rarefied ſubſtance within the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57681:35"/>
Tube, and ſo draw up the <hi>Mercury</hi> higher, as our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teaches us, that 'tis from the ſhrinking of the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus</hi> occaſion'd by the cold that the Water in <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 50.</note> aſcends in cold weather. And whereas the only proof he adds of ſo improbable an Explication is taken from our eighteenth Experiment, wherein we relate, that ſometimes the Quickſilver did ſenſibly fall lower in colder then in far leſs cold weather: I anſwer, that this eighteenth Experiment will ſcarce make more for him then againſt him: For, as I there take notice that the Quickſilver deſcended in cold weather, ſo it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſcended likewiſe in hot weather, and roſe in cold. And 'tis very ſtrange, that in all the Obſervations made, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Countries and at differing times, it ſhould ſtill ſo happen that the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder ſhould be ſhorter near the top of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> then further from it; if the reſiſtance of the outward Air have nothing to do with the keeping it ſuſpended. And 'tis yet more ſtrange, that the Foot-ball ſhould in like manner grow turgid and flaccid, according as it is carried into places where it has a ſhorter or longer Pillar of Air incumbent on it.</p>
                  <p>I was going to proceed to what remains of this Second Part of our Treatiſe, but that ſince I begun this Chapter caſually meeting with an Experiment lately ſent in a Letter to a very Ingenious <note n="†" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Croon</hi> one of the learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge.</note> Acquaintance of his and mine by a very Induſtrious Phyſician <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Hen. Power.</note> (who is ſaid to have had the curioſity to try over again many of the Experiments of our Engine) and finding it very proper to confirm our newly related Experiment made at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and to be of ſuch a nature as we have not in this part of <hi>England</hi> the opportunity to try the like, for want of Hills high enough, I ſhall (according to the permiſſion given me) inſert it in this place. And the rather, that as the Mountains have by the Trials made on them of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, afforded us a noble proof of the weight of the Air; ſo they may afford us one of its Spring: wherein I hope the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Waters deſcent will not be aſcribed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57681:36"/>
to any attraction made of the Water by the violently-diſtended outward Air. And becauſe the Experiment was not made by us, but by another, we will ſet it down in his words, which are theſe: <hi>This fifteenth of October 1661. we took a Weather-glaſs</hi> A B, <hi>of about two foot in length, and carrying it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">See the ſecond Figure.</note> 
                     <hi>to the bottom of</hi> Hallifax <hi>Hill, the Water ſtood in the ſhank at thirteen Inches above the Water in the Veſſel: Thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it thus fill'd, with the whole frame, immediately to the top of the ſaid Hill, the Water fell down to the point</hi> D, <hi>viz. an Inch and a quarter lower then it was at the bottom of the ſaid Hill; which</hi> (as he rightly inferrs) <hi>proves the Elaſticity of the Air: for the internal Air</hi> A C, <hi>which was of the ſame power and extenſion with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at the bottom of the Hill, did manifeſt a greater Elaſticity then the Mountain-Air there</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Probably theſe or the like words, <hi>did manifeſt Preſſure,</hi> are here omitted, for the Mountaine-Aire there ſeems to have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather by its Weight then Elaſticity.</note>, <hi>and ſo extended it ſelf further by</hi> C D.</p>
                  <p>The like Experiment, I hear, the ſame Ingenious Doctor has very lately repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and found the deſcent of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be greater then before. And though ſome <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> have thought it ſtrange, that in an Hill far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Appennines,</hi> ſo ſhort a Cylinder of ſo light al quor as Water ſhould fall ſo much; yet I ſee not any reaſon to diſtruſt upon this ground either His Experiment or Ours (late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd to have been made at <hi>Weſtminſter;)</hi> but rather to wonder the Water fell not more (if the Hill be conſiderably high:) for their ſuſpicion ſeems grounded upon a miſtake, as if becauſe the Quick-ſilver in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment made without purpoſely leaving any Air in the Tube, would not, at the top of the mention'd Hill, have ſubſided above an Inch, if ſo much, the Water, that is near fourteen times lighter, ſhould not fall above a fourteenth part of that ſpace; whereas in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, the upper and deſerted ſpace of the Tube has little or no Air left in it, but the Correſpondent part of the Weather-glaſs was furniſh'd with Air, whoſe preſſure was little leſs then that of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> at the bottom of the Hill;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57681:36"/>
and conſequently muſt be much greater then the preſſure of the ſame Atmoſphere at the top of the Hill, where the Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Cylinder's gravity (upon whoſe account it preſſes) muſt be much diminiſh'd by its being made much ſhorter, and by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of an Air leſs compreſt. And thus much for the firſt of the two Conſiderations wherewith I promiſed to conclude this ſecond part of the preſent Tract. Onely before I proceed I muſt in a word deſire the Reader to take notice, that though I have here ſingled out but one of the nine Experiments which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer in the 11. and 12. Chapters reckons up as urg'd by his Adverſaries; yet I do not thereby declare my acquieſcing in his Explications of thoſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> but onely leave both them and ſome other things he delivers about Siphons and the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> Experiments, to be diſcours'd by thoſe that are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to examine them, contenting my ſelf to have ſufficiently diſproved the <hi>Funiculus</hi> which his Expoſitions ſuppoſe, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the grounds of explicating ſuch Experiments aright.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe other thing that I would have conſidered touching our Adverſaries <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is, That it is <hi>needleſs.</hi> For whereas he denies not that the Air has ſome Weight and Spring, but affirms that it is very inſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <note place="margin">Page 11.</note> ſuch great matters as the counterpoiſing of a Mercurial Cylinder of 29. Inches, as we teach that it may: We ſhall now endeavour to manifeſt by Experiments purpoſely made, that the Spring of the Air is capable of doing far more then 'tis neceſſary for us to aſcribe to it, to ſalve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57681:37"/>
We took then a long Glaſs-Tube, which by a dexterous hand and the help of Lamp was in ſuch a manner crooked at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that the part turned up was almoſt parallel to the reſt of the Tube, and the Orifice of this ſhorter leg of the Siphon (if I may ſo call the whole Inſtrument) being Hermetically ſeal'd, the length of it was divided into Inches, (each of which was ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into eight parts) by a ſtraight liſt of paper, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Diviſions was carefully paſted all along it: then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in as much Quickſilver as ſerved to fill the Arch or bended part of the Siphon, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſtanding in a level might reach in the one leg to the bottom of the divided paper, and juſt to the ſame height or Horizontal line in the other; we took care, by frequently inclining the Tube, ſo that the Air might freely paſsfrom one leg into the other by the ſides of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> (we took (I ſay) care) that the Air at laſt included in the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Cylinder ſhould be of the ſame laxity with the reſt of the Air about it. This done, we began to pour Quickſilver into the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leg of the Siphon, which by its weight preſſing up that in the ſhorter leg, did by degrees ſtreighten the included Air: and continuing this pouring in of Quickſilver till the Air in the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leg was by condenſation reduced to take up but half the ſpace it poſſeſs'd (I ſay, <hi>poſſeſs'd,</hi> not <hi>fill'd)</hi> before; we caſt our eyes upon the longer leg of the Glaſs, on which was likewiſe paſted a liſt of Paper carefully divided into Inches and parts, and we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not without delight and ſatisfaction, that the Quickſilver in that longer part of the Tube was 29. Inches higher then the other. Now that this Obſervation does both very well agree with and confirm our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> will be eaſily diſcerned by him that takes notice that we teach, and Monſieur <hi>Paſchall</hi> and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> friends Experiments prove, that the greater the weight is that leans upon the Air, the more forcible is its endeavour of Dilatation, and conſequently its power of reſiſtance, (as other Springs are ſtronger when bent by greater weights.) For this being conſidered, it wil appear to agree rarely-well with the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> that as according to it the Air in that degree of denſity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57681:37"/>
and correſpondent meaſure of reſiſtance to which the weight of the incumbent Atmoſphere had brought it, was able to counter-balance and reſiſt the preſſure of a Mercurial Cylinder of about 29. Inches, as we are taught by the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment; ſo here the ſame Air being brought to a degree of denſity about twice as great as that it had before, obtains a Spring twice as ſtrong as formerly. As may appear by its being able to ſuſtain or reſiſt a Cylinder of 29. Inches in the longer Tube, together with the weight of the Atmoſpherical Cylinder, that lean'd upon thoſe 29. Inches of <hi>Mercury;</hi> and, as we juſt now inferr'd from the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, was equivalent to them.</p>
                  <p>We were hindered from proſecuting the tryal at that time by the caſual breaking of the Tube. But becauſe an accurate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this nature would be of great importance to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Spring of the Air, and has not yet been made (that I know) by any man; and becauſe alſo it is more uneaſie to be made then one would think, in regard of the difficulty as well of procuring crooked Tubes fit for the purpoſe, as of making a juſt eſtimate of the true place of the Protuberant <hi>Mercury</hi>'s ſurface; I ſuppoſe it will not be unwelcome to the Reader, to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that after ſome other tryals, one of which we made in a Tube whoſe longer leg was perpendicular, and the other, that contained the Air, parallel to the Horizon, we at laſt procured a Tube of the Figure expreſt in the Scheme; which Tube, though of a pretty bigneſs, was ſo long, that the <note place="margin">See the 5. Figure.</note> Cylinder whereof the ſhorter leg of it conſiſted ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a liſt of Paper, which had before been divided into 12. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and their quarters, and the longer leg admitted another liſt of Paper of divers foot in length, and divided after the ſame manner: then Quickſilver being poured in to fill up the bended part of the Glaſs, that the ſurface of it in either leg might reſt in the ſame Horizontal line, as we lately taught, there was more and more Quickſilver poured into the longer Tube; and notice being watchfully taken how far the <hi>Mercury</hi> was riſen in that longer Tube, when it appeared to have aſcended to any of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57681:38"/>
diviſions in the ſhorter Tube, the ſeveral Obſervations that were thus ſucceſſively made, and as they were made ſet down, afforded us the enſuing Table.</p>

                  <p>For the better underſtanding of this Experiment it may not be amiſs to take notice of the following particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Tube being ſo tall that we could not convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make uſe of it in a Chamber, we were fain to uſe it on a pair of Stairs, which yet were very lightſom, the Tube being for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57681:38"/>
ſake by ſtrings ſo ſuſpended, that it did ſcarce touch the Box preſently to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The lower and crooked part of the Pipe was placed in a ſquare wooden Box, of a good largneſs and depth, to prevent the loſs of the Quickſilver that might fall aſide in the transfuſion from the Veſſel into the Pipe, and to receive the whole Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in caſe the Tube ſhould break.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we were two to make the obſervation together, the one to take notice at the bottom how the Quickſilver roſe in the ſhorter Cylinder, and the other to pour in at the top of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it being very hard and troubleſome for one man alone to do both accurately.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Quickſilver was poured in but by little and little, according to the direction of him that obſerved below, it being far eaſier to pour in more, then to take out any in caſe too much at once had been poured in.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That at the beginning of the Operation, that we might the more truly diſcern where the Quickſilver reſted from time to time, we made uſe of a ſmall Looking-glaſs, held in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poſture to reflect to the eye what we deſired to diſcern.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That when the Air was ſo compreſs'd, as to be crouded into leſs then a quarter of the ſpace it poſſeſs'd before, we tryed whether the cold of a Linen Cloth dipp'd in water would then condenſe it. And it ſometimes ſeemed a little to ſhrink, but not ſo manifeſtly as that we dare build any thing upon it. We then tryed likewiſe whether heat would notwithſtanding ſo forcible a compreſſure dilate it, and approching the flame of a Candle to that part where the Air was pent up, the heat had a more ſenſible operation then the cold had before; ſo that we ſcarce doubted but that the expanſion of the Air would notwithſtanding the weight that oppreſt it have been made conſpicuous, if the fear of unſeaſonably breaking the Glaſs had not kept us from increaſing the heat.</p>
                  <p>Now although we deny not but that in our Table ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars do not ſo exactly anſwer to what our formerly intimated
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57681:39"/>
                     <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> might perchance invite the Reader to expect; yet the Variations are not ſo conſiderable, but that they may probably enough be aſcribed to ſome ſuch want of exactneſs as in ſuch nice Experiments is ſcarce avoidable. But for all that, till further tryal hath more clearly informed me, I ſhall not venture to determine whether or no the intimated Theory will hold univerſally and preciſely, either in Condenſation of Air, or Rarefaction: all that I ſhall now urge being, That however, the tryal already made ſufficiently proves the main thing for which I here alledge it; ſince by it 'tis evident, that as common Air when reduc'd to half its wonted extent, obtained near about twice as forcible a Spring as it had before; ſo this thus-compreſt Air being further thruſt into half this narrow room, obtained thereby a Spring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as ſtrong again as that it laſt had, and conſequently four times as ſtrong as that of the common Air. And there is no cauſe to doubt, that if we had been here furniſht with a greater quantity of Quickſilver and a very ſtrong Tube, we might by a further compreſſion of the included Air have made it counter-balance the preſſure of a far taller and heavier Cylinder of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi> For no man perhaps yet knows how near to an infinite compreſſion the Air may be capable of, if the compreſſing force be competently increaſt. So that here our Adverſary may plainly ſee that the Spring of the Air, which he makes ſo light of, may not onely be able to reſiſt the weight of 29. Inches, but in ſome caſes of above an hundred Inches of Quickſilver, and that without the aſſiſtance of his <hi>Funiculus,</hi> which in our preſent caſe has nothing to do. And to let you ſee that we did not (a little above) inconſiderately mention the weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Atmoſpherical Cylinder as a part of the weight reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the impriſoned Air, we will here annex, that we took care, when the Mercurial Cylinder in the longer leg of the Pipe was about an hundred Inches high, to cauſe one to ſuck at the open Orifice; whereupon (as we expected) the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube did notably aſcend. Which conſiderable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> cannot be aſcribed to our Examiners <hi>Funiculus,</hi> ſince by his own confeſſion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57681:39"/>
that cannot pull up the <hi>Mercury,</hi> if the Mercurial Cylinder be above 29. or 30. Inches of <hi>Mercury.</hi> And therefore we ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this reaſon of it, That the preſſure of the incumbent Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in part taken off by its expanding it ſelf into the Suckers dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cheſt; the impriſon'd Air was thereby enabled to dilate it ſelf manifeſtly, and repel the <hi>Mercury</hi> that compreſt it, till there was an equality of force betwixt the ſtrong Spring of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt Air on the one part, and the tall Mercurial Cylinder, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the contiguous dilated Air, on the other part.</p>
                  <p>Now, if to what we have thus delivered concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Air we adde ſome Obſervations concerning its ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Expanſion, it will the better appear how much the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of theſe Mercurial Experiments depend upon the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſures of ſtrength to be met with in the Airs Spring, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its various degrees of Compreſſion and Laxity. But, before I enter upon this ſubject, I ſhall readily acknowledge that I had not reduc'd the tryals I had made about meaſuring the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of the Air to any certain <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> when that ingenious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Richard Townely</hi> was pleaſed to inform me, that having by the peruſal of my <hi>Phyſico-Mechanical</hi> Experiments been ſatisfied that the Spring of the Air was the cauſe of it, he had endeavoured (and I wiſh in ſuch attempts other ingenious men would follow his example) to ſupply what I had omitted concerning the reducing to a preciſe eſtimate how much Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of it ſelf loſes of its Elaſtical force, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of its Dilatation. He added, that he had begun to ſet down what occurred to him to this purpoſe in a ſhort Diſcourſe, whereof he afterwards did me the favour to ſhew me the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which gives me a juſt Curioſity to ſee it perfected. But, becauſe I neither know, nor (by reaſon of the great diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our places of reſidence) have at preſent the opportunity to enquire, whether he will think fit to annex his Diſcourſe to our <hi>Appendix,</hi> or to publiſh it by it ſelf, or at all; and becauſe he hath not yet, for ought I know, met with fit Glaſſes to make an any-thing-accurate Table of the Decrement of the force of dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57681:40"/>
Air; our preſent deſign invites us to preſent the Reader with that which follows, wherein I had the aſſiſtance of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I took notice of in the former Chapter, as having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſomething about Rarefaction: whom I the rather make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of on this occaſion, becauſe when he firſt heard me ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Townley</hi>'s ſuppoſitions about the proportion wherein Air loſes of its Spring by Dilatation, he told me he had the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (and not long after the publication of my <hi>Pneumatical</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe) made Obſervations to the ſame purpoſe, which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to agree well enough with Mr. <hi>Townley</hi>'s Theory: And ſo did (as their Author was pleaſed to tell me) ſome Tryals made about the ſame time by that Noble <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> and eminent Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician the Lord <hi>Brouncker,</hi> from whoſe further Enquiries into this matter, if his occaſions will allow him to make them, the Curious may well hope for ſomething very accurate.</p>

To make the Experiment of the debilitated force of expanded Air the plainer, 'twill not be amiſs to note ſome particulars, eſpecially touching the manner of making the Tryal; which (for the reaſons lately mention'd) we made on a lightſome pair of ſtairs, and with a Box alſo lin'd with Paper to receive the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> that might be ſpilt. And in regard it would require a vaſt and in few places procurable quantity of Quickſilver, to employ veſſels of ſuch kind as are ordinary in the <hi>Torriccllian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we made uſe of a Glaſs-Tube of about ſix foot long, for that being Hermetically ſealed at one end, ſerv'd our turn as well as if we could have made the Experiment in a <hi>Tub</hi> or <hi>Pond</hi> of ſeventy Inches deep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We alſo provided a ſlender Glaſs-Pipe of about the bigneſs of a Swans Quill, and open at both ends: all along which was paſted a narrow liſt of Paper divided into Inches and half quarters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſlender Pipe being thruſt down into the greater Tube almoſt fill'd with Quickſilver, the Glaſs helpt to make it ſwell to the top of the Tube, and the Quickſilver getting in at the lower orifice of the Pipe, fill'd it up till the <hi>Mercury</hi> included in that was near about a level with the ſurface of the ſurrounding <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There being, as near as we could gueſs, little more then an Inch of the ſlender Pipe left above the ſurface of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> and conſequently unfill'd therewith, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent orifice was carefully clos'd with ſealing Wax melted; after which the Pipe was let alone for a while, that the Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated a little by the heat of the Wax, might upon refrigeration be reduc'd to its wonted denſity. And then we obſerv'd by the help of the above-mentioned liſt of Paper, whether we had not included ſomewhat more or ſomewhat leſs then an Inch of Air, and in either caſe we were fain to rectifie the error by a ſmall hole made (with an heated Pin) in the Wax, and afterwards clos'd up again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Having thus included a juſt Inch of Air, we liſted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57681:41"/>
up the ſlender Pipe by degrees, till the Air was dilated to an Inch, an Inch and an half, two Inches, &amp;c. and obſerved in Inches and Eighths, the length of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder, which at each degree of the Airs expanſion was impell'd above the ſurface of the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Obſervations being ended, we preſently made the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment with the above-mention'd great Tube of ſix foot long, that we might know the height of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder, for that particular day and hour; which height we found to be 29 ¾ Inches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Our Obſervations made after this manner furniſh'd us with the preceding Table, in which there would not probably have been found the difference here ſet down betwixt the force of the Air when expanded to double its former dimenſions, and what that force ſhould have been preciſely according to the Theory, but that the included Inch of Air receiv'd ſome little acceſſion during the Tryal; which this newly-mention'd diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence making us ſuſpect, we found by replunging the Pipe into the Quickſilver, that the included Air had gain'd about half an eighth, which we gueſt to have come from ſome little aerial bubbles in the Quickſilver, contain'd in the Pipe (ſo eaſie is it in ſuch nice Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to miſs of exactneſs.) We try'd alſo with 12. Inches of Air ſhut up to be dilated; but being then hindred by ſome unwelcome avocations to proſecure thoſe Experiments, we ſhall elſewhere, out of other Notes and Tryals (God permitting) ſet down ſome other accurate Tables concerning this matter. By which poſſibly we may be aſſiſted to reſolve whether the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere</hi> ſhould be look'd upon (as it uſually is) as a limited and bounded Portion of the Air; or whether we ſhould in a ſtricter ſenſe then we did before, uſe the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> and <hi>Aereal</hi> part of the World for almoſt equivalent terms; or elſe whether we ſhould allow the word <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> ſome other notion in relation to its Extent and Limits; (for as to its Spring and Weight, theſe Experiments do not queſtion, but evince them.) But we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as we ſaid, to referre theſe matters to our <hi>Appendix,</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57681:41"/>
till then to retain our wonted manner of ſpeaking of the Air and <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> In the mean time (to return to our laſt-mention'd Experiments) beſides that ſo little a variation may be in great part imputed to the difficulty of making Experiments of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exactly, and perhaps a good part of it to ſomething of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the Cavity of the Pipe, or even in the thickneſs of the Glaſs; beſides this, I ſay, the proportion betwixt the ſeveral preſſures of the included Air undilated and expanded, eſpecially when the Dilatation was great (for when the Air ſwell'd but to four times its firſt extent, the Mercurial Cylinder, though of near 23. Inches, differ'd not a quarter of an Inch from what it ſhould have been according to Mathematical exactneſs) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, I ſay, was ſutable enough to what might be expected, to allow us to make this reflection upon the whole, That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the intimated Theory will hold exactly, (for about that, as I ſaid above, I dare determine nothing reſolutely till I have further conſidered the matter) yet <hi>ſince</hi> the Inch of Air when it was firſt included was ſhut up with no other preſſure then that which it had from the weight of the incumbent Air, and was no more compreſt then the reſt of the Air we breathed and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in; and <hi>ſince</hi> alſo this Inch of Air, when expanded to twice its former dimenſions, was able with the help of a Mercurial Cylinder of <hi>about</hi> 15. Inches to counterpoiſe the weight of the Atmoſphere, which the weight of the external Air gravitating upon the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> was able to impell up into the Pipe, and ſuſtain above twenty eight Inches of <hi>Mercury</hi> when the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air by its great expanſion had its Spring too far debilitated to make any <hi>conſiderable</hi> (I ſay conſiderable, for it was not yet ſo dilated as not to make <hi>ſome)</hi> reſiſtance: <hi>ſince,</hi> I ſay, theſe things are ſo, the free Air here below appears to be almoſt as ſtrongly compreſt by the weight of the incumbent Air as it would be by the Weight of a <hi>Mercurial</hi> Cylinder of twenty eight or thirty Inches; and conſequently is not in ſuch a ſtate of laxity and freedom as men are wont to imagine; and acts like ſome mechanical Agent, the decreement of whoſe force holds a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57681:42"/>
ſtricter proportion to its increaſe of dimenſion, then has been hitherto taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not now ſtand to propoſe the ſeveral reflections that may be made upon the foregoing Obſervations touching the Compreſſion and Expanſion of Air; partly becauſe we could ſcarce avoid making the Hiſtorical part ſomewhat prolix; and partly becauſe I ſuppoſe we have already ſaid enough to ſhew what was intended, namely, that to ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> there is not of our Adverſaries <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> any <hi>need:</hi> the evincing of which will appear to be of no ſmall moment in our preſent Controverſie, to him that conſiders, that the two maine things that induced the Learned Examiner to reject our <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> are, that Nature abhors a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and that though the Air have ſome Weight &amp; Spring, yet theſe are inſufficient to make out the known <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> for which we muſt therefore have recourſe to his <hi>Funiculus.</hi> Now as we have formerly ſeen, that he has not ſo ſatisfactorily diſproved as reſolutely rejected a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> ſo we have now manifeſted that the Spring of the Air may ſuffice to perform greater things then what our Explication of the <hi>Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian</hi> Experiments and thoſe of our Engine obliges us to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to it. Wherefore ſince beſides the ſeveral difficulties that incumber the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> we oppoſe, and eſpecially its being ſcarce, if at all, intelligible, we can adde that it is <hi>unneceſſary;</hi> we dare expect that ſuch Readers as are not byaſs'd by their reverence for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools, will hardly reject an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which, beſides that it is very <hi>intelligible,</hi> is now prov'd to be <hi>ſufficient,</hi> only to imbrace a Doctrine that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuch a rarefaction and condenſation, as many famous Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts rejected for its not being comprehenſible, even when they knew of no other way (that was probable) of ſolving the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> wont to be explicated by it.</p>

And in his third Corollary (which we lately deſired the Reader to obſerve) ſpeaking of the Air in the Receiver (and the caſe is the ſame with the Air in the Cylinder) he affirms more then once, <hi>Eo magis extendi ac rarefieri aërem relictum, quo plus inde exhauritur, majoremque proinde acquirere vim ſeſe contrahendi.</hi> Whereas here he would have us believe, that the little internal Air that was in the Cavity of the ſhank of the Stop cock, does as ſtrongly retract the Sucker, or, which in our caſe is all one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt its depreſſion, when the Sucker is yet near the top of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, (and conſequently when the included Air is but a little dilated) as when the ſame Sucker being forced down to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Cylinder, the ſame portion of remaining Air muſt be exceedingly more diſtended.</p>

                  <p>In the Fourth Experiment, touching the ſwelling of a Bladder upon the removal of the ambient Air; and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to that removal our Author objects nothing againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication we give of it by the Spring of the Air included in the Bladder, and diſtending it according as the preſſure of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air is weakned. But he endeavours alſo to explicate it his way, to which he ſayes this circumſtance does excellently agree, that upon the regreſs of the external Air into the Receiver, the tumid Bladder immediately ſhrinks, becauſe (ſaith he) by ſuch ingreſs of the external Air, the Air in the Receiver, which drew the ſides of the Bladder outward from the middle of it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax'd. Which Explication whether it be more natural then ours (that aſcribes the ſhrinking of the Bladder to the preſſure of the Air that is let into the Receiver) let the Reader judge, who has conſidered what we have formerly objected againſt the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners <hi>Funiculus,</hi> and the Relaxation of it upon the admiſſion of Air.</p>
                  <p>As for the reaſon likewiſe he adds, why a perforated Bladder does not alſo ſwell, namely, that by the hole, how little ſoever,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57681:44"/>
the included Air is ſuck'd out by the rarefi'd ambient, we leave it to the impartial Reader to conſider whether is the more genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Explication, either ours (againſt which he has nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) or his, which to make clearly out he ought (according to what we formerly noted diſputing againſt his <hi>Funiculus)</hi> to ſhew us what kind of ſtrings they are; which though, according to him, ſtrongly faſtned to the inſide of the Receiver and the <hi>ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the Bladder, muſt draw juſt as forcibly one as another, how long ſoever they be without the Bladder in compariſon of thoſe that within the Bladder draw ſo as to hinder the diduction of its ſides. For Experience ſhews, that in a perforated Bladder the wrinkles continue as if there were no drawing at all.</p>
                  <p>And though he could deſcribe how ſuch a ſtring may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, yet our Explication will have this advantage in point of probability above his, That whereas he denies not that the Air has Spring and Weight, as we deny his <hi>Funiculus</hi> to have any other then an imaginary exiſtence; and whereas he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that by the Inſtrument the Air about the Bladder is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; to ſhew that there needs no more then that, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no <hi>Funiculus,</hi> to draw aſunder the ſides of the Bladder, we can confirm our Explication by the formerly mentioned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the ingenious <hi>Paſchall,</hi> who carrying a flaccid Foot-ball from the bottom to the top of a high Mountain, found it to ſwell proportionably as he aſcended, and as the weight and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ambient Air decreaſed, and likewiſe to ſhrink again as he deſcended. And yet in this caſe there is no recourſe to be had to a <hi>Funiculus</hi> of violently-rarefi'd Air to draw aſunder eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way the ſides of the Foot-ball.

                  <p>But, I do confeſs, I do for all this think our Explication more true, then well conſidered by our Author. For the putting of water into the Vial that was broken, was done (as is clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the beginning of our Narrative) upon a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (as indeed we tryed divers other things with our Engine, not ſo much with immediate reference to the Spring of the Air, as to make uſe of ſuch Tryals in ſome other of our Writings.) And accordingly in the ſecond Tryal mentioned in the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment the water was omitted. But, notwithſtanding this water, the ſides of the Glaſs being expoſed to the preſſure of the Atmoſphere, had that whole preſſure againſt them before the exhauſtion of the Receiver; ſo that there needed no ſuch blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Air afreſh as our Author imagines, to effect the breaking of the Vial, it being ſufficient for that purpoſe, that the preſſure againſt the convex <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of it was taken off by the exhauſtion of the Receiver, the preſſure againſt the concave <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> remaining as great as ever. And therefore we need not altogether deny what the Examiner ſayes, that <hi>Licet clauſus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perne fuiſſet tubulus ille, codem tamen modo fracta ſine dubio, fuiſſet
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57681:46"/>
phiala.</hi> For, ſince in ſuch caſes the Air (as we have often taught) is ſhut up with the whole preſſure of the Atmoſphere upon it, it may almoſt as eaſily break the Glaſs as if it were unſtopt. And accordingly we mention in the 36. Experiment the breaking of a thin Glaſs Hermetically ſeal'd upon the receſs of the ambient Air. But, how confidently ſoever our Author ſpeaks, I thought fit to adde the word <hi>almoſt,</hi> becauſe we obſerved in the 39. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, that ſuch thin Vials (and thick ones will not break) are ſubject upon the withdrawing of the ambient Air to retch a little, whereby the Spring of the Air within the Vial might in ſome caſes (I ſay, in ſome) be ſo far weakned as not to be able to break it, unleſs aſſiſted by the preſſure of the Atmoſphere wherewith it communicates, and which leans upon it. And when the Vial does actually begin to break, then the purſuing preſſure of the outward Air upon the yielding Air within the Vial may help to throw the parts of the Glaſs more forcibly aſunder.</p>
                  <p>All the Experiments from the 9. to the 17. excluſively our Examiner leaving uncenſured, we may with him, advance to the conſideration of the 17.</p>

                  <p>In this we relate how, when we made the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhut up the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> together with the Tube and the ſuſpended Mercurial Cylinder (of about 29.

But againſt our Explication of this Experiment (which has had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to convince and ſatisfie many ingenious men) the Examiner objects nothing in particular, contenting himſelf to have recourſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57681:46"/>
here alſo to his <hi>Funiculus.</hi> Yet two obſervations of ours he is pleaſed to take notice of.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that though the Quickſilver were exactly ſhut up into our Receiver after the manner newly declared, yet the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended Quickſilver did not deſcend: whence having ſaid that I argue, that it is now ſuſtained not by the Counterpoiſe of the Atmoſphere, but by the Spring of the Air ſhut up in the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he ſubjoyns onely this, <hi>Sed rectius ſane infertur, Cylindrum illum nihil ibidem antea praeſtitiſſe.</hi> But whether this be not <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dictum</hi> we leave the Reader to collect from what we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſcourſt in the ſecond Part of this Defence of the Spring of the Air; eſpecially from that Experiment; by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That Spring may ſuſtain a far higher Cylinder of Quick-ſilver.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Obſervation he mentions of ours, he ſummarily recites our Explication of the deſcent and aſcent of the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Tube, by the debilitated and ſtrengthned Spring of the Air.

Inches, is now enabled to draw it up higher; I demand upon what account this new Air does thus preſs againſt the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> and impell up and ſuſtain that in the Tube. It will not be ſaid that 'tis by its weight; for as much <hi>Mercury</hi> as may be thus impell'd up above the uſual ſtation will weigh a great many times more then the Air forc'd into the Receiver. And therefore it remains that the additional Air counterpoiſes the additional <hi>Mercury</hi> by its Spring. And if we conſider withall, that there's no reaſon to doubt, (eſpecially conſidering what we have formerly delivered upon tryal touching the power of compreſt Air to impell up Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) but that, had we not been afraid of breaking our Veſſel, we might by forcing more Air into the Receiver have impell'd it up to the top of the Tube, and kept it there; we ſhall ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that, ſuppoſing there could be no ſuch <hi>Funiculus</hi> as our Examiner's <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> the preſſure of the incumbent Air
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57681:47"/>
alone might ſuffice to keep a correſpondent Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> ſuſpended: and that without any attraction of the reſtagnant <hi>Mercury</hi> by a <hi>Funiculus</hi> of violently diſtended Air in the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Quickſilver in the Tube may be made to reſt at any height greater or leſſer, provided it exceed 30.

                  <p>I know not whether I may not adde (to expreſs an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to omit what ſome may think proper to do my Adverſary right) that it may be ſaid for the Examiner, that he in the 11. page acknowledging with us a power in the Air to recover its due extenſion if it be crouded into leſs room then its diſpoſition requires; a man may from that principle ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in queſtion by ſaying, that the Air in the Receiver being forcibly compreſt by the intruſion of freſh Air into the ſame veſſel, does by its endeavour to recover its due expanſion preſs upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> and force up ſome of it into the Tube. But this Explication, though it agree with what the Author teaches in a place very diſtant from his Notes upon our 17. Experiment, now under debate; yet ſtill 'tis not clear to me how, by what he ſayes in theſe Notes, the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is accounted for as the word <hi>Hinc</hi> imports it to be. But otherwiſe I need not quarrel with the Explication, ſince without recurring to the <hi>Funiculus</hi> for the ſuſtaining of the additional <hi>Mercury,</hi> the ſolution of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is given upon the ſame principle that I employ.</p>

                  <p>Our Examiner in his Animadverſion upon the 18. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having recited my Conjecture at the cauſe why a Cylinder of <hi>Mercury</hi> did in Winter riſe and fall in the Tube, ſometimes as Water is wont to do in a Weather-glaſs, according to the laws of heat and cold, and ſometimes quite contrary thereunto; adds, that this Experiment does ſtrongly enough overthrow our <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> of the Atmoſpherical Cylinder, and clearly ſhew that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57681:48"/>
Quickſilver is not ſuſtained by it: <hi>Nam</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſi hic ab eo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentatum fuiſſet, debuiſſet potius frigidiore tempore aſcendere quam deſcendere, eo quod aër tunc multo denſior eſſet &amp; gravior. Ita<expan>

But in his Animadverſions upon this Experiment he ſeems to have been too forward to reprehend; for he neither well confutes my Conjecture, nor ſubſtitutes ſo much as a plauſible one in the ſtead of it. And as to his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it doth not conclude: becauſe that as ſometimes the Quickſilver in the Tube did riſe in warmer, and fall in colder, weather; ſo at other times it did rather emulate the aſcent and deſcent of water in a Weather-glaſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though it be true, that Cold is wont to condenſe this or that parcel of Air, and that a parcel of Air may be made heavier by Condenſation; yet that is in regard of the ambient Air that retains its wonted laxity, in which the condenſed Air is weighed. But our Author has not yet proved, that in caſe the cold of the Winter ſhould condenſe the whole incumbent Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, it would then gravitate ſenſibly more upon the reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Quickſilver then before. As a Pound of Wooll will not ſenſibly vary its weight, though the hairs whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed be made to lye ſometimes in a looſer, ſometimes in a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, order.</p>
                  <p>And, thirdly, this Objection does as little agree with his Doctrine as with my Conjecture: For in the 50. page, where he gives us an account according to his principles of the riſing and falling of water in a Weather-glaſs, and compares it with the ſuſpenſion of Quickſilver, he tells us, <hi>Hinc fit quod, contracto hoc funiculo per frigus, aqua illa tempore frigido aſcendat, deſcendat au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tempore calido, eo quod per calorem funiculus ille dilatetur.</hi> So that, according to the Examiner himſelf, the Quickſilver ought to have aſcended in colder, and deſcended in warmer, weather. Now, although I propoſed my thoughts of the difficult <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:57681:48"/>
under conſideration but as a Conjecture, and therefore ſhall be ready to alter them, either upon further diſcovery, or better information; yet I ſee not why it ſhould be poſt-poſed to the Examiner's, who, though he rejects our Explication, ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes no other then what may be gathered from theſe words, <hi>Ego certe non dubito quin dentur hujuſmodi occultae cauſae, quibus funiculus ille ſubtilis, quo in tubo ſuſpenditur argentum (ut dictum eſt capite decimo) modo producatur, modo abbrevietur, &amp;c. ſic<expan>

                  <head>The 31. Experiment.</head>
                  <p>Upon this our Author having recited our Conjecture at the cauſe why two very flat and ſmooth Marbles ſtick ſo cloſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that by lifting up the uppermoſt you may take up alſo the lowermoſt, approves my way of examining that Conjecture. But whereas I ſay that the reaſon why, though the Marbles were kept together by the preſſure of the ambient Air, yet they did not fall aſunder in our exhauſted Receiver, no not though a weight of 4. Ounces were hung at the lower ſtone, might be, that by reaſon of ſome ſmall leak in the Receiver the Air could not be ſufficiently drawn out: yet he tells us with his wonted confidence, <hi>Certum eſſe, ſententiam illam vel hoc ſolo Experimento ſatis refelli.</hi> But poſſibly he would have ſpoken leſs reſolutely, if he had made all the tryals about the adheſion of Marbles that we relate our ſelves to have made in the ſhort Hiſtory we have publiſh'd of <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity and Firmneſs.</hi> For our Examiner ſpeaks as if all that we aſcribe to the Air in ſuch Experiments were to ſuſtain the lower Marble with the weight perhaps of a few Ounces: Whereas in caſe the Air be kept from getting in at all between the ſtones, it may (according to our <hi>Hypotheſis)</hi> ſuſtain a Weight either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or well-nigh equal to that of a pillar of Air as broad as the Baſis of the lower Marble, and as long as the Atmoſphere is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57681:50"/>
high, or to the weight of a pillar of Quickſilver of the ſame thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and about 30. Inches long; theſe two pillars appearing by the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment to counterpoiſe each other. And therefore ſince in the ſeventeenth Experiment, when we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted our Receiver as far as we could, there remain'd Air enough to keep up in the Tube a Cylinder of about an Inch long of Quickſilver; and ſince the broader the contiguous Marbles are, the greater weight faſtned to the lowermoſt may be ſuſtain'd by the reſiſtance of the Air, (as is obvious to him that conſiders the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and as we have proved by Experiment in the forementioned Tract) it need be no wonder that the Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Receiver ſhould be able to ſupport the lowermoſt Marble, whoſe Diameter was near two Inches, and a weight of four Ounces, thoſe two Weights being inferior to that of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Cylinder of that Diameter and an Inch in length. And though it were not, yet we are not ſure that the Receiver was as well emptied when we made the 31. Experiment, as when we made the 17. And (if my Memory does not much miſ-informe me) 'twas with the ſame pair of Marbles that in the preſence of an illuſtrious Aſſembly of <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> (who were Spectators of the Experiment) the uppermoſt Marble drew up the lowermoſt, though that were clog'd with a weight of above 430. Ounces.</p>
                  <p>As for the account the Examiner ſubſtitutes of our <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> I know not whether many Readers will acquieſce in it: For, not to inſiſt upon the Objection which himſelf takes notice of, that according to him the diſtended Air in the Receiver ſhould draw aſunder the adhering Marbles; his Explication ſuppoſes that there cannot naturally be a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> whence he infers that, <hi>Neceſſe er at ut lapis ille non aliter deſcenderet, quàm relinquendo poſt ſe tenuem hujuſmodi ſubſtantiam, qualis ab argento vivo aut aquâ ſic deſcendentibus relinqui ſolet.</hi> But whereas he adds, that the cauſe of the obſtinate adheſion we meet with in our caſe is, that ſuch a ſubſtance is far more difficult to be ſeparated from Marble then from Quickſilver or any other kind of body; that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is precarious. And though I have tryed Experiments of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57681:51"/>
this nature with ſtones of ſeveral ſizes, perhaps an hundred times, yet I never could find that by their coheſion they would ſuſtain a weight greater then that of a Pillar of the Atmoſphere that preſt againſt the lowermoſt: Which is a conſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that much better agrees with our Explication then our Adverſaries. And whereas he further ſayes, <hi>Unde exiſtimo planè, ſi perfectè complanata fuerint duo marmora ſic conjuncta, it a ut nullus omnino aër inter utrum<expan>

                  <p>Of the appearance of Light or Whiteneſs, mentioned in this Experiment, the Examiner confeſſes that we have aſſigned a cauſe probable enough, by referring it to the vehement and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den commotion of the included Air. And indeed though I do ſtill look upon ſome of the things that I heſitantly propos'd about this difficult <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> but as meer Conjectures, and though he annexes his Explication of it; yet I ſee not but that it is coincident with ours, or not better then it. For, to what I had ſaid of the Commotion of the parts of the Air, he adds onely
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57681:52"/>
in two or three ſeveral places their being violently diſtended; which how it improves the Explication of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> I do not readily ſee. And whereas he ſubjoyns, <hi>Exiſtimo autem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum potius candorem illum eſſe lumen quoddam reflexum, quam innatum, eo quod (ut teſtatur Author) in tenebris non appareat, ſed ſolum de die aut accenſa candela:</hi> I preſume the attentive Reader will eaſily diſcern that his Opinion is much-what the ſame that I propos'd and grounded on the ſame reaſon. But the chief diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in this abſtruſe <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> namely why we meet with it but ſometimes, our Examiner's Explication leaves untouch'd.</p>

                  <p>But in his Animadverſions upon theſe, having told the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I ſeem to aſcribe the ſudden extinction of the included Animals to the exceſſive thinneſs of the Air remaining in the Receiver, made by the receſs of what was drawn out, unfit for Reſpiration; he adds reſolutely enough, <hi>Verum impoſsibile vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut hujuſmodi animalcula ob ſolum defectum craſsioris aëris tam cito moriantur:</hi> but gives no other reaſon then that they dye ſo ſoon, which is no more then what he ſaid in the newly-cited words, and beſides is grounded upon ſomething of miſtake. For the Creatures he mentions were a Bee, a Flye, and a Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and thoſe included too in a ſmall Receiver, which could be ſuddenly exhauſted: and theſe indeed became moveleſs within a Minute of an Hour; but that Minute was not (as the word is often us'd to ſignifie in <hi>Engliſh)</hi> a Moment, but the Sixtieth part of an Hour. And though theſe Inſects did in ſo ſhort a time grow moveleſs, yet they were not ſo ſoon kill'd; as appears by the Narrative. The ſanguineous Animals that did <hi>indeed</hi> dye, were kill'd more ſlowly. And I remember that having purpoſely
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57681:52"/>
enquir'd of a man (us'd to go under water by the help of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine wherein he could carry Air with him to the bottom of the Sea) how long he could endure, before he was accuſtomed to dive, without breathing or the uſe <note place="margin">See more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it as 'tis propos'd by Mr. <hi>Hobbes.</hi>
                     </note> of a Spunge; he told me, that at firſt he could hold out about two or three Minutes at a time: Which made me think that Divers become able to continue under water ſo long, either by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly-convenient Conſtitution of body, or by a gradual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. And I am apt to think that he did, as men are wont to do, when he ſaid two or three Minutes, mean what is indeed a much ſhorter time then that when exactly meaſured amounts to. For, having purpoſely made tryal upon a couple of Moles that were brought me together alive, one of them included in a ſmall, though not very ſmall, Receiver was between two and three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes in killing; whereas the other being immediately after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd under water did not there continue full a Minute and a quarter, before it finally ceas'd from giving any ſign at all of life. By which tryal it may appear, that 'tis not impoſſible that the want of Reſpiration ſhould diſpatch an Animal in as little time as is mentioned in the Experiment I am now defending. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our Author either ſhould have proved that 'tis not poſſible for the want of Air to deſtroy Animals ſo ſoon, or ſhould have given us ſome better account of the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> For whereas he teaches us, that according to his Doctrine the little Animals above-mentioned were ſo ſoon kill'd, <hi>qui a per rarefactum illum aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ſeſe contrahentem extractus ſit eorum halitus:</hi> I ſee not that hereby, if he explicate the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> otherwiſe then we, he explains it better; for he ſeems to ſpeak as if he thought this <hi>halitus</hi> to be ſome peculiar part of the Animal in which his life reſides. And beſides he ſeems not to conſider, that whereas, according to me as well as according to him, the Air contained in the Lungs (ſuppoſing theſe <hi>Animalcula</hi> have any) muſt in great part paſs thence into the Receiver, (for whether that be done by the Spring of the Air it ſelf, that was harboured in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57681:53"/>

And thus have we by Gods aſſiſtance conſidered what the Exam ner hath been pleaſed to oppoſe either againſt our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Explications, or againſt the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that divers of them ſuppoſe: Wherein I have been the more particular and prolix, becauſe I would willingly excuſe my ſelf and others from the trouble of any more Diſputes of this kind. I hope there is not in my Anſwers any thing of Aſperity to be met with; for I have no quarrel to the Perſon of the Author, or his juſt reputation; nor did I intend to uſe any more freedom of Speech in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his Objections, then his reſolute way of propoſing divers of them made it on thoſe occaſions needful for the Caution of thoſe Readers who are not acquainted with our differing wayes of writing, and perhaps have not obſerved that ſome men are wont to conſider as much what they propoſe but with a <hi>Perhaps,</hi> or ſome ſuch expreſſion of diffidence, as others do what they deliver far more reſolutely. And though being very far from being wedded to my Opinions, I am ſtill ready to exchange them for better, if they ſhall be duly made out to me, (which I think it poſſible enough they may hereafter be;) yet peradventure the Reader will think with me, that the Examiner has not given me cauſe to renounce any of them, ſince the Objections he has propos'd againſt me have been ſufficiently anſwered, and ſince the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> he would ſubſtitute in the room of ours (beſides that it is partly precarious) ſuppoſes things which divers of the eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wits of our Age (otherwiſe of differing Opinions) profeſs they cannot admit or ſo much as underſtand: whereas the Weight and Spring of the Air are not denyed by our Author himſelf, and are demonſtrable by Experiments that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted betwixt us.

Now the former of theſe being little elſe but a bare Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the later bearing ſome ſhew of Demonſtration, I ſhall endeavour to examine it as I find it ſet down in his 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. Chapters, to which (eſpecially the 23.) he very often in his Book refers the Reader for ſatisfaction, pretending there to evince that Rarefaction cannot be made out any otherwiſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57681:55"/>
then by ſuppoſing a body to be in 2, 3, 4, 10, 100, 1000, 1000000 of places at the ſame inſtant, and adequately to fill all and every one of thoſe places.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, we will examine his Negative, and next his Affirmative, Arguments for this ſtrange <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Negative I find in the 20. Chapter, where he endeavours to confute the two wayes of explicating the Rarefaction and Spring of the Air, namely, that of the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> and that of the <hi>Pleniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe we find him conclude it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, firſt, becauſe he had before proved that there can be no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which being done by a Circle <hi>(viz.</hi> There is no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Tube becauſe Nature abhors a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and we ſee Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors a <hi>Vacuum</hi> becauſe ſhe will not ſuffer a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Tube above the <hi>Mercury,</hi> but to prevent it will continually ſpin the Quickſilver into <hi>ſupe ficies,</hi> and never diminiſh the body of it) will ſuffer me to paſs to his next, which is, That this way is falſe, becauſe in the Experiment of the Carps Bladder the Air is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd a 1000. times bigger; nay, in reſpect of the body of Gold it has 1000000. times leſs matter in equal ſpaces. And this, ſayes he, is a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> that is impoſſible ever to be made out by interſpers'd Vacuities. Now that the Vacuiſts cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, by ſo bold an aſſertion as this, be made to forſake their Principles, he may perceive by theſe following Solutions which I ſhall give of all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> he recites, flowing naturally from an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that I ſhall for the preſent aſſume. Let us ſuppoſe then the Particles of Bodies, at leaſt thoſe of the Air, to be of the form of a piece of Riband, that is, to be very long, ſlender, thin and flexible <hi>laminae,</hi> coyled or wound up together as a Cable, piece of Riband, Spring of a Watch, Hoop, or the like, are: we will ſuppoſe theſe to have all of them the ſame length, but ſome to have a ſtronger, others a weaker Spring: we will further ſuppoſe each of theſe ſo coyled up to have ſuch an innate circular motion, as that thereby they may deſcribe a Sphere equal in Diameter to their own, much after the manner that a Meridian turn'd about the Poles of a Globe will deſcribe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57681:55"/>
by its revolution a Sphere of the ſame Diameter with its own in the Air. By this Circular motion the parts of the <hi>laminae</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to recede from the Centre or Axis of their motion, acquire a Springineſs outward like that of a Watch-Spring, and would naturally flye abroad untill they were ſtretch'd out at length, but that being incompaſt with the like on every ſide, they cannot do it without the removal of them, as not having room ſufficient for ſuch a motion. And the faſter this circular motion is, the more do the parts endeavour to recede from the Axis, and conſequently the ſtronger is their Spring or endeavour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Theſe ſpringy bodies thus ſhap'd and thus moved are ſufficient to produce all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> he names as impoſſible to be explicated. And, firſt, for the buſineſs of Expanſion, it will very naturally be explained by it: As let us ſuppoſe for inſtance the Diameter of theſe ſmall coyled Particles of the Air (which being next the Earth are preſs'd upon by all thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous incumbent Particles that make up the Atmoſphere, and are thereby ſo crouded that they can but very little untwiſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; let us ſuppoſe, I ſay, the Diameter of theſe Particles) to be 1/1000000000000 of an Inch; and then to be much of the form of thoſe repreſented in the 4. Figure by <hi>A B C D:</hi> and that theſe Particles, when a conſiderable quantity of the preſſure of the ambient parts is taken away, will flye abroad into a Coyle or Zone ten times as big in Diameter as before; that is, they will now be 10/1000000000000 of an Inch in Diameter, and appear in the form of thoſe in the Figure expreſt by <hi>E F G H:</hi> theſe Zones whirl'd round as the former will deſcribe a Sphere a 1000. times as big in bulk, and thereby fence that ſpace from being entred by any of the like Zones: this it would do, ſuppoſing thoſe Spheres did immediately alwayes touch each other; but becauſe of their circular motion, whenever they meet they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be beaten, and flye off from one another, and ſo require a yet greater ſpace to perform their motion in. This ſuppos'd, there are no <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction (which is enough at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to anſwer what he objects) but may be naturally and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57681:56"/>
made out. As firſt, for that of the ſwelling of a Carps Bladder, if we ſuppoſe ſome ſmall parcels of the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt <hi>laminae</hi> to lye latitant within the folds of it, and being much coyled up together ſcarce to take any ſenſible room, this Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Air will appear to contain very little or nothing within it; whereas when the preſſure of the Air is taken off in good part from the outſides of it, then thoſe formerly latitant Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles diſcloſe themſelves by flying open into much bigger Zones, ſo as perhaps to be able to defend a thouſand times bigger ſpace from being entred into by their like or any other groſs Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſuch as thoſe of the Bladder. Now becauſe the Pores of a Bladder are ſuch as are not eaſily permeable by the Particles of Air, therefore theſe lurking Particles ſo expanding themſelves muſt neceſſarily plump out the ſides of the Bladder, and ſo keep them turgid untill the preſſure of the Air that at firſt coyled them be re-admitted to do the ſame thing for them again.</p>
               <p>Next, as for Rarefaction by heat, that will as naturally follow as the former from this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For the Atoms of fire flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in in great numbers, and paſſing through with a very rapid motion, muſt needs accelerate the motion of theſe Particles, from which acceleration their Spring or endeavour outward will be augmented, that is, thoſe Zones will have a ſtrong nitency to flye wider open, (for we know that the ſwifter any body is moved circularly, the more do the parts of it endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the Centre of that motion) from whence if it has room will follow a Rarefaction. As for the conveyance of Light, that being according to <hi>Epicurus</hi> performed by the local motion of peculiar Atoms, their motions to and fro through this <hi>medium</hi> will be leſs impeded by the rarefi'd Air then by the condens'd; as indeed upon Experiment we ſhall really find them.</p>
               <p>As for his third Objection drawn from his ſuppoſed attractive virtue of the thus rarefi'd Air, that is quickly anſwered, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it to have any power at all of attraction; and by ſhewing (which is already done) that what effects he would have to be performed by the attraction of the included, is really done by the preſſure of the ambient, Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57681:56"/>
And, laſtly, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of my Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Experiment are ſufficiently obvious and eaſie to be deduc'd.</p>
               <p>So then, by granting <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Principles, that the Atoms or Particles of bodies have an innate motion; and granting our Suppoſition of the determinate motion and figure of the Aerial Particles, all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Rarefaction and Condenſation, of Light, Sound, Heat, &amp;c. will naturally and neceſſarily follow: and the Authors Objections againſt this firſt way of Rarefaction will ſignifie very little.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond way of Rarefaction, by the intruſion or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſome ſubtil matter of <hi>Aether</hi> into the ſpaces deſerted by the rareſying Particles, which is that propos'd by the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of a <hi>Plenum,</hi> this alſo is by the Author condemned, and branded with Impoſſibility. And why? Firſt, becauſe 'tis (he ſayes) impoſſible that the above-mentioned <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Carps Bladder can be explained by it. Secondly, becauſe 'tis impoſſible to give a reaſon from it of the impetuous aſcent of Water admitted into an exhauſted Receiver. And, Thirdly, becauſe 'tis impoſſible to explicate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. His Reaſons to confirm which three Impoſſibilities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe drawn from a meer miſtake, or ignorance of thoſe <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes</hi> which have been invented by the Aſſertors of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall paſs over, and content my ſelf to explain a way how theſe Impoſſibilities may become Poſſibilities, if not Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p>And the way that I ſhall take, ſhall be that of the moſt acute Modern Philoſopher <hi>Monſieur Des Cartes,</hi> publiſhed in his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Works: Which is this, That the Air is a Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of long, ſlender, flexible particles, agitated or whirl'd round by the rapid motion of the <hi>Globuli Coeleſtes,</hi> and the ſubtile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his firſt Element, whereby they are each of them enabled to drive or force out of their Vortice all ſuch other agitated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Now the ſwifter theſe Bodies are whirl'd round, the more do their flexible parts fly aſunder and ſtretch themſelves out; and the more forcibly do they reſiſt the ingreſſe of any other ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57681:57"/>
agitated particles into their Vortice, and conſequently the ſlower their motion is, the leſs will be their reſiſtance. And becauſe there is a vaſt number of theſe whirled particles lying one above another, and each particle having its peculiar gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it will neceſſarily follow that the undermoſt (which to maintain their Vortice muſt reſiſt ſo great a preſſure) muſt very much be hindred from expanding themſelves ſo far as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would, were there none of thoſe incompaſſing agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Particles that lay in their way: and that thoſe being by any means removed, or they themſelves by a more rapid motion of the Particles of their Vehicles, the firſt and ſecond Element, (which is according to that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> an effect of Heat) more ſwiftly and ſtrongly whirled round, they preſently begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand themſelves, and maintain a bigger Vortice then before. Now to perform what I juſt now promiſed, I ſhall endeavour to give a poſſible, if not a probable, cauſe of the objected <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</hi> And, Firſt, for that of the Carps Bladder, where the Air is rarefi'd (ſayes the Author) 1000. times, it will eaſily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by ſuppoſing the few Particles of the Air, which (whileſt they ſuſtain the preſſure of all the incumbent Atmoſphere) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſpicuouſly luck within the Bladder, (each of them being able to maintain but a very ſmall Vortice) to be by the ſubſiding <hi>Mercury</hi> in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment freed from the preſſure of the Air, and their motion continuing the ſame (by reaſon that the Tranſcurſion of their Vehicles is not at all or very little hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either by the Glaſs or Bladder) their parts having room to expand themſelves, will flye abroad to ſuch Extenſions as may perhaps make a Vortice 1000. times as big in bulk as what they were not able juſt before to exceed. Hence the Particles of the Air (being ſo groſs as not eaſily to pervade the Pores of the Bladder) muſt neceſſarily drive out the fides of the Bladder to its utmoſt extent, and ſerve to fill the Receiver in the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgick</hi> Experiment. Now, whereas theſe Particles will by the ſame preſſure of the Air be reduc'd to the ſame ſtate they were in at firſt, that is, to be thronged into a very little room, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57681:57"/>
thereby be able to maintain a very ſmall Vortice; the Air let in in the <hi>Torrecellian</hi> Experiment reduces the Air in the Bladder to its former inconſpicuouſneſs; as the admiſſion of the Water in the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Experiment does that Receiver full of rarefi'd Air into the bigneſs of a Hazel Nut. Now the Water in this laſt-mention'd Experiment enters with a great impetuoſity, becauſe driven on with the whole preſſure of the Atmoſphere, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted onely by the ſmall force of the ſo-far-rarefi'd Air.</p>
               <p>As for the Authors Objection againſt this way of Rarefaction drawn from the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Gun powder, I ſhall endeavour to anſwer it by ſhewing them poſſibly explicable by a <hi>Carteſian Hypotheſis.</hi> For ſuppoſing thoſe Terreſtrial parts of the Gun pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be firſt at reſt, and afterwards agitated by the rapid moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his firſt Element, there will be ſufficient difference of the former and later condition in reſpect of Extenſion; and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the particular conſtitution of Gun-powder (ariſing partly from the Specifick forms of the Particles of its ingredients; Nitre, Sulphure and Char-coal, and partly from their proportionate commiſtion) to be ſuch as will readily yield to the motion of his <hi>Materia ſubtilis,</hi> ſo ſoon as an ingreſs is admitted to it by the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any particular parcel of it, the Expanſion will be ſpeedy enough.</p>
               <p>So then let us ſuppoſe a Barrel of Gun-powder placed in ſome cloſe room, to ſome grains of which we will ſuppoſe ſome actual fire to be applied, by which actual fire (the Texture of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being ſuch) thoſe grains are ſuddenly fired, that is, many Millions of parts, which before lay ſtill and at reſt, are by the action of the burning Coals ſhatter'd, as it were, and put into a poſture ready to be agitated by the rapid motion of the <hi>Materia ſubtilis:</hi> into which poſture they are no ſooner put, then agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and whirled ſufficiently by it; whence follows a vaſt Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that part of Gun-powder ſo fired. For each of its parts being thus whirl'd and hurried round, expell and beat off with great violence all the contiguous Particles, ſo as that each Particle takes up now 1000. times as much Elbow-room (if I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57681:58"/>
may ſo ſpeak) as juſt before ſerv'd its turn, and conſequently thoſe that are outermoſt take every one their way directly from the parcel or Corn they had lain quiet in, being hurried away by the ſudden Expanſion of the Particles that lay next within them; ſo that whatever grain or parcel of Gun-powder they chance to meet with, before they have loſt their motion, they preſently ſhiver and put into ſuch a motion as makes them fit to receive the action of the <hi>Materia ſubtilis.</hi> Which ſubtil Matter being every where preſent, and nothing ſlow in performing its office, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately agitates thoſe alſo like the former; ſo that in a trice the Particles of the whole Barrel of Gun-powder are thus diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by the motion the <hi>Materia ſubtilis</hi> muſt needs be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with ſo great an impetuoſity on all ſides, as not onely to break in pieces its ſlight wooden priſon, and remove the lighter Particles of the ambient Air, but huge Beams, nay, vaſt accumulated Maſſes of the moſt compacted Structures of Stone, and even ſhake the very Earth it ſelf, or whatever elſe ſtands in its way, whoſe Texture is ſo cloſe as not to give its Particles free paſſage through its Pores. This underſtood, I ſee not, firſt, what the Authors three Arguments brought to prove his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſignifie, for there are no more Corpuſcles in the room before the Gun-powder is fired then after, nor is there any more matter or ſubſtance before the ſides of the room by yielding give place for the external fluid bodies to ſucceed, and the onely change is this, that the <hi>Globuli ſecundi Elementi</hi> (as he calls them) are expell'd out of the room, and the <hi>Materia primi Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti</hi> ſucceeds in the place of it. Nor do I ſee, ſecondly, what great reaſon he had for his grand Concluſion, <hi>Haec abundè demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant, rarefactionem per hujuſmodi corpuſcula nullatenus poſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus examined the Authors firſt Arguments, that Rarefaction cannot be made out by any other way then his; we ſhall find his other, which he brings to eſtabliſh his own <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> much of the ſame kind. As, Firſt, that his way of Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implies no Contradiction: For if the affirming a body to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57681:58"/>
really and totally in this place, and at the ſame time to be really and wholly in another, that is, to be in this place, and not to be in this place, be not a Contradiction, I know not what is. Next, that ſome learned School-men have thought ſo; to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, more learned men have thought otherwiſe. And, laſtly, that there are very plain Examples of the like nature to be found in other things; of which he onely brings one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Rota Ariſtotelica,</hi> which upon examination we ſhall find to make as little to the purpoſe as any of the other.</p>

And Firſt, he ſuppoſes Time to conſiſt of a determinate number of Indiviſibles, (that is, ſuch as have neither <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>poſterius</hi> included in them) which he calls Inſtants.

But as for his Virtual Extenſion, I conſeſs I underſtand as little what it is as I verily believe he did; and therefore I will proceed to his following ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. His Third therefore is, That by how much more <hi>rare</hi> a body is, by ſo much the more are its Indiviſibles virtually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Hence his Fourth is, That though theſe Indiviſibles be really indiviſible, yet they are virtually <hi>in quotvis partes diviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> Whence he deduces his Fifth Principle, That ſince theſe Indiviſibles are really indiviſible and virtually extended, they muſt neceſſarily be moved after the ſame manner that other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and virtually-extended things are. His Inſtances are in the motions of an Angel and an indiviſible piece of wood, which, he ſayes, are both of the ſame kind. As for that of Angels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no immediate Revelation, and a Spirit and its actions not falling under ſenſe, and not having any third way by which to be inform'd, I ſhall leave him there to enjoy his fancies. But as for that of his piece of wood, we ſhall find it ſufficiently full of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities and contradictions. And firſt, he calls it indiviſible, but why I know not, for 'tis neither really nor yet mentally ſo: not mentally ſo by his fourth Principle, where he ſayes that 'tis
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57681:59"/>
                  <hi>virtualiter in quotvis partes diviſibiles,</hi> by which word <hi>virtualiter</hi> he means the ſame thing with <hi>mentaliter,</hi> or nothing. Nor, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, is it really ſo: for then (according to the main buſineſs of his Book, as may be gathered from the firſt words of his Title-Page, <hi>Tractatus de Corporum Inſeparabilitate)</hi> it would be impoſſible that any thing in the world ſhould be diviſible; for he making an inſeparable continuity, and that bodies will rather be (I can't tell how) ſtretcht beyond their own dimenſion <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi> then part from one another; a body may as ſoon paſs through the dimenſions of any one Indiviſible, as paſs between two. Next, he grants in the ſtrange ſtretching or rarefaction of theſe Indiviſibles a temporary motion of the condens'd Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; whence there will follow that there muſt be diſtinct places or <hi>Ubi</hi>'s, it muſt be <hi>terminus à quo, terminus ad quem, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> And next, it were impoſſible to divide a line into two parts, ſuppoſing it conſiſted of an unequal number of Indiviſibles; as if 101. Indiviſibles of exceedingly-rarefi'd Air ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in length an Inch, it were impoſſible to divide that Inch into two equal parts. I might run over many more, but it would be too tedious to be here recited. As for his indiviſible parts of Time, thoſe alſo muſt neceſſarily be <hi>in quotvis partes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibiles;</hi> for elſe the ſame body or Indiviſible muſt neceſſarily be in divers places at the ſame inſtant. But becauſe he can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nay confidently affirm, this and many other ſuch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and abſurdities, I am not willing to mention them; and I think it would have made more for the Authors reputation if he had done ſo too. As for his laſt Chapter, where he applies theſe Principles to the Explication of the <hi>Rota Ariſtotelica,</hi> I have not here time to ſet down all the abſurdities that any one that has but a ſmattering in the Mathematicks may obſerve: as, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times half an indiviſible part of a Circumference may touch an indiviſible of a Line; ſometimes one may touch half, a quarter, a hundredth part, a whole one, two, ten, a hundred, &amp;c. at the ſame inſtant; nay, an indiviſible of a Circle may be all of it in a thouſand places together, and the like. And this he brings as a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57681:60"/>
great Argument to eſtabliſh his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of Rarefaction, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it to compriſe many <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s and very great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whereas the thing is very plain and eaſie, and contains no ſuch obſcurities. For if, for example, we ſuppoſe a Wheel <hi>ABCD</hi> to be moved in a direct motion from <hi>AIC</hi> to <hi>KLM,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of it retaining the ſame poſition to that line that they had at the beginning of their motion, each of the points <hi>AEIGC</hi> will on a Plain, or in the <hi>Medium</hi> it pervades, paſs through or deſcribe a line equal to the line <hi>IL,</hi> and not onely all the points lying in the line <hi>AIC,</hi> but all and every point of the whole <hi>Area</hi> of the Circle; this muſt neceſſarily happen if the Diameter <hi>AIC</hi> be moved parallel to it ſelf: But if whileſt it be thus moved with an equal progreſſion, it be likewiſe moved with an equal circulation, the caſe will be altered. For then, firſt, each point will by this compound motion deſcribe on the Plain or <hi>Medium</hi> either a perfect Cyclorid, as when the Wheel makes one perfect revolution, whileſt the whole is progreſſively moved from <hi>I</hi> to <hi>L;</hi> or ſome Piece, as when the Wheel has not perfected its revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or more then a whole one, as when the Circle has made more then one whole revolution whileſt it is moved in its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate length. I ſhall here onely conſider the firſt, as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more eſpecially to my preſent purpoſe, and in regard the two later on occaſion may be eaſily explicated by it. Next, each point of this Circle acquires from its compounded motion vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees of Celerity as to its progreſſion, according to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious poſition to a point which is alwayes found in ſome part of the line drawn through the Centre of the circular motion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the progreſſive. And it is found thus, as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference to the <hi>Radius,</hi> ſo is the line of the progreſſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the diſtance of the point from the Centre. And this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens becauſe the line of Progreſſion is equal to the Circle deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on that diſtance as <hi>Radius;</hi> each point therefore of this ſmaller Circle, when it comes to touch the Perpendicular, muſt, as to its progreſſive motion, ſtand ſtill: This point therefore will be the Centre of this compounded motion. Now becauſe for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57681:60"/>
the explication of the <hi>Rota Ariſtotelica</hi> we need not conſider any other then thoſe Points which are tranſient through or croſs the Perpendicular line, we ſhall onely examine them. Let then in our Example <hi>A</hi> be the Centre or immoveable point, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference therefore <hi>ABCD</hi> will be equal to <hi>IL</hi> or <hi>AK</hi> by our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> Now becauſe the point <hi>I,</hi> which is the Centre of the Rotation, has onely one motion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Lation, its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity will be equal to the ſingle celerity of the Lation; we will therefore put it to have one degree. <hi>C,</hi> becauſe it is moved with two motions, both tending the ſame way, and each equal to the velocity of <hi>I,</hi> muſt needs have two degrees of velocity. The point <hi>F,</hi> becauſe moved with two motions, both tending the ſame way, the one <hi>(viz.</hi> its Lation) being equal to that of <hi>I,</hi> and the other (becauſe it is but half as far diſtant from the Centre of Rotation as <hi>C,</hi> and therefore is moved but with half the celerity of <hi>C,</hi> which was equal to that of <hi>I)</hi> but half as quick, we will put to have one degree and an half. By the like method we might find the velocity of all the points in the Perpendicular, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as we have there marked ſome of them; but it would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, we needing not to conſider more then the two points <hi>A</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> The point at <hi>E</hi> being moved forward by its progreſſion with the ſame velocity that <hi>I,</hi> but by its rotation (which is but half as ſwift as that of the Circle <hi>ABCD,</hi> that is double the Circle <hi>EFGH)</hi> being moved the contrary way or backwards with half the velocity, loſeth half of its progreſſion forwards. The point in <hi>A</hi> being by its progreſſion moved forwards equally ſwift with <hi>I,</hi> and by its rotation (the Circle <hi>ABCD</hi> being equal to the line <hi>IL)</hi> being carried backwards with equal velocity, muſt neceſſarily ſtand ſtill as to its progreſſion. Now having ſhewn that the point <hi>A</hi> (being by reaſon of its two equal oppoſite motions at reſt) does onely touch a point of the line <hi>AK,</hi> and is not at all moved on it; and that the point <hi>E</hi> (being carried forward twice as faſt by its progreſſion as it is carried backward by its rotation, and thereby moved half as faſt as the point <hi>I)</hi> does not onely touch the line <hi>EK,</hi> but whileſt it touches it is moved on it with a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57681:61"/>
progreſſive motion half as ſwift as that of <hi>I:</hi> It will neceſſarily follow, that each point ſituate in <hi>E</hi> muſt neceſſarily deſcribe a ſmall line, which is a part of the whole <hi>EC.</hi> Now both the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the former, and the contact and progreſſion of the later, being performed by an infinite ſucceſſion of points in the ſpace of an infinite ſucceſſion of Inſtants; I ſee not any one difficulty of this Problem but may ſatisfactorily be given an account of by it, without having recourſe to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the determinate number of indiviſibles of ſpace and time; which at beſt will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to this, that <hi>In ſuch a determinate moment or minute ſpace of time,</hi> (which conſiſts of an infinite conſecution of Inſtants, and has <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius</hi> in it; though yet he will call it an Inſtant, and have it to have the ſame proprieties with an Inſtant uſed in the common Philoſophical ſenſe) <hi>ſuch a determinate minute Corpuſcle</hi> (which, though it have extenſion in length, breadth and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet will he not admit it to be diviſible or have parts, no not though, according to his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the indiviſible of one body may be rarefied to be as big in bulk as a million of the indiviſibles of another, but will have it to be called and to be a real indiviſible) <hi>will ſucceſsively paſs over ſuch a determinate ſpace or length</hi> (which yet he will not admit to be diviſible, though according to his Principles it may equalize the length of millions of his other Indiviſibles, nor admit a ſucceſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but inſtantaneous, though that does neceſſarily put a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into two, three, ten, a hundred, &amp;c. places at once; but will have theſe alſo to be indiviſible.) Haſte makes me paſs over the abſurdities about the contact of a Circle and a Line, and to compriſe in ſhort all that great Explication he has given of this and other intricate (as he calls them) Problems, which is this, That the reaſon of the celerity of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome one of theſe indiviſibles above another is, that it paſſes through a greater part of an indiviſible in the ſame inſtant then the ſlower; that is in plain ſenſe no more then this, One body is ſwifter then another becauſe it is moved faſter, From whence he draws ſeveral Corollaries, as that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57681:61"/>
Hence may be given a reaſon why an Eagle is ſwifter then a Tortoiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it moves faſter. I ſhould have ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeveral Objections which may be brought againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility of Quantity <hi>in infinitum;</hi> but that as all the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick Writers are full of them, ſo it is a Subject which we are leaſt able to diſpute of, having very little information of the nature of Infinity from the Senſes.</p>

unto it. Whence again it is evidently concluded that the <hi>Mercury</hi> placed in its own ſtation is not there upheld by the external Air, but ſuſpended by a certain internal <hi>Cord,</hi> whoſe upper end being faſtned to the Finger draws and faſtens it after this manner into the Tube.</p>
            <p>Chap. 4. p. 8, 9. <hi>Sumatur, &amp;c.</hi> Take a Tube ſhorter then twenty nine Inches and an half, for inſtance of twenty Digits, not ſhut, as hitherto, at one end, but with both ends open: let this Tube, its Orifice being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in reſtagnant <hi>Mercury,</hi> and one Finger being plac'd underneath, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> to be poured in run not through, be filled with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> and then another Finger be applied to its Orifice, to cloſe it well: Which being done, if you draw away your lower Finger, the upper will be found to be ſtrongly drawn and ſuck'd into the Tube, and ſo ſtifly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it, (or rather to the Quickſilver, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew) that it will elevate the Tube it ſelf with all the Quickſilver, and make it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to hang pendulous in the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>From which Experiment this Opinion is moſt clearly refuted: For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to it the Quickſilver in ſuch a Tube but twenty Inches long muſt be thruſt upwards by the preponderating Air; it will never by it be explained how this Finger is ſo drawn downwards, and made ſo ſtrongly to ſtick to the Tube. For it cannot by the Air thruſting upwards be thus drawn downwards.</p>
            <p>p. 11. <hi>Quod vel, &amp;c.</hi> Which is thence confirmed, Becauſe if that preponderating Air ſucceeds, as is aſſerted, in the place of the lower Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which was withdrawn, that is, if it uphold the Quickſilver after the ſame manner which it was upheld by the lower Finger applied under it; it is manifeſt, according to this Opinion, that the Finger on the top ought not to be more drawn downwards after the lower Finger is removed then before. Seeing then that Experience teacheth the contrary, it is manifeſt that Opinion muſt be falſe.</p>
            <p>Chap. 5. p. 12. <hi>Quarto, &amp;c.</hi> In the fourth place it is impugn'd, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thence it would follow that Quickſilver through a like Tube might be ſuck'd with the ſame eaſineſs out of a Veſſel that Water is ſuck'd out of the ſame. Which not withſtanding is contrary to Experience, by which we are taught that Water is eaſily drawn into the mouth of him that ſucks, whereas Quickſilver cannot be drawn thither by his utmoſt endeavour, nay, ſcarce unto the middle of the Tube.</p>
            <p>The ſequel I thus manifeſt: Becauſe ſeeing, according to this Opinion, that the Liquor underneath, whether it be Water or <hi>Mercury,</hi> may ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, no more is requir'd but that the Air ſhut in the Tube may be drawn upwards by ſucking; which being drawn up, the Liquor underneath will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57681:63"/>
immediately aſcend, being thruſt thither by the external Air now prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating, (as <hi>Pecquet</hi> declares in his Anatomical Diſcourſe, <hi>p.</hi> 63.) It is manifeſt that the <hi>Mercury</hi> may be ſuck'd out with the ſame eaſineſs that Water is ſuck'd out with. Which being ſo evidently againſt Experience, the Opinion from whence it is deduced muſt needs be falſe.</p>

            <p>Part 2. Chap. 1. p. 20. <hi>Conſtat hoc, &amp;c.</hi> This appears from what has been already ſpoken in the preceding Chapter: For the Quickſilver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending cannot ſo draw the Finger downwards, and faſten it unto the Tube, unleſs it be hung upon the Finger by ſuch a Cord, which by its
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57681:64"/>
weight it vehemently ſtretches, as is manifeſt by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Reſpondeo, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, That this comes to paſs that there may be no Vacuity, ſeeing there is nothing elſe there that can ſucceed into the place of the deſcending Quickſilver.</p>
            <p>p. 21. And hence is confirm'd that common Axiom uſed in the Schools for ſo many Ages paſt, that <hi>Nature doth abhor a Vacuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Nam licet, &amp;c.</hi> For though the immediate cauſe why water (for inſtance) doth not deſcend from a Gardeners Watering-pot (for that Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they uſe) ſtopt on the top, is not the fear of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> but the reaſon now mentioned, namely, That there is not weight ſufficient to looſe that conjuncture by which the water doth adhere to the top of the cloſed Water-pot: Nevertheleſs in the end we muſt of neceſſity come to that Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Quae quidem, &amp;c.</hi> Which traction and adheſion when it cannot proceed but from ſome real body placed between the Finger and the <hi>Mercury,</hi> it is manifeſt that that ſpace is not empty, but filled with ſome true ſubſtance.</p>

p. 30. <hi>Cum per, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing by the firſt Note 'tis manifeſt that the Quickſilver doth ſo ſtick to the top of the Tube, and by the ſecond Note the Rarefaction is made onely by the meer diſtenſion of the body; it ſo comes to paſs that the deſcending Quickſilver leaves its external or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>ſuperficies</hi> fixed unto the top of the Tube, and by its weight doth ſo ſtretch and extenuate it, untill it becomes eaſier to leave another <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies</hi> in like manner, then to extend that any further. It leaves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſecond, and doth by its deſcent extend that a little further, untill it becomes eaſier to ſeparate a third then to extend that any further: And ſo forwards, untill at length it hath no power to ſeparate or extend any more <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> namely, untill it comes unto the heighth of 29. Inches and an half; where it acquieſces, as we have declared in the firſt Chapter.</p>

Theſe Surfaces ſeem to be ſeparated from the Quickſilver, and to be extended into a moſt ſlender ſtring by the weight that falls down, after the ſame manner that in a lighted Candle ſurfaces of like ſort are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Wax or Tallow underneath by the heat above, and are extenuated into a moſt ſubtil flame. In which it is worth obſervation, that as that flame doth doubtleſs take up more then a thouſand times a greater ſpace then the part of the Wax of which the flame was made took up: So is it here to be thought, that that ſtring doth take up a ſpace more then a thouſand times as big as that which the ſmall particle of <hi>Mercury,</hi> from whence it aroſe, did before take up. As alſo it doubtleſs happens when ſuch a particle by a fire underneath is turned into a vapour.</p>

p. 46. <hi>Reſpondeo, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that all theſe things happen becauſe the Gun-powder ſo kindled and turned into flame takes up a much greater ſpace then before.

                  </expan>, &amp;c.</hi> And even this Experiment doth very well agree with our Principles: For ſeeing by this depreſſion of the Sucker, the Air ſhut up in the cavity of the Cylinder is ſeparated from the Cylinder, and doth deſcend together with the Sucker, (as we have, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. obſerved of water deſcending together with Quickſilver) it comes to paſs that in that whole depreſſion new ſurfaces are taken from that deſcending Air, and ſtretched out, as we have there explained it in the caſe of deſcending water. Since therefore ſuch Sufaces are as eaſily ſlipt off and extended in the end of the depreſſion as in the beginning; it is no wonder that there is found the ſame difficulty of depreſſing it at both times.</p>
            <p>p. 72. <hi>Eo magis, &amp;c.</hi> That the Air is ſo much the more extended and rarefied, by how much the more is thence exhauſted, and ſo doth acquire a greater force of contracting it ſelf.</p>
            <p>p. 74. <hi>At profecto, &amp;c.</hi> But truly it ſeems not credible that this moſt ſoft Air ſhould ſo vehemently compreſs a Glaſs on all ſides (eſpecially one of that thickneſs there mention'd) as to break it.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Verius, &amp;c.</hi> It is therefore more truly anſwered, that the Glaſs is therefore ſo broken, becauſe by that exſuction its ſides are more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn inwards then (by reaſon of the figure unfit for reſiſtency) they were able to reſiſt. For ſeeing the included Air doth moſt firmly ſtick to the ſides of the Glaſs, to draw out the Air will be nothing elſe but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bend the ſides of the Glaſs inwards.</p>
            <p>p. 75. <hi>Sed profecto, &amp;c.</hi> But truly this ſeems too far remov'd from Truth, and may be by this alone ſufficiently refuted. Becauſe if the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Air which deſcends by that Tube into the Vial be ſo great as to break the Vial it ſelf, it ought certainly, before the breaking of the Vial, very much to move the water in which the Tube is immers'd, and to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57681:65"/>
excite bubbles in it, &amp;c. as appears, if any one blowing through that Tube doth make but an ordinary preſſure upon the water. But it is ſure that the water before the Vial is broken doth not move at all: as the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter will find.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Licet, &amp;c.</hi> Though the Tube had been ſhut at the top, the Vial had doubtleſs been broken after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>p. 77. <hi>Sed rectius, &amp;c.</hi> But it is more rightly thence inferr'd, that that Cylinder did nothing there before.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Dico, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay then that the Quickſilver doth by that exhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo deſcend in the Tube, becauſe it is drawn downwards by the Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon the reſtagnant Quickſilver. For that incumbent Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by its exhauſtion greatly rarefied and extended, vehemently contracts it ſelf, and by this contraction doth endeavour to lift the reſtagnant <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> out of its Veſſel; whence it comes to paſs that (the reſtagnant <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> now leſs gravitating upon the bottom of its Veſſel) the Quickſilver in the Tube muſt deſcend, as is manifeſt in it ſelf: So that it is no wonder that, the external Air afterwards entring, the Quickſilver again aſcends, ſeeing by that ingreſs the force which elevates the reſtagnant Quickſilver is weakned.</p>

                  </expan> hinc, &amp;c.</hi> And hence is a reaſon alſo given of another thing which is there noted, namely, that by the violent intruſion of the external Air into the Receiver the Quickſilver aſcended conſiderably above 29. Inches and an half. For as by the extraction of the Air the Quickſilver is depreſt below its ſtation, ſo by the intruſion of new Air it is elevated above it.</p>
            <p>p. 80. <hi>Nam ſi, &amp;c.</hi> For if it were kept up by that, it ought rather to aſcend then deſcend in colder weather, becauſe the Air then would be more denſe and heavy. Therefore the Quickſilver is not upheld by the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of Air, as is aſſerted.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Hinc fit, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that this <hi>Funicle</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the cold, the water doth aſcend in cold weather; but doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in hot, becauſe by heat the <hi>Funicle</hi> is dilated.</p>
            <p>p. 81. <hi>Ego certè, &amp;c.</hi> I truly do not doubt but there are ſome ſuch occult cauſes, by which the ſlender <hi>Eunicle</hi> that ſuſpends (as we mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the 10. Chapter) the Quickſilver in the Tube is ſometimes length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſometimes ſhortned, and ſo doth ſometimes let down, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lift up the Quickſilver.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>In decimo nono, &amp;c.</hi> In the 19. he ſhews that water doth in the ſame manner deſcend upon the exhauſting the Receiver, as he had ſhewn Quickſilver in the foregoing Chapter to deſcend. Of both which ſeeing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57681:66"/>
there is the ſame cauſe, there is no reaſon we ſhould any longer inſiſt on this.</p>
            <p>p. 82. <hi>Nam ſi, &amp;c.</hi> For if it were done ſo, theſe bubbles ought not ſo to have aſcended from the bottom of the Veſſel, (as it is aſſerted they did, both in this and the following Experiments that treat of bubbles) but from the upper part of the water, where they are leſs compreſt; as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently manifeſt.</p>
            <p>p. 83. <hi>Reſpondeo, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer that the water, upon that exhauſtion of the Air, doth not ſo aſcend of its own accord, but is violently drawn or lifted upwards by that rarefied Air contracting it ſelf. For as water doth ſuffer ſome compreſſion (as appears by experience) ſo here alſo it ſuffers ſome diſtenſion. And hence it is clearly manifeſt why theſe bubbles ſhould ariſe rather from the bottom of the Veſſel, then from the upper part of the water. For when that vehement ſuction doth endeavour to elevate the water from the bottom of the Vial, there ariſes there a certain ſubtil matter, which being turned into bubbles doth ſo aſcend as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 15. Chapter and the 4. Experiment.</p>
            <p>p. 84. <hi>Certum eſſe, &amp;c.</hi> It is certain that that Opinion is ſufficiently refuted by this ſingle Experiment.</p>
            <p>p. 85. <hi>Neceſſe, &amp;c.</hi> It muſt needs be that that ſtone could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſcend, then by leaving behind it ſuch a thin ſubſtance as is left by Quickſilver or Water deſcending in like manner.</p>
