            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Proceedings at the Seſsions for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AMongſt ſuch a multitude of various Crimes, the ſtory of every petty Felony with its trivial Circumſtances here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined or puniſht, cannot reaſonably be expected to be publiſhed; ſuch an undertaking would be no leſs tedious than unuſeful, and in ſome caſes unfit: but as to whatever was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted conſiderable or remarkable, this Sheet dares promiſe you a brief, yet ſufficient, Account both of the manner of Fact, and what became of the Priſoner charged therewith.</p>
            <p>The firſt Relation we are to make, is of a very ſad and unhappy accident. A Gentleman was indicted (according to form in ſuch caſes) for Murder; but upon Evidence the buſineſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared onely thus: A Burglary about four or five a clock in the morning being made, or at leaſt attempted, and diſcovered by the noiſe, and the people crying out <hi>Thieves,</hi> the perſon now tried, generouſly came forth of his Bed with his Sword in his hand to help his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102583:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Friends and ſeize the Robbers, but caſually meets three or four Journymen-<hi>Shoomakers,</hi> who working hard by and taking the Alarm, came likewiſe running out with the like honeſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but in that hurry and paſſion, mutually miſtaking each other for ſome of the Malefactors (who in truth were all eſcaped before) and the Gentleman demanding of the perſon deceaſed who they were? and he, under that miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, roughly replying, <hi>You ſhall know by our Actions,</hi> or to that effect, and withal ſtriking him; the now Priſoner concluding him one of the Thieves, unfortunately gave him a wound which occaſion'd his death: So that it appearing to be done partly by <hi>Miſadventure</hi> and partly <hi>ſe Defendendo,</hi> he was wholly acquitted.</p>
            <p>Another perſon was arraigned for a Murder committed about three years ago neer <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and for which his own Brother, being above a twelvemonth ſince Convicted of Manſlaughter, and not able to read when he had pray'd the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Clergy, was executed: But though this man was in his company when the fact was done, and ſome Circumſtances ſeemed to lie heavie upon him, yet for want of cleer Evidence he was diſcharged: As likewiſe were two more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning killing of a man neer <hi>Holborn,</hi> it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that he received any blow or wound from either of them that might occaſion his Death.</p>
            <p>But one for killing his Comrade by <hi>Tower hill,</hi> upon a Quarrel ariſing between them about
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102583:4"/>
a Reckoning at an Ale-houſe, was found guilty of Manſlaughter.</p>
            <p>A poor Charewoman intruſted ſometimes to ſweep the Hall of one of the City-Companies, and ſcour their Pewter when need required, made bold at ſeveral times to exchange a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity thereof for Silver. She very penitently confeſt the Fact, and had endeavour'd reſtitution as far as ſhe could, begging mercy of the honourable Bench, which was afforded her.</p>
            <p>Another coming with three or four other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to an Ale-houſe, ſome of them got up ſtairs, and breaking open a Cheſt of Drawers took away twenty Guinnies, five Rings, and ſeveral other things of value. The Priſoner being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be one of the Company, and that ſhe paid the Reckoning, was Convicted.</p>
            <p>A notorious Criminal after many fair warnings and not a few Convictions, having ſome time ſince obtained the mercy of Tranſportation, finding, it ſeems, the place not to agree ſo well with her as that of Newgate, whereunto ſhe had been ſo oft accuſtomed, or at leaſt that the Cuſtomes of the Country were not fit for her Trade, Sugars and Tobacco not being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſtolen, harbour'd, or put off there, as Watches, Rings, Plate, Silks, &amp;c. are here; thought fit to come back and follow her old Profeſſion of Shoplifting, being lately taken with a Scarf, which ſhe alleadged ſtuck to her clothes when ſhe went out of a ſhop at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, though the Jury were of opinion that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102583:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhe ſtole it: Which, together with her too early Return, 'tis verily believed, may cauſe her to take a ſurer Tranſportation by a turn at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> which, no doubt, will be much lamented as an <hi>untimely</hi> End, becauſe it happen'd no <hi>ſooner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next conſiderable, was an Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man and a woman, pretended to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarried, for Coyning. The woman had been an old Offender, and now no leſs than nine or ten Indictments found againſt her for Felonies; being ſo frugal and induſtrious, as firſt to ſteal Plate, and afterwards <hi>make Money</hi> of it, to ſave the trouble of Exchange and the charge of Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. Yet as cunning as ſhe was, ſhe became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to her own Diſcovery: For upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Secrecy, ſhe tells an acquaintance that ſhe knew ſome perſons that had ſtore of Caſh, and were reſolved to ſet up a private Mint; and ſhe would order it ſo, that he ſhould ſurprize them at work, and then get a good ſum for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein ſhe was to go ſnips. He ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſents, but honeſtly imparts it to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whoſe care and office it belongs to inſpect ſuch offences. Several times ſhe came to him, and ſometimes brought him new-coyn'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit-money to put off; but ſtill on pretences the buſineſs was not ripe, and perhaps then ſomewhat diſtruſting him, delay'd the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo that at laſt having learnt that ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a houſe about <hi>Hounſlow</hi> for carrying on the Intrigue, he with a Warrant and Officers went down, and found her blowing the fire in a Room
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102583:5"/>
where there were ſeveral ſorts of Metals, divers pieces of ſtolen Plate, a Coyning-Preſs, and ſome other Tools, now produced in Court; but her Husband was in another Room in bed. She did not much deny the Fact, but wholly clear'd him (to whom not above a fortnight before ſhe had been married) proteſting that he was not privie to any of her actions of that kinde. The Court asking the man upon his Tryal whether he were content to part with his Wife, he, like a kind Husband, replied, <hi>I am very willing the Law ſhould have its courſe: Better one than both.</hi> So that, he was acquitted, and ſhe convicted of High Treaſon, and by Law to be Burnt.</p>
            <p>The Court had much trouble given them by a fellow and his wife, the man being indicted for two Facts, ſtealing of a Mare, and of Linnen; the woman for a Smock: both refuſed to plead, inſomuch that the terrible Sentence of <hi>Pein fort &amp; dure</hi> (or preſſing) paſt, but not being recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and they on view of the Preſs, and Mr. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>'s preſſing and pious Exhortations not at once to caſt away their lives and their ſouls, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves, were admitted to Tryal, and for want of exact proof acquitted on both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments.</p>
            <p>Another remarkable thing was of a luſty young wench, who coming to an Office of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to inquire for a Service, was by them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to one at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and entertain'd, pretending her ſelf to be a Quaker, on which account her Maſter and Miſtriſs the more freely
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102583:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
truſted her; but <hi>the ſecond day</hi> in the evening ſhe robb'd them of ſeveral pieces of Plate, Clothes, &amp;c. above the value of Fifty pound, and putting her ſelf in mans apparel went off with the Prize, but was ſoon purſued and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her diſguiſe) diſcovered, and in her maſculine habit carried to Newgate; but now appeared in a female dreſs. Before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhe accuſed one for taking the Goods by her Invitation or conſent, and afterwards denied that he knew any thing of it, and charged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but ſtill acknowledging 'twas done by her privity, was found guilty of the Felony.</p>
            <p>Several perſons were found guilty of Felony and burnt in the hand for ſtealing of Silver Tankards, &amp;c. out of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aling-houſes: wherein there was little obſervable beſides this, That people after ſo many Examples ſhould be ſo far infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to run the hazzard of forfeiting their Licenſes, and loſing their Plate, by expoſing it in common uſe, meerly to gratifie their Pride, or a worſe humour of Covetouſneſs, which abateth the quantity of the Liquor, proportionably to the tempting quality of the Cups they vend it in.</p>
            <p>A woman in the <hi>Strand</hi> coming to buy one pair of Silk Stockings which ſhe paid for, fearing (it ſeems) ſhe might have a hard bargain, had been ſo kind to her ſelf as to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Seven and twenty pair more privately into her Apron without the uſeleſs Ceremony of asking the price; but being diſcovered by a By-ſtander, was forc'd to make legal ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and take an Acquittance for the ſame in her hand; to which Squire <hi>Ketch</hi> vouchſafed to be a Witneſs, and ſubſcribe his Mark.</p>
            <p>A luſty fellow arraign'd for ſtealing a Horſe, abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any knowledge of the buſineſs; but being ſuddenly ask'd what <hi>boot</hi> he had when he <hi>ſwapt</hi> him away, affirm'd, <hi>But five and thirty ſhillings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which amounting to a plain Confeſſion, he was brought in Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102583:6"/>
Another for ſtealing  of Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaded the general Pardon he had lately obtained for another Robbery; but the words thereof being read, and not extending to this Caſe, he was likewiſe Convicted, it ſerving rather to aggravate than exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate his Fact.</p>
            <p>After this a woman was tried for the moſt unnatural Crime of Murdering her Baſtard-child, and a man for the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trick of killing almoſt Threeſcore Sheep onely to ſteal Fourſcore pounds of Tallow; a piece of Villany never till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few years practiſed: He pleaded guilty, and was Burnt in the hand.</p>
            <p>There were three Bargemen arraigned for Murder, drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a boy in a Fiſher-boat on the Thames. It was endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be proved that they did it wilfully; but they alleadged, that by the violent current of the Tide they could not help it. The Jury ſound the matter of Fact ſpecially, and left it to Judges to determine the Crime in point of Law.</p>
            <p>Several perſons in cuſtody for Robberies on the High-ways were not tried, there being no Proſecution in <hi>Middleſex</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but are to be ſent to the reſpective Counties where they did the Facts, to take their Tryals at the Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>There were in all Five perſons Condemned to die: Two men and two women (old notorious and incorrigible Thieves) to be Hang'd, and one woman to be Burnt: Four ſet by, before Judgement, for Tranſportation; Fourteen Burnt in the hand; and Six for Petty Larceny to be Whipt.</p>
