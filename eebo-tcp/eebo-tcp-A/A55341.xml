            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>IF Heav'n the grateful Liberty wou'd give,</l>
               <l>That I might chuse my Method how to live:</l>
               <l>And all those Hours propitious Fate shou'd lend,</l>
               <l>In blissful Ease and Satisfaction spend.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Near some fair Town I'd have a private Seat,</l>
               <l>Built Uniform, not little, nor too great:</l>
               <l>Better, if on a rising Ground it stood,</l>
               <l>Fields on this side, on that a Neighb'ring Wood.</l>
               <l>It shou'd within no other Things contain,</l>
               <l>But what are Useful, Necessary, Plain:</l>
               <l>Methinks, 'tis Nauseous, and I'd ne'er endure</l>
               <l>The needless Pomp of gawdy Furniture:</l>
               <l>A little Garden, grateful to the Eye,</l>
               <l>And a cool Rivulet run Murmuring by:</l>
               <l>On whose delicious Banks a stately Row</l>
               <l>Of shady Lymes, or Sycamores, shou'd grow.</l>
               <l>At th' end of which a silent Study plac'd,</l>
               <l>Shou'd with the Noblest Authors there be grac'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> in whose mighty Lines,</l>
               <l>Immortal Wit, and solid Learning Shines.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53343:5"/>Sharp <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and am'rous <hi>Ovid</hi> too,</l>
               <l>Who all the turns of Loves soft Passion knew:</l>
               <l>He, that with Judgment reads his Charming Lines,</l>
               <l>In which strong Art, with stronger Nature joyns,</l>
               <l>Must grant, his Fancy do's the best Excel:</l>
               <l>His Thoughts so tender, and exprest so well;</l>
               <l>With all those Moderns, Men of steady Sense,</l>
               <l>Esteem'd for Learning, and for Eloquence:</l>
               <l>In some of These, as Fancy shou'd advise,</l>
               <l>I'd always take my Morning Exercise.</l>
               <l>For sure, no Minutes bring us more Content,</l>
               <l>Than those in pleasing useful Studies spent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'd have a Clear and Competent Estate,</l>
               <l>That I might live Genteelly, but not Great.</l>
               <l>As much as I cou'd moderately spend,</l>
               <l>A little more sometimes t'oblige a Friend.</l>
               <l>Nor shou'd the Sons of Poverty Repine</l>
               <l>Too much at Fortune, they shou'd taste of Mine;</l>
               <l>And all that Objects of true Pity were,</l>
               <l>Shou'd be reliev'd with what my Wants cou'd spare;</l>
               <l>For what our Maker has too largely giv'n,</l>
               <l>Shou'd be return'd in gratitude to Heav'n.</l>
               <l>A frugal Plenty shou'd my Table spread,</l>
               <l>With healthful, not luxurious Dishes, fed:</l>
               <l>Enough to satisfy, and something more</l>
               <l>To feed the Stranger, and the Neighb'ring Poor.</l>
               <l>Strong Meat indulges Vice, and pampering Food</l>
               <l>Creates Diseases, and inflames the Blood.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53343:5"/>But what's sufficient to make Nature Strong,</l>
               <l>And the bright Lamp of Life continue long,</l>
               <l>I'd freely take, and as I did possess</l>
               <l>The bounteous Author of my Plenty bless.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'd have a little Cellar, Cool, and Neat,</l>
               <l>With Humming Ale, and Virgin Wine Repleat.</l>
               <l>Wine whets the Wit, improves its Native Force,</l>
               <l>And gives a pleasant Flavour to Discourse;</l>
               <l>By making all our Spirits Debonair,</l>
               <l>Throws off the Lees, the Sedement of Care.</l>
               <l>But as the greatest Blessing Heaven lends</l>
               <l>May be debauch'd, and serve ignoble Ends;</l>
               <l>So, but too oft, the Grapes refreshing Juice,</l>
               <l>Does many mischievous Effects produce.</l>
               <l>My House, shou'd no such rude Disorders know,</l>
               <l>As from high Drinking consequently flow.</l>
               <l>Nor wou'd I use what was so kindly giv'n,</l>
               <l>To the dishonour of Indulgent Heav'n.</l>
               <l>If any Neighbour came he shou'd be free,</l>
               <l>Us'd with respect, and not Uneasy be,</l>
               <l>In my Retreat, or to himself, or me.</l>
               <l>What Freedom, Prudence, and Right Reason give,</l>
               <l>All Men, may with Impunity receive:</l>
               <l>But the least swerving from their Rules too much;</l>
               <l>For what's forbidden Us, 'tis Death to touch.</l>
               <l>That Life might be more comfortable yet,</l>
               <l>And all my Joys refin'd, sincere and great,</l>
               <l>I'd chuse two Friends, whose Company wou'd be</l>
               <l>A great Advance to my Felicity.</l>

               <l>Averse to Vanity, Revenge, and Pride,</l>
               <l>In all the Methods of Deceit untry'd:</l>
               <l>So faithful to her Friend, and good to all,</l>
               <l>No Censure might upon her Actions fall.</l>
               <l>Then wou'd ev'n Envy be compell'd to say,</l>
               <l>She goes the least of Womankind astray.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To this fair Creature I'd sometimes retire,</l>
               <l>Her Conversation wou'd new Joys inspire,</l>
               <l>Give Life an Edge so keen, no surly Care</l>
               <l>Wou'd venture to assault my Soul, or dare</l>
               <l>Near my Retreat to hide one secret Snare.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53343:7"/>But so Divine, so Noble a Repast,</l>
               <l>I'd seldom, and with Moderation taste.</l>
               <l>For highest Cordials all their Virtue lose,</l>
               <l>By a too frequent, and too bold an use;</l>
               <l>And what would cheer the Spirits in distress,</l>
               <l>Ruins our Health when taken to Excess.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'd be concern'd in no litigious Jarr,</l>
               <l>Belov'd by all, not vainly popular:</l>
               <l>Whate'er Assistance I had power to bring</l>
               <l>T' oblige my Country, or to serve my King,</l>
               <l>Whene'er they call'd, I'd readily afford,</l>
               <l>My Tongue, my Pen, my Counsel, or my Sword.</l>
               <l>Law Suits I'd shun with as much Studious Care,</l>
               <l>As I wou'd Dens, where hungry Lyons are;</l>
               <l>And rather put up Injuries, than be</l>
               <l>A Plague to him, who'd be a Plague to me.</l>
               <l>I value Quiet, at a Price too great,</l>
               <l>To give for my Revenge so dear a Rate:</l>
               <l>For what do we by all our Bustle gain,</l>
               <l>But counterfeit Delight for real Pain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If Heav'n a date of many years wou'd give,</l>
               <l>Thus I'd in Pleasure, Ease, and Plenty live.</l>
               <l>And as I near approach'd the Verge of Life,</l>
               <l>Some kind Relation (for I'd have no Wife)</l>
               <l>Shou'd take upon him all my Worldly Care,</l>
               <l>While I did for a better State prepare.</l>
               <l>Then I'd not be with any trouble vext,</l>
               <l>Nor have the Evening of my Days perplext.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53343:7"/>But by a silent, and a peaceful Death,</l>
               <l>Without a Sigh, Resign my Aged Breath:</l>
               <l>And when committed to the Dust, I'd have</l>
               <l>Few Tears, but Friendly, dropt into my Grave.</l>
               <l>Then wou'd my Exit so propitious be,</l>
               <l>All Men wou'd wish to live and dye like me.</l>
