            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>COmpassion which gives us a more sweet, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous touch, than any other concern that attends our Nature, had at the Funeral-Procession so sensible an effect upon ev'n <hi>Me,</hi> that I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear being guilty of the Paper with which I presume to trouble your Lordship. For what could be a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving consideration, then that a Lady, who had all that Youth, Beauty, Virtue, and Power could bestow, should be so suddenly snatch'd from us? A Lady that was serv'd by the Sword, and celebrated by the Pen of my Lord <hi>Cutts.</hi> Though indeed, if we rightly esteem'd things, we should lament for our <hi>own</hi> sakes, not <hi>Hers;</hi> so Poor a thing it is to make an Evil of that, which is certainly the kindest Boon of Nature, our <hi>Dissolution.</hi> But the Men of Honour are not so ungratefull to their <hi>Friend</hi> Death, as to look at him in the ghastly dress the World gives him, of Rawbones, Shackles, Chains, Diseases, and Torments; they know that he is so far from bringing such Company, that he relieves us from 'em. So little is there in what Men make such Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about, and so much is it an Irony to call it <hi>brave</hi> to expire calmly, and <hi>resolution</hi> to go to rest. This
<pb facs="tcp:55800:3"/>
is no News to your Lordship, whom Death has so often allur'd with the <hi>Glory</hi> of Dangers, and with the <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Wounds, I'll not be so Poetical to say, your Muse hover'd about you, and sav'd you inspight of the many you have receiv'd, but am sure, I may say, she'll preserve you, when you can receive no more: For <hi>Apollo</hi> is a Physician ev'n <hi>after Death:</hi> As to my Verses, all, methinks, on the Dead Queen ought to be address'd to your Lordship; who, in the Dedication of your own Works, best adorn'd her Living; if Good for your Entertainment, Bad for your Pardon; if, when these are thrown aside, an Eye cast upon 'em introduces the mention of so excellent a Princess, where other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise She had not been spoken off, I have my full end; nor do I think I come late on a Subject, which all Good Men will Eternally dwell upon; I am sensible how short I have fall'n of expressing the gracefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of some Honourable Personages, whose Names I have presum'd with; I design'd 'em only an oblique Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and nam'd 'em for the very Reason they walk'd at the <hi>Funeral,</hi> which was not to showe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but to do Honour to the Queen. But should it prove any way offensive, <hi>I</hi> hope to shun their, and your Lordship's Resentment by the concealment of my name, and borrow the unknown Knight's device, in Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> of the Fish <hi>Sepia,</hi> which when catch'd in the Net, casts a black Ink about it, and so makes it's escape. This thought, my Lord, checks the fervent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition I have long had, of expressing my self, My Lord,</p>
