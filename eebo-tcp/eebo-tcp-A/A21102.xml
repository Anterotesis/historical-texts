         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

diſcord ſo harſh, as when Benefits and vngratefulneſſe are put together.
This is a diſcord that cannot be tempered by any art, to make a grace, or to
make the harmonie more rare and artificiall. It were a ſhame for me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that know ſomewhat in Muſicke, to commit ſuch an vnpardonable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in manners. And this I muſt of neceſſitie doe, if with all humility from
the deepeſt thoughts of my heart, in priuate and in publique, I doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
all poſſible thankefulneſſe to ſo Great, ſo Wiſe, ſo Learned, ſo Noble,
and bountifull a Patron and Benefactour. Goodneſſe is not to be eſteemed by quantity. A Hand or
an Eye drawne by a curious Painter, is worth a large Table done by an ordinarie Hand: But your
Lordſhips Beneficence was both great and good. For it was an Annuity for my life; and it was done
ſo, that it had in it all that can commend a good deed. It was not done for allyance, or former know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which makes a benefit a debt: Not for Seruice paſt; for that is not a benefit, but a reward:
Not wrung or forced by long ſuit, or mediation of friends, which puls downe the price of any benefit:
Not after long delay and much wayting, which is the torment of Suitours, and makes a benefit payd
for before it come. Not done with wayward lookes, and chiding, which vnder the colour of good
counſell, giues a benefit a bitter taſte of contumelie. Nor wonne after ſome denyals and repulſes;
that which we wraſtle for, we account our owne. Neither was it giuen vpon no cauſe, for ſo benefits
are not placed but caſt away. It had none of theſe, but all the contrary commendations. For your
Lordſhip conferred it on me when I was vnknowne vnto you, when no man had euer ſpoken for me;
when I was farre remote and leaſt thought of ſo Honourable a friend, and leſſe of ſuch a fauour,
and it was ſent by your Lordſhip to me; and all this done ſo, that when I came to ſent my thankes,
your Lordſhip knew not who I was; yet was it done vpon hearing of ſome Motects of mine, of which
I would not in modeſty ſpeake, but that it makes for your Lordſhips iuſt praiſe; He doth not giue,
but throw away, that hath no reaſon for his giuing: Let the world then be iudge, if I haue not good
cauſe to profeſſe all thankefulneſſe. And if euery man, whom your Lordſhip hath thus preuented
in greater matters (as I haue heard of a great many ſince this fauour was done to me) had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
or would take occaſion to giue your Lordſhip thankes as this Paper doth, it would turne the
enuy of ſome ill-diſpoſed, into admiration of your ſweet and noble nature. For my poore ſelfe, I haue
haſtened theſe few Motects, that I might ſhow ſome part of my thankefulneſſe, and be further
indebted to your Lordſhip, for a new fauour, in taking them vnder your Lordſhips protection. I
know they are not worthy your Lordſhips eare, but thankefulneſſe conſiſts not in the meanes, but
in the heart of him that for benefits is engaged. Yet it would be ſome content to me, if I were ſure,
that as many eyes would looke vpon this Epiſtle, as it may be there will be eares to heare the Songs
I preſent. But I muſt be content with the inward teſtimonie of my heart, in which I will daily pray
for your Lordſhips happineſſe, and honour, and reſt</p>
