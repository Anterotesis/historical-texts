            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF THE
CHARACTER
OF A
Popish Successor:
In a REPLY to two pretended ANSWERS, &amp;c.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A Reply to the first Answer printed by N. Thompson.</head>
               <p>THERE has lately, as the Author has most truly exprest, a
very slight. Reply been made to a Pamphlet call'd, <hi>A Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a Popish Successor;</hi> in which he arraigns the Pamphleteer
(as he calls him) <hi>of contradictory discourse and reasoning,</hi> but
says <hi>his principles are not so:</hi> To prove which he allows you
to fancy <hi>a picture of the late Rebellion; for like that it begins with fears and
jealousies of Religion, Liberty and Property, and continues in murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
at the Imperial Root, and to stiffen the knees that would bow to a crowned
head.</hi> The last two parts of this Inditement has been so far from being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the Author, that where he found them, they were own'd, as the
evil effects of a worse cause: but by advising us <hi>not to be subdued like less
than English men;</hi> not to submit our necks like slaves to the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke,
he does infer, <hi>we must repel a King under the name of an Invader.</hi> Truly
when tho' by the permission or aid of any <hi>English</hi> King, Popery, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
Idolatry, and Cruelty, are entring our Gates, and are ready to but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
our Protestant Ministers at their Divine Worship, make Human <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
Sacrifice of us, our Wives and Children; we justly may resist the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
Tyrannick Power of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place our Answering Pamphleteer would have you believe,
notwithstanding your own sense and reason to the contrary, there is no
just fear of <hi>Popery,</hi> nor any danger in any of their Plots; but from his own
wise suppositions drawn from 41, and 48. has found or made a Plot, and as
prudently laid it at the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> door; a Plot so subtil, that they have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99784:3"/>
outdone the very Jesuits themselves in the contrivance; and laid it with so
much art and cunning, that no heart could have imagined it, nor no eye
discerned it but his. And now let us take notice who this honest Gentleman
under the sinily of his <hi>Leviathans,</hi> means, <hi>that sport and take their pastimes
in our troubled deep; whose restless and uneasie rolling does not foretell, but is it
self the storm.</hi> But I think, with our wise Authors leave, this had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proved, before so positively asserted, considering 'tis no less than three
whole successive Parliaments (his <hi>Leviathans</hi>) that have been restless to
find out a Plot, and vigorous to prevent our ruin; all which he has drawn
in as the greatest, nay only principals of our destruction, and as his Text
goes, <hi>are themselves the storm</hi> or Plot; he musters up a thundering accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against them, <hi>that they foment the people into rebellion, distract them with
dreadful apprehensions, casting them into a raving frenzy; and as the greatest
plague of the wicked, makes them afraid where no fear is.</hi> And this honest well
principled man is all this while a man of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And to
prove the correspondence of this truth with that of his Pamphlet, we may
easily remember, that all the <hi>Parliaments</hi> were not all <hi>Presbyters;</hi> the first
<hi>Parliament</hi> were all men chose at His <hi>Majesties</hi> blessed Restoration, when
there was not the least favour for that Party; and those Loyal, Wise, and
Honest Patriots of their Countrey, gave the first blow to the <hi>Plot,</hi> first
Allarmed the people, made Tests, and removed the <hi>DUKE</hi> out of his <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and seat in <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet these are the men, and this the <hi>storm which
is ready to shatter our Royal Vessel, the Brittish Kingdom, into pieces.</hi> But since
he is a zealous Protestant, they have no reason to be angry at his making
bold with his own Party.</p>
               <p>But why should we stand in fear of Popery? <hi>Ay, why indeed,</hi> says he?
He has no fear at all; they will not hurt him for his Religion, then why
should we fear? But alas! all are not such Protestants as he, Heaven knows,
such Champions for their Cause and Interest; and therefore we may have
reason to fear, notwithstanding all his brotherly advice to the contrary.</p>
               <p>In the next place let us see what small difference he makes between the
<hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and those of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> only
<hi>a few disputable matters of faith, and not very material Ceremonies of Divine
Worship;</hi> as what harm is it to pray to Saints, to worship Images? or what
great matter to believe the Infallibility of the Pope, or the Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Sacrament, or to allow the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
error, when it shall depose and murder Kings, command Massacres, make
Plots, Fire Cities, Canonize the principal Actors of their Revenge and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Cruelties, and consecrate the Instruments of death? Is it not hard,
says our honest Protestant, that these frivolous divisions <hi>on a sudden should
ruine and efface all those good characters of Magnanimity and Iustice, of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
and Goodness in this our Popish Prince, which even his greatest enemies,
nay the most detestable Character it self allows him?</hi> Indeed Mr. Scribler, I
remember no such allowance; but as your self remarkt, suppose, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
But if the encouraging of Plots and Popery, holding correspondence
with his Holiness and other Forreign Princes, contrary to the Laws of this
Nation, be Virtues, those and more perhaps of such a nature, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him. In the next place he takes a great deal of pains to let you know
what the Virtues are; which though the Characterizer does not understand,
he does especially when Cardinal; and to shew you he is a man of truth,
and can keep his word sometimes, he has there made so slight a Reply, as I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99784:3"/>
have not thought it worth the answering, but will refer the ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to compare that part of the Character with his Answer; and now I will
skip over this page, as he has done several which he could not with all his
stock of Impudence defend.</p>
               <p>Well now, <hi>says he,</hi> since we have Laws to suppress Popery, what remains then
for a Popish King, but to put those Laws in execution; and for us, but to sit
down under the shadow of this Fence? <hi>Yes, I think a greater assurance that
he will execute them, than our Answerer can give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Argument, or rather Opinion, <hi>is so far from thinking that the
Reign of a Popish King can be any ways advantageous to the Iesuitical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that he rather believes it will be their destruction; and why? because
there is Laws of foree against them, and the power of executing those Laws he
himself has already given to the people; and which he has concluded they will
more vigorously do under such a King.</hi> But hold! this Sham wont pass; we
know the people may convict them; but none can punish them but their
Prince. But if the people by the authority of our Scribler do, what will he
have this King to be the mean time asleep? or with all his Cardinal Virtues
an Atheist? for if he is not a Papist, he has no pretence to any Religion,
having himself renounc't all Churches else. Certainly he must be the first of
these two, if this power be assumed in his Reign, without his permission;
and the last, if with it. For no man can be, or pretend to be a Son of the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that will not be obedient to all her principles and commands,
and will not maintain on all occasions to their utmost power, her Cause and
Interest: He shall no sooner refuse or neglect to do this, but he shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
as the basest Coward, and excommunicated as the vilest Heretick.
Besides, there will be more danger for him to permit their punishments,
than any other Prince whatever; for as their hopes in him has given them
almost assurances of their utmost wishes; so will their hatred and malice be
greater to him, when they shall find themselves more than frustrate of all
their ambitious expectations. And if an Atheist, (a man that believes no
God, no punishment for Vice, nor no reward for Virtue) to pretend to be
of a Religion by which he has banisht himself his native Countrey, lost the
hearts of three Kingdoms, and thrust himself for ever from a Throne, he
must be the greatest mad man, or the most a Fool in the Creation; and I
think it not fit for either of these to wear a Crown, or a Papist our <hi>English</hi>
Diadem. And prudently considering all this, that <hi>exclusive Bill in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
was like the wise Fathers advice to rash <hi>Phaeton,</hi> as much for his own
good as the Kingdoms safety; for no doubt but if ever he should ascend
this Throne, and hurried on by the furious conduct of his <hi>Romish</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
till he had set his Nation in a flame, he himself at last will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
perish in his own fires.</p>
               <p>Now our Answerer <hi>bids us consider the weight of a Coronation Oath with a
Prince of any sense of Honour or Religion,</hi> and he has promis'd upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
(pray Heaven he keeps his word!) a very smart argument, which
he makes out thus; <hi>He has a double tye, of Nature and Religion.</hi> Those tyes
indeed ought to be very strong; but how strong the tyes of Nature and
Gratitude to the best of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Brothers,</hi> are in him, has been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
experienced, and largely treated of in the Popish Character; but for
<hi>Religion,</hi> that has no tye at all upon him that loosens all other tyes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the pride and interest of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. And though our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99784:4"/>
has to a miracle confest, <hi>that there is such a Doctrine in the Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>as dispencing with, and absolving Papists from all Oaths to Hereticks;</hi>
yet says he, <hi>'tis a Doctrine never universally received, aud that even they that
do believe it, do not preach it to all; and therefore these, with him, are poor
shifts and evasions.</hi> Why should we fear it should be made use of against us?
for says he, <hi>that Prince that would lose all his Honourable preferments rather
than tell a lye against his conscience, ought certainly, to be believed when he shall
make so solemn a protestation as his Coronation Oath.</hi> But that Oath we have
by sad experience found to be such a Juglers knot, and has so often plaid fast
and loose, that if he were a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and should swear by <hi>Alha,</hi> we
should have much more reason to believe him as <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Infidel,</hi> than as a
<hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> for we know the bands of Nature, Morality, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
have been sacred to <hi>Heathens,</hi> but never to <hi>Papists.</hi> And besides, I
must tell my smart Gentleman, Tho' we very well know that Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are frequent things from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet it would have been no less than a
mortal sin, and never to have been forgiven, to have presumed in that
case to have told a lye without the <hi>Popes</hi> permission; tho' truly as some <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
have declared, his <hi>Holiness</hi> was to blame not to dispense both with the
<hi>Dukes</hi> receiving the Sacrament in the <hi>Protestant Church,</hi> and their taking the
Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> for some time, since they would have
been no less sons of his Church, nor no less true to his power, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
he might so easily have done it, which would have prevented all their
misfortunes, and for ever have secured their Interests.</p>
               <p>And next says our Scribler, <hi>What if the King of</hi> France, <hi>contrary to his
Oath upon the Sacrament, has invaded</hi> Flanders, <hi>he is but one president; and
must all Princes of that Religion violate their Oaths because he has done so?</hi>
But for Q. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Eng.</hi> violation of her Oaths, Covenants, and her Honor,
with all her barbarous recorded Cruelties, let her pass, 'tis not at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to his purpose to take the least notice of her. Besides, for his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
Oath, 'tis an Oath upon compulsion; and he has greater and more
ambitious motives to make him take it, tho' against his conscience, than the
<hi>French</hi> King had to take his Oath upon the Sacrament, and break it; for
that was only a little to enlarge his Empire: but this of our <hi>Popish Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
is to mount him on a Throne. And since it is a like ambitious cause in
both, we very well know, that <hi>ambitio multus mortales falsos fieri coegit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He tells us now <hi>his first design was only to be of the defensive part.</hi> But if
comparisons of these times with those of the late Rebellion; if railing at,
and accusing three Parliaments of a horrid Plot, a Plot to ruin Monarchy,
ferment us into Civil Wars, and make us cut our own throats, be more than
defensive, the second page of his Pamphlet must tell him to his face he lies.
But now he is at the same thing again; he must say something.</p>
               <p>Well tho' <hi>he denies the possibility of introducing Popery, because a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as good Protestants as the</hi> Characterizer <hi>do both say so, and believe it too;</hi>
yet certainly he thinks the Party very powerful, to protect his noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
impudence against the King, the Parliament, and all the Judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power of the Nation, who has with great wisdom, and by strong
proofs, found out a most Hellish and Dangerous Plot; a Plot against the
Life of his Sacred Majesty, the Protestant Religion and Government; and
with reason and thankfulness have acknowledged 'twas only the especial
Providence of God that has delivered us. But he says, <hi>'tis not only impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to introduce</hi> Popery, <hi>but 'tis impossible for the</hi> Papists <hi>themselves to believe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99784:4"/>
it could be done;</hi> that is to say, there has been no Plot on that side. But
what has he made all the Three Estates of <hi>England</hi> to be, but a pack of Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
and Villains, to pretend a Plot where there was none; and to set their
hands to the confirmation of such a Falshood, and to the delusion of the
undiscerning multitude? Nay, he has a further charge against that great and
honourable Council of Parliament, who (tho' a <hi>Papist</hi> King cannot influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the Judiciary Officers of his own creation) have already depraved the
Bench, and obstructed Justice, as in the last line of his 8<hi>th</hi> page, where he
says, <hi>Iustice has been denied, where it might give distast to the Representatives
of the Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but after much sensless quibling upon the Characterizer's being a
<hi>Papist,</hi> because he was of their minds so far as to believe their design of esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
<hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>England</hi> might have took effect; he at last has not only
<hi>granted the possibility of their belief, but the introducing of</hi> Popery <hi>feasible.</hi> Yet
(says he) <hi>does it follow, that because they thought so then, that they think so
still? sure they have little reason to believe that that design which was in so
hopeful a forwardness as never since Queen</hi> Maryes <hi>days could be boasted of, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with all the art and contrivance, all the secresie and cunning of a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and active party, favoured by several the greatest persons in the kingdom,
and those most eminent for their Riches and Interest to support the Cause, and
the universal security of the Nation conspiring with all these, and after all this
brought to nought; should ever at all, or at least in this age, be effected, when all
their measures are broken, and all their wicked contrivances laid open, and the
whole scene of that Religious Villany displayed to publick view; when the whole
Nation is still awake with continual fears, and fresh Alarms against them.</hi> Yes,
Mr. Scribler, 'twas and might still be possible, if the people of <hi>England</hi> be
yet more sensless than in that security you spoke of, and does yet leave them
the hopes of a pernicious Popish King; there will be then no need of
Plots, his Power will undoubtedly perform much more than all their Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
stratagems cou'd ere design. It was indeed an over-hasty <hi>Roman</hi> zeal
to mount him on the Throne before his time; they were impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
thought long till they arrived at their dear promised Land, and wou'd
have took delight to have waded through that Sea of blood that wou'd
have brought them thither; 'twas that and Providence that it seemed had
not designed we all should perish in our dreams, made them so unhappy
to themselves, and fortunate to us. Their fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that death might interpose
betwixt them and all their hopes, and snatch their darling Prince before his
Brother's or their work was done; their dread of this, and eager thirst of
blood, made them plot on for what they might have had without, and ruin
all. But to prove 'tis possible, in case of a <hi>Popish King,</hi> 'tis in the power of
any <hi>English</hi> Prince to remit the punishments due to that party when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
as has been experienced; and I think none will doubt but a <hi>Popish
King,</hi> and an obedient Son of Holy <hi>Mother Church,</hi> will extend his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
a little further for them than an Heretick, so far no doubt as to
encourage his own Religion, and suppress its enemies, and give them leave
to revenge their long sufferings. Well, admit this King, and more certainly
the impowering his party to all they can desire, what will the cackling of all
our Protestant Geese do then, to the preserving our Capitol? even as much
good as our Scriblers Vindication has done his Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99784:5"/>Next, if it were possible that we shall ever suffer a Papist <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and put the reins of Government into his hands, whose Arbitrary
Principles we so abhor; when we do this, we shall no doubt not only be
content to let him have a standing Army, but shall every man voluntarily
contribute to the setting up and maintaining that Army we know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
is design'd to enslave us, or cut our throats. But I will hope, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it impossible for the whole Nation to be mad at once; and on that
presumption agree with my Pamphleteer in that point, That we shall have
no standing Army, no Arbitrary Government; and indeed I fancy the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
have just cause to say now, <hi>Perditur haec inter miseros Lux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well but he says again, <hi>It were folly for a Papist King to attempt the
bringing in of Popery: for,</hi> says he, <hi>young as the Reformation was in Queen</hi>
Maryes <hi>days, it might indeed with some ease have been pluckt up, ere it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
root; the Papist in those days equal, at least, if not exceeding the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
all longing for the restoration of their Religion: but now when this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
Superstition has been so long worn off the minds of the people, and
the Reformation so deeply and so strongly rooted, the</hi> Roman <hi>Church so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
both for the dangerous Innovations of its Doctrine, and the Idolatry of
its Ceremonies; and so odious in the eyes of the people for its pernicious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
exprest in the Villanous practises of its professors, in Massacres, and Plots
all detected.</hi> All this indeed is very true; and I confess he is so far much in
the right. But soft and fair! how came this to pass? how has the Papists
disobliged you, now that you are so briskly treating of their pernicious
Principles, the dangerous Innovations of their Doctrines, Idolatry of their
Ceremonies, and their Villanous practices in Plots and Massacres? How
came the wind to be thus turn'd now? Or has my good friend forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
since he writ the second page of his wise Answer, where he was show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the principles of a Papist and a Protestant so little differ; 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to reason or common sense a Papist should be less an honest man for
them, <hi>as only differing in a few disputable matters of faith, and not very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
ceremonies of divine worship.</hi> And is it possible that he who has so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against contradictory discourse and arguing, and has so much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to find it out where it never was, by leaving out, or adding words
of his own, should at last be found so grosly guilty of the same fault? Well,
but perhaps he may as justly as his Master say the case was alter'd, so he
could not help it; for indeed his first business was to perswade us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what a happy condition we should be in under the reign of so vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and heroick a Popish King, and to take off our dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of his Religion; therefore he tells us the small difference betwixt us
and them, <hi>as only a few disputable matters of faith,</hi> &amp;c. but fearing that work
with all his painful arguments may not be perfectly finisht, therefore he
now says we have no reason to think it can do us any harm, because it can
never be establisht in <hi>England; for the dangerous Innovations of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and the Idolatry of its Ceremonies, and villanous practises of its profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in Plots and Massacres, have rendred it so odious.</hi> But this contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was a little unlucky in this place, just where he is accusing the <hi>false
Satyr of blowing hot and cold with the same breath;</hi> but in that we may
suppose he did forget himself, which may be forgiven him too, since by his
handling both these Arguments with so much convincing art and cunning,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99784:5"/>
he has proved good Wits are incident to ill memories.</p>
               <p>But now he says, <hi>'Tis plain, tho' the Triple Mitre be struck at, the three
Crowns is their aim; nor would they be so violent against</hi> Popery, <hi>which they
have no reason to fear, but that they know 'tis the charm to bring in the people
to the ruine of Monarchy; knowing the multitude to be not unlike Beasts or
Cattel in a Ship, which in any storm that is raised, if they are made apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of the Vessels sinking on the one side, run immediately with such a violent
panick fear to the other, that they overset the Ship, and quite overwhelm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and it in ruin.</hi> And all this lyes again at the Parliaments door, because
they have endeavoured for the good of the Kingdom to disinherit a <hi>Popish</hi>
Successor, and have not supplied the King with moneys, tho' at the same
time they have declared, if his Majesty will be graciously pleased to join
with them, and bar all the pretence of <hi>Papists</hi> to this <hi>English</hi> Diadem, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their fears by passing that one Bill against that Prince, whose succession
is the terror and distraction of this Nation; an Act in which consists the
peace, the safety, and the glory of three Kingdoms; let him but be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from all pretensions to this <hi>Crown,</hi> which justly may be done by <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and they will open their purses so wide to Him, give Him
that Mass of Wealth, as will make Him both fear'd abroad, and beloved at
home. So vast a Treasure will they make Him, as none of all His Royal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
nor He Himself was ever Master of. But should they have done't
without, it would have betrayed the Nation, ruin'd their own Priviledges,
and left all Grievances as unredressable as unredrest, and then they might
thank themselves for what would follow.</p>
               <p>And next our Scribler thinks it very unreasonable <hi>that the Prince alone
should not have the benefit of Liberty of Conscience, which every subject in his
dominions takes very ill to have denied to himself.</hi> Truly 'tis hard indeed;
but the circumstances of this Nation considered, not at all to be wondred
at: for I believe all men of sense, as well as Sir <hi>Poll,</hi> as he calls him, will
take it for granted, that if this <hi>Popish</hi> Heir comes to the Crown, he will by
the dictates of that Religion, in spight of Vows and Covenants, <hi>promote
the Romish Interest with all the severity, injustice, and tyranny, that most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Cruelty can invent.</hi> But whether or no he will condescend to make
the least excuse for it, as the <hi>Characterizer</hi> has supposed he might, I cannot
tell; but our Answerer that laughs at the supposition, 'tis probable knows
more of his mind, than to think he will be guilty of so much curtesy, as to
make us an excuse for any thing he does against us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> (says a Critick in the Character) <hi>these be the dangers of a Popish King,
why have we not such strong, such potent Laws made before this Popish Heir
comes to the Crown, that it shall be impossible for him ever to set up</hi> Popery,
<hi>tho' he shou'd never so much endeavour it?</hi> The <hi>Character</hi> answers, <hi>To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to do it by Law, even with those Laws we have already against it, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</hi>
But it is likewise as impossible for any man of sence to believe, that
he being a <hi>Papist,</hi> and Vassal to the Pope, either will or can put those Laws
in execution. But then a little after 'tis confest <hi>he may be totally restrain'd
from all power of introducing Popery by the force of such Laws as may be made
to tye up his hands; and put the execution of those Laws into the hands of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99784:6"/>
People, and consequently those Laws must be such as must ruin his prerogative.
Well, but granting thus much,</hi> says our Answerer, <hi>what you infer from this
is doubly ridiculous; first, that no Monarch would thus intail such an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
on a Crown as shall render the Imperial Majesty of</hi> England <hi>but a pageant,
a meer puppet upon a wire.</hi> And what can you make more of a King that has
no power, no not so much as the meanest subject in his Dominions can have
after these Laws are made to tye up his hands? he cannot put an Officer in
any place throughout his Kingdoms, for fear he should be a <hi>Papist,</hi> nor take
one servant of that perswasion into his Court, they being all liable then to
the conviction and persecution of the people; and when it is so far from
him to defend them, that 'tis not in his power to favour, in any case, the
dearest of his own party: for may not his subjects, or rather his Masters,
inspect into his actions, and call him to account for every thing they think
a misdemeanor, having the Law in their own hands? and when his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
is thus ruined, is not this Prince more like a Pageant born upon
mens shoulders, than a King? which when they are weary of, they may
throw him down, and dash him all to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But these Laws,</hi> says he, <hi>that bind up a King so strictly, suppose him to be
a Popish King, such only to be restrained, this is not therefore an intailed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy,
but a short eclipsing of the full splendor of a Crown, which in the
next Protestant Successor is to shine forth with greater luster.</hi> But how will
you assure us that the people, after they have been once possest of such a
glorious Power, will ever give it back again? Indeed I doubt it: for we
have not seen the <hi>English</hi> men so willing to part with any of their <hi>Magna
Charta,</hi> or the least of their Priviledges: No, I am rather afraid it will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give them the itch of taking the Name as well as Power upon them;
and I believe 'tis the only expedient to subvert this glorious Monarchy into
a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>But to give us hopes that we may have a very good and merciful <hi>Popish</hi>
King, that will neither <hi>remember Petitions, Protestings, nor Association Votes,</hi>
he refers us to the consideration of his Royal Brothers Clemency, which
indeed has been so great, that ingratitude it self cannot but acknowledg it;
but all this while he was a Protestant Prince, and therefore that can be no
Argument to make us think a Papist King will be as gracious: for were
his Nature an Original of Mercy, he could not be the man he would be,
without the forfeiture both of his Conscience, Religion, and his Kingdoms:
for if an <hi>Emperor</hi> or a <hi>King</hi> (says <hi>Parsons) shows any favour to an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
for that he loseth his Kingdom,</hi> Philopat. p. 109. <hi>Becanus,</hi> another of
their Authors, says, <hi>If that Kings and Princes are negligent in rooting out of
Hereticks, they are to be excommunicated and deposed by the Pope,</hi> Controv.
Anglican. p. 131. 132. And when the Papists tell us how many Virtues he
is Master of, and amongst the rest how noble and how strong his friendship
is, then granting the truth of this, his opposers has more reason to dread his
Power: for 'tis a known Maxim, <hi>The greatest and truest friend, the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
and revengeful Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for those Acts of Parliament which we find ordering and disposing of
the Succession, they make</hi> (says he) <hi>very little for the purpose for which they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99784:6"/>
were produced.</hi> Yes, they prove that the <hi>Succession</hi> has been given by Act
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> thought fit; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those reasons they afterwards thought more weighty, the Gift has
been recalled, and they have placed a Right elsewhere; and who shall
dare to say these <hi>Acts,</hi> or any made by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> are unjust?
Indeed the King without his People, or the People without their King, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alter the Succession, but with a joynt consent: Those Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
declare it has and may be done again; and certainly there never
was a Cause that did require the changing of the Succession half so much
as we have now.</p>
               <p>But he is drawn to an end; and I thought nothing could have been more
audacious than his Answer is throughout, in notorious Accusations of
all our Great and Honourable Parliaments; but the dedicating his Libel
to those very men with the same hand he writ it of them, is a boldness that
certainly has no president, but is an Original of Impudence.</p>

               <head>A
REPLY
TO
Roger L' Estranges
PAMPHLET.</head>
               <p>WELL, but now for our Second Masquerade, who Begins
just like his Brother, and carries on the Argument of
Forty one throughout every Paragraph of his whole
Pamphlet, to answer all that can be said against <hi>Popery</hi>
with that. He tells us:</p>
               <p>The Character of a Popish Successor were an excellent piece in the kind, if it
had not too much Sublimate in it. The truth of it is, <hi>says he,</hi> the Author has
made the figure of his Successor too frightful, and too enormous; and then he
finishes his Master-piece with a paradox, by the supposal of a most excellent
Prince, and yet making him the greater Devil for his Virtues.</p>
               <p>I cannot suppose it any Paradox, to say the intoxication of <hi>Romish</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and that Religious frenzy in the brains of Majesty, will pervert all
his Natural Virtues, and make him imagine he does his God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
good service, and think he improves his Talent sevenfold, when he puts
the severest <hi>Roman</hi> Laws in force against us, which is no less than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of our Estates, next the loss of our Liberties, and our Lives in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short time after. Nor are we to suffer any death more merciful than
burning alive, which is the Popes own Law, in these words, <hi>Decerminus ut
viva in conspectu hominum Comberatum (De Hereticis. 7 Decretat. sect. in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutilem).</hi>
Nay, his obeying his Superior Ecclesiastick Power in executing
these Laws, shall be so far from making him or any other <hi>Papist</hi> else, think
him the <hi>greater Devil,</hi> as he says, that on the other side the Pope, and all
of that Church, will tell him he has improved all his Virtues to that height,
that he deserves to be a Saint; has merited that Heaven which they will
give him.</p>
               <p>But before I go any further, <hi>says he,</hi> let me recommend to the <hi>Reader</hi> one
Remark, as a thing worthy his attention, That he cuts all the way upon the
Successor, as presupposing him to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> and consequently dangerous and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99784:8"/>
insufferable by reason of that perswasion; and very magisterially gives his own
bare word for the dangers of that perswasion: why does he not rather tell us in
particular terms, These and these are the principles, and then make his inference
from those principles, to the dangers that attend them.</p>
               <p>I thought both the Principles of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and the dangers that
attend them, had been too well experienced in <hi>England,</hi> as well as other
places, not to be known to the most Vulgar person in it: for what was <hi>Q.
Maries</hi> Tyranny, but an impulse of Conscience derived from those <hi>Popish</hi>
Principles that told her that all Hereticks are all notorious Traytors, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
against God himself, and therefore guilty of the highest High Treason,
which they call <hi>Crimen Laesae Majestatis Divina,</hi> and therefore they deserve
that worse penalties should be inflicted for that, than other High Treason?
And it is besides enacted by a General Decree, That whatsoever King, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
or Nobleman, shall believe that the Decrees of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops
may be, or shall suffer them to be violated in any thing, be accursed, and
shall remain for ever guilty before God, as a betrayer of the Catholick
Faith, <hi>Caus. 25. 91. cap.</hi> 11. and therefore considering all this, we cannot
with reason think that such barbarous Cruelty could be the delight of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
soft and tender hearted woman, or that Majesty could be so perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
so ungrateful, and so dishonourable for little or no advantage; but
she was a servant of the Church and Pope, and durst not incur his curse,
that was to open her the Gates of Paradice; and 'tis impossible for any
<hi>Papist</hi> to have such a Soveraign Power as hers, and not to be the same Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that she was.</p>
               <p>Now in Answer to a paragraph which his Brother, the wiser of the two,
skipt over, concerning the barbarity of the known Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, <hi>that pronounces damnation to all that differ from it in any one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of faith,</hi> and to justifie his Masters and his Religion from such a terrible
Accusation, <hi>as tearing up his Fathers Sacred Monument, branding his blessed
memory with the name of Heretick; and the compleating the horrid Anathema,
of most impiously execrating the very Majesty that gave him being.</hi> He says the
<hi>Characterizer</hi> lays down a false supposition, and then raises out of it a most
uncharitahle consequence; for the very position, That there is no salvation
out of that Church, is yet qualified with an exception, In case of an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
perswasion. I think that case was plain in that Royal Martyr, who
sealed the invinsible perswasion of the <hi>Protestant Faith</hi> with his blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And next he says,</hi> If this be so lewd a principle in one Religion, why is it
not so in another? Which being admitted, involves every individual member of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the same condemnation. <hi>So that he says, in asserting
this Doctrine</hi> the <hi>Characterizer</hi> himself damns all the Papists, as well as he
makes them damn all the Protestants.</p>
               <p>Now as I never thought the <hi>Protestants</hi> in a more likely state of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the <hi>Papists</hi> saying or believing so; so I always thought it was the
proof of Crimes, and not the accusation; that must condemn all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so just a Judg as God Almighty; and there are such proofs of that
Hellish Doctrine, that it bears witness against it self: for 'tis not the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99784:8"/>
knowing and judging their principles, but their believing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them, damns the <hi>Papists;</hi> but he is a <hi>Protestant</hi> that holds the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Tenents as good as those of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and is of whether
for a peny: so that 'tis possible he may believe a man deserves to be hanged
as much for being accused of burning a House, or killing a man, and think
him as guilty, as if he were taken in the fact: nay, with him a <hi>Protestant</hi>
shall as justly deserve to be damn'd for saying this is a <hi>Popish</hi> Tenent which
they themselves declare to be so, as those <hi>Papists</hi> that believe it; and we
must have a special care of saying they do any thing ill, lest we contribute
more to their damning than they themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now let us see what this pretended</hi> Protestant <hi>Champion</hi> Mr. Le
Strange <hi>says to an Oath of a</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>Prince.</hi> Take that for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
once, that there is no trusting to their Oaths, and you cut all the ligaments of
Society and Commerce; there is an end of all Treaties and Alliunces, amicable
and mutual Offices betwixt Christian Princes and States; nay <hi>(says he)</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
but that Maxim, and you turn all <hi>Europe</hi> into a Shambles, and put Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
into a state of War; for where there is no trust, there is no security.</p>
               <p>Well I allow all this, that these Politick Reasons of State may oblige
<hi>Papist</hi> Princes to keep their Oaths with Foreign Princes, nay with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
when they shall break them with their own subjects, to usurp an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power in their own Kingdoms, and to establish their own Religion
amongst their own people, where they can never be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Character</hi> says, <hi>He has Religion to drive the Royal</hi> Jehu <hi>on; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that from the beginning of the world, through all ages, has set all Nations
in a flame, yet never confessed it self in the wrong.</hi> Mr. <hi>Le Strange</hi> says these
are strange words to come from the mouth of a pretender to scruples, and
a Protestant Advocate; his quarrel is not now so much to a Popish as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Successor. If he had said only the pretext of Religion, he might
have appealed to the clamours of his Brethren, or his own papers.</p>
               <p>Hold there, honest Mr. <hi>Towzer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> follow not the scent so close; 'tis his
Religion will drive the Royal <hi>Iehu</hi> on to our destruction; and I am sure
blind zeal as well as pretext, has at some time or another set almost all
Nations in a flame.</p>
               <p>He has told us, <hi>'Twas the pretended fear of</hi> Popery <hi>that brought a pious
and a Protestant Prince to the block.</hi> And tho' we all know this to be a sad
truth; yet that can be no Argument to us now, who have the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of evident Plots, and an <hi>Heir,</hi> an <hi>apparent Roman Catholick</hi> to bring in
<hi>Popery,</hi> and to establish Tyranny, if it shall ever be in his power; when
that was but a pretence against his Royal Father, which they made use of,
like those Rogues that went and pretended a Commission to search for
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and under that colour robbed a House;
and because they were Villains, and had none, must there be no further
search made after those Traytors. Must the Authority of all Constables be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99784:9"/>
denied in that case, because they came with a villanous cheat? And must
there be no Plot, no danger in a <hi>Popish Successor,</hi> nor no just fear of <hi>Popery</hi>
now, because for the late Rebellion they had only that pretence? But his
design is to divert our eyes from approaching Tyranny, by bidding us look
another way.</p>
               <p>And tho' I am no <hi>Papist</hi> in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> yet I must say this for that party
he calls so, notwithstanding all the Crimes he alledges against them, which
indeed tho' never so much deluded into, or set on by the <hi>Papists,</hi> will bear
no excuse; yet there is but that one president of horror against that party;
and we have no reason to suspect they would be at the same game again, for
being against a <hi>Popish Successor</hi>'s coming to the Crown; a Cause so much
concerns the Nation.</p>
               <p>To prove that Government was purely Divine, he tells us, <hi>It needs no
other support than the authority of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> By me Kings reign,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we call <hi>Kingly</hi> Government, he says was at first <hi>Paternal,</hi>
and after that <hi>Patriarchal;</hi> but to prove still that <hi>Kings</hi> were made for the
people by the consent of God himself upon the request of the children of
<hi>Israel,</hi> the Chain of Kingly Succession has been broken, and the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right invested in another, as we may see in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1. where <hi>Samuels</hi>
sons, as Judges of <hi>Israel,</hi> no doubt had as great a right of <hi>Kingly power,</hi> as
either <hi>Paternal</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Government; but they not walking in the
ways of their Father <hi>(c. 8. v. 3.)</hi> God Almighty to satisfie his troubled
complaining people, did grant the dispossessing these men of their lawful
Birthrights, and command the crowning of <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 8 22. a man so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from any pretence to that power, that he was of another Tribe;
and after <hi>Saul, David</hi> was anointed King, tho' <hi>Saul</hi> had many Sons living
at the same time; yet who dares to say, that <hi>Saul</hi>'s or <hi>David</hi>'s was an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation,
or an unjust Power? Now we see by this, that the succession of
<hi>Kingly</hi> Government has not been so sacred, but upon some occasions it has
been changed by Divine as well as lawful Authority; and from his own
Text of Scripture, <hi>I have made the man; the earth, and the beast that are upon
the ground, and by my outstretched arm have given it to whom it seemed meet
into me,</hi> Jer. 27. 5. there is as much a Divine Right for the unmolested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of five shillings <hi>per Annum</hi> by a subject, as for the inheritance of
three <hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the Expedient offer'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> in Parliament, in lieu of the
Exclusive Bill, where 'tis proposed that his Children shall wear his Crown;
shows plainly 'tis not malice against his person, nor <hi>Forty one,</hi> they aim
at; but the preservation of peace and safety in these Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>And we have great reason to thank God, and pray for a blessing on
those men that struggle most against a Religion which from the effects
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99784:9"/>
of its Bloody Principles we can produce so many Records of Tyranny
and Persecution.</p>
               <p>I have been told, That a Reply to the first Pamphlet would have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
Answer'd both that, and the <hi>Papist</hi> in Masquerade; there being so
little difference in the substance of their Arguments: However I think I
have particularly answered every material part of that, and Mr. <hi>Le Strange</hi>'s
too.</p>
