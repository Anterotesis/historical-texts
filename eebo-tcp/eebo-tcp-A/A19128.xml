            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:5290:5"/>
                  <hi>Milanor,</hi> who from his youth was so well instructed in good letters, and the Sciences liberall, as among the most learned Doctors he was reckned peerelesse, before he came to the age of eightéene yéeres. During this time of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, his Gouernors to make him perfect in all things beseeming so great a Prince, caused him to practise the managing of great Horsses, to vse the Tilt and Tourney, with all other-feates of agilitie incident to Armes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in right soone he grew so prompt and excellent, as all the Lords and Subiects of his Realme were not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed at his forwardnes, but thought themselues especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blessed, to liue vnder the regiment of so braue a King. Nor was this ioy alone to them, but many other nations and forreigne Princes did participate therein, especially the Kings of <hi>Scottes</hi> and <hi>Norgalles</hi> his neighbours, who hearing of the great bountie, prowesse, magnanimitie, and other lawdable vertues in this King, determined to be freends to him and his, holding this opinion, that beeing confederate with <hi>England</hi> in loue, no other King or Prince durst molest them with warres. Upon this consideration, they sent their Ambassadours to his Maiestie, to promise and sweare peace, amitie, and inuiolable concord, with obeysance, and acknowledging him their Superiour, where they were receiued honourably, and with content, a matter greatly auailing them afterward, as you shall perceiue by the following discourse of our Historie.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Portugall</hi> vnderstanding the manifold vertues, and power of King <hi>Milanor,</hi> as also that so many Kings and Princes desired his fréendly alliaunce, preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so well by his sundry Embassades, as the King of <hi>England</hi> married with his Sister named <hi>Selerina,</hi> faire in perfections, yong and gratious among all the Ladies in her time, and to continue holy loue betwéene this King and Queene, soone after she was conceyued with a goodly Sonne, at whose birth happened such a maruelous aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as no registred memorie records the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:5290:5"/>At what time the Quéene was in trauayle, suddenly was the Citie of <hi>London</hi> couered with a darke and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Clowde, the heauens deliuering such thunder and lightning, the earth likewise shaking and trembling so straungely, as the Citizens expected death euery moment, imagining the end of the world was come vpon them. For the space of two houres this wonderfull tempest endured, vntill the Quéene was deliuered of her burthen, when the Clowde began to vanish away, and the heauens looked fayre and cheerefull as before. After this despairing Storme, the people who with feare and terror of the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had hid themselues in vaultes and caues, amazed and fearefull, began to shew themselues: but when the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Kings Pallace came to open the windowes, they beheld in the great waste place before the Court, thrée Statues of Copper, each one about eight foote in height, and by each of them stoode a Collomne of blacke Marble, on the formost whereof, hanged a Shéeld of fine and pure Steele, right curiously engrauen and pollished, and enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with many pretious stones and iewelles: in bréefe, such was the workemanship and deuise thereof, as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sword, launce, or bullet from an Harquebuzo, could any way pierce or enter it. Aboue this Sheeld on the same piller, was engrauen these verses in faire gréene letters, whereto the Statue pointed with one of his fingers.</p>

                  <l>Pallas the wise Goddesse, whose skill thus framed me,</l>

               <p>The second Statue shewed on his Piller, the God of loue <hi>Cupid,</hi> being framed of massie Orientall Pearle, holding a golden bowe in his hand, and his arrowes in a Quiuer of golde by his side, vnder his féete on the Piller was engrauen these verses in Romane letters.</p>

                  <l>No one so stout or affable, can take me from this place,</l>
                  <l>Except in loyaltie of loue, all other he surpasse.</l>

This Image of <hi>Venus</hi> held in her left hand a flaming strebrand, and pointed with her right hand to the Crowne. Under her feete hung a Table, wherein was written two French verses, thus Englished.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>This Crowne is for the Ladie framd.</l>
                  <l>That chiefe in beautie shall be namd.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The two first Statues séemed like two fierce and strong Sauage men, each of them hauing a great fauchion hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Skarffes by their sides, and in such sort were they charmed, as whosoeuer made offer to take the Crowne, or touch the God of Loue, was immediatly assayled by one of the men, who would not giue ouer till he had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed him. Many Knightes of <hi>England,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, aduentured their fortunes at these Statues, but were still repulsed, vntill the Knight came that conquered these monstrous men, as héereafter in the Historie shall be declared.</p>
               <p>In like manner, at the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> the Ladyes profered to take away her Crowne, but the Statue stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, repelled them continually, so that they which once had assayed, durst meddle no more: wherefore, the Crowne remayned vnconquered, vntill the Lady came that surpassed all other in beawty, to whome the honor of the Crowne was vowed.</p>
               <p>After they had long beheld and considered this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so admirable, and vnable to coniecture the meaning thereof, diuers went to aduertise the King of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who was no lesse abashed héereat then the other were, especially the Queene, whose feare was not a litle, hearing the terrible thunder and tempest that happened, by which occasion she had more spéedie deliuerance then

was expected, and with greater ease, then commonly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue: yet was the child in such goodly shape, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his Father, as the Mother was highly pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, hoping this Infant would remaine an inuiolable league of loue betwéene the King and her, and the rather, the intelligence of this new spectacle animated her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>The King giuing little credite to this strange report, went in person with all the Princes and Lords of his Court to behold the same, and séeing that it was true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, confessing likewise the thing in strangenesse to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe the memorie of all former aduentures: he sent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for the most skilfull Philosophers in his Realm, who hauing learnedly considered thereof, assured the King, that at the instant appearing of those rare spectacles, a Child should be borne, that in bountie, prowesse and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, should exceede all the Knightes in the world: for whose renowne, a wise Nigromancer had appointed that occasion, that each curious eye might discerne his rare vertues, among all that should aduenture for the Shéeld and Trophe of <hi>Cupid.</hi> Nor can we iudge my Lord, sayd these wise men, that the same is reserued for any other, then your new borne Sonne, at whose houre of birth, the Statues appeared, or (at leaste) some other that shall issue from him: for our iudgemente in his Astracisme doth perswade vs, that he shall be valiant and renowmed in feates of Armes, and in loyaltie was neuer man found his second.</p>
               <p>As for the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> that beareth the rich Crowne, we gesse (my Lord) it is meant to some Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you shall haue héereafter, who in beautie and gratious nature, shall excéede all of her time. If it like your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, to make experience of what we haue sayd, you must send for all the fairest Ladies in your Realme, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to trie their vertue, in taking the Crowne from the head of the Image, in which attempt, you shall receiue
<pb facs="tcp:5290:7"/>
occasion of excéeding pleasure: for the brazen statue which you behold standing by it, will repulse the Ladies in such sort, as they shall repent their bold aduenture.</p>
               <p>The King very ioyfull to heare these newes, said: By the faith of a Prince, I will cause proofe to be made héereof within these few dayes, and first, the Ladies of our Citie of <hi>London</hi> shall begin, if they can not speede in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the Ladies through our Realme shall be aduertised thereof, as also they of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Norgalles,</hi> which haue commendation beyond other Nations for beautie. In the meane while I will go conferre with the Quéene héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who (as I thinke) will not be a little glad, to heare that such good fortune is reserued for our yong Sonne.

I know behoueth vs Madame (quoth he) to forethinke on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5290:7"/>
the Baptizing of our Sonne, who shall be his Sureties in that holy Sacrament, to which I can request no fitter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, then our freendly, breethren and neighbors, the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Norgalles,</hi> so please you Madame to ioyne with me in opinion. The Queene was so well contented with this motion, as Ambassadours were immediately dispatched, who so well executed the trust committed to their charge, as the Kings reputed themselues highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored by this request, and all things are now preparing for the Baptisme of this noble yong Prince. At the arriuall of these two Kings, great ioyes and triumphs were made by the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and as concerning their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Court, you must thinke it was according to their high estates, withall, that Englishmen are not to learne to welcome Strangers.</p>
               <p>When the day was come that the yong Prince should be Christened, as the King his Father had requested, he was named <hi>Palladine:</hi> and afterward, to honor the tune and the royall companie, there wanted no worthy deuises, with exquisite Chiualrie perfourmed both at the Tilt and Tourney, wherein the King of <hi>Scots</hi> bare great estimation, being a yong Prince, aged sixe and twenty yéeres, and one, that in Knightly exercises carried especiall account. Yet was not this ioy alone in the Court, but in <hi>London</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Citizens shewed the like, where the Conduits ranne diuers sorts of Wines, the Stréetes were stored with Tables before the dores, and all kinde of good chéere placed thereon, with such ringing of Belles, and making Bone-fiers, as neuer was the like seene before that time. It were too long a matter to rehearse, what braue Theatres were erected, and therein presented most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Comedies, with Maskes, Mommeries, and all kinde of delightfull inuentions, during the time of this Feast, which continued fifteene dayes together. It shall suffise me to tell yee, how the King <hi>Milanor</hi> hearing that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Norgalles</hi> would now returne home againe,
<pb facs="tcp:5290:8"/>
was desirous to haue the aduenture tried of the thrée Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues before they went, and therefore caused to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by sounde of Trompet, through all the streetes in <hi>London,</hi> that all Knights and Gentlemen should on the morrow come to the Pallace, to aduenture their fortune for the rich Sheeld, and the God <hi>Cupid,</hi> so that if any one could take them from the Statues, with right good will they should enioy them. The like protestation was made of the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the rich Crowne, which was destenied to the most accomplished Lady in beautie, the fame whereof, called faire beauties darlings to the Court on heapes, each one thinking to beare away the Crowne, by the benefite of her amiable lookes. Wherefore, the place and houre being appointed, God knowes how they labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to augment their naturall beautie by arteficiall meanes, as oyntments, distilled waters, perfumes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like extraordinarie matters, which many Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (who haue any naturall imperfection) at this day vse to make them seeme more amiable.</p>
               <p>But now is the day come to make triall of the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when the King <hi>Milanor,</hi> with the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and all the Ladies of the Court, went to the voyde place before the Pallace, and there on a faire Skaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde couered with rich Tapistrie, sate downe to take view of the valiant Knightes, who durst presume to take the Sheeld from the Piller. No sooner were they placed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemed their estates, but twelue English Knightes, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of greatest courage and valour in the Countrey, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselues (well armed) to trie their fortune.</p>
               <p>After they had done reuerence to the Kings and Estates present, he that imagined himselfe of highest resolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, stept vp on foure of the staires before the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, thinking to reach the Shéeld that hung thereon, but the enchaunted Image drawing his fauchion, with such furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous strokes repulsed him downe againe, as he durst not presume to meddle any more, to the no little maruaile of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5290:8"/>
the King and his companie, who were not wont to behold such vncouth spectacles.</p>
               <p>Next, came a gallant yong Knight, well prouided with a Romaine Target, and a short arming Sword, and with maruellous valour, he ranne vp the steps before the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomne, and attained to the highest step of all, but he went downe againe sooner then he expected, for the Image threw him so violently backe againe, as he tumbled headlong downe the staires to the ground. Like fortune fell to the rest of the twelue, some shewing greater magnanimitie in fight then other did, yet their foile was alike, and this Shéeld of honor could not be wonne by any of them.</p>
               <p>Then came the Quéene to the Skaffold, where the Kings sate, and vnderstanding how the Knightes had sped in this first Aduenture, she sayd. Straunge is it (my good Lords) that no one of our Knightes can preuaile, let the Gentlemen prooue the aduenture of the second Statue, whereon the God of loue sheweth himselfe, which must be conquered by none (as I heare) but by the most loyall Knight in the world, by this meane shall we know them that haue best deserued toward their Ladies, and who excéedeth all other in constancie, Madame, aunswered the King <hi>Milanor,</hi> we thinke your councell verie necessarie, for long will this Sheeld hang heere, if no other Knightes then of our Realme come to trie their fortune: such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as hold best opinion of their owne loialtie, make triall of your vertue at the God of Loue, and frée libertie we graunt to all straunge Knightes, as to them of our Realme, which our Heralds shall signifie for their better assurance.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Herald had publikely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his charge, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all the Knightes to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme themselues, for loyaltie (quoth he) is not to be discouered by armes, but by the hidden vertue &amp; thought, consisting in the hart of a man. My Lord, sayd the Quéene, had you not assured me to whome this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is reserued, I would haue intreated your Maiestie to make the first triall. Then Madame, quoth the King, you haue some suspition of my loyaltie. Not so my Lord, sayd she, for nothing is lesse in my thought, and so certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion do I hold thereof, as I feare not that all present should behold your vertue, to the greater enlarging of your honor and mine owne.</p>
               <p>While these spéeches passed, a yong English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came to mount the steps, that enuironed the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomne whereon the God of Loue stoode, but as he lifted his foote to the nethermost step, the Statue tumbled him backe, with his héeles vpward, so that euery one laughed hartely thereat. In sooth my fréend, said the King, verie little loyaltie remaines in you, whome loue cannot abyde the sight of, if your Lady be in this company, good occasion hath she to get her a better seruant.</p>
               <p>Then came another, who had many times inuocated on the name and fauour of his Mistresse, and he without
<pb facs="tcp:5290:9"/>
any impeachment mounted on the third step, making an offer to attaine the fourth, but the Statue thrust him downe againe, whereby he might perceiue his owne insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, Beleeue me, quoth the Quéene, he hath done much better than the other, and the Lady he loueth, is greatly beholding to him, for iustly may he be accounted loyall, in that the Image suffered him to ascend so high.</p>
               <p>Then one of the King of <hi>Norgalles</hi> Knightes came to trie his fortune, whome the Statue repulsed with such shame, as all the day after he would not be séene, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise ye Gentleman, said the King his maister, you might haue spared the labour in comming so farre, to returne home with so foule a rebuke, and little néede had ye to shew vs your great inconstancie, brother quoth the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> be not offended with him, for well he knowes, that his Mistresse is not in this companie. You say true bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aunswered the King of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> but if I knew her, I would aduertise her of his exceeding vertue.</p>
               <p>Héere commes another of my Knightes to make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofe, and yet perhaps, will amend his fellowes disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. The Knight attained the highest step, without any disturbance, and as he lifted his hand to take the Image of <hi>Cupid,</hi> the Statue tooke him by the arme, and set him on the ground againe, I see then, said the King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galles,</hi> each one must heere be iudged according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and defect of his loyaltie.</p>
               <p>Afterward came a little Scottishman, as thicke as tall, his beard growing scattering like bristles, his nose flat to his face, two teeth standing before gagd out of his mouth, a man in euery part very much mishapen, and seruing as a Iester to make the King laugh, he had married a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as handsome as himselfe, yet was he iealous of her out of all measure. This proper Squire séeing so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed by the Statue, by breach of their loyaltie to their Wiues and Ladies, considered with himselfe, that he had neuer violated the bonds of marriage, but euermore kept
<pb facs="tcp:5290:10"/>
his faith to his wife, therefore he would hazard his good hap, not doubting but to carie the Image of <hi>Cupid</hi> with him into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Hauing demaunded leaue of the King his Maister, with a little cudgell in his hand, he came to the Collomne, and went vp to the verie highest step, the Statue not offering any signe of resistance: but as this deformed fellow would haue embraced the Image of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> the Statue snatched the cudgell out of his hand, and so rapt him therewith about the shoulders, as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to hye him downe againe, the Kings and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent merily laughing at this iest. Alas poore foole, said the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> how durst thou presume to shew thy selfe in this action? Why my Lord, aunswered the Queene, your little man is yet found the most loyall, and no Gentleman this day hath witnessed the like. Beléeue me Madame, aunswered the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> it is against his will that he is so loyall, for being so euill fauoured and deformed, how can he finde any woman to offend with him. Come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little fellow said the King <hi>Milanor,</hi> you haue beene beaten with your owne cudgell, because ye came no better prouided: but that the honor of the day may remaine to you, I will that at this present no further triall shall bée made, enough hath beene done my men, let now the Ladyes by their beautie aduenture for the rich Crowne of <hi>Venus,</hi> and let it suffise that a little fellow hath strained all our Knightes. The Quéene in person began the enterprise, but reiected as vnworthy of the fatall Crowne, and after her followed the Ladies of the Court, whose fortunes were like or worsse in effect, to their no little disgrace in their owne conceites, who prized their beauties at the highest rate. The <hi>London</hi> Danies had likewise their time of proofe, yet could their daintie faces carie no pawne in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, for the Crowne was reserued for the onely Lady, who might not be paragonned by any other whatsoeuer.</p>

Then they withdrew themselues, giuing place to twelue other, who Combatted with the Pyke, arming Sword and Battle-Axe, and thus was the night consumed in such disports, to delight the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Norgalles,</hi> who in the morning tooke their leaue of the King and Quéene, and were conducted on their iourney by many English Lords.

               <p>This yong Prince thus giuen to all honest and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quallities, began to haue some feeling of his high and magnanimous spirit, so that to experiment and trie his owne strength, he would cope with diuers yong Lords &amp; Gentlemen of his age, to runne in the Listes, to breake Launces, to Combate with the Mace, the Arming-sword, and all other weapons, both on horssebacke, and on foote.

               <p>The Duke hearing his Sonne in these tearmes, was well pleased to behold him of so good a mind, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted likewise to graunt what he demaunded, saying. In sooth my Sonne, seeing <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are now in peace together, the lesse do I doubt of thy going thither, and boldly mayst thou assure him, that he hath a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fréend of me, determine then to depart when thou wilt, foorthwith shall I giue order for thy prouision in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: but returne not till thou hast tried the aduenture so renowmed, which hapned before the Kings Pallace on the day of his Sonnes birth, and if thy good fortune may bring it to an end, well mayst thou intreate the King for thy Order, in that thou shalt well deserue thy Knighthood, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many haue fayled in triall thereof. <hi>Manteleo</hi> hauing humbly thanked the Duke his Father, for graunting him the thing he onely desired, said. I promise you my Lord, that I will not returne thence without proofe of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, albeit I were sure to be repulsed more sharply then any hath béene heeretofore: yet since the aduenture is so ordeyned, let me dye ere I be dishonored with feare or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maying. Héereupon, the Duke called the maister of his Horsse, to whome he gaue charge to prouide his Sonnes estate toward <hi>England,</hi> and that all things might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for his departure within thrée daies following: which was accordingly perfourmed, and so the Prince <hi>Manteleo</hi> with his trayne set forward from <hi>Millaine,</hi> in the wéeke next after Pentecost, making such expedition in trauaile, as hauing passed the fairest Cities in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5290:12"/>
was desirous to see, he came to <hi>Bullin,</hi> where he tooke ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and with a merry gale of winde, in lesse then eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene houres, he landed in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King <hi>Milanor</hi> aduertised of his arriuall, was greatly contented therewith, commaunding in all the Townes where-through he should passe, that he should be receyued and intreated honorably. And when he drew néere <hi>London,</hi> the Gouernours were charged to méete him on the way, the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> likewise to welcome him at the Citie gates, and the King with his Quéene and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, remained at the Pallace to entertaine him. Euerie thing thus perfourmed in greatest maiestie, the Prince of <hi>Millaine</hi> was receiued with generall ioy of the Citizens, and the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> accompanied with many great Lords of <hi>England,</hi> to whome <hi>Manteleo</hi> behaued himselfe with honorable modestie, as well he could his Courtship in those affayres, and riding along with the English Prince, he entred into these speeches.</p>
               <p>The fame of so many lawdable vertues, accompanyed with heroicall prowesse and magnanimitie, which amply are discerned in your dayly cogitations, hath earnestly prouoked me (good Prince) to be aquainted with you, for which onely occasion, I left my natiue Countrey, to see this Realme, euery where named happie, by the honorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the King your Father, whose vertues you imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate so effectually, as you remaine a wonder to them that neuer saw you. And long may good successe attend your dayly actions, heauen making me so fortunate, to winne acceptance in your eyes, in that I haue deuoted my selfe to estéeme of you aboue all other.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Manteleo,</hi> answered the Prince <hi>Palladine,</hi> as I knowe my selfe farre vnworthie these titles of prayse, so am I perswaded, that your speeches proceed of good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards me, flying reports are oftentimes found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true: yet do not I mislike your opinion of me, which hath sorted out the meane to sée and knowe you in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb facs="tcp:5290:13"/>
as our honorable and well wishing fréend. Of the King my Father haue I heard of your parents, and good acquaintance hath he had with the Duke your Father, when as a Knight errant he sought after aduentures: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your selfe therefore right welcome hither, and gladly shall I accept of you as my freend and companion. Thus beguiled they the time, til they came to the Pallace, where the Prince of <hi>Millaine</hi> stayed to behold the Statues, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the deuises he had so long desired to see, whereat, not able to maruaile sufficiently, they went on into the great Hall, where the King embraced him verie louingly, the Princes and Lords likewise present, entertained him with excéeding kindnesse and humanitie, in that they had heard the King many times report, the worthie chiualrie of the Duke of <hi>Millaine</hi> his Father.</p>
               <p>After the King had welcomed this stranger with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfold courtesies, and had vnderstood the cause of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his Court, he sent him with the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> to salute the Quéene and her Daughters. But loue, whose puissance as yet he had neuer felt, finding time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie so conuenient, when <hi>Manteleo</hi> had done his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Queene, comming to the Princesses that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on her, hauing kissed the first, named <hi>Marcelina:</hi> he found his sences so strangely inueigled, as he stoode silent before her a prettie while, being not able to deliuer one word, so was he rauished with contemplation of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Which the Princesse well noting, and imagining this passion to procéede by bashfulnesse, or feare, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preuents yong Gentlemen when they enter the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of great Ladies, she tooke the Prince by the hand, and thus began.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you are so welcome, as your owne hart can wish, great hath béene your payne and trauayle, comming so farre to see this Court, no sufficient recompence can the King our Father make yée, nor we poore Ladies, for this excéeding kindnesse. These words forcing <hi>Manteleo</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5290:13"/>
his spirits, caused him returne this aunswere.</p>
               <p>In comming hither (swéete Madame) haue I sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no paine or trauaile, but rather comfort, pleasure, and pastime. For long since is it, that I desired to offer my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the King your Father, as well for the rare vertues which makes him farre renowmed, as also to renew the auncient amitie, that yée and the Duke my Father haue had together, when they as Knightes errant trauayled straunge Countreys. Another and chéefe cause, was to see my Lord your Brother, whose second in prowesse is not to be found: and you likewise faire Ladies, whome heauen hath not onely enriched with especiall vertues, but also with rare and most perfect beautie. And though my Starres alotted me no greater good héereby, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the surpassing worke of nature in you both, yet would I repute my trauaile more largely requited, then were I created Emperour of the world, adioyning héere to, if any seruice remayned in me that might be to your liking.</p>
               <p>During these spéeches, he threw many piercing lookes on the Princesse <hi>Marcelina,</hi> and she returned the like on him, thinking she had neuer seene a more comely Knight in all perfections, her Brother <hi>Palladine</hi> excepted, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by his lookes and yéelding countenance, that she had wonne some earnest in his loue: with which imagination, her hart was highly contented, and to continue him in this good affection, she thus replyed.</p>
               <p>Not a little doo I think my selfe beholding to you, my good Lord, noting your forward zeale to the King my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seruice: loth am I to presse yée with such regard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, in that my deseruings are altogether too simple, let my good will then excuse my want, assuring your selfe of a maydens prayers wheresoeuer you go.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Manteleo</hi> would haue aunswered, the Prince <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi> came, and thus brake off their talke. I beséech yée my Lord and companion, to withdraw your selfe into your Chamber, there to repose your selfe after your iourney, for
<pb facs="tcp:5290:14"/>
of necessitie you must be sore wearied, hauing spent so little time betwéene <hi>Millaine</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Manteleo</hi> departed to his Chamber with <hi>Palladine,</hi> and in two lodgings ioyning together lay these new fréends. There did the <hi>Millayne</hi> Prince cloath himselfe in braue and sumptuous garments, not forgetting the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Continuing in this determination, thence forward her extreame desires made her pensiue and solitarie, yet would she not impart her disease to any one, because she would first make triall of the Princes constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, least his loue might be impeached with dissembling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now is the houre of Supper come, when the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince <hi>Manteleo</hi> was placed at the table, right ouer against his beloued <hi>Marcelina,</hi> neither of them being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this good hap, but vsing the same as an especiall benefite, with secret glaunces to court each other. Which the Princesse <hi>Floraea</hi> dilligently marked, and seeing her Sister so often to chaunge her couller, coupling therewith many bitten in sighes, she tofore hauing neuer shewed the like: became iealous of the matter, thinking the Prince should as soone affect her as her Sister, yet made she no outward shew of this conceite. But when the Tables were withdrawne, and each one preparing themselues to daunce, <hi>Manteleo</hi> tooke his Lady <hi>Marcelina,</hi> without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any offer to <hi>Floraea,</hi> wherewith she became so <hi>mal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> as to despight them, she would euery day after sit so néere them, as they could not speake one word to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but she might easily vnderstand what they said.</p>
               <p>The Prince well noting how hee was crost, would the oftner entertaine <hi>Marcelina</hi> to Daunce, taking the

benefite at the end of each Measure, which gaue them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to conferre together, no one in those excused times being able to impeach them, whereat <hi>Floraea</hi> greatly repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, séeing them talke with such affectionate protestations.</p>
               <p>The Pastimes ended, the King and Queene went to their lodgings, <hi>Manteleo</hi> humbly giuing them the good night, not forgetting the Saint he serued in desires, and afterward the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> accompanied him to his Chamber, where after many other spéeches betwéene them, they concluded on the morrow to request their Knighthood of the King. So <hi>Palladine</hi> left <hi>Manteleo</hi> for that night, whose mind was busied with his Ladies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable words, not doubting but to shew himselfe so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Armes, as the Princesse should receiue good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to affect him, and graunt him the honor he earnestly desired. In this good hope he laid him downe to rest, the Princesse <hi>Marcelina</hi> nothing inferiour to him in amorous opinions, and that night her brother <hi>Palladine</hi> had told her, that <hi>Manteleo</hi> and he would intreate their Order of the King, wherewith she was not alittle contented, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining thence forward, to entertaine the Prince of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi> as her Knight.</p>

Then went they to salute the King, and intreated his Highnesse to graunt them their Knighthood. When his Maiestie perceiuing their forwardnesse, and noting the earnest desire of <hi>Manteleo,</hi> thus aunswered.</p>
               <p>Loth am I to denie your request, albeit as yet you are ouer-yong, but the good opinion I haue of your prowesse, and fortunate successe that may befall ye héereafter: doth supply your want of yeeres, wherefore, this night per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme the holy watch, and to morrow will I giue ye your Order. The two Princes humbly thanking his Maiestie, went to giue order for their Armour and furniture, and at night they entred the Chappell, where spending the time in the accustomed religious exercise, they expect the houre of their long desired honor.</p>
               <p>In the morning, the King with his Nobilitie entred the Chappell, and as he was busied in the Ceremonies vsed in such affaires, there entred two Damosels verie brauely apparelled, each of them hauing a goodly Sword in her hand, and with them was an armed Knight: then one of the Damosels comming before the King, vpon her knee deliuered these spéeches.</p>
               <p>Mightie and renowmed King, excelling in vertue all Princes liuing, vnderstand, that this Knight my Brother, is enchaunted by a wicked Sorcerer, for not graunting to accomplish his carnall desire, so that since the time of his refusall, he hath not conuersed with any woman in the world, not with his owne Wife héere present, but hateth all Women to the death, to the no little greefe of me and my faire Sister, séeing her selfe so despised of her husband, without giuing any occasion of offence. Any many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys haue we trauailed, to finde the man or woman that can end this enchauntment, yet hetherto haue we lost all our labour. But true it is, that as we passed through the lesser <hi>Aegipt,</hi> we happened to meete with an auncient
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5290:15"/>
Lady, who gaue vs these two Swords, which (as she said) cannot be drawne by any, but by two Knightes, the most valiant and loyall of their tune. These worthie men shall vncharme this Knight, and to them belong these Swords, being the best that euer were framed, and their names that shall draw these Swords out of their scabbards, are engrauen on the weapons, yet not to be seene till they be drawne. Wherefore right mightie King, we humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, that this sad aduenture may be tried by your Knightes, for very often haue we heard, that this Court is stored with men of greatest vertue.</p>
               <p>If the King and all present, were amazed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Damosels and the Knight, much more were they by hearing the reason of the enchantment.</p>
               <p>In sooth, said that Quéene, I cannot but pittie the poore Gentleman, that for the carefull regard of his loyaltie, he should receiue so great discourtesie. Doubtlesse, quoth the King, he was a cruell villaine that enchaunted him on this occasion, and were he heere, either would I cause him to end the enchauntment himselfe, or recompence him with his iust desarts. As for you Lady that are Sister to this Knight, right gladly do I graunt what you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested, and neuer could you haue come in better time, for the greatest part of the Knightes in our Realme are heere at our Court, besides, diuers other am I presently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due with the Order, which being done, they shall all trie their fortune in this aduenture. Heerevpon, the newe Knightes were immediatly dubbed, and each after other laboured to pull foorth the enchaunted Swords, which they could not stirre the length of halfe a foote, except <hi>Orli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Durandell</hi> of <hi>Cieue,</hi> who drew them wel-neere to the middest.</p>
               <p>The new Knightes <hi>Palladine</hi> and <hi>Manteleo,</hi> séeing no one could altogether vnsheath them, tooke the Swords to trie what they were able to do, and they drew them foorth so easily as they had beene their owne weapons, each one

He taking the ring with exceeding reuerence, thus aunswered.</p>
               <p>Sweete Madame, most humbly doo I thanke ye for this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5290:17"/>
fauour, which I will kéepe as mine owne life. And néedlesse is it for you to giue me any thing, whereby I might the better remember ye, for so liuely is your diuine figure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my hart, that no fortune, how good or bad so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can haue power to blemish or deface. As she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to aunswere, the King started from his chaire, and comming to the Prince <hi>Manteleo,</hi> sayd, Better leysure to daunce shall we haue after supper, let vs now go see our yong Knightes in the Listes, to trie if since their order was giuen, their strength is impaired or increased.</p>
               <p>Then ceassed the instruments and the dauncing, the Knightes going all to arme themselues, each one verie ioyfull of this occasion, but especially the Prince <hi>Manteleo,</hi> for the great desire he had to be séene in the Ioust, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the aduenture of the Statues, fame would he trie his fortune there ere he entred the Listes, and mouing the King thereof, his Maiestie liked it very well, who with the Queene, and all the Courtly assistants, came to their wonted Scaffold, when the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> was the first that aduentured for the Shéeld, saying. I haue heard that such as laboured to win this Sheeld, haue beene verie sharply repulsed by this Statue, but I thinke it was through want of demaunding licence to take it, therefore will I reason with the kéeper thereof, to knowe if this Sheeld be destenied to me. So aduancing himselfe to the Statue, armed at all points verie brauely, he thus spake. Suffer me (faire Image) to take this Shéeld downe without the Combate, or if I may not haue it otherwise, determine to defend thy selfe. The Statue made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of a sauadge man, thus replied. I will not Combate with one so yong, and a Knight so vnexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as thou art, therefore I councell thée to go make proofe of thy bountie else where, then will I deale with thee in Combate, otherwise, neuer thinke to win this Sheeld. I see well said <hi>Palladine</hi> to <hi>Manteleo,</hi> that the end heereof is not reserued for me. Try (my Lord) if your fortune be
<pb facs="tcp:5290:18"/>
any better then mine. Héerevpon, <hi>Manteleo</hi> mounted the steps, thinking to go take downe the Sheeld, but the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thrust his hand before it, saying. Nor is it (as yet) for thée, that thou shouldest attempt to take this Sheeld, it behoues thee to be much more exercised in armes, and therefore content thy selfe. Good reason haue I to thinke, said <hi>Manteleo,</hi> that I haue not as yet merited so high a guerdon, by reason of my insufficiencie in martiall affaires, therefore I will presume no further: but in the aduenture of <hi>Cupid</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> predestinated to the most loyall, after you Sir <hi>Palladine</hi> will I hazard my selfe.</p>
               <p>By my faith, quoth the Prince, I will not meddle with him, for (as yet) I haue nothing to do with the God of Loue, nor know I what puissance he hath ouer humaine creatures, therefore will I stand foorth of his reach. The like may I say, quoth <hi>Manteleo,</hi> yet will I attempt to win his portrait: so giuing a piercing glaunce on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Marcelina,</hi> he drew his Sword, and with resolued as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance approched the Statue, who presently snatching his fauchion from his side, resisted him in such sort, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them was a long and doubtfull Combate, to the great admiration of the King and all present. Yet maugre the peasant strokes of the brazen Image, he attained to the highest step of all, each one then thinking that <hi>Cupid</hi> was his owne: but so weightie were the cruell charges of the Statue, as he was enforced to fall downe backward in a swoune, to the great greefe of the King, Queene, and <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine,</hi> but chéefely of <hi>Marcelina,</hi> who seeing his Armour broken in so many places, and the blood (as she thought) to issue from him so aboundantly, perswaded her selfe that he had yeelded vp his ghost. Ah gentle Prince, quoth she to her selfe, if thou be dead, I am the onely cause thereof, for well I know, that for my loue thou didst enterprise this aduenture, too deere hast thou bought thy comming into <hi>England</hi> and the earnest affection thou didst beare to me.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Marcelina</hi> continued these regrets, the Prince
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5290:18"/>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> with other Knightes recouered <hi>Manteleo,</hi> and vnarming him, perceiued he was not wounded at all, but weary and ouer-trauailed, with so long resisting the cruell blowes of the Image, whereon could none of the Princes strokes be discerned, though the clanching of his weapon made a wonderfull noise. <hi>Manteleo</hi> finding himselfe fresh and lustie, would haue returned againe to the Statue, but the King stayed him with these words.</p>
               <p>Me thinks (my Lord) you haue done inough alreadie, let others now haue time for their triall. At which spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the other Knightes followed as their turnes came, each one being as roughly handled as the Prince <hi>Mante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo:</hi> who gréeued that he had not ended the aduenture, thinking that <hi>Marcelina</hi> would withdraw her affection, reputing him vnworthie her loue, that could deliuer no better proofe of his loyaltie. And in truth at the first she was iealous thereof, but in the end she perswaded her self, that such a hidden vertue could not be discerned in a man, vntill he receiued the swéetes of loue by his Lady, which opinion made her zeale more vehement to the Prince.</p>
               <p>The King seeing the day was verie farre spent, referred the rest of the sports till the morrow, when <hi>Manteleo</hi> had good hope to recouer his honor in the Ioust, to the especiall good liking of his Lady and mistresse. So the King with his Lords returned to the Pallace, and the Knightes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnarmed themselues, came into the Chamber of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, where the Prince deuising with his faire Goddesse, with many perswasions excused his bad successe, which she could not but take in good part, considering that intire loue couers all occasions of dislike.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow is the day come, when the yong Knightes should shew themselues in open féeld, except the Prince <hi>Mante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo,</hi> who excused himselfe by riding on hunting, and therefore borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his freend <hi>Palladines</hi> hounds, left the Court, causing his horsse and armour to be secretly conuaide to a keepers Lodge, which was a mile and more from the Citie, because he would not haue any one knowe what he intended. Meane while the Ioustes began, the King maruelling at the absence of <hi>Manteleo,</hi> especially <hi>Palladin</hi> and faire <hi>Marcelina,</hi> who missing her freend at dinner, imagined he was gone without bidding her adiew, and the occasion thereof to be, because he had failed in the aduenture of <hi>Cupid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Champions comming into the féeld, the foremost were <hi>Mustiell</hi> of <hi>Rostock,</hi> and <hi>Brunifort</hi> his brother, on the other side came <hi>Durandell</hi> of <hi>Cleue,</hi> and <hi>Orliman</hi> of <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> with all their companie in séemely equipage. When the Heralds had commaunded the Knightes to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire, <hi>Mustiell</hi> and <hi>Durandell</hi> gaue the spurres to their horsses, and after they had broken thrée Launces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a peece with braue chiualrie, at the fourth encounter they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so furiously, as they were both cast foorth of their saddles to the ground. Next followed <hi>Brunifort</hi> and <hi>Orli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who dismounted each other at the first attaint, but <hi>Brunifort</hi> recouered his horsse againe quickly, when <hi>Sedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> Sonne to the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> bad him play, yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>Orliman</hi> in his misfortune. Heereupon, <hi>Grinday,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:5290:19"/>
sonne to the Duke of <hi>Orton,</hi> reuenged his fellowes wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such valour they shewed on either side, as the honor of the day was giuen to them, the King with all his Nobles being readie to depart: when suddenly entred the Lystes two strange Knightes in white Armour, resembling each other, the one bearing in his Sheeld thrée Griffons Sable volant, in a feeld Argent, the other, three Griffons Argent in a Sable feeld.</p>
               <p>After these Knightes had shewen many carires, and braue voltages with their horsses before the Ladies, one of them encountred <hi>Brunifort</hi> with such courage, as he was throwne to the ground with his heeles vpward: the like successe had <hi>Mustiell, Orliman,</hi> and the rest, to the no little admiration of the King and all the Ladies, and great vexation of <hi>Palladine,</hi> who would not Ioust, because his companion <hi>Manteleo</hi> was not there.</p>
               <p>As the King was about to depart, giuing the prize to these two strange Knightes, there entred the Lystes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Champion in white Armour, bearing in his Shéeld a Hart Guelles, bound with a golden chaine, and without making any reuerence, or shewing any brauadoes with his horsse, he met one of the strange Knightes so roughly, as he was sent to measure his length on the ground. The other strange Knight, to reuenge his fellowes iniurie, came cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously against this new-come Knight, and after the breach of two or thrée Launces, was sent to kéep his fréend companie, whereat not alittle enraged, he drew his Sword, and comming to the Knight, said. I confesse Sir, that thou hast the maistrie ouer me at the Launce, let me now try my fortune better or worsse in Combate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other willingly consented, but the King intercepted them, saying. Not so Gentlemen, I will not that any Combate shall now be fought, in respect the Ioust was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned for pleasure, and to exercise our Knightes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light their Ladies: enough therefore is done for this day, let anger ceasse betwéene yée, and fréendly embrace each

other, letting me vnderstand: of whence you are, that I may doo you the honor you haue deserued. With right good will my Lord, aunswered the vanquished Knight, my companion and I are freends with this Knight, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues great estimation for his worthie prowesse. As for our names, and of whence we are, I am called <hi>Landash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Norgalles:</hi> and my freend is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Simprinell,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the King <hi>Milanor,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> had knowledge of the Knightes, they came from the Scaffold, and embraced them with excéeding courtesie: but when they knew the Conquerour to be <hi>Manteleo,</hi> I leaue their maruellous ioy to your imaginations. Is it true my Lord? quoth the King, haue you stollen such an occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse your valour? Your Maiestie knowes, aunswered <hi>Manteleo,</hi> that I am but newly Knighted, and therefore but little experienced in Armes, nor durst I discouer my selfe before your Highnesse, least my fortune should haue prooued as contrary as it did yesterday, which you must imagine I tooke discontentedly. You néede not feare héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, said the King, to shew your selfe in chéefest places of Chiualrie, in that a beginning so good and fortunate, must néedes in continuance be as prosperous. Heereupon, the three Knightes verie louingly embraced each other, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a perpetuall league of amitie betweene them, which they religiously held irreuocable, as in the discourse of our historie you may behold.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:5290:21"/>
constrayneth vs héereto, nor would I for all the world breake my word: as for our returne, perswade yourselfe it will be sooner then you imagine. I assure yée thereof Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, sayd the Knight that was enchaunted, for I will not leade them farre from this Realme, nor into any place of danger. <hi>Manteleo</hi> had his heart so scaled vp with gréefe, beholding his mistresse to shed so many teares, as he was not able to speake one word, whereby <hi>Palladine</hi> presently gathered suspition, that secret loue betwéene them had caused this chaunge, wherefore, bidding his Sisters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diew, he departed the chamber with the Knight and the Damosels, leauing <hi>Manteleo</hi> to say what further hée would, but greefe brake him off with these spéeches. You knowe Madame what I haue promised, with which words, the teares trickling downe his cheekes, he kissed her, and the Princesse <hi>Floraea</hi> likewise, and so went to séeke <hi>Palladine,</hi> whome he found readie mounted with their Squires at the Court gate.</p>
               <p>So departed these two companions in armes with their trayne, with resolution before their returne, to make the world aquainted with their bountie and prowesse: chéefely <hi>Manteleo</hi> for the loue of his <hi>Marcelina,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after her Lords departure, withdrew her selfe alone into her Cabinet, and continuing her teares, breathed foorth these sad laments.</p>
               <p>Ah loue, who euer thought thy strength to be of such puissance, so violent hath thine entrance beene into my hart, as impossible is it for me to liue long, vnlesse my loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fréend giue me remedie, for none but he can giue me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Alas, why is it not permitted vs to trauaile straunge Countreys as well as men: had fortune so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured our sexe, thou shouldst not (swéete fréend) be long without me, but miserable is our condition to be thus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. Many other amorous complaints made the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull <hi>Marcelina,</hi> whom we will now leaue, and returne to the Princes, being scant a mile on their way: when <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi>

intreated the Knight that was enchaunted, to tell him whether they should trauaile, of whence he was, how, and wherefore he had béene enchaunted.</p>
               <p>My Lord, answered the Knight, right gladly would I satisfie your demaund, but hardly can I recount my infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes without extreame greefe, so greatly doth the verie remembrance thereof displease me: therefore I pray yee be contented that my Sister be the reporter heereof, for well can she reueale euery accident.

My Brother was there married to one of the most beautifull Ladies in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and dwelt in a small Uillage on the frontiers of the Realme, where a Gentleman (much about your yéeres) fell in aquaintance with him, the continuance whereof bred such amitie betwéene them, as my Brother intreated him to lodge in his house, and two of his neerest kinsemen with him. But in an vnhappie houre chaunced this fréend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, for this Gentleman too vncourteous for this great kindnesse, seeing my Brothers wife so perfect in beautie, became enamoured of her in such sort, as he onely desired the knowledge of her, forgetting the honor and regard of his fréendly hoste.

Now go and commend me to your Aunt, and to the two Knightes that shall draw the Swords, to whome I will that thou giue the order of Knighthood, to the ende their vertue, courage, and magnanimitie may be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

what remaineth, we must conduct ye into <hi>Hungaria,</hi> to the Castell where my faire Sister is enclosed, and where the villaine abideth that stole her from my Brother. Yet is her honor preserued from any attaint, for as the Traytor one day would haue rauished her, mine Aunt (of whome I spake) by aduenture came thither, and hauing throwne the paillard out of the chamber by the shoulders, enchaunted the same in such sort, as none may enter therein but my Brother, nor can he come there but by your ayde. A déede of such honor and charitie I hope you will not refuse, in reuenging our wrong on that maleuolent villaine, which shall be easie for you to doo, as the aforesaid wise prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse declared to vs. The Princes hauing heard this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous treason, thus aunswered. We will assist ye faire Lady to our vttermost, nor shall ye neede to whet vs on with perswasions, for we are bound by dutie to reuenge actions so soule and enorme. For this kinde replye, she gaue them many thanks, spending the time in these and like conferences, and two daies rode they without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture worthie the rehearsall.</p>

And the cause of our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thether, is to trie an aduenture of two Swords, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5290:23"/>
not long since were caried thither, vnable to be drawne by any, but by two of the best Knightes in the world.</p>
               <p>If you go for no other occasion, aunswered <hi>Palladine,</hi> well may ye spare that labour, for two yong Knightes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the aduenture two dayes since and more.</p>
               <p>Two yong Knightes? quoth another of them, of what Countrey I pray ye? The one, said <hi>Palladine,</hi> is an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman,</hi> and the other an <hi>Italian,</hi> borne in <hi>Millayne.</hi> By my faith, quoth the Knight in a great laughter, belike then the enchauntment was no hard matter to finish, nor was any hidden vertue to be discernd therein, when an <hi>Italian</hi> and an <hi>Englishman</hi> could bring it to ende. Uery fewe good Knightes are founde among the <hi>Italians,</hi> in whome is more ostentation and brauadoes, then matter of moment and effect: and in <hi>Englishmen</hi> is much lesse, being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all Countreys for men of little estimation.</p>
               <p>The two yong Princes hearing their Countreys so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praised, began to growe in maruailous choller, especially <hi>Mante<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eo,</hi> who bending the browes, and enflamed with vnquenchable anger, thus aunswered. Of whence are you Sir, that can so well collaude the Knightes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Italy?</hi> What mooues you to vse such spéeches, being in the Kingdome you discommend? Trust me, if you haue any wit, you make no shew thereof in your words. Be not angrie, aunswered the Knight, I see by your couller that you sweate in your Armour: but if ye continue this moode. you haue met with <hi>Spanyards</hi> that will walke ye a little. And heere haue you met an <hi>Englishman</hi> and an <hi>Italian</hi> sayd <hi>Manteleo,</hi> euen they that ended the aduenture of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted Swords, who presently will teach ye to temper your toong.</p>
               <p>With these words, he went to his Squire for his Launce, placing it to encounter him that gaue the spéeches, but <hi>Palladine</hi> called to him, saying: Forbeare my Lord, and let me deals with him, for I ought to begin first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the offence was first made to me. Beside, they are in
<pb facs="tcp:5290:24"/>
my Countrey, it belongeth then to me to correct their folly, making by proofe what an <hi>Englishman</hi> is able to doo. If you see me stand in néede of your helpe, doo as you shall finde occasion, otherwise, let me alone with these lusty <hi>Spanyards. Palladine</hi> without any further spéeches, with a braue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire encountred the prating companion, who, though he brake his Launce with good courage on the Prince, was throwne with such violence from his horsse, as he lay not able to stirre hand or foote. Which when the other three beheld, they ran altogether against the Prince, who gaue the foremost such a freendly welcome, as falling on his head to the ground, brake his necke with the weight of his owne bodie. The other twaine (at this encounter) had broken their Launces on <hi>Palladine,</hi> and now drew their Swords, thinking to reuenge their fellowes ill fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but greatly did they finde themselues deceiued, for the Prince séeing he had no more to deale withall thou these two, redoubled so many fierce strokes vpon them, as the one fell out of his Saddle depriued of his sences, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to saue his life, would haue fled away: the Prince dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing him of that benefit, by hamstringing his horsse, caused him to fall to the earth, when snatching off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, with his Sword would haue smitten his head from his shoulders. Alas Sir Knight, cried the vanquished <hi>Spanyard,</hi> saue my life, I yeeld my selfe to thy mercy: what I haue done against thee, was in reuenge of my Brother whome thou first dismounted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accurssed be the houre that he spake so vndiscretly, this is not the first time I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered my life, onely to sustaine his fond and ouerfoolish quarrels.

And thou shalt say to him, that the two Knightes which departed thence with two Ladyes, and if Knight who was there deliuered from enchauntment, in

They haue no more, aunswered <hi>Manteleo,</hi> then they worthily deserued, ought they to misprise or detract strange Knightes, cheefely such as are of one nation? yet let vs see in what estate they are. So comming to the Knight that was first dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and finding him dead, by reason of the aboundance of blood he had lost, as also because his Helmet hindered him from the aire: Unhappy man, said his Brother, oftentimes haue I told thee, that thy pride and ouer-wéening would one day cause thy death.

How she suffered this mishap, I know not, but as I returned from the wood, and méeting the Lion with my child, which full well I knew by the swadling cloathes, I made what haste I could after the beast, hoping by some meanes to recouer my child, which now (I thanke God and you) I haue done.

               <p>The Damosell and the Squire returned with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the Princes, who hauing heard the Gentlemans mishap, presently mounted on horssebacke, and rode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Castell.</p>

               <p>By this time are the Princes and the enchaunted Knight come to the Castell, where they found the thrée Brethren staying their comming, and without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spéeches, they prepared to the carire, when <hi>Palladine</hi> would haue encountred the Gentleman of the Castell, but the enchaunted Knight intreated him to the contrarie,

               <p>The enchaunted Knight likewise told his Lady, the successe of his iourney into <hi>England,</hi> how he receiued the
<pb facs="tcp:5290:29"/>
Swords of the wise Sorceresse, and how the two Princes (by drawing them) ended his enchauntment: they hauing at his request trauailed so farre, onely for her deliuerance from the cruell Gentleman. Now thankefull she shewed her selfe for their honorable paines, her great care in curing their woundes, and readie seruice to supply all wants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the vertues of so good a minde. Needlesse were it to tell ye, how <hi>Lydiseo</hi> procured from the King his Father many presents of good will to the Princes, and dayly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them with his owne person, as the men in whome he most of all delighted: I shall therefore reueale what happened to <hi>Palladine,</hi> while he attended the cure of his woundes in this Castell.</p>
               <p>As one night the Prince lay soundly sléeping in his bed, the Lady that before had appeared to him, presented her selfe now to him againe, speaking to him in this manner. Know Sir <hi>Palladine,</hi> that I am a Pagan, named the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who through the assertion thy vertues cause me beare thée, am come to aduertise thée, that I framed those two Swords, which the Knight enchaunted brought to thée and <hi>Manteleo,</hi> that you twaine might helpe him to recouer his lost Lady. And because I haue fore-seen by my magique and hidden knowledge, that by thee I shall one day attaine to high estate of honor: I will not conceale from thee, that the destenies haue reserued onely to thée, the atchiuement of many great and braue enterprises, as also the finishing of rare aduentures and enchauntments, wherein thou shalt endure much paine and trauaile.</p>
               <p>Beside, I am to let thée vnderstand, that fortune hath sorted thée out a Lady, who at this day is estéemed peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in beautie, whome to finde, thou shalt trauaile many strange regions, with labour that will be long and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: yet shalt thou still be protected by me, and comforted by the great fame thou shalt heare of her beautie, surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all the Princesses in the world. Begin the search of her so soone as thou canst possible, and thinke not my spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5290:29"/>
friuolous, for thou shalt finde them vndoubtedly true. So vanished away the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> leauing the Prince in meruailous doubts, what this Pagan woman might be, that seemed to beare him so great affection. In the end, such deliberate aduise he tooke of her words, perswading himselfe of their truth and certaintie, as he concluded to seeke the Lady, the onely Phenir among the fairest in beautie. Of her immediately he became amorous, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to depart from the Prince <hi>Manteleo,</hi> because he would haue no competitour in his loue.</p>
               <p>But before we passe any further, and to bewray the cause of this aduertisement by the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> you must note, that she was Sister to the King of <hi>Aquilea</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing béen espoused to a Duke, one of the greatest Lords in that Realme, by whome she had three faire Daughters. All her life time she spent in the superstitious sciences of Nigromancie and Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> might be brought into that Countrey, each of her daughters should haue a Sonne by him that should in chiualrie surpasse all the Knights of their time; the one of them being destenied to be an Emperour, and the other two to be Kings of wonderfull possessions.</p>
               <p>Now to compasse the meane, whereby <hi>Palladine</hi> might be brought to this farre distant Countrey, you must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise note, that the King of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> brother to <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> had the fairest daughter that euer was seene: by which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, this enchauntresse appeared to the Prince, inciting him to follow the search of the fairest Lady in the world, promising him to enioy this rare virgin named. <hi>Nonpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reha.</hi> And when he should be thus brought into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, she deuised to exercise her arte in such sort, as he should haue the honor of her daughters, to the ende she might expect the fortune of the children, who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to so high dignities. Resolued on this intent, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke her selfe to dwell among the mountaines, where she

framed the two enchaunted Swords, as the first motion to draw <hi>Palladine</hi> toward <hi>Aquilea,</hi> where at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted he shall arriue.</p>
               <p>But now he is with the Prince <hi>Lydiseo</hi> at the Castell, where he and <hi>Manteleo</hi> hauing their woundes healed, the enchaunted Knight (with his Lady and Sister) returned to their owne home: the vision of wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> calleth <hi>Palladine</hi> thence, and faine would <hi>Manteleo</hi> returne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>England,</hi> because he liued by the onely remembrance of his mistresse <hi>Marcelina,</hi> so comming to <hi>Lydiseo, Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> thus began.</p>
               <p>Worthie Prince, your care for our health hath excéeded our deserts, yet we remayne with humble dutie to make requitall: hauing accomplished our promise to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted Knight, who with his Lady and fréends are safely where they would be, we craue licence for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to our Countries, where our parents expect our comming continually.</p>
               <p>Many gracious spéeches were vttered by the Prince, and many liberall and bountifull promises, onely to cause them goe with him to the King his Fathers Court: but all was to no purpose, they promised to visit the King at more conuenient leysure, because very vrgent occasions did now hasten their departure.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lydiseo</hi> sawe he could not perswade them, he gaue to each of them a verie sumptuous armour, and foure of the best horsses in his stable, with diuers other giftes of inestimable valew: so after many courtesies and kind em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, <hi>Palladine</hi> and <hi>Manteleo</hi> set forward on their iourney, and <hi>Lydiseo</hi> hauing seazed the Castell to the King his Fathers vse, on the next day following rode to the Court, where he acquainted the King with al that had happened.</p>
               <p>The Princes hauing ridden most part of the day, came at length to a faire fountaine, standing in a fresh coole shadowe of trees, where they alighted, minding to dine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5290:30"/>
with such prouision as their Squires had brought with them. Afterward, they lay downe in the shade to sleepe a-little, which <hi>Manteleo</hi> and the Squires did very soundly: but <hi>Palladine</hi> not able to forget the words of the wise <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biconte,</hi> arose, and being loth to trouble them that slept, tooke his helmet and his sword, intending to walke among the trees till they awaked. He had not gone from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie the space of halfe a bow shoote, but he espied a goodly plaine, in the middest whereof stoode a faire pauillion, with two or thrée bundles of Launces erected at the entrance. Maruailing what the meaning heereof might be, he kept himselfe still hid among the trees, to see if any one would come in or out of the Tent. At length, he beheld come ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the plaine, two Knightes with a Damosell that bare a goodly Shéeld, which with the beam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These two Knightes and the Damosell would haue passed the Tent, but hée espied one came suddenly foorth, and stayd them, saying. You may not passe by (Gentlemen) so easily, you are well armed for the triall of the Launce: you must therefore make some proofe in this place of your chiualrie, else must you leaue your Armour and Horsses behinde yee. And first of all, you Damosell must deliuer me the Sheeld you cary, for it liketh me well, and I shall best deserue it. I may not doo so, aunswered the Damosell, because you are not the man it is sent vnto, and for whome it was purposely made. Whether I be he or no, quoth the Knight of the Tent, haue it I will: with which words he offered to take it violently from her, but the two Knightes stayed him with these spéeches.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, we neyther refuse the Ioust or Combate with thee, but in presuming to take the Shéeld perforce from the Damosell, we iudge it rather the behauiour of a shéefe and robber, then sitting with the credit of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or one that by brauerie of minde, desires to trie the courage of Knightes errant. Are you offended, quoth the

As they walked into the wood to seeke him, they heard the clanching of weapons, and entring on the plaine, they espied <hi>Palladine</hi> with the two Knightes and the Damosell, and a man kneeling on his knees before him, crauing pardon for his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manteleo</hi> being glad he had found his freend, came to him with merrie and chéerefull countenance: when the two Knightes seeing his face, immediatly knew him, and casting downe their helmets, came and embraced him, saying: How highly are we beholding to the vertuous Prince <hi>Palladine,</hi> without whose assistance our liues had perished? <hi>Palladine</hi> knowing them to bée <hi>Durandell</hi> of <hi>Cleue,</hi> and <hi>Orliman</hi> of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> of whose chiualrie he had heard mickle commendation, embraced them with marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous affection, the like did <hi>Manteleo,</hi> and no small gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were entercoursed betwéene these foure Princes.</p>

               <p>Happie and successefull Knight, whose vertues are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowined through the wide world, the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> hath

sent you this Sheeld, commending her selfe dutifully to your good grace, intreating you to forsake your companie awhile, and with me to go visit her that honors you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> hearing her speake of the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> who had so often appeared to him in visions, was as ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as <hi>Manteleo</hi> and the other were sorrowfull, to leaue the companie of him they loued so well: but hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken the Sheeld, returned this aunswere to the Damosell.</p>
               <p>Faire freend, I thanke your mistresse and you likewise, promising to goe with ye whether you please, though leth I am to forgoe the companie of these gentle Princes: but seeing it liketh the Lady <hi>Orbiconte</hi> it should be so, I obey her commaund right willingly, hoping to see my good freends againe ere it be long.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Palladine</hi> thus spake, his couller altered very pale and wanne, whereby the Damosell judged that he was wounded, wherefore she said: I perceiue (my Lord) you are scant well, let us enter this Tent I pray ye, where you shall be unarmed, and these Knightes likewise, that I may see what woundes you haue receiued: for my Lady <hi>Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this aduise they entred the Tent, where when they were vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Damosell verie cunningly dressed their wounds, finding these of <hi>Orliman</hi> and <hi>Durandell</hi> to be most doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet her comfortable speeches made them expect speedie recouerie. Afterward, they sate downe to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, with such viands as they found there readie in the Tent: and <hi>Palladine</hi> calling for the prisoner, said: Knight, if thou desire the safetie of thine owne life, tell me without fabling, what the Knight was that first proffered to take the Sheeld from the Damosell: and vpon what occasion you kept the passage heere, to forbid the course of Knightes

errant. Nor will I Sir (quoth the Knight) hide bne iote of the truthe from you.</p>
               <p>Knowe then, that he which would haue taken the Sheeld from the Damosell, was brother to a Gentleman, who not long since (by the Kings commaundement) was put to a most shamefull death, for that vniustly he detayned a Knightes wife: to whose Castell, came two strange Knightes, and by the ayde of <hi>Lydiseo,</hi> Prince of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> they tooke the Gentleman sore wounded, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward executed, slew many of his seruants, as also his two brethren, deliuering the Lady to her husband againe, who now liue in quiet in their owne Castell.</p>
               <p>This Knight that stroue for the Sheeld, was likewise brother to that Gentleman, who hearing the misfortune of his brethren, vowed to take vengeance on those two Knightes, by whose meanes, he was now left freendlesse in the world. Upon this determination, heere caused he his pauillion to be erected, sending his espials abroade, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure all Knightes by this passage, hoping at length to finde those twayne, which I thinke he imagined to be they that conducted the Damosell: because he commaunded vs all to assaile them, but whether they be the same or no, he is now greatly deceiued of his hope, and thus haue you heard the verie truth of our being heere.

At length, the Damosell tooke <hi>Palladine</hi> aside fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her speeches to him in this manner.

               <p>Worthie Sir, aunswered the Knight, a true discourse shall I make of all my trouble, and thus it is.</p>
               <p>The Lord of this place, the auncient man whome you first ouercame in the Court, had thrée Sonnes, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I found about a moneth since in a little Warren néer to my house, which is distant hence not past a mile: and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he allured a yong mayden, the daughter to a poore tenaunt of mine, where villainously he sought to dishonor her. My selfe (by good hap) walking that way, beheld the poore virgin before him on her knees, he hauing his Sword drawne in his hand, threatning therewith to cut her throate, if she would not accomplish his vnlawfull desire.</p>
               <p>When I sawe this vncouth spectacle, and that the poore mayden was out of breath, with strugling and striuing to defend her chastitie, I came to him, and fréendly intreated him to forbeare that bad minde: but he immediatly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vsing any words better or worsse, left the mayden, and with his Sword began to assayle me, where doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I had béene murthered, had I not béene prouided for mine owne defence: yet did I make such good shift with him, as he was fayne to submit himselfe to my mercie, which I was contented to graunt him, vpon promise, that he would neuer offer the like vile attempt, not fitting the name of a Gentleman, who rather ought to defend the chastitie of virgins. But the forsworne wretch kept not his promise with me, for so soone as I had left him, he ran after the poore mayden againe, who thought to saue her selfe by flight to her Fathers house, and in despight that he was vanquished by me, or what else I knowe not, he stabd her to the heart with his dagger. I hearing her pitifull cry when the wound was giuen, ran after the murtherer, who turned againe valiantly to resist me: but I handled him in such sort, as he accompanyed the poore mayden in death. A Lackey that attended on this lubricious villayne, seeing his mayster had giuen his last farewell to the world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb facs="tcp:5290:37"/>
caryed the newes to the Lord his Father, and his other two Brethren, whom you slew without the gate. The Brethren made sollemne promise to their Father, that they would take the most cruell vengeance on me as could be deuised, awayting opportunitie to execute theyr bloodie intents: and this day as I was walking in my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, hauing no other defence then as you sée me in my doublet, they layd violent hands on me, binding me on the horsse as you found me, and but for you, God knowes how they meant to haue vsed me.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> thanke God for your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, and next to him the wise Lady <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> who sent this Damosell to conduct me hither for your succour.</p>
               <p>Ah my good Lord, aunswered the Knight, often haue I heard of that worthy woman, who (as I vnderstand) is Sister to the King of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> a maruailous louer of Knightes vertuous and valiant: I promise ye right soone will I go giue her thanks for this excéeding fauour.</p>

                  <hi>Palladine</hi> hearing him speake of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the letters engrauen on his Sword, for which cause, he determined to trauaile thither, to finde the wise <hi>Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conte,</hi> that she might shew him the Lady, whereof in his sléepe she did aduertise him. Upon this resolution, they sate downe to meate, and after the Tables were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, the Damosell thus spake.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, you haue accomplished the promise you made me, for which I thanke ye, and will make report thereof to my Lady and mistresse, to whome I must with all dilligence returne, being assured of this Knightes safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: wherefore I humbly take my leaue, because I meane to be gone very earely in the morning. <hi>Palladine</hi> sorie she would be gone so soone, sayd: If it like ye faire Damosell, I will conduct ye on your way for your Ladyes sake, who beares me such affection without any desert. My Lord, quoth she, I hartely thanke ye, but my Lady commaunded me to returne alone, assuring me to escape on the way
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5290:37"/>

I like well his attempt, said <hi>Palladine,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be: but knowe ye not how he is called? <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the prowd, men name him (quoth the Knight) and fitly doth that surname agrée with him, for he is one of the most vaineglorious men that euer was heard of, beside, excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in crueltie to Knightes that deale with him, for if he vanquish any one, he neuer pardons him, no, though he yéeld himselfe to his mercie. Beleeue me, said <hi>Palladine,</hi> small commendation gets he thereby, being rather estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a coward, then valiant: for he vseth such crueltie, to terrify those as shall afterward deale with him. But the enterprises of Tourneys for the loue of Ladyes, should not extend to such extremitie, but rather for honor and fame onely: yea, though to a mortall enemy, mercy should be giuen him when he yéeldeth himselfe. The brute beasts shew greater humanitie, as we may reade in examples, of Lyons, Beares, Dogs, and diuers other, who ceasse from rage and furie on a yéelding pray. It is necessarie then, answered the Knight, that such men should haue such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure serued them, and no greater mercie ought they to haue, then themselues tofore haue shewed to other: as for my selfe, if fortune fauour me against him, he shall find as little pittie as he hath giuen. By my Sword (quoth the Prince) I so desire to see that cruell Knight, as I will beare ye companie, so you please to accept thereof: for perhaps the great villaine is some Deuill, and then it is necessarie he should be well coniured. Great honor and pleasure, quoth the Knight, shall you héerein doo me, for I desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then companie.

So clothing her selfe in most sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous garments, and being attended on by her wayting Ladyes, she went to the Princes lodging: and after two or three gracious courtesies passed betwéene them, she said, Sir Knight, right welcome are ye to our Court, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund me, or any thing else héere to your liking: for so much doo I account my selfe indebted to you, hauing slayne the cruell and proud <hi>Dardalon,</hi> as while I liue, I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer returne sufficient recompence.

In this did <hi>Brandidoll</hi> promise his ayd, and diuers other of their faction as bad as they, many of them being now slayne, which so contents me, as nothing can do more. And were I as well rid of cruell <hi>Brandidoll,</hi> hencefoorth should I liue in peace, without feare or suspition of any one: for when the mightie enemies are quailed, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dare not presume to stirre.</p>
               <p>Madame, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> perswade your selfe in this, that in respect of your innocencie, God will not suffer you to take any wrong, but that your enemies shall worke their owne confusion.

Know then sweete Lady, quoth <hi>Simprinell,</hi> that my extreame sicknesse happened by no other cause, then the loue and affection I beare to your mistresse: and feare to offend her or the King, hath by silence of my loue brought me to this daunger. Why my Lord? quoth she, you that are of so high and honorable discent, can ye offend my Lady by louing her? or you that are as good as she, doo not deserue loue for loue? she is the child of a King, and so are you, beside, she is humble and gracious as any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse liuing, then feare not to let her knowe your daunger. Alas Madame, quoth he, neuer shall I dare to speake to her: but may it please you to solicite my cause, yet with carefull héed of her dislike, I shall confesse my life preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by you. And so much will I doo for ye my Lord, quoth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5290:43"/>
she, without giuing her any occasion of offence: but rather shall I doo it in such sort, as by a speedie answere you shall perceiue her mind. Go then good madame, said the Prince, and boldly may ye assure her, that my life or death is in her hand. So went the Lady to her mistresse, to whome she imparted what you haue heard, wherewith she was so well pleased, as she presently sent to him againe this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that she entertained his loue with the like, and that as he would witnesse his affection towards her, he should practise what spéed he could deuise for his health.</p>
               <p>These words breathed such life into the Prince, as within few dayes he was perfectly recouered, when after many amorous parlees with <hi>Belanicia,</hi> she to make a triall how his loue was grounded, hauing heard report of the faire Duchesse <hi>Brisalda:</hi> desired him to trauell to <hi>Varne</hi> in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> carying with him her liuely counterfeit, and there to maintaine against all Knightes whatsoeuer, that she was fairer then the Duchesse <hi>Brisalda,</hi> on which condition, she would accept him as her Knight and loyall seruant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simprinell</hi> glad to be so commaunded, the next day hee departed with his foure Squires, and comming to <hi>Varne,</hi> where the Duchesse remained, heard what braue imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was there in Chiualrie: wherefore comming to the accustomed place of the Tourney, on a faire Piller he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Ladyes picture, saying, he would maintaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all commers, that his mistresse excéeded the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse <hi>Brisalda</hi> in beautie. The Knightes attendant on the Duchesse, were amazed héereat, preparing themselues to defend her cause: but <hi>Simprinell</hi> willed them first to bring the Duchesse counterfeit, and it to be placed by his Ladies, and the conquerour should carie them both with him. Right soone was the Duchesse figure set on the Piller, and <hi>Simprinell</hi> this first day dismounted twelue Knights: <hi>Palladine</hi> being ridden abroade on hunting, which made <hi>Brisalda</hi> despaire of her fortune, fearing the strange cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion would depart vnconquered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5290:44"/>This dayes good successe, emboldened <hi>Simprinell</hi> to try the second, when <hi>Palladine</hi> entring the Listes among the other Knightes, whome one by one he saw brauely vnhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he came to <hi>Simprinell</hi> with these spéeches.</p>
               <p>In sooth (Sir Knight) I commend your enterprise, beeing a cause that maketh many forward in Armes: but as for the Lady, whome you extoll beyond my Lady the Duchesse héer present, I say and will auerre the contrary, against you and all other till the houre of death. If affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath blinded your eyes, I soone shall alter that opinion, when your owne selfe shall confesse, that your Lady is no way to be compared with mine.</p>
               <p>I imagine by your words Sir, answered <hi>Simprinell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that you will defend your mistresse by the toong onely: but let vs goe to the matter roundly, for you are not yet so good an Oratour, as to perswade me from a resolued assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>You thinke then, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> that I thinke to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the Combate by my words. Not so, for you shall sée me effectually defend the honor of her beautie who is my mistresse. So giuing the spurres to their horsses, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with such violence, as <hi>Palladine</hi> lost his stirrops, but <hi>Simprinell</hi> was cast foorth of his saddle to the great ioy of the Duchesse and her freends, that his presumptuous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie was so worthely checked.</p>
               <p>Afterward they fell to the Combate with the Sword, and long they fought without any aduantage, till <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> by tripping his enemie, got him downe, and himselfe vpon him, when holding his Sword ouer him, he sayd: Now must thou confesse the Duchesse <hi>Brisalda,</hi> to be a Lady farre excelling thine in beautie, elfe art thou not like to sée her again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Seeing fortune hath throwne me into this extremitie, said <hi>Simprinell,</hi> I confesse my selfe van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished: but to say that my mistresse is inferiour to thine, I will not though I die therefore, nor am I otherwise bound by my owne conditions, then to leaue her portrait

to the will of the conquerour. The Iudges of the féeld gaue sentence accordingly, wherevpon <hi>Palladine</hi> left <hi>Simprinell,</hi> and went to place the Duchesse counterfeit aboue <hi>Belani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> albeit he perceiued her figure much more beautifull: by which conceit he gathered, that this was she of whome the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> told him, wherefore he onely minded <hi>Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> purposing right soone to forsake the Duchesse.</p>
               <p>As he was vnarming in his chamber, he began to thinke how he might leaue <hi>Brisalda,</hi> and what excuse would serue for his departure: yet when he considered his good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, and what especiall fauour he had receiued at her hands, he altered his mind, reputing the words of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biconte</hi> for méere illusions.</p>
               <p>And as he continued in this déepe musing, he thought he heard one whisper in his eare, saying: It is not heere <hi>Palladine</hi> that thou must abide, wherefore follow the good fortune that is promised thée. Héerevpon he concluded, what euer happened, he would depart on the morrow, and thereof that night he meant to aduertise the Duchesse, to whome he went right soone afterward.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch were y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> troublesome thoughts of <hi>Palladine,</hi> in hastening his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture toward <hi>Belanicia,</hi> as without any longer stay he came to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse, who séeing him looke so sad, desired to knowe the cause thereof. In sooth Madame, quoth he, I can not forget the strange Knight that I Iousted withall this day: right
<pb facs="tcp:5290:45"/>
sorie I am that I demaunded not his name: for I imagin I haue sometime seene him in <hi>England.</hi> If that be all, sayd the Duchesse, we will send for the Knight hither: but her sending was in vaine, for he departed immediatly after the Combate. When <hi>Palladine</hi> sawe no excuses would serue, but she would néedes presse him with earnest request of his penstuenesse, he said.</p>
               <p>Let it not dislike ye good Madame, if I haue intended any thing for your honor and mine owne, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thereof as it deserueth. Full well you knowe faire mistresse, that hardly can we continue our loue together, enioying the benefite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good hap affoords vs, without iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous suspition of your Lords and Ladyes: and affection maketh amorous fréends oftentimes forgetfull of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, so that béeing subiect to the iudgement of many, they shall hardly escape without scandalous and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie spéeches. And nothing (sweet Madame) is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our honors, especially yours, in respect of your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and authoritie: to preuent which danger, and that héereafter we may stand out of the reach of wounding toongs, I meane to trauaile to <hi>England</hi> to the King my Father, whome I wil acquaint with the intended mariage betwéene vs, and his good will obtained, right soone shall I returne to haue it accomplished. In the meane while, you may conferre thereon with the Lords of your Councell, who (I thinke) will not dislike thereof, when they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my birth and parentage, so shall our credits be safely defended, and what hath past alreadie, be sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Brisalda</hi> heard these spéeches, her heart was so swollen with gréefe, as she was not able to make any aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: whereat he could not but meruaile, considering his words tended to great reason: yet with such zealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions he still laboured her, making faithfull promise of his spéedie returne, as in the end he obtained her consent, albeit God knowes verie vnwillingly. Giuing her then an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5290:45"/>
amorous conge, he tooke two bracelets from his armes, verie richly embellished with pearle and stone, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the Duchesse, saying. On the same day I came to your Court, swéete Madame, you gaue me a iewell, which I will kéepe for your sake while I liue: that you may likewise remember me, I beséech ye to weare these bracelets, which were giuen me by my mother on the day I was Knighted. Alas my Lord, quoth she, I doubt you haue left me such a remembrance, as except you spéedily returne againe, will beare me company to my latest home. Yet will I kéepe one of the bracelets for your sake, and when you come againe, I will haue the other. So putting the bracelet on her arme, she vowed neuer to take it off, vntill she sawe her Knight returned. With many kind em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, and deuoute kisses, he returned to his lodging, and the Duchesse to her chamber, where calling her trustie maiden to her, who was a captiue Moore, and one not a little in her fauour, being acquainted with all that had passed betweene the Prince and her, with many bitter sighes and teares, she telles the Moore the summe of her greefe. The Moore perswaded her, that the Prince heerein had done aduisedly, for safetie of both their honors, if their loue (as greatly she doubted) had sorted to effect: for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie must be the meane to couer such matters, which she would so substancially bring to passe, as none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues should be acquainted therewith. With much adóo the Duchesse was pacified, and on the morrow when <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi> departed, she sent him a pursse of gold to spend in his trauaile, causing her Lords to accompanie him two or thrée miles on his way: and so (though loth) these louers are seperated, the Duchesse abiding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He had not ridden halfe part of the day, but a Knight with thrée Squires gallopped after him, crying: Stay Sir Knight, for héere commes one that must speake with thée.
<pb facs="tcp:5290:46"/>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> presently turning his horsse, tooke his Launce from his Squire, thus aunswering.</p>
               <p>What is he that would speake with me? let him kéepe out at the length of my Launce, till I haue better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, why he should come to seeke me in such haste. Because thou wouldest so faine knowe me, aunswered the Knight, thou shalt vnderstand, that I am the man thou didst vanquish yesterday, more by fortune then prowesse: therefore I would now trie againe, how well I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge my former foyle. So fetching their carire, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred together so brauely, as they were both dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and while their Squires laboured to catch their horsses that ran about the féeld, they fell to the combate with the Sword, and wounded each other very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, till in the end <hi>Palladine</hi> got the aduantage: and as he made proffer to smite off his enemies head, he knew him to be <hi>Simprinell,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Scots.</hi> Soone was all the former vnkindnesse pacified, and each embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced other verie louingly, reproouing themselues of great wrong to fréendship, yet excusing the same by ignorance. When their Squires sawe how they were wounded, one of them thus spake. In this wood (my Lords) is a faire Abbey, and there remaineth one verie skilfull in Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie: so please ye to goe thither, the Abbot will entertaine ye gently, because he is brother to a worthie Gentleman, who spent his time as a Knight errant, and for his sake he loueth all strange Knightes whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>They not misliking this councell, went presently to the Abbey, where the Abbot welcommed them as beseemed their estates: and while their Supper was prouiding, the skilfull man hauing visited their woundes, they walked into the faire Orchards and Gardens, recounting to each other their seuerall fortunes, since they were together in the Court of <hi>England. Simprinell</hi> discoursed his loue to <hi>Belanicia</hi> of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and the cause of his comming to the Citie of <hi>Varne:</hi> which when <hi>Palladine</hi> heard, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:5290:46"/>
not only to forget his affection to <hi>Belanicia,</hi> but also to assist his freend to his vttermost in obtaining her loue, saying.</p>
               <p>My noble fréend, I knowe what manner of disease loue is, if one haue not receiued the swéetes thereof, albeit, when I sawe you in <hi>England,</hi> I had no knowledge at all therein: wherefore, if I shall accompanie you to <hi>Norgalles,</hi> such good speeches will I vse of you to your Lady, as she shall not be offended for not bringing her portrait againe, or that of the Duchesse which she sent ye for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simprinell</hi> thanked the Prince for his offer, but he was farre otherwise addicted, saying: he had promised his Lady a further iourney for her loue, wherein he would not haue any companie.</p>
               <p>With this answere was <hi>Palladine</hi> well contented, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his course another way: so hauing stayed two daies at the Abbey, and either of them being able to beare Armour, he left <hi>Simprinell</hi> there, and courteously taking his leaue of the Abbot, set on whither fate and fortune would guide him.</p>
               <p>And after he had ridden fiue or sixe dayes, he met a horsseman, with whome, falling in talke, he vnderstood, that the great Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> of <hi>Roome,</hi> had at <hi>Paris</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised a noble Tournament, for the loue of the faire <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde</hi> of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> a Princesse estéemed incomparable in beautie. And I (quoth the Courrier) am sent to the King of <hi>Norgalles</hi> Court, who hath a faire Daughter named <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanicia,</hi> before whome, I must reueale my message, and declare the Prince <hi>Caesars</hi> challenge, in presence of all the Kings Knightes. Afterward, I must trauaile to <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and in the Court of the Duchesse <hi>Brisalda,</hi> a Lady likewise renowmed for her beautie, I must make knowne of this famous Tournament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> glad to heare the Duchesse so commended, and that now he had the meanes to see the Princesse <hi>Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> accompanied the messenger to <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and by the

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Simprinell</hi> felt himselfe well recouered, and remembred, how he had not onely failed in winning the portrait of the Duchesse, but in the attempt had lost y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figure of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse <hi>Belanicia:</hi> he determined not to goe to <hi>Norgalles,</hi> vnlesse he could accomplish his Ladye? commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore taking his leaue of the Abbot, he rode backe againe to <hi>Varne,</hi> and comming to the place of triumphes, found the Duchesse with her Ladyes placed on the Scaffolds, and the Prince <hi>Alfian</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> the Champion for <hi>Brisalda,</hi> who preuayled woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely against all that encountred with him. <hi>Simprinell</hi> looking on his Ladyes picture, and séeing it embased vnder the Duchesse, had such a violent impression strooke him to the harte, as he intended to recouer her honor againe, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5290:47"/>
else to leaue his life in the feeld. And in this resolution he encountred the <hi>Irish</hi> Prince, passing two or three courses brauely, the shiuers of their Launces flying vp into the aire: but at the third attaint, he met <hi>Alfian</hi> so roughly, as both horsse and man were sent to the ground.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alfian</hi> had recouered his feete, hee drew his Sword, and comming to <hi>Simprinell</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who by this time was alighted, and prepared for him: when they began a fierce and cruell combate, whereof <hi>Simprinell</hi> in the end had the honor. Then comming to the Duchesse, with cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reuerence he demaunded of her, if she would permit him to carie thence the portraites: whereto she made no answere, but in a great anger strong from the Scaffold, because her champion had defended her cause no better. Heereupon, the Iudges as the equitie of the case required, deliuered the portraites to <hi>Simprinell,</hi> which he giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Squires, mounted on horssebacke, returning presently backe to the Abbey, not alittle glad of his high good fortune. At the Abbey he stayed thrée or foure dayes, to heale such woundes as he tooke in the last combate, and afterward departed toward <hi>Norgalles,</hi> where he arriued without any aduenture by the way to hinder him. If he were welcome to the Lords and Ladies, I referre to your opinions, and how the Princesse <hi>Belanicia</hi> liked thereof, when she sawe her Knight returned with the Duchesse counterfeit, let Ladyes desirous of especiall account, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine her content: but in requitall of his great paines, so confidently did she loue him afterward, as by imparting the same to her brother <hi>Landastines,</hi> who highly fauoured his freend. <hi>Simprinell:</hi> the King was made acquainted therewith, and Ambassadours sent to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> such good liking thereof beeing found betweene them both, as the mariage was consumated, and long loue requited with desired recompence.</p>
               <p>Afterward, <hi>Simprinell</hi> imparted to <hi>Landastines,</hi> how at first he was foyled by the Prince <hi>Palladine,</hi> and in his
<pb facs="tcp:5290:48"/>
absence had woon his Ladyes credit againe: which <hi>Landa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> tooke so vnkindly, as they concluded to trauaile to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither the <hi>English</hi> Prince was gone before, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile this wrong to former amitie. And thither are ridden <hi>Landastines</hi> and <hi>Simprinell,</hi> to the great gréefe of the King and Quéene, but chéefely of <hi>Belanicia,</hi> so soone to forgoe her Lord and husband.</p>
               <p>

               <p>After they had saluted each other, <hi>Palladine</hi> presently knew the Duke, remembring he had séene him in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court: yet would not he make any shew thereof, because he was so slenderly accompanyed, hauing no one with him but his Squire <hi>Lycelio,</hi> and therefore was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be esteemed but as a poore Knight errant.</p>
               <p>The Duke merily demaunded of <hi>Palladine,</hi> whether he trauailed, and about what affaires.</p>
               <p>My Lord, quoth the Prince, my iourney is to <hi>Paris,</hi> and no other busines haue I there, then to make one in the famous Tournament, ordained by the Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> of <hi>Roome</hi> for loue of the faire <hi>Rosamonde</hi> of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But will you, quoth the Duke, aduenture your selfe against a Prince so magnanimous? In sooth (aunswered <hi>Palladine</hi>) I will try my fortune both against him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I may.</p>
               <p>Alas, said the Duke scoffingly, your courage excéedes your abilitie, if you desire the combate, as you professe: I would aduise ye not to meddle with <hi>Caesar,</hi> for if ye doo,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5290:48"/>
you will hardly deale with any other afterward. Let that fall out, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> as my fatall Starres haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: if I be vanquished, I must put it vp with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: for I am as all men are, subiect to fortune.</p>
               <p>You are then, said the Duke, the Knight of fortune, and she your mistresse: yet can I scant thinke it, vnlesse that is she which is painted in your Shéeld.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> seeing the Duke so scorne him, angerly aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
               <p>In truth my Lord, your lips hang in your light, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the God of loue to be fortune.</p>
               <p>I see I am deceiued, quoth the Duke, for <hi>Cupid</hi> hath made you a louing Knight: by the faith I beare to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, me thinks amorous conceites doo ill agrée with so yong a countenance. I scant thinke, said <hi>Palladine,</hi> that your elder countenance can disgrace mine so yong. Be not angrie Gentleman, quoth the Duke, the tune is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for diseases: and if you chase your selfe too much, you may chance to be beguiled of all your wit. If I happen héereafter, said <hi>Palladine</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either to borrow some wit of you, or to lend you more then you seeme to haue, thinke a yong man as able as he that lookes more auncient: and for your scoffing floutes, the next time I meete with yee, you and I will try who is the better man. So taking a Scarffe from about his arme, he threw it to the Duke, saying: In witnesse of my words, there is my gadge, which I will fetch againe before I will forfeit it, and pay you vsurie inough for your taunting speeches. With which words he galloped an other way, the Duke in great laughter bidding him adiew: but <hi>Palladine</hi> rode on verie paciently, minding to be reuenged on the Duke when he came to <hi>Paris.</hi> But it fell out contrarie to his expectation, for the Duke, and all his Knightes riding toward <hi>Paris</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were taken by two cruell Outlawes, that kept a strong Castell, they beeing named <hi>Brulanfutior,</hi> and <hi>Frucidant,</hi> who likewise kept the Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Fraunce</hi> prisoner,
<pb facs="tcp:5290:49"/>
because <hi>Brulanfurior</hi> sought to marie with his Sister <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samonde:</hi> and béeing denyed, as vnworthie so faire a Princesse, hée and his Brother left the Court, alluring with them the yong Prince <hi>Lewes</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there led a most hatefull and despised life, emprisoning all the Knightes they could get, and stealing all necessaries from the poore countreymen.</p>
               <p>By this Castell <hi>Palladine</hi> chaunced to ride, when he saw the seruants to these cruel men, take violently a great heard of Sheepe from two poore Shepheards, which he got them againe by killing the theeues: and afterward vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the thraldome of Prince <hi>Lewes,</hi> disguised in Shepheards habits, he and <hi>Lycelio</hi> entred the Castell, where by pollicie they slew <hi>Brulanfurior</hi> and <hi>Frucidant,</hi> with all the villaines that attended on them.

placed to regard the sports: Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> verie brauely came foorth of his Tent, and the first that made offer to runne with him, was the Duke of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who bare in his Sheeld for his deuise, a Knight fighting with a Lion. Whereby was figured, the noble assistance he gaue to his Lady <hi>Agricia,</hi> who had beene deuoured by a Lion had not he defended her: whereupon, she entertained him as her Knightly seruant, commanding him to trauaile to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to maintaine her beautie against Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> of <hi>Roome,</hi> as farre excelling faire <hi>Rosamonde</hi> of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> For this cause he entred the Listes, and comming to <hi>Caesar,</hi> thus spake. Hither am I come Sir Knight, to iustifie that my mistresse faire <hi>Agricia</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> exceedeth <hi>Rosamonde</hi> in all perfections of beautie. And I, quoth <hi>Caesar</hi> will maintaine the contrarie, that the Lady thou hast named, deserues not to be equalled with my diuine Goddesse. So coutching their Launces, they met together with exquisite chiualrie, and at the second encounter, the Duke of <hi>Gaule</hi> was vnhorssed: when being caried into his Tent by his Squires, verie sore hurt and brused with his fall, he entred into many dolorous complaints, because he had so lost the honor of his mistresse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Landastines</hi> of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and <hi>Simprinell</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come thither to finde the Prince <hi>Palladine,</hi> determined to make proofe of their valour against <hi>Caesar,</hi> but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Duke of <hi>Gaule</hi> in misfortune, and so did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other Knightes after them.</p>
               <p>Then entred the Listes two braue gallants, the one in azured Armour thick set with Starres of gold, and in his Sheeld, a Lady reskewed from a Giant: the other bare for his deuise, Fame triumphant in a siluer feeld.</p>
               <p>The Knight in azure Armour, made signe to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he would first aduenture for his Lady: yet such was his ill hap in the end, as both horsse &amp; man were throwne to the ground. When the Knight of Fame sawe his fréend dismounted, he came to <hi>Caesar</hi> with these speeches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:5290:50"/>Sir Knight, I confesse as well as thou doost, that my Lady <hi>Rosamonde</hi> excelleth all other in beautie: but this will I make good on thy body, that I am more woorthie to be her seruant then thou art. It should séeme then, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Caesar,</hi> that I deserue not to be so accounted: this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie shall the strength of my Launce presently discide, and thou or I will be her onely seruant. Heereupon, they encountred verie valiantly, breaking many Launces, yet neither able to mooue the other, whereat, they both grew angrie, desiring the King to let them haue stronger Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or else to permit them the Combate with the Sword: but the King would not suffer them to meddle with Swords, commanding each of them a very strong Launce, at which charge, the Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> was brauely dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Knight of Fame had almost borne him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. A great murmuring presently grew among the people, some auouching, that because the strange Knight so hardly recouered himselfe, therefore Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> should not be held as vanquished, but that they should prooue their fortune once more. But the Iudges gaue verdict to the contrarie, attributing the conquest to the Knight of Fame: which when <hi>Caesar</hi> heard, he went to the King, to intreate his Maiestie for the Combate with its Sword: but he denyed it him, saying, that the Ioustes being enterprised for loue, ought not to be ended in hatred.</p>
               <p>At these words, Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> went to his Lady <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde,</hi> who gaue him many thanks for his honorable paines: and though his successe happened so ill in the end, yet would not she withdraw her loue.</p>
               <p>But now commes <hi>Palladine</hi> into the feeld, being sorie he had not the conquest of <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet determining to end his choller on the Knight of fame, to whome he approached, saying: It gréeues me Sir Knight that I Iousted not with noble <hi>Caesar,</hi> for if I had, little praise couldest thou haue gotten to day. Your reason? aunswered the Knight of fame. Because I had woon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor (ꝙ <hi>Palladine</hi>) which
<pb facs="tcp:5290:51"/>
thou vsurpest, and yet remains in doubt among a number, which if thou darest say thou hast deserued, I will auouch the contrary: beside, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it appertaines not to thee, to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to the faire Lady <hi>Rosamonde</hi> nor to the very meanest among her Ladies: for (as I vnderstand) she is prouided of one beyond thee many degrees. Good Sir, aunswered the Knight of fame, you are very bold and braue in spéeches: What mooueth ye so much to abase me, seeing you knowe not of whence or what I am? nor hast thou seene any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in me deseruing these words. But I perceiue the cause héereof groweth, by the desire thou hast to deale with me, wherein thou shalt haue thy desire, either at the Launce or Sword, so pleaseth the King to graunt vs that libertie. Then turning to his Maiestie, the Knight of Fame intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the combate, with the Sword, if they could not finish their quarrell at the Launce. Loth was the King to suffer such danger, but the Iudges, with many Lords and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons there present, noting the earnest desire of the Knight, and that they were both strangers, perswaded his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, intending to cause them giue ouer, if in fight either of them should be in perill of life.</p>
               <p>When they had thus obtained what they would, they gaue their horsses the spurres, and with a verie rough en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, they were both dismounted, whereat <hi>Palladine</hi> verie angrie, drew his Sword, and marching against the Knight of Fame, such a cruell combate continued betwéene them, as neuer had the like beene seene in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> The King beholding their Armour broken, and the ground coulored with their scarlet blood, sent his Sonne the Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> to intreate them giue ouer: which they immediatly did, the Knight of Fame being not a little glad thereof, because he was brought into verie great debilitie, onely by the exceeding aboundant losse of his blood. <hi>Lewes</hi> bringing them before the King his Father, caused them both to be graciously entertained, and taking <hi>Palladine</hi> by the hand, sayd. Sée heere my Lord the man that slew <hi>Brulanfurior</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:5290:51"/>
and his brother, who deliuered me from imprisonment, and many Knightes that were held captiue in the Castell.</p>
               <p>The King not alittle ioyfull of these newes, arose and embraced <hi>Palladine,</hi> saying.</p>
               <p>Worthie Knight, I am more indebted to you then any man else in the world, for you alone haue done that to me, which neither with strength or pollicie I was able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe. I enioy my Sonne againe by your meanes, and my people are deliuered from those mercilesse villaines, whome neyther law nor loue could bridle: let me vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of whence you are, that I may knowe the man to whome I am so highly beholding.</p>
               <p>My Lord, aunswered the Prince, my name is <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> Sonne to the King <hi>Milanor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> your louing brother and vowed fréend.</p>
               <p>At these words, the King was much more glad then before, and casting his armes about his necke, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conceite of ioy, the teares trickled downe his face: then came the Quéene and faire <hi>Rosamonde</hi> her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who welcommed the Prince with maruailous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, the like did <hi>Landastines, Simprinell</hi> and <hi>Lydiseo</hi> of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> who was the man that came with the Knight of Fame, and at report of these Triumphes trauailed into <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Knight of Fame himselfe, he was called <hi>Don Robert,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Freeze,</hi> a stout, couragious and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die champion, greatly deuoted to the loue of faire <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde.</hi> The King presently departed to his Pallace, there to honor these braue Knightes as they worthely deserued: but <hi>Caesar</hi> of <hi>Room<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of death. Oftentimes would he priuately conferre with her, and she would aunswere him with such rare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, as increased his torments aboue the compasse of reason.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next morning, the King and all his Barons being in the great in the great Hall, <hi>Palladine, Landastines</hi> and <hi>Simpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi> likewise in companie, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred a Squire, attired after the <hi>Morisco</hi> manner, who making great reuerence, thus began.</p>
               <p>Mightie and redoubted King, I am sent from the Prince <hi>Zarcanell</hi> of <hi>Chipre,</hi> who yet abideth without the Citie, to craue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of your Maiestie, that he may report before you and
<pb facs="tcp:5290:54"/>
your Lords, an enterprise which he hath determined to execute before you.</p>
               <p>Squire, aunswered the King, say to thy maister, that he shall be welcome, and boldly let him enter our Citie: for we graunt him frée accesse to our presence, to open any thing he hath intended.</p>
               <p>The Squire returned presently to his Lord, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Kings gracious answere, commanded his seruants to goe to the playne before the Court, and there with all spéed to set vp his Tent: in meane while, himselfe accompanied with thrée Gentlemen, came before the King, and hauing humbly saluted his Maiestie, before all the Princes and Lords thus spake.</p>
               <p>Gracious Prince, I am perswaded that your highnesse well doth knowe, what authority loue hath ouer humaine creatures, and how vnable they are to resist his power: therefore I beséech ye not to thinke it strange, if I declare what loue hath enforced me to doo.</p>
               <p>So it is, that hauing heard the beawtie of faire <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelia,</hi> so highly renowmed aboue all Ladyes in the world: as one couetous to sée a thing so excellent, I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed to <hi>Aquilea,</hi> and there sound by proofe, that fame had rather spared then spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what she might, there I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came immediatly enthralled with her loue, and by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious behauiours towards her preuayled so farre, as she accepted me to be her Knight: with this charge and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I should carie her diuine figure into the Courtes of all Christian Princes, where Ladies or Damosels were famous for beawtie, and against all commers to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my mistresse rare preheminence. If froward fortune gaue me the ouerthrowe, then must I leaue to the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour my Ladies counterfeit: but if my luckye Starres graunted me the victorie, I am to carie with me the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished Ladyes portraite. And hauing heard (my good Lord) that your daughter <hi>Rosamonde</hi> is named among the fairest in Christendome, I directed my iourney hither:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5290:54"/>
and may it like you to deliuer her counterfeit on the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named conditions, I am readie to doo my deuoire in the open féeld before your Pallace gate, where I haue caused my Tent to be erected. Right well am I contented, sayd the King, and immediatly will I come thither with my daughter, whose portrait shall be there openly presented, and if any one will combate for her, there shall she be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard her fortune. <hi>Palladine</hi> standing by, coniectured this to be the Knight, whereof the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> made mention in her Letter: wherefore he first auaunced himselfe, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly intreating the King, that he might defend his daughter <hi>Rosamonds</hi> beawtie. Whereto the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently graunted, scant to the good liking of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who still bare his arme in a Scarffe: and began iealously to suspect <hi>Palladine,</hi> minding to reuenge him as occasion serued. Upon this agreement, <hi>Zarcanell</hi> departed to his Tent, where beeing well armed, and brauely mounted, expected his aduersarie, who not long after came with the King, the Prince <hi>Lewes,</hi> and many noble Lords in gallant equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. The Quéene, her daughter <hi>Rosamonde,</hi> and all the Ladyes of the Court, came with great spéed to their Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, to behold the portrait of the Lady so highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which hung on a Launce at the entrance of his Tent: and both the Champions being readie for the Ioust, <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canell</hi> comming to <hi>Palladine,</hi> thus spake.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, as the huge world can not endure two Sunnes, so may not my eyes abide these two figures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the rarest beawtie in the world, the one of them being a Pagan, and the other a Christian. But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betweene vs shall be soone ended, without any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hazard of the weapon, if thou wilt confesse before this assemblie, that the incomparable beawtie of my Lady, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth the cléere Sunne shining in the day time, and thine the Moone that lighteneth the night.</p>
               <p>Sir, Sir, aunswered <hi>Palladine,</hi> we come not hither to argue on the Sunne or Moone, but at the point of the
<pb facs="tcp:5290:55"/>
Launce, and edge of the Sword, to trie betwéene vs the honor of the féeld, whereof if I be maister, I will be your Sunne, and you my Moone if you goe to the ground. Without any further speeches they encountred together, their Launces being broken with such furie, as the <hi>English</hi> Prince was set on the crupper of his horsse, but <hi>Zarcanell</hi> nothing moued or shaken. In thrée or foure courses more, <hi>Palladine</hi> could neuer fasten his Launce on his enemie, yet <hi>Zarcanell</hi> still brake on him, for he was so nimble, and ranne so close to his horsse, as each one woondered at his fine chiualrie. Without doubt my Lord, quoth the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Champaigne</hi> to the King, neuer did I sée a brauer horsseman, he hath the raines of his Courser at commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that can gouerne him in such sort without any attaint. But <hi>Palladine</hi> angrie at his hard fortune, met <hi>Zarcanell</hi> so right at the sixt course, as breaking the girts of his saddle, his horsse ranne away, and left him behinde him. Yet did he quickly recouer himselfe, and drawing his Sword, came valiantly against <hi>Palladine,</hi> shewing as fine sleights, and agilitie in the Combate, as he did before on horssebacke with his Launce. In the end, it was his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be ouercome, when vnder the Sword of <hi>Palladine</hi> he entred into these complaints.</p>
               <p>Unhappie that I am, of force I sée I must yéeld my selfe, and not my bodie onelye, but my life also, hauing lost the onely maintenance thereof, the gracious fauour and regard of my mistresse. Ah incomparable miserie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that euer esteemed of me hitherto, hath in a moment vtterly reiected me: therefore good Sir Knight, rid me of this paine, and with one stroke end my miserie and life together, for greater good you neuer did to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> seeing him in such despaire, so pitied his case, as suffering him to arise, he thus comforted him.</p>
               <p>My fréend, you ought not in this sort to offend your selfe, considering these are but the tricks of fortune, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men are dayly subiect, and no more hath happened to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5290:55"/>
you then might haue doone to me. If the Lady for whome you vndertooke this voyage, loued you well, she cannot but augment it, knowing with valour you defended her cause. In sooth my Lord, answered <hi>Zarcanell,</hi> rather had I die a thousand deathes, then returne to my Lady, hauing not woon the portraite of faire <hi>Rosamonde</hi>: for her selfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, that neuer would she loue me except I brought it. And héere I vow to you, that I will returne to mine owne Countrey, so soone as I haue recouered my woundes: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you not onely the portraite you haue woon, but those likewise that I conquered in <hi>Norgalles,</hi> and elsewhere, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging my selfe of loues seruice, séeing he rewards his faithfull seruant no better. Therein vse your pleasure, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> but first goe with me, that your woundes may be searched to preuent further inconuenience. So go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King, he desired that his Chirurgions might attend on the Knight: for I assure your Maiestie, quoth he, neuer met I with any man of higher desert. Whereto the King willingly graunted, causing <hi>Zarcanell</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Court, and to be lodged in one of the fairest chambers, where he was dilligently attended, as in ten dayes he was perfectly recouered. When thanking the King for his noble entertainement, and taking leaue of his Maiestie, the Prince <hi>Lewes, Palladine,</hi> and the rest, he departed toward his owne Countrey, not alittle agréeued (as you may thinke) for his misfortune.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Palladine,</hi> he remembring the letter sent him by the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> and hauing imprinted in his heart the Lady <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> whose counterfeit he kept with choyse regard, determined to take his farewell of the King, and iourney with all speede toward <hi>Aquilea.</hi> Wherefore in the euening, the King walking in his Garden after supper, he told his Maiestie, that he was desirous to trauaile to the King his Father in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore that it would please him to licence his departure. The King (though loth) consented thereto, being sorie to forgoe the
<pb facs="tcp:5290:56"/>
valiant <hi>Palladine,</hi> who was so great a grace to his Court. Hauing then taken his leaue of the King, and of all the noble Princes and Ladyes; he departed on the morrow from <hi>Paris,</hi> accompanyed with <hi>Landastines</hi> and <hi>Simpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> taking his way toward <hi>Millayne,</hi> in hope to finde his fréend <hi>Manteleo</hi> there, but he was as then newly gone toward <hi>Normandie,</hi> to pacifie a controuersie betwéene his Father and the Duke, who was a man well prouided with money and munition, for he kept diuers Rouers and Pirates on the Seas, that dayly brought him great store of good booties.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the fourth day, after <hi>Palladine</hi> and his fréends departed from <hi>Paris,</hi> riding through a Forrest, they met a Knight and a Damosell, and with them a Squire gréeuously weeping: the Squire ioyfull to meete these Knightes, came to <hi>Palladine</hi> with these spéeches. Help Gentlemen, for Gods sake helpe me, to be reuenged on this Traitour, who hath slaine my maister by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of this Damosell. <hi>Palladine</hi> moued with the Squires teares, rode to the Knight, and thus spake.</p>
               <p>Knight, or paillard rather, what hath mooued thée to misuse passengers, and to bathe thy hands in innocent blood? Knight if thou wilt, quoth he with the Damosell, but paillard, reserue for thy selfe: as for him that I haue slaine, he was the cause of his owne death, because I found
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5290:56"/>
him readie to haue dishonored this Damosell. It is best for thee to excuse thy déede, sayd <hi>Palladine,</hi> in respect heere is none that can contrarie thée: but I rather thinke the shame is thine, then his that is dead, as his Squire hath protested to me. Think what thou wilt, quoth the Knight, but the Squire lieth falsly, and I ought to be better belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued then he, if thou didst me the right belonging to Armes: but credit as thou findest occasion, I haue no leysure to stand chatting with thée. And because thou art so lustie, answered <hi>Palladine,</hi> thou shalt a little tarie my pleasure. So couching their Launces, they met so roughly together, as they were both cast foorth of their saddles: afterward, they continued a cruell Combate with the Sword, till <hi>Landastines</hi> and <hi>Simprinell</hi> stepping to the Damosell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of her what the Knight was, Alas Gentlemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quoth she, his name is <hi>Manteleo</hi> the Prince of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>stines</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently stopping betwéene them, sayd: Giue ouer Sir <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine,</hi> for you fight against your déere fréend <hi>Manteleo.</hi> At these words, the Princes threw downe their weapons, and with all the ceremonious courtesies incident to fréend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they louingly embraced each other: whereat, the Damosell greatly meruailed, and the Squire who was the cause of their fight, whereupon, doubting a further danger toward him, because his maister was slaine in so bad a cause, so fast as he could tooke himselfe to flight.</p>
               <p>After the manifold kinde excuses, which freendly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vse together, they rode with the Damosell to her Castell, where their wounds being visited, they afterward iournyed to <hi>Millayne: Palladine</hi> being honorably wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed by the Duke, and especially fauoured for his loue to his Sonne <hi>Manteleo.</hi> And hauing feasted there certaine dayes, the Duke recounted to <hi>Palladine</hi> his present af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with the Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> who after many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable actions, was by his power slaine in a battell:
<pb facs="tcp:5290:57"/>
whereupon, the <hi>Normans</hi> were content to endure his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie ouer them, and for that cause had they sent their Ambassadors. In the end, by the worthie aduise of <hi>Palladine,</hi> the Duke tooke the gouernement vpon him, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sonne <hi>Manteleo</hi> to receiue the possession thereof. Now thought <hi>Palladine</hi> he stayed too long, remembring the letter from the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> therefore would he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently depart toward <hi>Aquilea,</hi> to the great gréefe of the Duke and his fréend <hi>Manteleo,</hi> being loth to forgoe, the <hi>English</hi> Prince so soone. <hi>Landastines</hi> and <hi>Simprinell,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that <hi>Palladine</hi> would trauaile alone, albeit more willingly they would haue borne him companie, rode back to <hi>Norgalles</hi> againe, <hi>Simprinell</hi> confessing how he had woon the portraite of <hi>Brisalda,</hi> whereof <hi>Palladine</hi> made little or no account at all, because he had now almost forgotten her. <hi>Manteleo</hi> likewise went to <hi>Normandie,</hi> where he was receiued as their Lord and Gouernour, and hauing esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished all matters concerning the common wealth, he crost the Seas into <hi>England,</hi> to visit his best beloued Lady <hi>Marcelina,</hi> whome he had chosen aboue all other in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Palladine</hi> thus departing from his fréends, hauing none in his company but his Squire <hi>Lycelio,</hi> and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <hi>Liboran,</hi> by whose meanes he entred the Castell of <hi>Brulanfurior,</hi> and therefore gaue him the name of <hi>Liboran</hi> the well aduised: tooke Shipping, and coasting by <hi>Lystria,</hi> at length they came into <hi>Albania,</hi> where suddenly they met with a Turkish Pirate, named <hi>Dormidon,</hi> who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to seaze on this christian bootie, assayled them, yet in the end was ouercome himselfe, and he with the most part of his men throwne into the Sea.</p>
               <p>After this sharpe encounter on the Sea, <hi>Palladine</hi> was desirous to take landing at the néerest Island, least they should be surprized by any more Pirates: and because he thought each day a yéere, till he might sée the swéete God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, promised him by <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> he determined not to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5290:57"/>
rest himselfe in any place, vntill he had found what he so earnestly desired, charging his Squires thence forward, to call him <hi>The Knight without rest,</hi> and vnder this name héereafter he trauaileth.</p>
               <p>The Pilote did as he was commaunded, striking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the néerest Island, which séemed to them verie beawtifull and delectable: but they were no sooner come on land, and their horsses brought on shore, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly offered to feede on the goodly gréene grasse, but a mightie flame of fire issued foorth of the ground, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued before them to hinder their passage any further.

               <p>First he sawe a huge multitude of Harpies flying about him, making offer to seaze vpon him with their tallants. Then he beheld as many Serpents, houering with their
<pb facs="tcp:5290:59"/>
wings ouer him, casting flame and fire out at their mouthes: yet could not these, and many other appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cause him to dismay, but trusting onely in the God of his strength, they vanished away, and he falling in a sléepe, the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> presented her selfe to him, saying:
<q>
                     <l>Knight without rest, of whome the heauens haue care,</l>
                     <l>Abide not in this place so sad and full of woe:</l>
                     <l>But follow thy intent which doth more good prepare,</l>
                     <l>And shall on thee thine owne desires bestowe.</l>
                     <l>Another man must these aduentures end,</l>
                     <l>So fortune willes, to whome I thee commend.</l>
                  </q>
This sayd, she presently departed, leauing the Knight to finish his dreame, whereat he meruailed when he awaked, to see himselfe alone in that place, not knowing which way to returne to his company: and as he considered on the words of the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> he arose, and looking on the Rocke, beheld in the middest thereof a Statue of blacke Marble, holding betwéene his armes a Table, whereon these words were written in letters of golde.
<q>When the inuincible Dragon shall be chased into this place by the faire Serpent, he shall giue end to these enchauntments by passing the flame: and those two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hauing read this prophecie, long time he was thinking on the meaning thereof, yet could he not by any meanes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe it: but true it is, that he doubted (according to the words of the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi>) that the ending of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture was destenied to another, and not to him, yet if he could he would haue passed further, to see if there had béene any more such matters of regard: but as he made offer to goe, the fire and flame appeared as it did before, and many voices breathed foorth bitter complaints. How happie is the man, quoth he, whose high good fortune shall finish these enchauntments, and thereby deliuer the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5290:59"/>
soules, whose cries are able to rent a hart of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. When he perceiued he might not passe further, but that he was resisted by the flame and diuers that smote him: he returned to the place where he left <hi>Lycelio,</hi> and mounting on horssebacke, came backe to the Ship. Then recounted he to the Pilote, what he had heard and séene in the Isle, and how it greeued him, that he could not end the enchauntments, onely to release the poore soules that cried to him. So setting Sayle, they coasted along <hi>Dalmatia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The name of a Christian being highly hated among the men of this countrey, <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to kéepe himselfe vnknowne, being able to speake the

               <p>The Gouernour vnderstanding that strangers were entred the Citie, sent one of his Captaines named <hi>Broan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> to enquire of whence and what they were. <hi>Broantine</hi> comming to their lodging, immediatly knew <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> being the Knight that accompanyed him into <hi>Bulgaria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Good Sir, I must desire ye to pardon me, for I doo not remember that euer I saw ye till now: and it may be you take me for some other body. No my Lord, sayd <hi>Broantine,</hi> I knowe ye well inough, for I trauailed in your companie to the Court of the Duchesse <hi>Brisalda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

May I then, quoth <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> desire this fauour at your hands, to enstruct me how I shall gouerne my selfe among these people, for I would not willingly be knowne that I am a Christian, in respect of the danger may happen to me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and therefore haue I changed my name, calling my selfe <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> hauing determined to rest in no place, till I haue found one I earnestly séeke for.

your selfe to me, said <hi>Broantine,</hi> you shall not be knowne, but both you and they that came with ye, shall be courteously entreated, and the rather, because you can speake this countrey language. I vnderstand it in deede, said <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> and speake it indifferently, as my Squire can doo also: but this Gentleman (meaning <hi>Liboran</hi>) is ignorant therein, and therefore counterfeiteth himselfe dumbe, that he might not be knowne, nor we by him. A good deuise, answered <hi>Broantine</hi>: stay héere (if you please) till I returne, I will goe make report of you to the Gouernour, and by my spéeches you shall be freendly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed. So went <hi>Broantine</hi> to the Gouernour, to whome he said, that <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> was of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a man valiant, hardy, and couragious, professing the same lawe that he did.

According to the Gouernours request the next day, <hi>the knight without rest</hi> came to the Pallace, where he was entertained verie honorably, the Gouernour vsing these words to him.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, our Captaine <hi>Broantine</hi> hath made such report of your forwardnes in Armes, as while I liue you must account me your fréend: and I will let the King vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of your being heere, that he may accept of you as men of vertue deserue.

The Gouernour walking with them in the great Hall, declared the whole cause of the warre, betwéene the King his maister, and the King of <hi>Panonia,</hi> and how within two or thrée dayes he meant to bid him battell.</p>
               <p>As for the matter of their discord, it grew by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: that the King of <hi>Aquilea</hi> refused to giue his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Nonparelia</hi> in marriage to the King of <hi>Panonia,</hi> nor the yong Princesse her selfe could not be perswaded to like of him, by reason of the many bad qualities he was endued withall, as also he was a man verie much defourmed. In déede my Lord, answered <hi>the knight without rest,</hi> I haue oftentimes heard, that the Princesse <hi>Nonparelia</hi> is the flower of the world for beawtie, an ill match were it then, that so sweete a Lady should haue a husband so hard fauoured. And the onely cause of my comming into this Countrey, was to defend her honor in this enterprised warre, as the Lady beyond all other in rare perfections. Soone after they sate downe to dinner, where wanted no store of costly delicates: and the Tables were no sooner withdrawne, but there entred the Hall a comely aged La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, her face all besprent with teares, and her sorrowfull lookes bewraying the anguish of her spirit. A good while she stoode viewing all the Lords, not speaking one word, till the Gouernour moued with pitie, thus spake. Faire Lady, full well doth your countenance bewray, that something hath happened scant to your liking: boldly deliuer the cause of your sadnes, and may I in any thing giue you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, be you assured I will perfourme it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:5290:61"/>Alas my Lord, quoth she, my case requireth present as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, for my husband comming with his Sonne to this Citie, onely to aide the King in his warres, foure Knights set vpon them in the Forrest neere at hand, and binding them both hands and feete, haue forcibly caried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, threatning in most cruell sort to murther them, for some priuate displeasure conceiued against them. <hi>The knight without rest</hi> presently offered himselfe, desiring the Gouernour that he might redresse the Ladyes wrong: and hauing obtained leaue for his departure, with <hi>Libo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Lycelio,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Broantine,</hi> went immediatly to horssebacke. So riding with the Lady, at length they ouertooke the foure Knightes, who with great cudgels cruelly did beate the Ladies Husband and Sonne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, <hi>the knight without rest</hi> highly offended, gaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spurres to his horsse to encounter w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them. But <hi>Liboran</hi> by signes, and <hi>Broantine</hi> by intreaties, perswaded him to suffer them deale with the foure Knightes, which they did verie vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and killing them all foure, deliuered the Knight and his Sonne safely to the Lady. Afterward they rode to the Knightes Castell, where their wounds receiued in fight being searched and bound vp, they were estéemed as their vertues deserued, the good Lady vsing all the meanes she could deuise, to expresse her thankefulnes for this noble courtesie. But <hi>the knight without rest</hi> still minded <hi>Nonpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia,</hi> thinking each houre a yéere, till he might sée her: and therefore practised as much as in him lay, the speedie reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of <hi>Broantine,</hi> and <hi>Liboran,</hi> that he might set forward to the mistresse of his thoughts.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:5290:63"/>
the building whereof was so rare and stately, as in all the world the like might not be found.

               <p>By her stood her Sonne <hi>Cupid,</hi> with an arrowe drawne in his bowe, as being readie to shoote: but so arteficially framed after the life, as neuer was a more choyse péece of workemanship séene.</p>
               <p>From thence they walked into meruailous goodly Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, which were painted round about with Poeticall Histories: as the contention betwéene the thrée Goddesses, <hi>Pallas, Iuno,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> the iudgement of <hi>Paris,</hi> the strange alteration of many metamorphosed louers, and the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of the Gods, where angry <hi>Tisiphone</hi> shewed her selfe.</p>

She walked with them likewise into her Parke, and shewed them what braue game she had there prouided, with all other deuises incident to delight, onely to allure <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> to stay there, till she had perfourmed her intent for her Daughters, which within few dayes after she cunningly compassed in this manner.</p>
               <p>The wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> calling her Daughters to her, the first whereof being named <hi>Iunona</hi> the second <hi>Palladia,</hi> and the third <hi>Veneria:</hi> gaue them especiall charge, to vse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in such sort to <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> that he might enter into that familiar acquaintance with them, as each thing might sort according to her determination.</p>
               <p>And one night while the Knightes and her Daughters were dauncing, she walked into her Garden, hauing in her hand a little Booke of parchment, couered ouer with black veluet: there framed she such spelles and charmes, and with secret muttering to her selfe, sent such a coniuration abroade, as nothing should preuent what she had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

               <p>By this time had <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> remayned héere seuen dayes, when <hi>Orbiconte</hi> knowing by her arte, that the King her Brother would bid his enemie battell within foure daies, she came to the Prince in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Palladine,</hi> séeing your affection is so forward, that you will assist my Brother in this warre against the King of <hi>Panonia,</hi> it is now high time to thinke on your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for I can assure ye, that within foure dayes the fight will begin. Nor can I entertaine any doubt or sorrow for the matter, because I haue alreadie foreseene, that our enemie will sustaine great detriment, losse and destruction onely by your noble and worthie behauiour, prepare yée therefore to set forward to morrow.</p>
               <p>Madame, answered <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> if it like you we will depart presently, the sooner shall we come to our iourneyes end. Not so, quoth she, you shall be ruled by my direction, for you haue time enough to trauaile thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So taking him and his freends into her Cabinet, she gaue the Prince a meruailous costly gréene Armour, to <hi>Broantine</hi> she gaue one of Azure couller, with a Shéeld, wherein was portrayed, how he deliuered the Knight and his Sonne from death: and to <hi>Liboran</hi> she gaue a carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Armour, figuring in his Sheeld, the Shepheards life he led by the Castell of <hi>Brulanfurior.</hi> As for you Sir <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> quoth she, I will not giue you any Shéeld, because, that you haue alreadie is better then any one héere, yea, beyond all other in the world, except one that is at <hi>London</hi> before your Fathers Pallace, which is reserued for one as yet vnborne, whose Father and Mother I knowe not, or the place from whence he is discended. After many other familiar spéeches, <hi>the knight without rest</hi> thus spake to the wise <hi>Orbiconte.</hi>

               <p>It was then concluded, that the Prince <hi>Almiden</hi> should leade the auantgard, the Duke of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Zorian</hi> the maine battell, and the Duke of <hi>Liburnia</hi> the ariergard: then were a legion of <hi>Dalmatians</hi> and <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyses</hi> appointed for the wings, being expert warriours with their Darts aboue all other nations.</p>

report the worthie déedes of <hi>the knight without rest,</hi> and theirs likewise that came in his companie, so that the King demaunded of whence and what the Knight was, who in his cause had behaued himselfe so brauely, whereto the messenger thus answered.</p>
               <p>My Lord, it is as yet vnknowne of whence he is, yet this I can assure ye, that he is one of the most goodly Gentlemen that euer I sawe.

But at the arriuall of this Knight, euen as some God had taken humane shape vpon him, our courage encreased, the huge Giant by his hand was slaine, and all the rest stood amazed, as doubting to fight, or turne their backs.</p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>Panonia</hi> (who was in person in the battell) sawe the onely man he trusted in thus confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with his Sonne, and fiue hundred men, he set furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously vpon vs, meaning to reuenge the Giants death if he could: but this heate lasted not long, for our men séeing the incredible magnanimitie of this Knight and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, followed him with such alacritie of courage, as the King and all his men were driuen on a heape, and had not a sudden winde and extreame storme fallen among vs, the King and his Sonne had béene slaine or taken. But the weather beating vpon our faces, we could not discerne which way they fled, till we espied them on the tops of the Mountaines: whereupon this Knight and his companions made after them, killing many of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the hilles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought backe with them fiftéene prisoners. For conclusion, I thinke our great Prophet sent this Knight, by whome, the Princes your Sonnes and all our liues are saued.</p>

And the good old King, very weake and crazie by reason of his late sicknesse, came in person to the

Pallace gate, accompanyed with all the Princes &amp; Lords of his Court, when his two Sonnes hauing humbly kissed his hand, <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> would haue done the like, but the King would not permit him, wherefore he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him in his armes, as though he had béene as great a state as himselfe.</p>
               <p>Gentle Knight, quoth he, welcome and frollick in our Court, for such report haue I heard of your vertue and prowesse, as neuer was I more desirous of any thing, then to see that worthie man, who with honorable paines la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in my seruice, hazarding your life and person, for him that neuer deserued such fauour and freendship.</p>
               <p>My Lord, answered <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious kindnesse exceedeth all report, in deigning to accept of me so honorably, I being but a poore and simple Knight errant, readie to passe straights of death in your seruice. Ah my Sonne, sayd the King, death hast thou alreadie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured for me, for which I cannot returne sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence: yet if I cannot requite you effectually, my good will shall not want wheresoeuer you be, in meane time, aske what you will, and be assured to speede. So taking him by the one hand, and his Sonne <hi>Almiden</hi> by the other, he went vp into the great Hall, where the Quéene, the Princesse, and all the Courtly Ladies, being choisely tricked in their brauest accoustrements, welcommed them with meruailous kindnesse, especially <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> who shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like the morning Starre among the other virgins, her courtesies to the Prince excéeded all comparison.</p>
               <p>These Courtly ceremonies ouerpassed, the Knightes were conducted to their chambers, to refresh themselues, and change their habites, while the roiall supper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. Now was <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> thoroughly set to worke, with consideration of the Princesse supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beautie, and longer would he haue continued in this rauishing studie: but that the Prince <hi>Zorian</hi> came to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise him, that the King stayed onely his comming. So
<pb facs="tcp:5290:68"/>
walked they together into the great Hall, where the King caused <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> to sit next him at the table, and the Princesse <hi>Nonparelia</hi> right ouer against him: a thing to her no little contentation, that she might behold the worthie personage, who had gained the onely priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her heart. All supper time, these two louers fed on no other viands, then the one regarding the other with piercing lookes: for their amorous affections so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maisterd their sences, as they forgot to receiue any suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The supper ended, the Lords and Ladies of the Court fell to dauncing: meane while, the Princesse <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelia</hi> hauing noted the gracious behauiour of <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> took the hardines vpon her to come néere him, and hauing with great modestie saluted him, thus spake.</p>
               <p>As I vnderstand Sir Knight, the King my Father and all his are highly beholding to you, in respect of your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paines in the late battell against our enemies.</p>
               <p>Alas Madame, quoth he, if I had not as then beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet doubtlesse you had béene assured of victorie, little then is the glorie that I haue deserued.</p>
               <p>Heerein you must pardon me Sir, aunswered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, for I haue heard credibly reported, that but for you we had lost the day: yet let me intreate so much fauour, as to tell me of whence you are, and what might be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this great kindnesse, that for my fathers sake you should so gladly thrust your life into danger.</p>
               <p>Madame, quoth he, so long since did your diuine name ouercome me, and such is your present authoritie ouer me, as death shall not make me conceale or disguise the truth to you. Knowe then sweete Lady, and hold it for certaine, that nothing procured me to assist the King your Father in his late warres, but onely your loue, beautie, and good grace: all which I haue heard so generally commended, as now I confesse report hath not feigned.</p>
               <p>In sooth my Lord, quoth she, such vertues as you speake of, are hard to be sound in me, but let it be as you please to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5290:68"/>
alleadge, yet no one is so much bound to thanke you as my selfe: for if the King my Father had lost the honor of the battell, too late had it beene for me to renew the peace, falling into the subiection of the verie worst man in the world, to whome my selfe denied the request of marriage, and héere hence grew the warre betwéene my Father and the King of <hi>Panonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much good Madame, quoth he, did I heare before, by the Gouernour of <hi>Enna,</hi> and the wise Lady <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> who intreated me and my companie verie honorably at her Pallace, and if in this action I haue done you any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, I account my labour well bestowed, and repute my selfe beyond all other in fortune: hauing disappointed a Prince so contrarie to the vertues and perfections, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your gracious nature is accompanied, for a man of so bad conditions, ought to haue sorted out one like to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>In déede my Lord, quoth she, you haue said the truth, notwithstanding, his euill disposed and deformed bodie made me not refuse him, but his great defect of vertue and honestie: for the gifts of the mind are to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those of nature, yet was he acquainted neither with the one or other. Longer would they haue continued in talke, but that the King commaunded to ceasse the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, because the Knightes should goe rest themselues in their chambers, wherefore the Princesse (breathing a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement sigh from her inward soule) gaue the courteous good night to <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> who hauing deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kissed her faire white hand, followed the King to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and there committing his highnesse to the fauour of the night, was by the two Princes brought to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they both louing him as he had béene their brother, especially <hi>Zorian</hi> the yongest, who determined to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him when he left the Court, and to séeke aduentures with him as a Knight errant.</p>
               <p>As each one thus departed to his lodging, the Princesse
<pb facs="tcp:5290:69"/>
called <hi>Broantine</hi> to her, and enquired of him what and of whence <hi>the knight without rest</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Madame, quoth <hi>Broantine,</hi> at this time I can hardly satisfie you, yet thus much I dare assure ye, as I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the wise Lady <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> that he is discended of royall linage, and one that I am especially bound to, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued vnspeakable fauours at his hands.</p>
               <p>In sooth, said the Princesse, he may well be said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of royall parentage, in that his ordinarie behauiour declares no lesse: but doo you knowe the cause of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into this Countrey, so slenderly accompanyed, and why he entred a quarrell nothing concerning himselfe?</p>
               <p>The cause (as I haue heard) good Madame, quoth <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antine,</hi> was the renowme of a Ladies beautie, famed through the world to excell the fairest.</p>
               <p>At these words, the Princesse began bashfully to blush, séeing these spéeches agréed with those the Prince himselfe spake, which encreased the amorous fire alreadie kindled in her heart: and that did <hi>Broantine</hi> very well perceiue, yet he dissembled as though he knew nothing. So depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Princesse to her chamber, and <hi>Broantine</hi> went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to <hi>the knight without rest,</hi> to whome, he reuealed his talke with <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> aduising him to follow a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so well begun, for there was hope of good successe to be expected. The Prince embracing <hi>Broantine,</hi> gaue him thanks for his freendly tidings: and the next day happened a notable occasion, both to the honor of <hi>the knight without rest</hi> and to assure him of the Princesse.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erie dangerous were the woundes of <hi>the knight without rest</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was constrained to keepe his chamber eight dayes together, in which time, the Princesse <hi>Nonpare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> sent often to vnderstand of his health, and went her selfe (as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie serued) to see how he did. But that which most of all gréeued these two louers, was, that they could not conferre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so secretly as they would: for she neuer went to him without companie of her Ladyes, whome she was loth to acquaint with her amorous desires. At length, as one desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be resolued of his affection towards her, one day she withdrew her selfe into her chamber, feigning to repose her selfe there all the after noone, hauing but two of her wayting Gentlewomen with her, the rest were sporting in the Garden and Orchard: and from her chamber she could goe to the Princes lodging, through the great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
<pb facs="tcp:5290:70"/>
vnséene of any, wherefore, accompanyed with her two Damosels, she came to <hi>the knight without rest,</hi> finding no bodie with him but <hi>Liboran,</hi> who generally through the Court was reputed dumbe, he seeing the Princesse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gaue place, walking to the windowe with the two Gentlewomen, where with signes and gestures he deuised with them, they taking great pleasure to behold him, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying his imperfection, because he was of stature comely, and gentle in conditions.</p>
               <p>While they thus beguiled the time with <hi>Liboran,</hi> their mistresse seeing she might safely conferre with <hi>the knight without rest,</hi> sate downe in a chaire by his bed side, and taking his hand to feele his pulses, giuing a great sigh, thus spake.</p>
               <p>Alas my Lord, pitie it is that honorable kindnes should be so hardly requited, and though your comming hither hath benefited the King and vs all, yet may you cursse our acquaintance, being bought at a price so déere and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>Not so good Madame, answered <hi>the knight without rest,</hi> I rather thinke the heauens specially fauoured me, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting my trauaile to this happie countrie: were it onely but to sée you swéete Lady, that mine eyes might behold the rare perfections, wherewith mine eares could neuer be glutted.</p>
               <p>You speake your pleasure of me my Lord, answered the Princesse, but were I endued with those titles which you giue me, yet are they farre inferiour to your noble desarts. But leaue this talke my Lord, and tell me how ye fare? and how you féele your wounds recouered? for nothing do I more desire, then to sée you well and frée from danger. Alas Madame, quoth he, the wounds I receiued in the combate against <hi>Sulberne,</hi> are nothing in respect of that I tooke when I sawe you first.</p>
               <p>The Princesse well vnderstanding his meaning, yet feigning the contrarie, thus replied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:5290:70"/>Why doo you not then acquaint the Kings Chirurgions therewith, who are reputed the most skilfull in all this Countrey? tell them your paine, and feare not, for all diseases are easily healed when they be soone taken in hand, and not suffered to enter the bodie too farre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or if you will not declare it to them, thinking (perhaps) they can giue you no remedie, boldly may you reueale it to me, as to the most secret fréend you haue in the world. And this I dare assure ye, that if your gréefe may be cured by humane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, my Aunt the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> can doo it effectually: and for her will I presently send a messenger, who will not faile to make all possible speede hither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The knight without rest</hi> well noting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princesse words, was so rauished in conceite, as he was not able to make any answere: but deliuering many a bitter sigh from the bottome of his hart, he lay as one confounded in a traunce. Why my Lord? quoth she, what think you on? dare you not discouer your disease to me? if you distrust me, I will binde my selfe to you by a sollenme othe, neuer to reueale it to any liuing creature: but will kéepe it as secret as your dumbe fréende that cannot speake, nor shall the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the worlde make me breake my promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Knight without rest</hi> would yet make no answere, but still sighing, with wonderfull affection behelde the Princesse: who now changing her cullour, and with the teares trikling downe her chéekes, continued her speeches thus. Beléeue me my Lord, me thinkes (vnder correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) you doo me wronge, in fearing to bewraye your gréefe to me, I beséeche ye (if you beare me any good will at all) not to make your harme vncurable by defaulte of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce to your freende, and consider that silence is the Nursse of many malladies: where contrariwise, disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same in time, the danger is with ease preuented. The woordes of the Princesse, deliuered with such zealous protestations, and with so many gracious offers: caused <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> (setting all doubtfull feares aside)
<pb facs="tcp:5290:71"/>
thus to answere. Madame séeing you haue coniured me in such sorte, and haue sollemnelye promised withall, to conceale the greefe that torments me, and cannot be séene: I will make known my harme vnto you. And as he would haue procéeded, a Gentleman entred the Chamber, to aduertise the Princesse that the wise <hi>Orbiconte</hi> was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariued, and that she came to visit the <hi>Knight without rest.</hi> As the Princesse was going to welcome her Aunt, she met her at the Chamber doore, and comming in againe with her, after she had humblye saluted her, she brought her to the Beds side, <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> being not a little glad to sée her, in consideration of the promise she made him at her Pallaice. Courage my Sonne quoth <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> for ere thrée dayes be past, I will make your woundes whole and sound, especially that which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your heart. It is not to be asked, whether these woordes pleased him or no, and she looking on his wounds, annointed them with a precious ointement, which healed them in suche sorte, as in foure and twentye howers the skarres could hardly be séene: then merilye to her Niece she thus spake. Doo not you hate this Knight, faire Niece, that hath kept you from marying with the King of <hi>Panopia</hi>? Beléeue me good Aunt, answered the Princesse, I am more beholding to this Knight then to any man els liuing, for he hath saued my life and honor: and may I any way recompence his gentlenes, he shall perceiue that I will not be ingratefull. But while the King my Father laboureth to requite his paines, let him be perswaded of my good will toward him.</p>
               <p>Madame quoth the Prince, so you continue me in your good grace, I thinke my selfe better recompenced, if I haue deserued any recompence at all: then were I presentlye created Emperour of the worlde. To breake off their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, a Squire came, who saide that the Tables were couered for Supper, wherfore <hi>Orbiconte</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse tooke their leaue, and went into the great hall, where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5290:71"/>
the King and the Quéene stayed their comming, who wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed their Sister with meruailous kindenes, spending the time of Supper with repetition of many matters. The Tables were no sooner with-drawen, but <hi>Orbiconte</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Niece aside to one of the windowes, began with her in this manner.</p>
               <p>Since my comming hither faire Niece, I haue percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that some thing tormentes ye excéedingly: reueale the occasion thereof to me, and if I may stand ye in any stéede for your helpe, be well assured I will doo it right willingly. The Princesse at these woordes was so astonyed, as she was not able to shape any answere: but shaking like a leafe on the trée, her cullour went and came very strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, such was her feare that her loue should be discouered. And hauing stayed in this quandarie a good while, at last she perswaded her selfe, that her Aunt by her secret know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vnderstood her gréefe, wherefore with the teares in her eyes, she thus replied.</p>
               <p>Let me intreate you good Aunt, to suffer me endure my mishap in silence, without constraining me to tell ye, from whence my great alteration procéedeth: it is vertue in a maiden to suffer patiently, and shame to bewraye her owne thoughtes, though euery hower addeth a worlde of miserie, and burdeneth her minde with more then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cares. Yet this I would haue ye to thinke, that my extremities (as yet) haue not stretched so farre, but to make me skilfull in iudging of a passion: from which heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I haue defended my selfe indifferently, accounting it an offence to modestie, to heare so much as spéech therof. <hi>Orbiconte</hi> desirous rather to encrease her passion then any way to diminishe it, thus recomforted her.</p>
               <p>You doo well (good Niece) in respect of your calling, to conceale the tormentes you endure, and which my arte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me withall ere I came hither, for it is a signe of speciall gouernement, to be carefull of disclosing such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, as carieth greatest regard among all women. But if
<pb facs="tcp:5290:72"/>
you are so liuely touched with loue, as your gentle hart may be empaired therby, by meanes of the woorthy <hi>Knight without rest,</hi> who hath doone more for you, then all your Fathers subiectes could without him: you must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that this is a disease common to euery one nor are you alone, or the first that hath felte the furie of this passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but many noble Ladies (bashefull and right modestlye gouerned) haue felt the power of the God of Loue, who ruleth and commaundeth when and where him pleaseth. For this cause expect the good houre, and before your infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie ranckle too farre, giue order and remedie thereto in the best sorte you can. I think it not amisse, that you make some experience of Loues authoritie, but you haue let him enter too farre within your hart that euen your very soule is penitrated therwith: the best and most auayling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile I can giue ye, is to practise some chaste and honest meane, wherby to enioy the summe of your desire, and so shall you preuent infamie and dishonor, which euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought carefully to auoide.</p>
               <p>Alas Madame, quoth the Princesse, I know no mean more honest then the mariage of him and I togeather, but how can that be compassed? or what honor is it to me to moue any spéeche therof? he is a stranger, vnknowen to me of whence or what he is, I am not acquainted with so much as his name. Assure your selfe faire Niece asnwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> that he is Sonne to a most vertuous King, as greatly renowmed as any one in the world: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will tell ye as concerning him, so you will promise and sweare to me to kéep it secret, for otherwise you shall put him in great danger of his life.</p>
               <p>Ah good Aunt, quoth <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> rather let me dye ten thousand deathes, then be the cause of any displeasure to him: therfore acquainte me with his estate, and I will be directed by you in all my after opinions. But by reason that the King arose and went to his Chamber, their talke drake off, the Quéene and her daughter conducting <hi>Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conte</hi>

Neither haue I good Niece answered <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> therfore presently will I be as good as my woorde. So walking with her into the Warderobe, and being none but them selues together, she began her discourse as followeth.</p>
               <p>Faire Niece, vnder assurance of the promise you made me yester night, I giue you to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> is a Christian, Sonne to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and his right name is <hi>Palladine,</hi> giuen him in honor of the wise Goddesse <hi>Pallas.</hi> And I hauing foreséene ere the time of his birth, that he should be the most vertuous and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb facs="tcp:5290:73"/>
Prince of his time, and the Children engendred by him, should very farre excell all other whatsoeuer: I then made choyse of him to be your Husband, séeing your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewise at that time great with Childe, and she deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of you sixe monthes after his birthe. That mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent might sorte to effect, and to make you the onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Lady of the world, by enioying a Husband the paragon among all Princes: I sollicited him by dreams and night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visions, yea, by letters and messages in such sorte, as by my meanes he trauailed hether, desirous to sée that rare beautye, wherwith I renowmed you beyond all other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And had it not béen for my dilligent admonition, he had ere this time béene maried to faire <hi>Rosamonde</hi> of <hi>Fraunce</hi>: where record remaineth of his famous chiualrie, as it dooth in many other places of the world. But neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is it to vse many woordes in this matter, you knowe that I desire nothing more then your aduauncement, and no man in the worlde is more accomplished with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, either in riches, vertue, braue minde, and all other good qualities: so that if my iudgement faile me not, I think him equall to you euery way, &amp; more woorthy to enioy you then any other. If you be deceiued Madame, said the Princesse, much more must I be then, for me thinkes it is impossible to finde his second: so would you haue said, had you but seene his valiant combate with the Giant <hi>Sulberne.</hi> If then quoth <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> you knowe so well what he is, he louing you as his own life, &amp; you him in like sorte: I would aduise ye, with all speede to consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the mariage betweene ye, albeit vnknowen to the King &amp; Queene, and let me deale for their good will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Alas Madame, quoth the Princesse, héerein would I willingly obay ye: but that in religion we are too farre a sunder. For that take you no care saide <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> in that before it be long, all your Fathers Kingdomes shall be conuerted to Christianitie: therfore boldelye make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to the Knight, that you will be baptised so soon as you

come into <hi>England,</hi> he hauing first sollemnely sworne to marrie with you, as well I knowe he hath no other intent. Héerewith shall his parents be well pleased, and yours heereafter likewise: for then and not before they shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that this is for your eternall honor and profit. <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> who desired nothing more then the conquest of his loue (and withall, the swéete benefite ensuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) whome she had made Lord and maister of her heart, thus answered.</p>
               <p>I knowe Madame, that my honorable preferment is the full of your intent, and that you will sheeld me from any blemish or reproch: I therefore commit all to your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will obey whatsoeuer you commaund me.

So went they both to the Princes chamber, where they found him walking with Captaine <hi>Broantine,</hi> one that knew the deapth of his desire, yet ignorant what <hi>Orbiconte</hi> and the Princesse had concluded. Many deuoute courtesies passed betwéene them, and <hi>Orbiconte</hi> taking the Prince aside, thus spake to him. You remember (my Lord) your vowe, when you called your selfe <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> that you would neuer entertaine quiet of minde, till you had found your onely beloued in the world, to whome you were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenied before your birth: now be of good chéere, for this night shall you be resolued of the Lady, who being frée in affection from all other, doth honor you with the vnspotted loue of a virgin, estéeming of you as her Lord and husband.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who giuing credit to the words of <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> sealed many a sweete kisse on the daintie lippes of <hi>Nonpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia,</hi> as pledges of a full contract in the sight of heauen, not to be recalled but by death onely.

their hands with sollemne and sacred vowes, he to carie her with him into <hi>England,</hi> and she there to receiue the faith of a Christian.

               <p>Ah my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quoth the Squire to this wounded Knight, you may well beléeue and hold for certaine, as I haue sayd to you many times, that loue can abide no companion: so by the often comming and going of this traytour to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame

                  <hi>Minoretta,</hi> he could not but seeke to deceiue ye, and to frustrate the hope you had in her: all which you must now endure with pacience, seeing we are all subiect to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes changes.</p>
               <p>If fortune then reward me with death, quoth the Knight, iustly may I accuse her of treason, as one that procureth all the mischiefes in the world. Ah traiteresse and wreakefull Lady, why didst thou not suffer me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that honor, which her diuine nature and beautie had grounded in my heart, and whereto I was sollemnely vowed and dedicated: Alas, I féele my strength more and more to forsake me. Ah <hi>Minoretta, Minoretta,</hi> what wilt thou say when thou hearest of my misfortune? I feare thy loue is rated at the price of thy life. Héerewith his speech failed him, and breathing foorth a vehement sigh, he yeelded vp the ghost. O my God, said his Squire, what shall I now doo? Where shall I bestowe the dead bodie of my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? if I returne to the Court of the King his brother, he will suspect that I haue murthered him. Ah sweete Lady <hi>Minoretta,</hi> what hart breaking will this be to you, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the death of my Lord, and the occasion thereof. The Knight of Fame hearing the sorrowfull words of the Squire, and fearing he would depart and leaue his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: came with his Squire from behinde the tree where they were hid, and seeing the wofull man holding his dead maister in his armes, thus spake to him. Tell me good fréend, how did this mishap befall thy maister? The Squire was so amazed, when by the light of the Moone he beheld the Knight of Fame, and his Squire with him, both their swords being drawne: as he was not able to returne any answere, whereby <hi>Don Robert</hi> perceiued, that the sudden sight of him affrighted the Squire, wherefore he thus spake to him againe. Why doost thou not speake to vs, my fréend? doubtest thou that we come to doo thée any displeasure? perswade thy selfe, that we will assist thee to our vttermost, and therefore feare not to bewray thy

mishap. The Squire throughly resolued by these cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous speeches, casting foorth many bitter sighes into the aire, and trembling as the burthen of his greefe gaue cause, thus answered. Alas my Lord, right gladly shall I reueale to you, the great misfortune now happened to my Lord, who (as you sawe) gaue vp his ghost betweene mine armes, the occasion whereof grew in this manner.</p>
               <p>My noble maister while he liued, was bastard brother to the King of <hi>Scicilie,</hi> yet as déerely beloued of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as if he had béene his lawfull legitimate brother, such was his vertuous and valiant behauiour: and for the King would assure my Lord of his intire good will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he gaue him the Signorie of <hi>Siracusa,</hi> with all the titles and benefites belonging thereto. But my woorthie Lord and maister, who was named <hi>Don Frionell,</hi> hauing about sixe moneths since heard commended, the excellent beautie of <hi>Minoretta,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Portugall:</hi> became so enamoured of her, as to compasse the means that he might sée her, he craued leaue of the King his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trauaile into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as a Knight errant, séeking after aduentures. Hauing obteined licence for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in stead of going to <hi>Fraunce,</hi> he tooke the way toward <hi>Portugall,</hi> where being arriued, so well he made knowne his prowesse at the Tilt and Tourney, which dayly hée maintained in honor of the Princesse, as the King enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him into especiall fauour: all the Lords and Knights of <hi>Portugall</hi> did the like, so that being well estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and honored of euery one, chéefely of the Quéene and her Ladyes, so well he could his Courtship to the Princesse <hi>Minoretta,</hi> that she accepted him as her Knight, and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him aboue all other that made loue to her.</p>
               <p>In this time came to the Court <hi>Don Galitreo</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> who no sooner sawe the faire Princesse, but presently he was so esprized with her loue, as he was readie to die at her foote, and therefore diuers times made offer of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to her: but she made no account thereof, declaring by

In sooth my Lord, answered the Hermit, he is not the first that hath béene murthered in this place, for I haue enterred fiftéene or sixteene in my little Chappell, which is kept with holie and religious deuotion: where if you please, the Knight you speake of may be buried, and I will helpe to carie him thither, for no other place is neere at hand by two good leagues and more.

As for me my Lord, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Knight of Fame, I can make no other proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then by this Squire that serued <hi>Don Frionell,</hi> in whose armes I sawe the Knight breathe his last, and dying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that the <hi>Castill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But she being recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and each one placed as they were before, <hi>Galitreo</hi> was sent for, to whome the King thus spake.</p>
               <p>Beléeue me <hi>Galitreo,</hi> I alwayes conceiued well of you till now, perswading my selfe of your truth and discretion, that nothing in the world could mooue ye so much as to thinke a bad thought, much lesse to commit any acte of treason. But what I say, this Knight auoucheth, that in <hi>Spayne</hi> you haue doone a deede of high dishonor, where you being armed and well accompanied, outragiously set vpon the noble Lord <hi>Don Frionell,</hi> he being naked and without defence, then and there you cruelly murdred him, yea, for a cause of no weight as I vnderstand: what answere make ye to this accusation? If <hi>Galitreo</hi> were then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully surprized, I referre to the iudgement of like bad min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men: but hauing beheld the stearne countenance of the Knight of Fame, with counterfeit reuerence thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
               <p>My Lord, not onely now, but at all times, calumnia-tours, and false accusers are easily found, the greater part of the auncient Romaine Histories are stored with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples thereof: but in the end, such bastard broode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractours, haue felt the desert of their lauish toongs, and innocencie hath vaunted with triumph. This speake I in respect of this paillard, who (vnder your Maiesties cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection hath falsly lied, and as a leaser is to be esteemed. For the woorthie Lord <hi>Don Frionell,</hi> was one of the dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest freends I had in the world: beside, I dare gadge my life, that this false wretch knowes me not, or euer saw me before this instant.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5290:78"/>
so my maister himselfe confessed at his latest gaspe, that because Madame <hi>Minoretta</hi> fauoured him, and despised you, therefore you wrought his death in that cruell man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Knight of Fame perceiuing, that <hi>Galitreo</hi> had no great mind to the combate, interrupted the Squire, and thus spake to the King. I sée well my Lord, that <hi>Don Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litreo</hi> despairing of his cause, desires to trifle the time with many circumstances, in that he thinketh me vnable to auerre mine accusation, because I want further testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, how he and his complices masked and disguised, did the shamefull déed of death and murther: may it therefore like your Maiestie to graunt vs the combate, and in fight will I make manifest his treason. Presumptuous as thou art, quoth <hi>Galitreo,</hi> doost thou thinke I feare to méete thée in plaine combate? no, so please my Lord the King, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thy challenge, and hauing giuen thee the due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a false varlet, will follow the quest of my déere freend <hi>Don Frionell.</hi> Him maist thou dead, quoth the Knight of Fame, soone enough to thy shame, not farre from the place where thou didst murther him, in a little Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the same Forrest, where I caused him to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as his Squire and mine owne are able to testifie. Héereupon, the King called two auncient Knightes, who hauing heard the difference betwéene the Knight of Fame and <hi>Galitreo,</hi> he demaunded their aduise in this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter. They thought it expedient, that the combate should be graunted them, to end the controuersie of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe: because <hi>Frionell</hi> might be slaine by the accuser and his Squire, as by <hi>Galitreo</hi> that stood accused. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King graunted them the combate at the Launce and Sword, as is common among all Knightes, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Marquesse of <hi>Villereal,</hi> and the Countie of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialne,</hi> Iudges of the feeld. All this while, the Princesse <hi>Minoretta</hi> continued her pensiue mones, praying for the prosperous successe of the newcome Knight, and the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the traitour <hi>Galitreo.</hi> On the morrow, was this

               <p>The Knight of Fame séeing himselfe so infortunate in obtaining a wife, so soone as his wounds were thoroughly cured, tooke his leaue of the King and departed, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent after he had seene his owne countrey, to trauaile into <hi>England</hi> againe, to be reuenged on <hi>Palladine,</hi> for the foyle he susteyned at the Ioustes at <hi>Paris,</hi> so mounting on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, he tooke his way directly toward <hi>Freezeland.</hi> And not able to continue there any long time, because his concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hate was such toward the <hi>English</hi> Prince, he trauailed thorough <hi>Scotland</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL this while remained <hi>Palladine</hi> with his faire <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> in the greatest pleasure and delight that could be imagined, till fortune, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious of their successe, sought to crosse them with her wunted fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse: which <hi>Orbiconte</hi> by her knowledge well perceiuing, and that now if she layd not to her hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

hand, all the promised good hap would be squandered for euer, to terrefie the two louers alittle, she came and brake it to them in this manner.</p>
               <p>It is a common saying, my good fréends, that dangers foretold, hurt the lesse when they come to passe, heereby am I to aduertise ye, that such a matter will shortly happen, as can not but be to your great disliking: yet be of good cheere, and endure it with resolued pacience, for I will preuent the effectuall working thereof. But to hold ye in no longer suspence, knowe, that this night past I made a figure, to vnderstand thereby, if your mariage were to be hindered by any contrarie accident: and I finde, that a mightie Lord, euen he that commaundeth ouer all these countries, will shortly send to request my Niece in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereto the King her Father will gladly giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>At these words the Princesse fell in a swoune, and <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> was meruailous impacient: but <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biconte</hi> hauing recouered her, in this sort began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade her. Why? faire Niece, doo you dispaire or doubt, that I can not hinder the mariage betweene you and the great Turke? knowe you not, that I haue done things of greater valew then that? I neuer thought you had such diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dence in me. Who brought Sir <hi>Palladine</hi> into this countrey but I? and who gaue you the honor of his loue, but I? and if I haue beene able to doo all this, thinke ye I can not wade through matter of lesse moment? Quiet your selfe, and feare not, but I will compasse your mariage to your owne content, without displeasing my Lord the great Turke, or the King your Father, notwithstanding his promise.</p>
               <p>Alas my good Aunt, said the Princesse, it is not for my Fathers ease, to purchase himselfe so great an enemie as is the great Turke, who in thrée dayes is able to ruinate our whole countrey: and hauing so bad a neighbour as is the King of <hi>Panoma,</hi> who doubtlesse would gladly with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5290:80"/>
the great Lord, in reuenge of the late foyle he sustayned, I see no way to preuent fatall danger.</p>
               <p>Why Madame? quoth <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie consisteth not in strength or multitude, but in the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of the Captaines, and discretion of the Souldiours to pursue an enterprise, as many examples are left among <hi>Romaines, Carthaginians, Athenians,</hi> and infinite other, where a small power hath preuailed against the greater, onely by the wise foresight of their leaders, and withall, hauing truth and iustice on their side. Let vs, said the Princesse, not stand vpon pollicie, or the truth of our cause, we can not be more subtill or hardie then they are: and as for our right in the matter, what reason shall my Father haue to denie so great a Lord? great I may boldly say, because in all the world he hath not his second, both in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, puissance, or any thing whatsoeuer. Alas good Niece, said <hi>Orbiconte</hi> merily, stand not on these doubtfull tearmes, for the case shall neuer be aduentured so farre: cast all your care on me, as yet (I thinke) I neuer fayled ye. So parted they to their chambers, where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse remained in a hell of greefe, such was her intire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Prince of <hi>England.</hi> And he likewise could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue on nothing, for now he thought to request the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in mariage, before the comming of the Ambassadors, perswading himselfe that the King would not deny him: then againe he dispaired of the matter, reputing himselfe vnlikely to enioy her, by reason of their contrarietie in faith and religion, the King being an earnest maintainer of the Pagan lawe. Nor would this imagination serue, wherefore he intended to steale her thence secretly, and to carie her with him into <hi>England,</hi> while <hi>Orbiconte</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at home to appease the trouble that might follow. In the end, he reposed himselfe on the faithfull promise of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biconte,</hi> and desired his Lady to doo the like, because he had found her so iust in all his former fortunes. But now are the Ambassadours come to the Court, where being
<pb facs="tcp:5290:81"/>
entertained with great pompe and royaltie, he that was appointed chéefe in the embassade, thus deliuered his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the King.</p>
               <p>King of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> the high and mightie Lord my maister being aduertised of the rare vertues wherewith thy Daughter is endued, hath sent me to intreate thée, that thou wouldest bestowe her on him in marriage: and in so dooing, he vowes himselfe thy fréend, and a continuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to thy ill willers.</p>
               <p>Heerewith he deliuered the Letters of credit, signed with the hand and scale of the great Turke: whereat the King no lesse ioyfull then amazed, that his Daughter should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise to so high fortune, without crauing any aduise in the cause, thus answered. I thanke my gracious Lord with all my heart, that he will so honor me with request of my Daughter in marriage: and her do I fréely giue him, with all that is mine at his disposing.</p>
               <p>Then did the Ambassadour present the King, sixe goodly Coursers of <hi>Turkie,</hi> sent him from his Lord and maister, and to the Princesse he gaue a sumptuous Carbanet, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Carbuncles, Orientall Pearles, and stones of inestimable valew, which she receiued with good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, albeit God knowes with a heauie heart, in which gréefe, <hi>the Knight without rest</hi> bare her company, yet durst not outward shew therof. This costly Iewell the Queene immediatly fastened about her Daughters neck, being commended for the rarest that euer was seene: afterward the King walked with the Ambassadours, dooing them all the honor he could any way deuise.</p>
               <p>While all the Court were busied, <hi>Orbiconte</hi> came with <hi>Nonparelia</hi> to <hi>Palladines</hi> chamber, and there concluded, that he should on the morrow take his leaue of the King, framing his iourney directly toward <hi>England,</hi> where the Princesse and she would in short time méete him: willing them to make no shew of sorrow at their departure, least suspition might preuent what she had intended, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5290:81"/>
them assuredly, that all her promises should sorte to effect. <hi>The Knight without rest</hi> did as he was aduised, and albeit it was long ere the King would giue consent, because he loued him very déerely: yet at length (with muche adoo) he preuailed, the Prince <hi>Zorian</hi> obtaining leaue of his Father to accompanie him in trauaile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Maiestie thought he could neuer haue a brauer companion. Many rich giftes the King bestowed on <hi>the Knight without rest,</hi> especially one of the Coursers sent him from the great Turke, and other thinges néedfull to be vsed in trauaile, and thus he prepared him selfe toward his iourney, reposing his confidence in the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> that she would bring his Lady safely into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Why my fréendes? are you so fearefull as you shewe your selues? doo you think any harme shall happen to you in my companie? am not I and my Niece sufficient for your assurance? what other safe conduct would ye haue? we goe into the land of our kindred and freends, to confirme a perpetuall peace and concorde, with one of the moste ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Princes in the world. My Nephewe the Prince <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> who departed (you knowe) with that gentle Knight: there is he louingly entertained &amp; fauoured, by him whom the Gods preordained to be my Nieces husband.

                     </gap>a</hi> Then <hi>Palladine</hi> declared the whole discourse of his voiage, how by the aduise of the wise <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> he had promised the Princesse <hi>Nonparelia</hi> (after she had receiued her Christendome) to take her in mariage, in that she was accomplished with as rare perfections of beawtie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as any Princesse in the world beside. You place that formost, quoth the King, which you loue best, preferring corporall beawtie before vertue: but héerein you are to be pardoned, for loue and affection so alter the sences, as makes men put one word in anothers place. I spake of that first my Lord, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> which I first sawe in so faire a creature, namely a choise grace of corporall beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and hauing afterward by frequenting her companie, gathered sufficient knowledge of her inward endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I placed them as they came to my acquaintance. And such is my hope, good Father, that your selfe wil iudge no lesse then I doo, when you haue seene her. For the rest, Madame <hi>Orbiconte</hi> her Aunt shall resolue ye, giuing you to vnderstand matters of weight, and such as you will thinke your selfe happie to knowe: this being the meane to bring to the Christian faith, the great and mightie Kingdome of <hi>Aquilea.</hi> Thou tellest me wenders my Sonne, quoth the King, but why didst thou not sooner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me heerewith? Because I feared, answered <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> that misfortune on the Sea might alter my intent, or the promise of <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> might be preuented by some other sinister meane. Well my Sonne, quoth the King, I pray that thy desires may haue a fortunate end, and such things as thou speakest of may come to passe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meane while, let vs prouide to receiue these two Princes, and make them such entertainement as their calling deserues. Foorthwith he commaunded, that the Pallace should bee adorned with most sumptuous Tapistrie, and calling for the Uiceadmirall, willed him to prepare certaine Ships, that might go meete the Ladies as they came, wherein
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5290:87"/>
                  <hi>Palladine, Zorian, Manteleo, Landastines,</hi> and many other great Lords were embarqued. And béeing come to the Ile of <hi>Tennet,</hi> they espied the Ships sayling amaine toward them, and entring among them, <hi>Palladine</hi> seeing <hi>Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conte</hi> aloft on the deck, knew well where the Princesse <hi>Nonparelia</hi> was: wherefore going aboord that Ship, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Orbiconte</hi> in his armes, he thus spake. Welcome good Lady into this Countrey, this day doo you giue me life, and the onely comfort I desire in this world: for had not your assurance at my departure from <hi>Aquilea</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me, I had ere this beene consorted with the dead. As he was thus embracing <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> the Princesse <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelia</hi> came foorth of her Cabin, and with a sweete smiling countenance came to him, saying. Haue you not doone yet my Lord? I am not content that you giue all the welcome to mine Aunt, and allow me no portion thereof, I thinke I haue deserued some part. At these words, he suddenly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Orbiconte,</hi> embraced his mistresse with such zealous affection, as neither of them were able to speake one word: in which time <hi>Zorian</hi> and the other Princes, had leisure to welcome the wise <hi>Orbiconte.</hi> During this time of greeting and salutation, they sayled on with so good a winde, as in short time they entred the Port of <hi>London,</hi> where this honorable companie were receiued with great magnificence, the Citizens conducting them thorough the streetes with such pompe and sumptuous deuises, as neuer was the like seene in <hi>London</hi> before. The King and Queene for the greater honor of their Sonne, came to the Court gate to welcome the Princesse, at whose rare beawtie as they did not a little wonder, so there wanted no kinde of courtesie, whereby their good will might at large be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. So walking on into the great Hall, there began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine new shewes of entertainement, whereby both <hi>Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conte</hi> and her Niece perceiued, that the Court of <hi>England</hi> was incomparable for gracious behauiour. While the King and Queene were conferring with <hi>Orbiconte, Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5290:88"/>
tooke his Lady aside to the windowe, where she at large declared to him, the dangers sustained in their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and their good deliuerance by the Admirall of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Broantine.</hi> Héerof sweete Lady, quoth <hi>Palladine,</hi> your Aunt already hath aduertised me, and I knowe assuredly, that you haue escaped greater perill then you can report to me, all for my loue, wherein I am religiously bound to you while I liue: yet heerewithall consider, that you haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all this for your faithfull freend and husband, who now bids you welcome as his loyall and espoused wife. Alas, my Lord, quoth the Princesse, you well knowe that I haue no other intent, and the sooner our nuptials are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, the better shall I be quieted, least any dishonor should ouertake me, in respect of what hath passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs heeretofore.

The Kings deuise was generally well liked, and the Princesse her selfe willing to vnderstand the rules, which were so farre different from her Pagan profession: in which exercise she had her whole studie and delight, till the time came that she should be Baptized.</p>

which likewise could not be discharged, but by her that was as much ouercome, as victorious in amorous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Now although these Statues were made of Marble, yet were they so excellently carued, and approching so neere to the life: as <hi>Venus</hi> (being attired in habit after the <hi>English</hi> manner) was able to entise the thoughts of a verie stayed person.</p>
               <p>Yet resteth one matter to declare, namely, that the man not deseruing the name of a louer, might not present himselfe before these Images: for the sight of such men was so offensiue to them, as they would disdaine to looke vpon them, and exalt themselues vp into the aire, because such vnwoorthie people should not touch them.</p>
               <p>Returne we now to Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> againe, he who by generall opinion had not his second in <hi>England,</hi> and by his new entraunce into the fellowship of the maried, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this estimation in his owne conceit: that he should beare away this long desired honor, in triall whereof so many had fayled héeretofore. Yet heerein his high opinion was beguiled, for he must yeeld and giue place to those whome the fates had especially appointed, to wit, his owne Sonne, the Prince <hi>Florano</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the faithfull Lady <hi>Pamphilia</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> his wife, as in their historie at large it is discoursed. For this cause, that the chéefest honor might remayne to him beyond all the other, he caused <hi>Broantine</hi> and <hi>Liboran</hi> to begin the triall first, then the Prince <hi>Zorian</hi> followed: yet all of them so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly fauoured, as they could not attaine to any shew of possibilitie. Which when <hi>Landastines</hi> and <hi>Manteleo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, the desire of glorie they had before, made them now of so high and resolute courage, as impacient of delay, they would not tarie for each other, attempting their fortune together: but this vnkindly heate caught such a sudden cooling, as their timeritie grew insupportable, whereby the Images turned their backs to them. Then they heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at

offended, said: that the vertue of loue (in this triall) had not his due, therefore they ought not to be any way dishabled. As for this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So such as had not exquisite beawtie, and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie to be tearmed incomparable: were repulsed thence with such discontent, as the open foyle was more gréeuous then death to them. <hi>Palladine</hi> heereat thoroughly moued, yet more reioycing at anothers fault, then distrusting his owne sufficiencie: aduanced himselfe, and proffering his owne hand to the Torche, and the other to the Bowe, the Images (making obeysance, and shewing amiable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to him) mounted vp on high from him, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such a laughter among the Ladies, as if they had séene a spectacle of greatest meriment. <hi>Erinnea</hi> Duchesse of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandria,</hi> and wife to <hi>Liboran,</hi> with <hi>Doronea</hi> wife to <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antine,</hi> newly created Duke of <hi>Bastanella,</hi> in their triall, the Images turned their backs to them: <hi>Graciana, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina,</hi> and <hi>Florea</hi> had but little more credit, sauing that the Images mooued not from them.</p>
               <p>But now came <hi>Nonparelia</hi> to her turne, and her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour procured a generall contentment: for <hi>Venus</hi> let her touch the Torche, and set the Crowne on her shoulder, but tooke it back againe immediatly: thereby prefiguring, that she being, had now lost her libertie.</p>
               <p>When they sawe the aduenture could not be ended, the Ladyes betooke them to their Scaffoldes, and the Knightes entred the Lystes, to make better proofe of their fortune by Chiualrie. <hi>Landastines,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antine, Mushell</hi> of <hi>Rostock.

Know you then, that the Knight of the Phenix was the Prince <hi>Caesar,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Othon</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Roome</hi> then reigning, and husband to the faire <hi>Rosamond</hi> of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who hearing of the honorable Triumph at the marriage of the Prince <hi>Palladine,</hi> and the aduenture of the Statues before the Court at <hi>London:</hi> trauailed thither, to win the conquest of the one, and credit of the other, that at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his best beloued, he might obtaine the greater grace and fauour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> beeing thus entred the Lystes, and noting the braue chiualrie shewen by the Princes, stood still a good
<pb facs="tcp:5290:91"/>
while, till he sawe both the sides make offer of departure. But fearing to be reprooued for his long stay, as though by cowardise he durst not trie his fortune, he first encountred one of the Prince <hi>Zorians</hi> Knights, and threw him to the ground with his héeles vpward. Seauen or eight more of them he serued in the like sort, till <hi>Landastines</hi> would néedes deale with this Champion: but <hi>Caesar</hi> met him with such violence, as both horsse and man was sent to the ground.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Norgalles</hi> desirous to reuenge this shame, called for a fresh Horsse and a Launce: and calling his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to Ioust againe, as he made proffer to begin his carire, the Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> thus spake to him.</p>
               <p>Good Sir be not offended with him, who hath saluted you with a courtesie common among Knightes errant: but enduring the same with pacience, giue the like to such as hazard them selues against you.</p>
               <p>I feele no taste of courtesie, quoth <hi>Landastines,</hi> in such gréetings, and thou mayst happen to confesse the same with him thou next assaylest, notwithstanding all thy brauerie in speeches. By proofe, said <hi>Caesar,</hi> I shall be made perfect, a fierce assaylant shall be assured of a braue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. So breaking off this contention, he gaue the spurres to his horsse against <hi>Zorian,</hi> giuing him such a vough charge at the encounter, as he was cast quite out of his saddle.</p>
               <p>At this sight were <hi>Palladine</hi> and <hi>Manteleo</hi> greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, whom the King (for the earnest loue he bare them) would not permit to beare Armes in this Tourney, but caused them to accompanie their Ladies on the Scaffold, and to giue iudgement who best deserued: they (as I said) mooued with the behauiour of the Knight of the Phenix, came to the King with great reuerence, <hi>Palladine</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these spéeches.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the reuerence and dutie that children owe to their Parents, hath made vs remaine idle among these
<pb facs="tcp:5290:92"/>
Ladies, during the honest exercise of our fréends and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, estéeming to contradict your commaund, were an offence more then presumptuous. But now are our desires so stirred and prouoked, as we can no longer containe our selues in slothfulnes, but are enforced humbly to intreat, that your highnesse would giue vs leaue to Arme our selues, onely to teach this newcome Gallant, who thinks alreadie he hath made a conquest, that in <hi>England</hi> are Knights, sprung from the race of the chéefest of the round Table, who are not to be feared with seeing thrée or foure men vnhorssed.</p>
               <p>My Sonne, quoth the King, my commaund was to no other end, then to withhold ye from the thing you haue now desired, because assayed new Combates without Armes, you should not be endaungered by two trials to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, considering how the one may be a hinderance to the other: and so doubtlesse would it come to passe at this instant, were I not fully perswaded, that honor neuer breakes companie with true loue, but more and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth his titles, to the great encouragement of all noble mindes. Therefore my Sonnes, doo what you please, I will not hinder ye: go in Gods name, and returne with the full of my desire.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus obtained what they would, they departed to their lodgings, returning soone armed and well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and passing by the Scaffolds, <hi>Palladine</hi> intreated his <hi>Nonparelia,</hi> to giue him one of her Bracelets, wherewith he might enter the Ioust vnder her fauour.

And that your desire may be the more satisfyed, I will bring ye to the man you imagined me to be, and likewise you shall knowe, with whome you haue now twise dealt without aduantage. My name is <hi>Mante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo,</hi> Sonne to the Duke of <hi>Millayne,</hi> and Brother by marriage to the Prince <hi>Palladine</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed humours among new married folkes, had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Palladine</hi> in such sort, as he sawe not when <hi>Manteleo</hi> thus ventured before him: yet afterward, séeing two ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies so louingly embrace, he meruailed who the Knight of the Phenix should be, at length these two pacefyed came toward the Prince, and in offering to salute him, this cause of stay hindered them.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Palladine</hi> was fastening his Ladies Bracelet about his arme, a Squire came before him, who on his knees presented him a Letter, saying. Worthie Lord my Lady and Mistresse the Duchesse of the rich Isles, whome you verie well knowe, commending her selfe to your good grace, hath sent you this Letter: desiring as the latest good you will doo her, to aunswere the same with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient spéed.</p>

he brake open the Seale, and opening the Letter, read there these lines following.</p>

               <p>My Sonne, answered the King, séeing the marriage is accomplished, it is too late to be blamed, or now to vse spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in this behalfe, which are but friuolous and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
