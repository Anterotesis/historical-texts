         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu cannot but <hi>Rememember,</hi> and I should
not have <hi>this</hi> Occasion of Telling you
<hi>so,</hi> if you did not <hi>well</hi> Remember,
That many months are not passed since
You encountred a Dangerous <hi>Fever;</hi> by which
the <hi>Vital Ty</hi> between what must <hi>Return to God
that gave it,</hi> and what must <hi>Return into the Earth
as it has been there,</hi> was very near burned asunder
in you; But <hi>God had then mercy on You, and not on
You only, but on me also, lest I should have had sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
upon sorrow.</hi> It was a darker Time in your
<hi>House,</hi> than (thro' Grace) with your <hi>Soul,</hi> when
we beheld You lying under what look'd like an
<hi>Arrest</hi> laid on you by the cold Hand of <hi>Death,</hi>
and saying, <hi>I shall go the gates of the Grave, I am
deprived of the Residue of my years.</hi> But the <hi>Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
which if you study to <hi>be</hi> a Blessing you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
want, was then your priviledge; even, <hi>To
be much</hi> pray'd <hi>for;</hi> and behold, the Effect of those
our Applications to the <hi>God of your Life!</hi> On
<hi>that</hi> very day when your faithful and worthy
<pb facs="tcp:42919:3"/>
Pastor the Reverend <hi>Charles Morton,</hi> with your
pious Neighbours were together <hi>praying</hi> for You,
we had our Answer, and You are yet alive. <hi>The
living, the living, they shall praise God;</hi> and <hi>You</hi>
have a blessed <hi>Opportunity,</hi> I hope not without
some <hi>Inclination</hi> to be doing so. Twas from <hi>such</hi>
an Inclination, that your <hi>Vowes</hi> did accompany
our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and your Sickness expired in Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<hi>To endeavour the doing of something for
the Service of the Churches here,</hi> and this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
<hi>By the Publication of some little</hi> Book, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
unto the Designes of</hi> Practical Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>in the Persons and Houses of this professing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
Tis pitty indeed that ever any <hi>special Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
or any <hi>special Mercy</hi> should befal us, without
producing some <hi>special service</hi> to the Name of our
God, upon whose <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Errands</hi> every such
Dispensation comes. Accordingly, you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to give you certain <hi>Discourses,</hi> which
You thought agreeable to your serious <hi>purposes;</hi>
and <hi>These</hi> are They. Unto <hi>You</hi> first I ought to
make the <hi>Dedication</hi> of them; because it is by
your <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Expence</hi> that they are to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

These Composures are <hi>singled out</hi> from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Effects of my <hi>Daily Studies,</hi> not because of
any <hi>singular</hi> Excellency adorning of them; for
<pb facs="tcp:42919:3"/>
they are but the first, rude, untranscribed Notes
of <hi>Sermons</hi> uttered in my ordinary Course of
Preaching more than once or twice commonly
in a Week; and strangers abroad in the world
may without the least wrong to <hi>me,</hi> believe,
That <hi>New-England</hi> is a Countrey wherein there
are every week in the year delivered more than
Two <hi>Hundred Sermons,</hi> to be preferred unto the
<hi>Best of</hi> These. But <hi>these</hi> are by You pitch't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because they are most Expressive of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,</hi>
and <hi>Exercises</hi> and <hi>Experiences,</hi> which
your self would choose to recommend unto the
Children of your People; and tho they may
amount to no better than <hi>Goat's hair</hi> and <hi>Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins,</hi>
it was thought they might be accepted
among, <hi>Small offers to the Service of the Taberacle.</hi>
There was once a great King, to whose Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
while many others made their more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Offerings,</hi> a poor man in some Transport of
Affection, having nothing else, took up his
palm-full of water from the street, and offering
of <hi>That,</hi> Received from the generous <hi>Conquerour</hi>
a Gracious <hi>Recompance.</hi> Even such a <hi>King</hi> is our
God! Sr. You have chosen to fetch a <hi>Thank-Offering</hi>
for <hi>Him,</hi> from such a <hi>Kennel,</hi> such a <hi>Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
(alas, it is no better!) as the Head and
Heart of the <hi>greatest Sinner in all the Rising Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
But I can only say, Tis as welcome from
<hi>me</hi> to <hi>You,</hi> as I believe, tis from <hi>You</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:42919:4"/>
made us <hi>Both.</hi> It is indeed a peice of <hi>Self-Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
that your Commands have obliged me unto;
for whatever others may think of <hi>Appearing in
Print,</hi> my own Opinion of it is, that unless a
man be extremely unacquainted both with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and with the world, he will be rather <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid</hi>
or <hi>Asham'd</hi> of it, than <hi>Taken</hi> with it; Let
him that wants <hi>Humbling</hi> become an <hi>Authour,</hi>
and he shall have it, if <hi>mean Thoughts</hi> have not
made him utterly <hi>Vnsensible.</hi> Nothing but a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
unto the <hi>Interest</hi> of God and of Truth, and
a <hi>Resolve</hi> to go cheerfully thro' much Contempt,
Obloquy, Detrectation, can make any <hi>considerate</hi>
Person to Salute mankind in the Quality of a
<hi>Writer.</hi> But Since it is my <hi>Duty</hi> to be (like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Bradford</hi>) alwayes doing <hi>Good,</hi> with <hi>Tongue,</hi>
or <hi>Pen,</hi> or <hi>Purse,</hi> I should account it my <hi>Honour</hi>
if my <hi>Pen</hi> may be employed for any Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Practical Godliness,</hi> tho' it Cost me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many <hi>Temptations,</hi> as it must cost me
not a few.</p>
            <p>Accept then, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> the Little Book which
You have called for; I may more fairly speak
it than he of old unto his Father, <hi>I have done
according as thou badest me; arise, I pray thee,
Sit, and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless
me.</hi> The Blessing which once <hi>Caleb</hi> gave to a
<hi>Son-in-law</hi> as I do not <hi>Want,</hi> I need not <hi>Ask;</hi>
But the <hi>Blessing</hi> which I am now Craving is,
<hi>That</hi> of your <hi>Prayers</hi> on my Behalf, to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Eternal
<pb facs="tcp:42919:4"/>
               <hi>Father,</hi> for such <hi>Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> and
<hi>Improvements,</hi> as tis <hi>His Work alone</hi> to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; and especially that I may be preserved
from the <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Snares</hi> which <hi>Ministers</hi> in their
younger years are most endangered by; of which
I have long thought PRIDE (the natural
Effect of <hi>Self-Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Small Experience</hi>)
to be the principal. The Prayers of one so <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi>
have an <hi>Authoritative Blessing</hi> in them;
and that I may further <hi>earn</hi> them, I take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to mention my own Supplications unto
the God of Heaven for <hi>Yourself.</hi> May the
Almighty God Long preserve your Life, and
give your <hi>Hoary Head</hi> to be <hi>found in the way of
Righteousness.</hi> May You have before you the
Exemple of that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who was, <hi>A man
come to seek the welfare of the Children of Israel;</hi> of
that <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who was, <hi>A Devout man, that
jeared God with all his House, and pray'd to
God alwayes;</hi> of that Treasurer, who made
the <hi>Bible</hi> his perpetual Companion, and <hi>Beleeved
with all his Heart:</hi> and as You have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<hi>Do Good unto all men.</hi> May the <hi>Death</hi>
(I dare not say, the <hi>Loss</hi>) of your <hi>Ten Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
the last of which going from you made
a <hi>Tenth Wave</hi> in your Tryals, only promote
your <hi>Vnion</hi> &amp; <hi>Communion</hi> with Him who is <hi>Better
than Ten sons;</hi> and may you enjoy in the <hi>House</hi>
of God, a <hi>Place</hi> and a <hi>Name better than that of
<pb facs="tcp:42919:5"/>
sons</hi> &amp; <hi>daughters.</hi> May all the <hi>Storms</hi> besides those
which the Adventures of your younger years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Atlantic Ocean,</hi> made you betimes acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
withal, in an unstable &amp; a tempestuous World,
prove so many fresh &amp; fair Gales, to be friend your
<hi>late</hi> but <hi>sure</hi> Arrival unto the <hi>Rest which remains for
the people of God;</hi> Wherein the <hi>Anchor</hi> of your
<hi>Hope,</hi> is already Cast, and where to You are
with the more-than-half Furled <hi>Sails</hi> of <hi>Time</hi>
hastening apace, after him that said, <hi>I desire
to</hi> loose Anchor <hi>and be with Christ, which is by
far the best of all.</hi> Tis by these Prayers that
I would approve my self,</p>

Retaining of <hi>Idolatry</hi> among many, while he was

your selves if you leave Him, or <hi>excuse</hi>
your selves if you grieve Him. <hi>Therefore</hi> are
you to <hi>fear</hi> Him, <hi>serve</hi> Him. Every <hi>Mercy</hi> of
God hath a <hi>Therefore,</hi> in it; it calls for Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42919:7"/>
and Obedience. When God has been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to us, even <hi>common</hi> Ingenuity, end much
more, <hi>holy</hi> Ingenuity will put us upon that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<hi>What shall I render to the Lord?</hi> Behold
an Answer in this, <hi>Therefore!</hi> We are <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
to <hi>fear the Lord and serve him;</hi> we are
<hi>Therefore</hi> to put away all our <hi>Idols,</hi> all our <hi>Follies</hi>
for ever more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A <hi>Copy.</hi> He gives them a <hi>Precedent,</hi>
an <hi>Exemple,</hi> to induce them hereunto. The
Pattern of a <hi>considerable person,</hi> has no inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Influence upon the Observers of it. Such
an one does <hi>good</hi> or <hi>ill,</hi> even like a <hi>Briareus,</hi>
with an <hi>Hundred</hi> Hands. An <hi>Hundred,</hi> &amp; an
<hi>Hundred</hi> more will do like <hi>Him.</hi> If he be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
he does according to the Language of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Speak with his Feet.</hi> If he be Godly,
he is, according to the Character of <hi>Iohn,</hi> a
<hi>Voice,</hi> Such an One most effectually bespeaks
all about him, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did once, <hi>Do what you
see</hi> me <hi>to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Ioshua</hi> enforces his <hi>farewel Exhortation</hi>
here; saith he, <hi>Be it known to you, that I and my
house will serve the Lord;</hi> I was once your <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
pray let me be <hi>so</hi> still. As I leadd you into
the <hi>Canaan</hi> of the Lord, let me have so much
credit with you, as also to lead you unto the
<hi>Service</hi> of the Lord. Be assured, I shall be a

now receive me as a <hi>Copy</hi> for you.</p>

<hi>A Fearing of God,</hi> and <hi>A Loving of God,</hi> as
it refers to the <hi>Frames</hi> of our hearts, <hi>with</hi> which
we are to do it. It is called, <hi>A Knowing of

likewise a <hi>Living</hi> to Him, and <hi>Walking</hi> with
Him, on the same accounts that it is a <hi>Serving</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Service</hi> of God notes two things, which
are to accompany our whole <hi>Duty</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>It notes, first, the <hi>Homage</hi> therein done to
our God. The <hi>Service</hi> of God is His <hi>Worship,</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s
<hi>natural</hi> Worship, and His <hi>appointed</hi> Worship.
Hence the <hi>Septuagint</hi> so translate our Text, <hi>I
and my house will</hi> worship <hi>the Lord.</hi> We <hi>serve</hi>
God, when we render to him his <hi>Natural</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
So tis intimated in <hi>Deut. 10. 12. Fear
the Lord thy God, walk in His waies, love him, &amp;</hi>
serve <hi>the Lord thy God with all thy Heart.</hi> When
we <hi>hope</hi> in God, when we <hi>call</hi> on God, when
we <hi>cleave</hi> to God, then we <hi>serve</hi> Him. And we
<hi>serve</hi> God when we render to Him his <hi>appointed</hi>
Worship. This was intended in <hi>Exod. 8. 1.
Let my people go, that they may serve me.</hi> We
<hi>serve</hi> Him when we <hi>observe</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God,
when we adore him according to the Rules of
His Word in His <hi>House,</hi> and wait upon him
in the use of his blessed and sacred <hi>Institutions.</hi>

And this the rather, because of another Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

to be done by men which <hi>God</hi> is not the Doer of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
otherwise, men would themselves be the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals</hi>
in procuring their own Salvation. But
one scope of our Lord's Death was even to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
for us, that <hi>Grace,</hi> that <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>Free-Will,</hi>
which may qualifie us to enjoy the <hi>Virtue</hi>
and <hi>Success</hi> of it. Certainly <hi>Peter</hi> was more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
unto the Merit of Christ for <hi>his</hi> Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than <hi>Iudas</hi> was for <hi>his.</hi> Yet the <hi>Purchase</hi>

                     <p>For <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Christ has made
our <hi>Serving</hi> of God, a <hi>possible thing.</hi> Had it not

Lord Jesus has bought us all into such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

                  <head>PROP. III.</head>
                  <p>Every man should engage HIS HOUSE also
in the <hi>Service</hi> of the Almighty God. We are
all related unto some <hi>House</hi> or other. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a <hi>Nation</hi> is called by that name. So tis
said in Exek. 3. 1. <hi>Speak to the</hi> House <hi>of Israel.</hi>
And thus, every man should labour to promote
the Service of God in the <hi>Nation</hi> which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto. All that can be properly done by
him for his <hi>Nation,</hi> in his <hi>Station</hi> to set <hi>up</hi> and

is to do, if ever he would give a good Account

But most usually, a <hi>Family</hi> is called by this

Tis a <hi>Metonymie;</hi> the <hi>House</hi> is put for them
who <hi>dwell</hi> in the house. Those who cohabit in
the <hi>same house</hi> are to endeavour that the <hi>same God</hi>

that are <hi>Vnder</hi> us, are by us to be drawn or

                     <p>First, The <hi>Commandment</hi> of God calls for it.
We have this <hi>Commandment</hi> often repeated unto
us, That we should be careful about the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi>
and <hi>Conversion</hi> of them that we are

                        </gap>lcated
in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament. We have in Deut. 6.

diligently</hi> teach <hi>them unto thy</hi> Children. We have
it again, in Psal. 78. 67. <hi>He commanded our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they should make known unto their</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>that these might set their hope in God, and
keep his Commandments.</hi> We have it once more
in Deut. 4. 9, 10. <hi>Gather the people, that they
may learn to fear me, and that they may</hi> teach <hi>their
Children.</hi> Tis a <hi>Commandment</hi> not unmention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>New</hi> Testament also. We find in <hi>Eph.
6. 4. Ye</hi> Fathers, <hi>bring up your</hi> Children <hi>in the

How many solemn Charges are laid upon us to
do our part, that God may be <hi>served</hi> by all that
are under our Inspection. God does <hi>Command</hi>
us, to <hi>command</hi> them, thereabout.</p>
                     <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Interest</hi> of God calls for it.
Our Lord said unto a <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Ioh. 21. 15. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
thou me?—Then Feed my Lambs.</hi> The
like may be said unto a <hi>Master,</hi> If thou doest
<hi>love</hi> God, then bring thy <hi>lambs</hi> to <hi>serve</hi> Him.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42919:14"/>
To propagate <hi>Religion</hi> is to magnify and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the Lord. It is said in Prov. 14. 28. <hi>In the</hi>
multitude <hi>of people is the Kings honour:</hi> as tis
said of an earthly, so may it be said of the
Heavenly King. Now if we cause our <hi>Houses</hi> to
<hi>serve</hi> God in Conjunction with our selves, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we propagate <hi>Religion;</hi> yea, to many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
I remember, <hi>Solomon</hi> assigns this as one
Cause, why he did well educate his own <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
twas because his father had so dealt with
<hi>him;</hi> Saith he in <hi>Prov. 4.</hi> begin. <hi>Hear ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the instruction of a father; for I was my father's
son, and he taught me.</hi> Let us fix <hi>our</hi> children in
the <hi>Service</hi> of God, and they will afterwards do
do so by <hi>theirs.</hi> Thus the Lord will alwaies have
<hi>A seed to serve him, which Will be accounted for a
generation.</hi> Our <hi>Children,</hi> did I say? yea, our
<hi>Servants</hi> too, may in like manner carry on a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Service</hi> to the Lord. It was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1. <hi>King. 10. 8. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are these thy servants, which hear thy wisdome.</hi>
Now many ages after, we find the posterity of
them <hi>Servants,</hi> retaining a savour of Devotion
and Affection to the House of God.</p>

                     <p>We should engage our <hi>Houses</hi> to the <hi>Service</hi>
of God, out of Respect to our Houses too. Tis
said <hi>A righteous man regards the life of his beast.</hi>
How much more will a <hi>righteous man</hi> regard the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42919:14"/>
state of his <hi>House?</hi> We have two things also
to be particularized here.</p>
                     <p>First, our <hi>Houses</hi> are <hi>miserable</hi> thro' us, if they
do not <hi>serve</hi> God. It is hinted as a most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
misery upon any person, in <hi>Prov. 5.
35. He shall dy without instruction.</hi> Fearful and
woful will be the case of those in our <hi>Houses,</hi>
whom our <hi>Instruction</hi> shall not endear the <hi>Service</hi>
of God unto. Our <hi>Houses</hi> are <hi>starving,</hi> while
our God is not <hi>serving</hi> in them. The Prophet
said in <hi>Lam. 2. 11. Mine eyes do fail with tears,
because the children swoon in the streets of the city;
they say to their mothers, where is the corn?</hi> O
doleful spectacle! But while our Children are
strangers to God, there is a worse <hi>Famine</hi> in
our <hi>Houses,;</hi> we suffer their Souls to pine and
perish without the <hi>Bread</hi> of life. Yea, our
Houses are <hi>Burning</hi> while our God is not <hi>Serving</hi>
in them. What a terrible desolation was that
on <hi>Sodom!</hi> in allusion to which, tis said of a
wicked man, in <hi>Iob. 18. 15. Brimstone shall be
scattered upon his habitation.</hi> Why, there is a
dreadful storm of ardent Brimstone, ready to
fall upon those <hi>Houses,</hi> where the Children are
not bringing up for God; the Wrath of God,
like an <hi>horrible Tempest</hi> of burning Brimstone is
impending over them. What shall I say more?
Our poor Children are enslaved unto Satan, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they come to be <hi>serving</hi> of God. If a <hi>Devil</hi>
had a <hi>Bodily</hi> Possession of our Children, how
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42919:15"/>
impatient should we be to see them delivered?
We should cry out like the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
in <hi>Matth. 15. 22. Have mercy upon me, O Lord,
my child is grievously vexed with a devil.</hi> But
know, the Devil has a <hi>spiritual</hi> Possession of our
Children, till they come to <hi>serve</hi> the Lord; the
<hi>evil spirit,</hi> he takes them, he tears them, and
they <hi>fome</hi> and <hi>pine,</hi> and are thrown into the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and into the <hi>fire.</hi> O pitty them; if we are
not more stupid than the <hi>Ostrich,</hi> pitty we our

                     <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are <hi>Accountable</hi> for our <hi>Houses,</hi>
if they do not <hi>serve God.</hi> As the Daughter of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> said unto the Mother of <hi>Moses,</hi> in <hi>Exod.
2. 9. Take this child and nurse it for me, and I
will give thee thy wages.</hi> Thus does the Lord
say unto us; <hi>Take these children, take these young
ones, and bring them up to</hi> serve <hi>me I will reward
thee for it.</hi> The Apostle saies, of Ministers, <hi>They
watch for souls, as they that must give an account;</hi>
so it may be said of all House-keepers, <hi>They must</hi>
give an account <hi>of the souls that belong unto their
Families.</hi> Twas confessed by the Prophet in the
Parable, 1. King. 20 39. <hi>Behold a man turned
aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep
this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall
thy life be for his.</hi> This, This is a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to come to pass in the dreadful Day of
God. Man, <hi>Thy life shall be for</hi> his <hi>life, who did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42919:15"/>
not</hi> serve <hi>God, because thou didst not teach him,</hi>
and <hi>Thy</hi> soul shall be for <hi>his</hi> soul, who is lost for
ever, because thou didst not look after him.
<hi>Iacob</hi> could say to his Uncle about his Lambs,
<hi>That which was torn of Beast, of my hands didst
thou require it.</hi> Behold, thou hast <hi>Lambs</hi> in thy
<hi>Fold,</hi> Little ones in thy House; God will
strain for it,—if wild beasts, and Lusts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
any of them away from the <hi>Service</hi> of God
through any neglect of thine, thou shalt smart
for it in the fiery prison of God's terrible Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

do not <hi>you</hi> stand out. Hearken, ye immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
souls; You have the call of <hi>Christians</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
you into this happy <hi>Service.</hi> All the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Believers of the By-past-Ages, the men, <hi>of
whom the world was not worthy,</hi> all these do with
<hi>one</hi> voice, and a <hi>loud</hi> one, urge this upon you;
<hi>Come and</hi> serve <hi>our God, as we have done before
you.</hi> Even <hi>Iames</hi> himself, the <hi>Kinsman</hi> of the
Lord is ambitious rather of this Denomination
<hi>The</hi> Servant <hi>of the Lord.</hi> And puissant Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
before now, have gladly espoused, such
a Title as that, <hi>The Vassals of the Lord.</hi> More
than this, you have the Call of <hi>Angels</hi> to incite
you thereunto. Those bright <hi>Morning stars</hi>
ask this of you, <hi>Will you come and move in our
Sphaere?</hi> They all are the <hi>servants of the Lord,</hi>
and they <hi>do his pleasure.</hi> At his Beck they clap
their <hi>silver wings,</hi> and they <hi>do his Commandments.</hi>
An <hi>Angel</hi> said once to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, <hi>I am
thy Fellow</hi>-Servant. That <hi>Angel</hi> is yet alive; &amp;
he makes the motion to every one of us, <hi>Wilt
thou be my Fellow</hi>-Servant <hi>before the Lord?</hi> Yea,
the SON of GOD Himself gives you this
Call. Of Him saith our God, in Isa; 42. 1.
<hi>Behold my</hi> Servant! Shall God say thus of
<hi>Christ?</hi> and shall. He not say it of <hi>thee?</hi> O
do not scorn to be the <hi>Servant</hi> of that GOD,
who has for a <hi>Servant,</hi> Him whom all the Third

Heaven is with endless Raptures adoring of.</p>
               <p>Consider, yet again, What your Service <hi>is,</hi>
while you <hi>serve</hi> the Almighty God. No <hi>Service</hi>
was ever so delightsome as this? tis, <hi>All peace,</hi>
and <hi>perfect peace.</hi> No Service was ever fo <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi>
it brings in those things, <hi>The gain whereof
is better than fine Gold;</hi> you shall be sure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
the Truth of that Maxim, <hi>God is a
Rewarder.</hi> No Service was ever so <hi>Honourable.</hi>
It prefers us to be <hi>Favourites</hi> of a greater Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
than <hi>he</hi> that had an hundred and seven and
Twenty Provinces under him. A <hi>Service</hi> do
we count it? No, tis a <hi>Freedom.</hi> We are <hi>Lords,</hi>
when we are <hi>The Lord's;</hi> Then, as <hi>he</hi> said, <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Domini,</hi> is true, not only <hi>in Genitivo singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
but <hi>in Nominativo plurali.</hi> It is a <hi>Freedom,
Yea,</hi> tis a <hi>Kingdom.</hi> It gives us to sing, <hi>Lord,
Thou hast made us</hi> Kings <hi>and Priests.</hi> It has been
well said, <hi>Deo servire est regnare.</hi> We have
<hi>Crowns</hi> on our heads, all the while we are in the
<hi>Service</hi> of God; but how massy, how weighty
will they be grown when our <hi>Pay-day</hi> comes!
Every <hi>Servant</hi> of God may now say, as in 2. <hi>Tim.
4. 8. Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
But Then, Then, we shall ascend
those glittering and glorious <hi>Thrones,</hi> which <hi>Eye
hath not seen;</hi> on them we shall be <hi>ever with the
Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, finally, (and let me warn you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully).
If you do not Resolve to <hi>serve</hi> God, it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42919:17"/>
had been <hi>good for you, that you never had been
born.</hi> All that forsake the <hi>Service</hi> of God, are
employ'd in <hi>another</hi> Service, which every soul may
tremble at the Description of; 'tis a <hi>Service</hi> to
those hellish Tigres in Eph. 22. <hi>The course of this

of the flesh.</hi> You cast off the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>One;</hi> but

are thy Lords, if <hi>God</hi> have not Service from
thee. All the Galleys in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi>
cannot shew a more dismal Vassalage! And
what will the <hi>Issue</hi> of that Service be? Truly,
<hi>The Wages—is Death.</hi> God will not <hi>save you,</hi> if

                  <p>And now demean your selves in all things as
the <hi>Servants</hi> of God ought to do.</p>

There is a Four-sold Concernment that will
now lye upon you.</p>
                  <p>First. Be studious to <hi>know</hi> what <hi>Service</hi> God
calleth for. Ly at His Feet, and say as <hi>Paul</hi> of
old, <hi>Lord, What wouldest thou have me to do?</hi> or
like <hi>Samuel</hi> once, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy servant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
Be daily <hi>Reading</hi> of the Word, be daily
<hi>Thinking</hi> on the Word: upon every opportunity
say, <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will say.</hi> To
all, add That, as your daily Petition unto God;
in <hi>Psal. 119. 115. I am thy</hi> servant, <hi>O Lord;
give me understandeng that I may know thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>Do</hi> what <hi>Service</hi> God
calleth for. Never object, never cavil against any
of Gods Commands; never dispute any thing
that He requires; but own, <hi>'Tis all holy, and
just, and Good.</hi> Be not more undutiful unto <hi>God,</hi>
than the <hi>servants</hi> of the Centurion were to <hi>him,</hi>
If <hi>He</hi> say, <hi>Go,</hi> then <hi>go;</hi> if <hi>He</hi> say <hi>Come,</hi> then
<hi>come;</hi> if <hi>He</hi> say, <hi>Do this,</hi> then <hi>do it,</hi> without
any Grumbling at it. Say not, <hi>I won't,</hi> altho
there be <hi>Hard Sayings</hi> pressed upon thee. Albeit
God may enjoin this, <hi>Pluck out thy</hi> right eye, <hi>cut
off thy</hi> right hand; and albeit the Injunction of
God may be; <hi>Take up thy Cross;</hi> yet Comply,
yet, Conform, without any Reluctancies; and
say with him in Psal. 119. 128. <hi>O Lord, I esteem
all thy precepts concerning all things, to be right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Be greatly <hi>Contriving</hi> how to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42919:19"/>
most <hi>serviceable</hi> unto God. Ponder well, What
you <hi>are,</hi> What you <hi>have,</hi> What you <hi>can;</hi> and
Ponder how all may be improved in the <hi>Service</hi>
of the Lord. Thus be <hi>Zealous of good Works.</hi>

no more Kindness for your <hi>Families,</hi> than to lay
them open to the <hi>Fury</hi> of a great and a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Twenty Cubits <hi>long,</hi> Ten Cubits <hi>broad,</hi> entring
into these and those <hi>Houses, to consume them.</hi> I
am to tell you, That <hi>Prayerless Houses</hi> are to feel
the force of this <hi>Flying Roll.</hi> An huge <hi>Roll</hi> of
<hi>Curses</hi> belongs to that <hi>House</hi> in which <hi>Prayer</hi> is
not upheld. The <hi>Curse</hi> of God is the Sauce in
every <hi>Dish,</hi> the <hi>Curse</hi> of God is the Cover to

of a Child, that when <hi>Family-Prayer</hi> began,
the <hi>Devils</hi> would make hideous Roarings and
Noises in the Room, as being under a Vexation
thereat, which was intolerable to them. Truly,
The Devils have <hi>no</hi> Disturbance in Houses where
<hi>Family-prayers</hi> is not maintained; <hi>prayerless</hi> houses
are <hi>haunted</hi> houses, and the Fiends of Darkness
reign, and ramp, there without Contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Prayerless Families,</hi> are not only the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
but also the <hi>Causes</hi> of all Impiety. They
bring an Irresistible Deluge of Disorder upon all
the Town and Land; and cause all the Countrey
to swarm with the <hi>workers of iniquity who call not
upon the Lord.</hi> And as the <hi>prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Householder</hi> is now <hi>cursed</hi> by God, so he will
one day be cursed by all his <hi>House;</hi> he <hi>brings</hi>
curses on them, and they will <hi>spend</hi> curses on
him, in the Day of Vengeance. In the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning

lake, they will <hi>curse</hi> the day that ever
they saw thy <hi>prayerless house,</hi> and, <hi>That</hi> House
<hi>brought me to this Hell!</hi> This, this will be their
Cry world without End.</p>
               <p>Consider, next, the marvellous <hi>Blessings</hi> which
belong to all <hi>Praying Families.</hi> It was noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Family of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi>in 1. Sam 6. 11.
<hi>The Lord blessed</hi> Obed-Edom <hi>and his househould,</hi>
while the <hi>Ark of the Lord</hi> was there. So shall
it be noted about the Family of a <hi>praying House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder;</hi>
The Lord will <hi>bless that man and his
Household,</hi> while that <hi>Prayer to the Lord</hi> is there.
<hi>Family-prayers,</hi> are conjoined prayers, and <hi>united</hi>
prayers; thus they become very <hi>successful</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
What Encouragement is there given to
them, in that promise, Matth. 18. 19. <hi>If two
of you shall agree on earth, touching any thing that
they shall ask, it shall be done for them.</hi> O let your
Families <hi>Agree</hi> in the Asking of <hi>grace,</hi> in the
Asking of <hi>glory,</hi> in the Asking of every <hi>good
thing; Prayer in Confort,</hi> will obtain it all.
When <hi>Cornelius</hi> was at his <hi>Family-prayer,</hi> what
a signal favour did the Almighty God show unto
him? Some while since, a whole Town in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
was very suddenly destroyed by an
<hi>Earth-quake,</hi> all except one peice of an house, in
which a good man happned then to be at <hi>Prayer</hi>
with his <hi>Family.</hi> Tis impossible to tell, <hi>O how
great is the goodness</hi> which God has laid up for
Houses that seek unto Him! But besides all the
<pb facs="tcp:42919:27"/>
other comforts of a <hi>praying Householder,</hi> he has
<hi>This</hi> peculiar to him, <hi>He teacheth all his Family
to.</hi> A praying <hi>Parent</hi> will have praying <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
David</hi> prayed in his Family, and his
Son <hi>Solomon</hi> prov'd a praying young man. A
praying <hi>Master</hi> will have praying <hi>Servants. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
pray'd in his Family, and his Man <hi>Elie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>
became a very praying person. Thus, O
man, all thy <hi>young people,</hi> will be filling every
corner of thy house with <hi>Prayers</hi> for thy Felicity.</p>
               <p>O consider of these things; and such let the
Impression of them upon you be; That you
may by <hi>Prayers</hi> with your <hi>Families</hi> Engage your
<hi>Houses</hi> to <hi>serve the Lord.</hi>

them <hi>hear,</hi> and make them <hi>learn</hi> those <hi>Lessons,</hi>
which may <hi>give to the young ones Knowledge and
Discretion.</hi> Teach them the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Truth.
Twas said to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in Cap. 3. 15. <hi>From a</hi>
Child <hi>thou hast known the Holy Scriptures;</hi> No
doubt, his Godly Mother and Grandmother were
the cause of his doing so. We should procure

Scriptures,</hi> even <hi>from a Child.</hi> Let them have

Especially in the <hi>Psalms</hi> and in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs:</hi>

And Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Stories</hi> are to be told unto them,

               </p>
               <p>But while we do thus, we are also to teach

be sure that they be not ignorant of any <hi>Saving</hi>
Truths. Tell them, What they <hi>are</hi> come to by

the <hi>Second Adam.</hi> Tell them what <hi>Covenant</hi>

be left unmentioned in your Instructions. All
the <hi>Lessons</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Commandments,</hi> and
the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> are to be laid before them.
And we are to be particularly faithful to them,

young ones well informed in. Give them <hi>at this
day</hi> to be sensible, who is the Supreme <hi>Head,</hi>
and <hi>King</hi> of the Church, and what <hi>Orders</hi> He
has appointed to be observed there.</p>
               <p>Secondly. There are ferious <hi>Questions</hi> with
which we are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our <hi>Families.</hi> And
there are peculiarly Two Things which we are
to <hi>question</hi> our young ones about.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Questions</hi> we are to put unto them,
First, Which Concern their <hi>Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here, yet further to particularize, We are
to try them with <hi>Questions</hi> about their <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
Our Lord Jesus asked his Disciples, in
Matth. 13. 51. <hi>Have ye</hi> understood <hi>all these
things?</hi> Thus are we to ask our young people,
<pb facs="tcp:42919:29"/>
                  <hi>Do you</hi> understand <hi>the great Mystery of Godliness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>
O keep up the great Ordinance of <hi>Catechising</hi> in
your houses. Before your little Folks have left
off living upon <hi>Milk,</hi> let them be so well vers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their <hi>Milk for Babes,</hi> that they may readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer any Question there. The <hi>Echoes</hi> of
this Exercise, are a most refreshing Melody in
the ears of God himself. Ask we our young
ones, What they think of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and of <hi>Themselves;</hi> and let them be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the <hi>Words of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are to search them also with <hi>Questions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their <hi>Experience.</hi> As our Lord asked His
Family, in Joh. 16. 31. <hi>Do ye now believe?</hi>
So should we ask our young people, <hi>Have you</hi>
Experieneed <hi>a work of</hi> Regeneration <hi>in your souls?</hi>
Ask them, <hi>Have you ever yet carried a labouring
and heavy-laden soul unto the Lord Iesus Christ?</hi>
It was the Advice of Wisdom, <hi>Know the state of
thy Flocks.</hi> Thus, we should endeavour to <hi>Know
the state of the Souls</hi> which we are to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for; to <hi>know</hi> whether they are in a <hi>Natural,</hi>
or a <hi>Renewed</hi> state.</p>
               <p>Once more, We are to help them with <hi>Quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi>
about their <hi>Temptations.</hi> It was a <hi>Question</hi>
once given to some, in Luc. 24. 38. <hi>Why do
Thoughts arise in your hearts?</hi> Even so we should
Enquire of our young people, <hi>What</hi> Thoughts
<hi>are you most troubled with?</hi> Enquire, what <hi>Fears,</hi>
enquire what <hi>Snares</hi> they are most endangered
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42919:30"/>
by. Be alwaies jealous, lest <hi>as the serpent beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Eve,</hi> so their <hi>minds be corrupted.</hi> Moreover
Some <hi>Questions</hi> we are to put upon them, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
which concern their <hi>Lives.</hi> It was
once an Interrogatory which some were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in Luc. 23. 17. <hi>What manner of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
have ye?</hi> Thus we are to Examine our
young people about the <hi>Words</hi> and the <hi>Works,</hi>
that fill their Lives. There are especially three
things which they should be Examined about;
their <hi>Prayer,</hi> their <hi>Time,</hi> and their <hi>Company;</hi>
Ask them, whether they live without <hi>Prayer</hi> or
no? Whether in Prayer they secretly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
pour out their souls before the Lord?
Ask them, How they spend their <hi>Time?</hi> How
much <hi>Idle Time,</hi> and how much <hi>useful</hi> Time, they
allow unto themselves? And ask them, What
their <hi>Company</hi> is? Whom they sit withal?
Whether <hi>vain Persons</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> or <hi>the Saints
which are the excellent,</hi> and <hi>all those that fear God?</hi>
Our Question will prove their <hi>Safeguard,</hi> if it be
well administred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are faithful <hi>Reproofs</hi> with
which we are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our <hi>Families.</hi> Tis said
in Prov. 6. 33. <hi>The</hi> Reproofs <hi>of Instruction are
the way of life.</hi> When we give <hi>Instruction,</hi> we
shall have occasion to give <hi>Reproof,</hi> too often with
it. There is no <hi>Family</hi> that has not Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
that are to be <hi>reproved</hi> in it. <hi>Young</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
too commonly are <hi>wild</hi> people; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42919:30"/>
some <hi>Castigations</hi> they will rarely be kept in
order. To some of them smart <hi>Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> to
others of them smart <hi>Blowes,</hi> will be too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
due. Tis said in Prov. 13. 24. <hi>He that
spareth his Rod hateth his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n; but he that loveth
him, chastens him betimes. Frowns</hi> are due to all,
and <hi>Rods</hi> to some Transgressors in the Family.
But there are two Negative and two Positive
Rules to be minded in <hi>Reproving</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>The Negative Rules are these two.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Reprove</hi> not <hi>Furiously.</hi> It is said in <hi>Iam.
1. 20. The wrath of man, worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God.</hi> Remember, Nothing will be
so well done <hi>in</hi> a passion, but what may be done
better <hi>out</hi> of it. If you are to <hi>chide,</hi> yet chide
not in a <hi>Fury.</hi> Do not call <hi>vile Names;</hi> much
more, do not <hi>swear,</hi> do not <hi>curse,</hi> do not Rage
with a <hi>Tongue set on fire of hell.</hi> If you are to
<hi>smi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> yet smite not in a <hi>Fury.</hi> Bloody, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
outragious Buffettings are to be avoided;
lest there be cause to say of you, <hi>Curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is their Anger for it is fierce, and their Wrath
for it is cruel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Reprove</hi> not <hi>for ever.</hi> Tis said in <hi>Ps.
103. 9. God will not</hi> alwaies <hi>chide, neither will He
keep his anger for ever.</hi> To be <hi>alwaies</hi> finding
faults, is the way <hi>never</hi> to be curing them. A
<hi>perpetual Warngling</hi> is a <hi>continual Dropping,</hi> which
there is no enduring of; it prejudices the
minds of them that feel it, against all that shall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42919:31"/>
be said unto them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Positive</hi> Rules are these Two.</p>
               <p>First Reprove <hi>Reasonably.</hi> Let there be <hi>just</hi>
Cause for it. When you <hi>reprove,</hi> it must be for
a <hi>true cause.</hi> As it was said of our Saviour in
<hi>Isai. 11. 3. He shall not reprove after the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of His ears.</hi> Thus, we may not go by meer
<hi>Hear-say,</hi> when we reprove those that are under
us. And it must be for a <hi>great</hi> Cause. Tis said
of the Spirit in <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 16. 8. He will reprove the
world for SIN.</hi> The sinful thing, the thing
for <hi>which the wrath of God comes,</hi> the thing which
the <hi>soul of the Lord hates,</hi> this we are to reprove.
We must not throw away <hi>Reproofs</hi> upon <hi>Nothing,</hi>
or upon <hi>Every thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Reprove <hi>Scripturally.</hi> Tis said in
2. Tim. 3. 16. <hi>All Scripture is profitable for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</hi>
A <hi>Reproof</hi> with a <hi>Scripture</hi> comes with a
more than ordinary Majesty and Authority.
When we Reprove those that are under us,
First, make them read a <hi>Text</hi> which does Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
what we would rebuke, and then set it
home with a very warm lively vigorous Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There are solemn <hi>Charges</hi> with
which we are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our <hi>Families.</hi> It was the
Character which the Lord gives of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in
Gen. 18. 19. <hi>I know him, that he will</hi> command
<hi>his children and his</hi> household <hi>after him, and they
shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> O that this might
<pb facs="tcp:42919:31"/>
be said of every <hi>Householder</hi> here; <hi>I know him,
that he will take all of his house, one by one, and</hi>
Charge <hi>every one of them to keep the way of the
Lord!</hi> What saies the Apostle, in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Thes
2. 11. <hi>We</hi> charged <hi>every one of you, as a father
his children.</hi> We should call aside our <hi>young</hi>
people, and lay upon them, the Charge of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
in 1. Chron. 28. 9. <hi>My son, know thou
the God of thy Father, and</hi> Serve Him <hi>with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Heart and a willing mind; for the Lord search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou seek Him, He will be found
of thee, if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off
for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Charge them; and this especially about four
Things. Lay upon them that <hi>Charge</hi> of God
in 1. Joh. 3. 23. <hi>This is His Commandment,
that you believe on the Name of his Son.</hi> Charge
them to accept of Christ Jesus, as their <hi>Prince</hi>
and their <hi>Saviour;</hi> Charge them to repair unto
Christ Jesus for <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Redemption.</hi> Lay also upon them that
Charge of God, in Mat. 6. 6. <hi>Enter into thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
and pray to thy Father in secret.</hi> Charge them
to Retire for their <hi>Devotions</hi> every day; Charge
them to let not a day pass them, without Crying
to <hi>God</hi> for His Mercy, and Pardon, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Once more, Lay upon them that <hi>Charge</hi>
of God, in Prov. 1. 10. <hi>My son, if Sinners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thee, consent thou not,</hi> Charge them, that
they be not the <hi>Companions of Fools;</hi> Charge
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42919:32"/>
them that they do not associate themselves into
an Intimacy and a Familiarity with any but such
as may be sober, discreet, blameless persons.
Finally, Lay upon them that <hi>Charge</hi> of God in
Hag. 1. 5. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of hosts,</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your waies. Charge them, that they <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
what their present Condition is, and what
their future Condition is <hi>like</hi> to be; Charge
them, that they <hi>consider</hi> of their past Behaviours,
and of the <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi>
which is yet before them. A young man has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a real Convert by being obliged unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi>
for one Quarter of an Hour in a Day.
Wish for them, say to them, <hi>Oh that they were
wise, that they would</hi> Consider! In a word,
Let your Charge on them, be that, which Holy
<hi>Bolton</hi> gave to his Children, when he dyed, <hi>I
charge you, that at the Day of Iudgement, none of
you dare to meet me in an</hi> Unregenerate <hi>estate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. The <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Family-Instruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tis to be performed in such a <hi>Manner,</hi> as may
best Attain the Ends of it. Particularly.</p>
               <p>First, We are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our Families very
<hi>Seasonably.</hi> We are told in Matth, 24. 45. The
<hi>Ruler over the Household</hi> is to <hi>give them their meat
in due</hi> Season. There lies much in the <hi>Time</hi> we
take for the <hi>Work.</hi> We should indeed have our
<hi>Frequent</hi> Times, to do it: We should speak
what may be for the <hi>Instruction</hi> of our Families,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42919:32"/>
every day, and often in a day; and on various
occasions be dropping our savoury Admonitions.
Even when we sit at the <hi>Table,</hi> we should rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rise without feeding the <hi>Minds,</hi> as well as
the <hi>Mouthes</hi> of our Attendents. Much more at
the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urs of Prayer,</hi> we should do something
that may make them more acquainted with
<hi>Divine Objects</hi> then they were before. But
we should likewise have our <hi>Stated</hi> Times to do
it. Especially <hi>Sacred</hi> Time will be very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Stated</hi> Time for it. On the <hi>Dayes</hi> of the
Lord, we should instruct our Houses in the
<hi>Things</hi> of the Lord; <hi>that</hi> were infinitely better
than to be Sleeping or Talking at an idle rate,
as then too many do.</p>
               <p>But about the <hi>Stated Time</hi> for <hi>Family-Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
there is a double Discretion to be used. It
is to be dispatched in a <hi>Quiet</hi> Time, in a Time
when there is no Disturbance by <hi>Passions</hi> within,
or <hi>Noises</hi> without. It is said in Eccles. 9. 16.
<hi>The words of wise men are heard in quiet:</hi> and no
<hi>wise man</hi> will speak when there is not <hi>Quietness</hi>
enough to allow an Audience for him. And it
is to dispens'd in a <hi>Lively,</hi> Time, in a Time when
<hi>Spirits</hi> are stirring, and <hi>Affections</hi> are vigorous.
Tis said in Rom. 12. 11. <hi>Be</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent <hi>in spirit,
serving the Lord;</hi> thus, this peice of <hi>Service</hi> for
the Lord, is to be done, when there is a <hi>Ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of Disposition thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42919:33"/>
Secondly, We are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our <hi>Families</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>pertinently.</hi> Accommodate our <hi>Instructions</hi> to
their <hi>Conditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are there any <hi>Vnconverted</hi> persons in our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies?</hi>
Let them be <hi>Suitably</hi> Instructed. Say to
them as in Psal. 34. 11. <hi>Hearken to me and I will
Teach you the Fear of the Lord.</hi> Let them be <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
of the <hi>Dangers</hi> which do threaten their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
souls; and let them be <hi>stirred</hi> to the
<hi>Duties</hi> that may lay them at the Pool, in the <hi>way</hi>
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Are there any <hi>Converted</hi> persons in our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?
Let <hi>them</hi> too be <hi>suitably</hi> Instructed. We
read in Joh. 8. 31. <hi>Iesus said unto the Iewes
which</hi> believed <hi>on Him,</hi> continue <hi>in my word.</hi> Let
them be quickned to <hi>continue</hi> in their Faith, and
Love and Zeal. Let them have <hi>Weapons</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
furnish them against all their Difficulties, and
<hi>Cordials</hi> to Revive them under all their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.</p>
               <p>Are there any <hi>Vnfruitful</hi> Souls, in our Families?
Instruct them <hi>suitably,</hi> by setting before them
what is the Doom of the Barren <hi>Free,</hi> and of the
Barren <hi>Ground;</hi> even, to be <hi>cut down,</hi> and <hi>burnt
up</hi> for ever. And say, <hi>O glorifie your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by bringing forth much fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are there any <hi>Back-sliding</hi> Souls, in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies?
Instruct them <hi>suitably,</hi> by setting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them the <hi>Displeasure</hi> of God at such as <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,</hi>
and His extreme Wrath on them whose
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42919:33"/>
                  <hi>Goodness</hi> is as the <hi>Morning cloud</hi> and <hi>the early dew;</hi>
and say, <hi>Remember whence thou art fallen, repent,
and do thy first works.</hi> Thus are we to suit the
the case of those whom we give Instruction to.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. We are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our Families ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Diligently.</hi> Tis a thing that we are to <hi>labour</hi>
in. Twas enjoind in Deut 6. 7. <hi>The words
which I command thee, thou shalt teach them</hi> Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<hi>unto thy Children.</hi> It calls for our <hi>Hearts</hi>
and our <hi>Pains.</hi> When we set about it, we should
think with our selves, <hi>We know not how short
our Opportunities may be; we know not whether we
shall ever speak more to those whom we now direct
our selves unto.</hi> In this as well as in other such
Cases, we should hear the voice of our own
<hi>Vncertainty</hi> &amp; <hi>Mortality;</hi> tis that in <hi>Eccles. 9. 10.
Do with thy might what thy hand finds to do, for
there is no work, nor wisdom in the grave whither
thou art going.</hi> Tis the <hi>Work of the Lord,</hi> about
which we are, when we are, <hi>Instructing</hi> our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
tis not to be done <hi>slothfully;</hi> we find in
<hi>Ier. 28. 10. cursed is the man, who</hi> doth it so;
tis to be done <hi>heartily;</hi> we find in 2. <hi>Chron. 31.
21.</hi> that is the way to <hi>prosper</hi> in it. O let us
be as <hi>Diligent</hi> in <hi>Instructing</hi> of our young people,
as the Emissaries of Hell are in Seducing of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We are to <hi>Instruct</hi> our Families by
<hi>Exemple.</hi> Be <hi>Exemplary;</hi> and follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
of that geat man, who said in Psal. 101.
10. <hi>I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42919:34"/>
Let our <hi>Walk,</hi> as well as our <hi>Talk,</hi> show the
young people with us how they are <hi>to walk and
to please God;</hi> and let us be able to call upon
them, <hi>Do you follow me, as I follow Christ.</hi> Let
us give such Expressions of <hi>Love</hi> to God and his
<hi>Truths</hi> and His <hi>Wayes,</hi> that our Families may
come after us in the like. Let them discern how
to seek the <hi>Face</hi> of God, and how to bear the
<hi>Hand</hi> of God, and how to prize the <hi>Word</hi> of
God, by seeing how <hi>We</hi> do it our selves. When
<hi>Elisha</hi> would get for himself <hi>a double Portion</hi> of
the spirit in <hi>Elijah,</hi> he said in 2. King 2. 10.
<hi>If thou</hi> see <hi>me, it shall be so unto thee.</hi> O that the
<hi>Sight</hi> of us, that the <hi>Sight</hi> of our Piety, and
Gravity might <hi>Instruct</hi> our Houses, and help
them to a <hi>double Portion</hi> of those Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
which are <hi>the Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> We
shou'd study an <hi>Instructive Conversation;</hi> and
we should never permit a <hi>Cham,</hi> a young <hi>Cham</hi>
in our families, to see us overcome with <hi>Drink,</hi>
Disguised with <hi>Vice,</hi> or naked with <hi>Folly;</hi> but
<hi>In all things we should show our selves a</hi> Pattern <hi>of
good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly. We are to Instruct our Families
with <hi>Authority.</hi> As the <hi>Minister</hi> is to imitate
the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom tis said in <hi>Mat.
7. 29. He taught as one having Authority.</hi> So
should the <hi>Householder</hi> do. And hence we are
to keep up our <hi>Authority</hi> in our families; not
permitting <hi>the child to be have himself proudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42919:34"/>
the Ancient.</hi> It is required in Lev. 19. 3.
<hi>Ye shall fear every one his</hi> Mother <hi>and his Father,</hi>
the <hi>Mother</hi> is here put before the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
commonly she first loseth her <hi>Authority:</hi>
but neither <hi>Mother</hi> nor <hi>Father</hi> should suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be trampled upon. Tis an intolerable
thing, for a saucy, impudent, unmannerly child
to reply, <hi>I wont,</hi> when a Parent bids him do this or
that. You sin grievously, if you do not curb and
break the <hi>Wills</hi> of them that you are to bring up in
the <hi>nurture of the Lord;</hi> and if you don't make 'em
tremble to <hi>break</hi> any of your <hi>commands.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let there be that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that <hi>Meekness,</hi> that
<hi>Reservedness,</hi> and <hi>Seriousness</hi> in our Deportments,
with which we may <hi>Rule well our own house, and
have our</hi> Children <hi>in</hi> Subjection <hi>with all g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

This is that <hi>Family-Instruction</hi> and Family<hi>-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
by which we must bring our <hi>Houses</hi> to
<hi>serve the Lord.</hi>

               <p>In a Word, Instruct your Families or else
the <hi>Blood</hi> of their Souls will be required at your

and the <hi>compliance</hi> which they that should have

<hi>seek out many inventions</hi> to excuse themselves from

in the fourth verse of this Chapter; it is
drawn from the <hi>Vncontrouleable Power</hi> of them

Excuse we have a two-fold Answer in the fifth

               <head>Prop. I.</head>
               <p>The Blessed God affordeth to men in this
World a <hi>Time</hi> to discharge the Duties incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on them. There are two things incumbent
on us; to <hi>Do</hi> good, and to <hi>Get</hi> good. The
good we are to <hi>do,</hi> is to <hi>Honour</hi> God; and the
good we are to <hi>get,</hi> is to <hi>Enjoy</hi> God. Those two
things comprise all our <hi>Duties;</hi> and they make
up the <hi>Errand</hi> which we come into the World
upon. Now, while we are in
this world, God allowes us a <hi>Time</hi> for this
work; we have <hi>time</hi> not only in the larger
sense of it, but also in the stricter sense of it;
We have <hi>time</hi> not only in <hi>Duration,</hi> but also in
<hi>Opportunity.</hi> There is not any <hi>Duty</hi> enjoined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
us, but there is a <hi>Season</hi> for it allowed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. Tis an Observation about the things
that <hi>shall</hi> be, in Eccles. 3. 1. <hi>To every thing
there is a</hi> Season, <hi>and a</hi> Time <hi>to every purpose.</hi>
Thus it may be said about the things that <hi>should</hi>
be, <hi>There is no</hi> Duty, <hi>but God hath provided us a</hi>
Time <hi>and a</hi> Season <hi>for it.</hi> We have some <hi>golden
spots of Time,</hi> whereof we may say, <hi>This is the</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42919:40"/>
Time <hi>for such a duty;</hi> and again, <hi>This is the</hi>
Time <hi>for another duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, We have a <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>do Good</hi> while we
are here in the world. We have a <hi>time</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
every <hi>Vertue,</hi> to use all that <hi>Piety</hi> and
<hi>Charity,</hi> all that <hi>Holiness</hi> &amp; <hi>Righteousness,</hi> which
the Lord requireth of us. The <hi>Good</hi> which we
are to <hi>do</hi> is expressed in <hi>Mic. 6. 8. He hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to</hi> love Mercy, <hi>and to</hi> walk humbly <hi>with thy God.</hi>
We meet with many <hi>Times</hi> to do those <hi>Good
things</hi> before we dye. We have now our <hi>

               <p>Secondly, We have likewise a <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>Get
Good</hi> while we are in the world. We have a
<hi>Time</hi> to obtain all that <hi>Favour,</hi> and all that

               <p>It is no small part of <hi>Wisdom</hi> for men to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi>
and <hi>improve</hi> the <hi>Time</hi> which God affordeth
unto them. When the Gales of <hi>Opportunity</hi>
blow in the Sails of <hi>Time,</hi> every man should see
and watch his own <hi>Opportunity.</hi> To <hi>Discern</hi> the
Time, is to <hi>mind</hi> the time, and to <hi>use</hi> the time,
for the performance of our <hi>Duty.</hi> Now tis a
<hi>wise</hi> man that will so <hi>discern</hi> the <hi>Time. Sapience</hi>
or <hi>Wisdom</hi> is a Vertue of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi>
whereby a man perceives the <hi>Dependence</hi> of
things; the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nexion</hi> of things, and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of things</hi> being understood, therein <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
is discovered. To <hi>discern the time</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this. Tis <hi>Wisdom</hi> for a man to lay his
<hi>Time</hi> and his <hi>Work</hi> together. Tis <hi>Wisdom</hi> for a
man to fore-see what will be the Issue of such a
<hi>Work</hi> at such a <hi>Time.</hi> But besides the <hi>Nature</hi>
of <hi>Wisdom</hi> evidently appearing in this thing, we
have a two fold further witness to the <hi>Wisdom</hi>
of it.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> there about,
shewes, that it is <hi>Wisdome</hi> for men to <hi>discern</hi> and
<hi>improve</hi> their <hi>time.</hi> What the all-<hi>wise,</hi> the only-<hi>wise</hi>
GOD calleth <hi>Wisdom,</hi> is unquestionably to
be esteemed so. The <hi>Redeeming</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> is great
Wisdom in the Language and the Account of
God. Twas said in Eph. 5. 16. <hi>Walk as</hi> wise,
Redeeming <hi>the time—</hi>Much of the same <hi>Date</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42919:41"/>
and <hi>Tenour,</hi> was the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians.</hi> In
that Epistle also we have the like passage, in
Cap. 4. 5. <hi>Walk in</hi> Wisdom, Redeeming <hi>the
time.</hi> Tis probable the Apostle therein has a
special Reference to Persecutions, which good
men were then exposed unto. To <hi>Redeem the
Time,</hi> was a proverbial Phrase of old, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
To <hi>Keep out of trouble as long as one can.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Chaldean</hi>-Soothsayers were told in their
distress, <hi>Dan. 2. 8. I know that ye would</hi> gain
<hi>the time.</hi> This was the Counsil of the Apostle,
<hi>By a prudent, holy, careful, and inoffensive Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards them that would interrupt you in the
worship of Iesus Christ,</hi> gain Time <hi>what you can
for the quiet practice of it.</hi> Well, If it be <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
to <hi>gain</hi> time <hi>for</hi> the Service of God, surely,
tis Wisdom to <hi>spend</hi> time <hi>in</hi> the Service of God.
It was the singular Character &amp; Commendation
of the <hi>Issacharites,</hi> in 1. Chron. 12. 32. <hi>They
had</hi> Understanding <hi>in the</hi> times, <hi>to</hi> know <hi>what Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
ought to do.</hi> Tis an <hi>understanding</hi> man, who
doth so <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Time,</hi> as to <hi>do</hi> his <hi>Work.</hi> Of a
<hi>Time-losing</hi> man, the Scripture saith, <hi>He is a Fool.</hi>
It saies in Prov. 18. 16. <hi>Wherefore is there a price
in the hand of a</hi> Fool?</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Prevention</hi> of <hi>Sorrow</hi> thereby,
shewes, That it is <hi>Wisdom</hi> for men to <hi>discern</hi>
and <hi>improve</hi> their <hi>Time.</hi> It is great <hi>Wisdom</hi> to
prevent great <hi>Sorrow.</hi> Now nothing in the
world fills the heart of man more with Anguish
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42919:41"/>
and Anger, than the <hi>Missing</hi> of Time. When a
man has missed his <hi>Time</hi> for his <hi>Work,</hi> it caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an unspeakable Regret within him. We
read of some professors, who missed their <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
to Entertain Christ Jesus and His Mercy: with
what a marvellous Agony did they cry out, in
Matth. 25. 11. <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us!</hi> Well
might they be called <hi>Foolish,</hi> who thus cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> too
late. The horrour of it being once only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by some profane people, who acted the
<hi>Foolish Virgins</hi> in a Play, at a City in <hi>Germany,</hi> it
even kill'd a Prince that was a Spectator of it.
Tis impossible to utter the Confusion which the
slipping of <hi>time</hi> does put the souls of men into.
When <hi>Esau</hi> had missed his <hi>Time</hi> to procure a
Blessing for himself, how did he resent it? We
are told in Gen. 27. 34. <hi>He cry'd with a</hi> great
<hi>and</hi> exceeding bitter <hi>Cry.</hi> Alas, how should it
be otherwise? The slipping of <hi>Time</hi> is an <hi>Ill,
and an</hi> exceeding bitter <hi>thing.</hi> There are but
two sorts of men; both of them find the <hi>Loss
of time,</hi> to prove at some time or other, a sad,
an evil, a troublesome thing unto them, 'Tis
thus esqecially when their time is come to <hi>Dy,</hi>
when their time is to <hi>be no more.</hi> As for <hi>Good
men,</hi> the <hi>Loss of time</hi> usually strowes <hi>Thorns</hi> on
their <hi>Beds</hi> when they come to dy. It grieves
the best man to think, My Time, <hi>my</hi> Time, <hi>I
have not so laid it out for God as I should have done.</hi>
He was a painful &amp; a pious Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

the <hi>damned</hi> set on their Time. We may say of
it as <hi>Iob</hi> of another thing, in Cap. 28. 22.
<hi>Destruction and death, say, we have heard the fame
thereof with our ears.</hi> Even so, <hi>Destruction and
Death set an high rate upon it.</hi> Ask men when
<hi>Destruction</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> is near to seizing upon 'em,
<hi>How much would you give now for a little of the</hi>
time <hi>that is gone?</hi> They will reply, <hi>O, whole
mountains of gold for one hour of it!</hi> Judge now
as you will judge then.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let us <hi>Discern</hi> the <hi>Irrevokableness</hi> of
our <hi>Time.</hi> When our time is once gone, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<hi>Irrevokable,</hi> and <hi>Irrecoverable</hi> for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
We may say of every <hi>Time</hi> that is <hi>past,</hi>
as in Psal. 49. 8. <hi>It is precious and it ceaseth
forever.</hi> The Wish of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could once bring
back the shadow of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but never could any
man procure a Return of his <hi>Time.</hi> Sometimes
the doleful Cryes of distressed ones have been,
<hi>Call</hi> Time <hi>again! call</hi> Time <hi>again!</hi> But alas,
<hi>Time</hi> won't come back for <hi>Calling.</hi> Oh how
should this make us to takeheed that we don't ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
any part of our Time, <hi>I shall never have</hi> this
<hi>time again!</hi> When once our Time has <hi>taken wing,</hi>
what is said of <hi>Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> in Cant. 8. 7. that may be
said of <hi>Time, If a man would give all the substance

When once Time is gone, <hi>'tis gone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let us <hi>Discern</hi> our <hi>Accountableness</hi> for
all our <hi>Time.</hi> God maintains us and supplies
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42919:43"/>
us with <hi>Time</hi> continually. He keeps a <hi>Sun</hi> to
measure it. The <hi>time</hi> will come when He will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
with us about all our <hi>Time.</hi> Tis said in
<hi>Ecc. 11. 9. O young man walk in the wayes of thy
heart; but know thou that for all these things, God
will bring thee into judgement.</hi> In like sort, let
me say, <hi>Come, squander away thy</hi> Time, <hi>even</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<hi>to get the dead commodity off thy hands; but
know thou that in the day, when God shall judge the
world, all this</hi> Time <hi>of thine must be</hi> accounted <hi>for.</hi>
It was the Law of old, in <hi>Exod 21. 18. If
one man smite another, so that he keep his bed, and
yet walk abroad again, he shall pay for his healing
and the</hi> Loss <hi>of his</hi> Time: Truly so, if we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently

It will be a fearful thing, if at last He say unto

been made up of</hi> idle hours.</p>
                     <p>These things are we to <hi>discern</hi> in <hi>all Time.</hi>
For the sake hereof, let us now permit <hi>no Time</hi>
to be misplac'd in such things as these.</p>
                     <p>First, Let us <hi>mispend no Time</hi> in <hi>vanity,</hi> of

                     <p>Let us <hi>Discern</hi> our <hi>Time,</hi> and Attend <hi>every Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in the <hi>proper Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold <hi>Prudence</hi> which the <hi>Wise
man's heart</hi> is to be no stranger to.</p>
                     <p>The First <hi>Prudence</hi> is,</p>
                     <p>Let no <hi>Duty</hi> be done out of its <hi>Time.</hi> We
are told in Eccles 3. 11. <hi>God hath made every
thing beautiful in the</hi> Time <hi>of it.</hi> There is a <hi>Nick</hi>
of <hi>Time</hi> that we are to take for all we do. Not
<hi>Snow</hi> but <hi>Fruit</hi> is <hi>beautiful</hi> in the Summer. Tis
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42919:45"/>
not beautiful for the Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> to be done
at a <hi>sleepy</hi> time, or at a <hi>busy</hi> time. Tis not <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi>
for the Duty of <hi>Reproof</hi> to be done at a <hi>time</hi>
when it can do no <hi>good</hi> at all. Set not upon this
or that Duty at a time when God calls to <hi>another</hi>
Duty. Tis said in Eccles. 8. 6. <hi>To every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there is a</hi> Time <hi>and Iudgement.</hi> We may
render all our Duties like <hi>Apples of gold in
pictures of silver,</hi> by well <hi>timing</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>The Second <hi>Prudence</hi> is,</p>
                     <p>Let no <hi>Time</hi> pass away without its <hi>Duty:</hi> Let
none of our <hi>times</hi> be unaccompanied with the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
which belong unto them. As now, there
are <hi>Duties</hi> that belong to a time of <hi>Prosperity,</hi>
and <hi>Duties</hi> which belong to a Time of <hi>Adversity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tis said in <hi>Eccles. 7. 14. In the day of</hi> Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>be</hi> joyful, <hi>but in the day of</hi> Adversity Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
In a time of <hi>Prosperity:</hi> now is a time for
men to <hi>Remember</hi> their <hi>Creator before the</hi> evil <hi>days
come;</hi> Now is a <hi>time</hi> for men to <hi>set their heart
and their soul to</hi> seek the Lord <hi>who hath given them
rest on every side.</hi> In a time of <hi>Adversity,</hi> now
is a <hi>time</hi> for men to bring <hi>sin to remembrance;</hi> now
is a time for men to <hi>meet the Lord</hi> in all the
ways of Repentance and Obedience. This is to
<hi>Discern the Time.</hi> But there are especially three
sorts of times which we are to fill with the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes</hi>
of those <hi>Times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First. Let the Dutyes of <hi>Worshipping times,</hi> be
done in those times. We have our <hi>times</hi> every
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42919:45"/>
day wherein the Lord saith, <hi>seek my Face.</hi> Now
let the <hi>Echo</hi> of our souls be that in Psal. 27.
8. <hi>Thy Face, Lord, we will seek.</hi> We have
every day our <hi>times</hi> for private Prayer, our <hi>times</hi>
for secret Prayer, our times for Reading <hi>of,</hi> and
Thinking <hi>on</hi> the Word of God. Let those things
be faithfully done in those Times.</p>
                     <p>Especially, <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day.</hi> Let
<hi>Sabbath</hi>-time be <hi>sanctifyed</hi> time. On this day,
ly all the day long at the <hi>pool</hi> of Mercy; <hi>Mercy,
Mercy,</hi> and Salvation for an immortal soul is
this day to be traded for. Tis a <hi>Time</hi> that the
great God is very Jealous about. He does won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
curse the <hi>Souls,</hi> and blast the <hi>Houses,</hi>
and ruin the <hi>Countryes</hi> where this Holy <hi>Time</hi> is
not acknowledged. He will terribly break the
<hi>rest</hi> of those whom His <hi>Rest</hi> shall not be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let the Dutyes of <hi>Visiting</hi> Times
be done in those <hi>Times.</hi> Tis too commonly seen
that <hi>Amici temporis Fures;</hi> our <hi>Friends</hi> are our
<hi>Theeves;</hi> they <hi>Steal</hi> our <hi>time,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ause we don't
<hi>use</hi> our time, when then they are with us. Tis

                        </hi> he adds, <hi>Let your
speech be always with Grace.</hi> That, that indeed
is a rare way to <hi>Redeem</hi> the <hi>time.</hi> Let us ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
study to do some good, whatever Company
we come into. It was observed of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Vrsin</hi> by his renowned Friend, <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

O abhor the useless visits that are quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all such designs. Mourn if you have been
in any Company without being profitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Let the Duties of <hi>Intervening</hi> times
be done in those <hi>times.</hi> We have large <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of time, that are the Intervals of our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses;
about these Fragments of <hi>time,</hi> I would
say as our Lord said about the Fragments of
<hi>Bread,</hi> in Joh. 6. 12. <hi>Gather up those</hi> Fragments
<hi>that nothing be lost.</hi> How many thousands of
happy thoughts might we have as we are sitting
in the <hi>House,</hi> or walking in the <hi>Street,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
wholly unimployed? The very Filings of
<hi>Gold</hi> and of <hi>Time</hi> are not to be cast away. To
<hi>discern</hi> our time, is to <hi>adapt</hi> our time.</p>

we are to <hi>Buy up</hi> the time, or <hi>buy out</hi> the time.
This is to <hi>discern</hi> the <hi>Time!</hi> We must be at

would not be ill-husbands of our time: We must
pay down either <hi>Mony</hi> or <hi>Monyes-worth</hi> for it;
we must <hi>fore go</hi> and <hi>under go</hi> many things for it.
Many things must we <hi>give up,</hi> that our time so
may be well-imployed. The case is ordinarily
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42919:46"/>
so, that either we must resign many <hi>Pleasures,</hi>
many <hi>Profits,</hi> many <hi>Honours,</hi> or else we must
part with our <hi>time.</hi> Now rather <hi>give up</hi> all
Delights, than suffer precious time to be pyrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away. All the things <hi>of</hi> time, are sometimes
Expence little enough <hi>for</hi> time. Yea, many
things must we give <hi>back,</hi> that so we may not
misemploy our time. The <hi>Devil</hi> and our <hi>Lusts</hi>
have been trucking for our <hi>time.</hi> The Devil,
that hellish Hucster, would engross all our <hi>Time</hi>
for his own. He deals with us as the <hi>Europeans</hi>

<hi>glass-Beads</hi> and <hi>tinsil-Toyes.</hi> The Answer that
our <hi>Lust</hi> makes to the Tempter is, <hi>Let me have</hi>
the pleasures of sin for a season, <hi>and every season
of my</hi> time <hi>shall be thine.</hi> O but we should be
content to <hi>give back</hi> all that Satan has proffer'd
us for our time; let it be never-so-much that
we might have had for the <hi>misuse of time,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grutch
it not. 'Twas the Speech of <hi>Austin,
Perde aliquid ut Deo vaces</hi> If you would have
Time for <hi>God,</hi> or any Good, you must part

                     <p>In a Word, Let us labour now to <hi>Regain</hi> the
<hi>Time</hi> that we have been cheated of. The

to Accuse and Convince him of some

Which will be critical upon us. Tis said in
Psal. 11. 4, 5. <hi>The Lords eyes behold, and His
ey-lids</hi> try <hi>the children of men; the Lord</hi> sounds
(as the French Translation hath it) <hi>both the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and the wicked.</hi> Every man in the world
falls under the <hi>Notice,</hi> and so, under the <hi>Tryal</hi> of
the omniscient God. The all-seeing <hi>Eyes</hi> of
God, as it were, <hi>Examine</hi> us, and His <hi>Ey-lids</hi>
knit themselves for a Scrutiny into our Hearts
and lives. The blessed God will pass a
<hi>Iudgment,</hi> after a <hi>Trial</hi> upon us; whether we
<hi>truly love Him and seek Him,</hi> or no. We are
told in Psal. 7. 9. <hi>The righteous God</hi> trieth <hi>the
Hearts and the Reins;</hi> an Assertion, an Expression,
it may be, more than seven times repeted in the
Word of God! The <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of God, extends it self to the most interior
parts of men; the motions of their very <hi>Hearts</hi>
and <hi>Reins</hi> come under His exactest Cognizance.
Every man may so far say after that godly man,
in Psal. 17. 3. Lord, <hi>thou hast proved my heart,
thou hast visited me, thiu hast</hi> tried <hi>me.</hi> To use a

Similitude made Legitimate and Canonical by

into the Bowels of the Creatures it was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon; it never laid them so <hi>

                     </gap>aked</hi> and <hi>open,</hi>
before the standers-by; as the <hi>examining Eye</hi> of
God makes a discovery of what is in our Souls
and our wayes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are the Trials of Divine <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations</hi>
which we must have Experience of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God's <hi>Providences</hi> are our <hi>Probations;</hi> by them
we are <hi>tried</hi> what we are. The things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
us in the world, fetch out of us, those things
which manifest what <hi>metal</hi> we are made of.
Particularly, tis said in 2. Cor. 6. 3, 7. We
are <hi>Approved by</hi> things on the <hi>Right hand</hi> and on
the <hi>Left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Merciful</hi> Dispensations of God, are
<hi>Trials</hi> of us: these are Trials on the <hi>Right</hi> hand.
It is a sacred Proverb, in <hi>Prov. 27. 21. As the
Fining-pot for silver, and the Furnace for</hi> Gold, <hi>so
is a man to his praise;</hi> or <hi>so the mouth which praises
any one, is to try him.</hi> As when a man is <hi>praised</hi>
by his Neighbour, so when a man is <hi>Blessed</hi> of
his Maker, he is then <hi>tried</hi> unto the utmost. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
from below, do <hi>Indicare virum;</hi> they soon
<hi>Try</hi> &amp; <hi>show</hi> the man that is perfum'd therewith;
and the same is done by <hi>Merc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> from above.
Therein the Lord brings us, as He did the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of <hi>Gideon,</hi> to a <hi>River</hi> of Plenty, and He saies,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42919:50"/>
as in <hi>Iudg. 7. 4. Now I will</hi> try <hi>them there.</hi>
The Favours of God, as it were, put us into a
<hi>Crucible,</hi> in a <hi>Furnace,</hi> where it soon becomes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
whether we fear him or no. They are so
many Trials, <hi>Whether we will hear God speaking to
us in our prosperity;</hi> or <hi>whether when we wax fat,
we shall kick against the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Afflictive</hi> Dispensations of God,
are likewise <hi>Tryals</hi> of us. And these are Trials on
the <hi>Left hand.</hi> So much is intimated in 1. Pet.
1. 6, 7. <hi>Ye are in heaviness thro' many</hi> Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<hi>that the</hi> trial <hi>of your faith, being much more
precious than that of gold which perisheth, though it
be tried with fire, may be found unto praise.</hi> All
<hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>Tentations;</hi> by them we are <hi>tried</hi>
whether we have the Grace of God in us or no.
Tis <hi>Faith,</hi> but not Faith <hi>alone,</hi> which our <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
here are the <hi>Trials</hi> of. A <hi>Sick-bed</hi> is a <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi>
a <hi>Reproach</hi> is a <hi>Furnace,</hi> a <hi>Loss,</hi> or a <hi>Goal</hi>
is a <hi>Furnace,</hi> in which tis <hi>tried</hi> whether we have
the spirits, not of <hi>Bastards,</hi> but of <hi>Children</hi> in us.
Hence we read of <hi>A great</hi> Tryal <hi>of</hi> Affliction.
<hi>Afflicted</hi> persons may make that Confession in Ps.
66. 10, 11, <hi>Thou, O God, hast</hi> proved <hi>us, thou
hast</hi> tried <hi>us as silver is</hi> tried; <hi>thou hast laid</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<hi>upon our loins.</hi> Hereby we are Try'd
<hi>whether we will despise the Chastning of the Lord,</hi> or
<hi>whether we will faint when rebuked of Him.</hi>

Upon the <hi>Trials</hi> of God, good men <hi>come forth
as gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is that in <hi>Gold,</hi> which good men may
be compar'd unto. We read in Deut. 1. 1.
about the mountains of <hi>Dizahab:</hi> that is, the
<hi>Golden</hi> mountains; because <hi>Gold</hi> was probably
dug from thence. The <hi>Churches</hi> of God in the
world, are such <hi>Mountains</hi> of gold. Every true
Believer is a rich lump of <hi>Gold</hi> before the Lord.
Of such persons tis said in Lam. 4. 2. <hi>They are
the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine</hi> gold.
There are diverse properties in <hi>Gold,</hi> which a
good man will have a blessed Resemblance of.
I should offer you not <hi>Gold,</hi> but <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>stubble</hi>
if I should read you here a <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Metallogy,</hi>
or discourse to you all that I could Philosophize
about this King of <hi>Metals.</hi> Let me only touch
on a few common Reflections, As now,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold</hi> is a <hi>pure</hi> metal. Hence we read near some
scores of times in the sacred Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>pure Gold.</hi> It will not readily admit a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or an Alloy with more imperfect Metals;
unless with <hi>Silver:</hi> Especially the <hi>Dust-gold</hi> of
<hi>Guinea,</hi> Gold whereof <hi>Iob</hi> saith, tis <hi>Dust of gold:</hi>
wonderful is the <hi>Purity</hi> thereof! Thus a good
man is a <hi>pure</hi> man; He is one of those that are
called in <hi>Matth. 5. 8. The pure in heart:</hi> He is
<hi>pure</hi> in his <hi>Ends, pure</hi> in his principles, <hi>pure</hi> in
his practises, <hi>pure</hi> from the dross of <hi>Lust:</hi> and
he is not so much <hi>Nominally</hi> as really, <hi>A Puritan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42919:51"/>
Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gold is a <hi>Ductil</hi> Metal. Tis marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
extensible when beaten into Leaves; twere
incredible to tell how far one Grain of <hi>Gold</hi> may
be extended and continued. So dense and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted,
and united, are the parts of it, that an
Ounce of it may be beaten (I suppose) into a
Thousand Leaves. Thus a good Man can be
<hi>Drawn forth</hi> into large Expressions of goodness
and vertue. It was said by such an one in Psal.
11. 3. <hi>My goodness Extendeth.</hi> He <hi>extends</hi> his
Piety, his Charity, he <hi>extends</hi> his lnfluence far
and near; and he is a <hi>Diffusive</hi> good.</p>
               <p>Once more, <hi>Gold</hi> is a <hi>Beautiful</hi> metal. 'Tis
called, <hi>Aurum,</hi> for that very cause; <hi>ab Aura,</hi>
i. e. <hi>a Splendore.</hi> Tis a shining and glitt'ring
thing; and hence things that are very splendid,
are said to be <hi>covered with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ellow</hi> Gold. For
this reason, an <hi>Hook</hi> of it once catch't <hi>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> by
<hi>the Lust of the Eye.</hi> Thus, a good man has a
transcendent <hi>Beauty</hi> in him. To such an one,
twas said in Cant. 6. 4. <hi>Thou art</hi> Beautiful.
There is a Lustre on the <hi>Face,</hi> and a Lustre in
the <hi>Walk</hi> of such a man; he has even the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of <hi>A light in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Gold</hi> is a <hi>Durable</hi> Metal. Tho'
the Bible affirms that it is <hi>Corruptible,</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

and <hi>Perishing,</hi> yet there is a mighty
<hi>Strength</hi> to be ascribed unto it. It will endure

an <hi>Enduring</hi> thing is a good man. His Character
is that in Matth. 24. 13. <hi>He shall</hi> endure <hi>to the
end.</hi> No <hi>Fire,</hi> no <hi>Water,</hi> no Vexation shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
his Devotion. He is the <hi>Overcomer,</hi>
whom neither the Flattery nor the Fury, neither
the Frowning nor the Fawning of any <hi>Tempter</hi>
can dissolve the Religion of.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Gold</hi> is a <hi>Ponderous</hi> Metal. Even
<hi>Lead</hi> it self in its weight, is to <hi>Gold</hi> as far short
as <hi>Sixty</hi> is of an <hi>Hundred;</hi> if I mistake it not.
Such is the <hi>Quality,</hi> such the <hi>Gravity</hi> of a good
man. A godly man is a <hi>Weighty</hi> man. Tis said
in Prov. 12. 26. <hi>A righteous man is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than his neighbour.</hi> One such man will weigh
down multitudes and myriads of other men. His
being a <hi>pondering man,</hi> it soon makes him become
<hi>ponderous</hi> man. His unconverted Neighbourhood
may own of him, <hi>Thou art worth ten thousand of
us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Gold</hi> is a <hi>precious</hi> Metal. Its <hi>precious</hi> for
the <hi>Vse</hi> which tis of in <hi>Nature.</hi> Rich Cordials
and Medicines are to be extracted from it. Its
precious also for the <hi>Price</hi> which tis of in <hi>Esteem;</hi>
the <hi>Auri sacra fames,</hi> the unhallowed Appetite
which men crave it with, prefers it above all
common things. Tis in Scripture-phrase a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
thing indeed, of which it might be said, <hi>It is
more precious than gold.</hi> But of a good man
might such a thing be spoken: it may be said
of such a man, as in <hi>Isa. 13. 12.</hi> The man is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42919:52"/>
                  <hi>more precious than fine</hi> gold; <hi>even than the golden
wedge of</hi> Ophir; [i. e. <hi>Peru,</hi> as some with much
pretense of Reason do conjecture it] A <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
man, is a <hi>precious</hi> man; all Beholders ought
to put a value upon him; he is even, <hi>precious
in the eyes of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus like to <hi>Gold</hi> will good men come forth,
under and after the <hi>Tryals</hi> of the Lord; which

for the <hi>merciful</hi> Dispensations of God, these do

who has believed our Report?</hi> Men and Brethren,
do you <hi>beleeve</hi> it, and apprehend it, and reallize
it. <hi>Beleeve</hi> it, that God is <hi>all Eye,</hi> and that He
needs not a <hi>Glass Window</hi> in your breasts for the
Exploration of you. <hi>Beleeve</hi> it, that <hi>the eyes of the
Lord run to &amp; fro, through the whole earth;</hi> and that
he will not by a <hi>Mistake</hi> drop a Blessing wrong as
blind <hi>Isaac</hi> did of old. Yea, let it be a frequent
Meditation with you, <hi>All that I</hi> am, <hi>and all
that I</hi> think, <hi>is well known unto the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Expect</hi> that God will one day <hi>Discover</hi>
what you are. There is a <hi>Day of Discovery</hi> that
shall shine upon us all; and, <hi>Behold the Day comes
that shall burn as an Oven, and all that do wickedly
shall be stubble in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Expect</hi> that the great God will have a <hi>Snare</hi>
in this world, for your Detection. Ever now &amp;
then there happen some <hi>Discriminating</hi> Things,
<hi>That they which are approved might be made manifest.</hi>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:42919:54"/>
God will have His Times and His Wayes, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to <hi>uncase</hi> our hearts before all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
It was said of that blessed man in 2.
<hi>Chron. 32. 31. God left him</hi> (in one thing) <hi>to</hi>
try <hi>him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</hi>
You may look for some <hi>Temptation</hi> before you
dye, which will make the Inclinations of your
souls notorious to the world; especially, If your
<hi>Hearts</hi> be not <hi>right with God.</hi> It is a <hi>Simile</hi> us'd
by one of the Ancients, for it; You shall have
an <hi>Ape</hi> drest in the <hi>Attire</hi> of a Man, for a while
imitating the <hi>Look,</hi> and <hi>shape,</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> of
a man: but if a <hi>Nutt,</hi> or an <hi>Apple</hi> be thrown
before him, he soon showes what he is. Thou
<hi>Hypocrite,</hi> the Lord will have something to
<hi>throw before</hi> thee, which <hi>Object</hi> will decoy thee
into a natural suitable Expression of thy self;
and as our Lord speaks, in Rev. 2. 23. <hi>All the
Churches shall know, that I am He that searcheth
the Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Expect</hi> also, that the great God will have a
<hi>Bar</hi> for your Detection in another world. Tis
confessed by all Christians, as in 2. Cor. 5. 10.
<hi>We must all appear before the Iudgment seat of
Christ.</hi> O that we could every one of us now se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
place our selves before <hi>the Iudgment seat of
God!</hi> Remember, O immortal souls, that
you must all very shortly appear before a <hi>Iudge</hi>
who hath <hi>Eyes like a flame of fire;</hi> and you must
then be exposed in the full view of <hi>Heaven</hi> &amp; <hi>Earth.</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42919:55"/>
Remember that you shall then have no <hi>Vizard,</hi> no
<hi>Disguise</hi> to cover you, but all men and Angels
must hear truly <hi>what</hi> you are. It was the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Eccl. 11. 9.—know thou, that God will
bring thee to Iudgment.</hi> Even so <hi>Know thou,</hi> that
thou canst not avoid the day when <hi>God shall bring
every worke into Iudgement, with every secret thing.
Know thou,</hi> that when the dead, <hi>small and great
stand before God,</hi> then <hi>thou</hi> shalt stand among 'em!
<hi>Know thou,</hi> that tho' thou shouldst then shriek, <hi>O
Rocks, hide me,</hi> or <hi>O Mountains-defend me,</hi> the
the Rocks and the Mountains would be deaf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that lamentable cry. Holy <hi>Ierom</hi> could say,
<hi>Wherever I</hi> am, <hi>or whatever I</hi> do, <hi>Methinks I hear
the Alarums of the last Trumpet,</hi> Arise ye dead &amp;
come to <hi>Iudgement.</hi> O that you would often
Reflect upon the Day, when <hi>God shall judge the
secrets of men by Iesus Christ.</hi>

are to use the Word of God as a <hi>Glass</hi> in which

as we sometimes are, by the <hi>Rods</hi> of God, we

                     <p>To be much in such Self-Examination is the

                     <p>II. Let us also approve ourselves, as <hi>gold,</hi>
under the <hi>Dispensations</hi> of the Blessed GOD.</p>
                     <p>Particularly,</p>
                     <p>First. Let them that are in <hi>Prosperity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves well under the <hi>Tryals</hi> of the
Lord. It may be that you are come to have store
of <hi>Gold;</hi> O that you may <hi>Be</hi> like what you <hi>Have!</hi>
Tis possible that you have been in much Distress
and Sorrow: But God has brought you forth,
as tis said He brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in Ps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
105. 37. <hi>He brought them forth with</hi> Gold.</p>
                     <p>Consider, That God is now <hi>Trying</hi> of your
<hi>Faithfulness.</hi> No doubt, you have sometimes
promised the God of Heaven, <hi>That</hi> if you might
have such a measure of <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> or,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42919:57"/>
                        <hi>That</hi> if you might have such a Degree of <hi>Estate</hi>
and <hi>Honour</hi> you would glorify God with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Activity. Well, saith our God, <hi>I'll try.</hi>
God is <hi>trying</hi> whether you will be true to those
Professions and Engagements, which you made
before He so smil'd upon you. God is <hi>trying</hi>
whether you will not Confirm that Observation,
in Jer. 17. 9. <hi>The</hi> Heart <hi>is deceitful above all
things and desperately wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Consider moreover, That God is now <hi>trying</hi>
of your <hi>Thankfulness.</hi> A very terrible Wrath is
denounced against them in Deut. 28. 47. <hi>Who
serve not God for the abundance of all things.</hi> God
gives you an <hi>Abundance of all things,</hi> and it is to
<hi>try</hi> whether you will <hi>serve</hi> Him, and <hi>praise</hi> Him
for it. God is <hi>Trying</hi> whether you will now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
say, <hi>Bless the</hi> LORD, <hi>O my soul, and all that
is within me!</hi> God is <hi>Trying</hi> whether you will
now think, <hi>What shall I</hi> render <hi>to the</hi> LORD <hi>for
all His benefits?</hi> Let us be as <hi>Gold</hi> by affording
now a good Experiment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let them that are in <hi>Adversity,</hi>
likewise behave themselves as under the <hi>Tryals</hi>
of the Lord. We may most or all of us, Lament,
<hi>I am the man that hath seen Affliction;</hi> there is a
Variety of Calamity which we are <hi>try'd</hi> withal.
God forbid that we should procure to our selves
the Brand set upon that wicked man of old, <hi>In
the time of his</hi> Distress <hi>did he</hi> trespass <hi>yet</hi> more <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the</hi> LORD. Never was there in this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42919:57"/>
world a more doleful sight than that of a <hi>Theef</hi>
on a <hi>Cross,</hi> yet Neglecting and Affronting the
Son of God. We that have been lately under
Affliction, (particularly, under that Affliction of
<hi>Sickness</hi>) have as it were <hi>lain among the pots;</hi>
God has as it were laid us by among the meanest
Lumps of clay; but O that we may now come

and <hi>Feathers with yellow Gold!</hi> O that we may
come forth of our <hi>Tryals</hi> more gracious, more
Savoury, more Heavenly, than ever we were
in our lives before; that the <hi>Iron-Age</hi> of <hi>Grief</hi>
may issue in a <hi>Golden-Age</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> unto us;
that our Adversity may procure more <hi>grace</hi> to
to us, than ever the Prosperity of <hi>Solomon</hi> did
<hi>gold</hi> to him. Tis to be desired, that the
<hi>Transmutation of Metals</hi> may be Exemplified
in us; and that the most exquisite <hi>Vitrioli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

powder may not be so powerful, to make <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

The Hundred and Nineteenth, is the

the <hi>sweetest,</hi> of all the Psalms; and perhaps the
<hi>Psalm,</hi> like the <hi>Grace</hi> wherewith it was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
has a <hi>growing Sweetness,</hi> towards the
Conclusion of it. The one and twentieth <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>

Affections;</hi> this two and twentieth Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
is an Heap of <hi>Holy Petitions.</hi> There are
especially <hi>Six</hi> Petitions in this last part of the
Psalm. The <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> of them are in the

words now before us. He begs, First, for his
<hi>Life,</hi> then for God's <hi>Help.</hi> The <hi>Life</hi> petition`d
for, may be understood as Two-fold: it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>The life of the Soul;</hi> both <hi>Natural</hi> Life, and
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Life may be intended in that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But cheefly the former. <hi>Let my soul live;</hi>
it is q. d. <hi>Let my</hi> Self <hi>live.</hi> Tis an usual Hebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.
In that signification it was the Choice of

That he might attend the Business for which he
desired to live; namely, To <hi>praise God.</hi> And
we also have the <hi>From-Whence,</hi> of this <hi>Help;</hi> this
is, From the <hi>Iudgments</hi> of God. <hi>Thy Iudgments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
this is one of the Ten various Phrases used here,
to signify, the <hi>Wayes</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> whereby God,
reveals Himself unto the world.</p>
            <p>In short, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> before us, is, That</p>
            <p>While we pray to <hi>live,</hi> we should account the
<hi>Praises</hi> of God to be the Cheef End of our <hi>Life,</hi> in
which the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God are to be sought and
used as our <hi>Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propositions which may shape this
Truth unto our minds are these.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Praise <hi>of God is to be accounted the cheef end
of our</hi> Life <hi>on Earth.</hi> If our <hi>Souls</hi> do <hi>live in our
Bodies,</hi> if we enjoy that <hi>Life</hi> which is an Union
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42919:60"/>
between <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> this is to be the <hi>End</hi> of
it; <hi>That we may</hi> praise <hi>the God of our lives.</hi> It
was the pious Expectation of the Psalmist, in
Psal. 118. 17. <hi>I shal not dy but</hi> live, <hi>and</hi> declare
<hi>the</hi> works <hi>of the Lord.</hi> This is to be the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of every man. Can we say, <hi>I do not dy
but live?</hi> We should add, <hi>I will then</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<hi>the</hi> Praises <hi>of the Lord.</hi> The first Question
that the Thoughts of men should be employed
upon is, <hi>What is the Cheef End of Man?</hi> The
true and Just answer To that Question is, <hi>The
Cheef End of man is to</hi> glorifie <hi>God.</hi> Well, put
the Question so, <hi>What is the Cheef End of</hi> Life?
The Answer to that Question too will be the
same; <hi>It is to</hi> glorifie <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>praise</hi> God, What is that? To <hi>praise</hi> God,
is to <hi>Render</hi> and <hi>Procure,</hi> a due Acknowlement of
His Excellencies. Indeed all the Duties of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
are Contained in this Comprehensive thing.
When we <hi>own,</hi> when we <hi>serve,</hi> when we <hi>Adore</hi>
the Great God in any or all the waies of His
Worship, Then we <hi>praise</hi> Him; and we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>praise</hi> Him, when we provoke others to
join with us in doing so. This, This <hi>Praise</hi> of
the LORD is the <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Life</hi> in the
World.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Being.</hi> We are told
that <hi>We have our</hi> Being <hi>in God.</hi> Of all things
whatever this is then most Reasonable,
that <hi>We should have our</hi> Being <hi>for</hi> God; and our
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42919:60"/>
Being <hi>for</hi> Him, is not expressed without our <hi>praising
of</hi> Him. The blessed God looks from on high
upon mankind, and saith, as in Isa. 43. 21.
<hi>This people have I formed for my self, they should
show forth my</hi> Praise. Now that which is
the <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Being,</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
too. Two things are to be affirmed of it,</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Law</hi> of God doth <hi>Appoint</hi> this as
as the <hi>End</hi> of our Lives. Unto every man
living, this is the Voice of God, <hi>I spare thy</hi>
life, <hi>that so thou mayst</hi> live <hi>my praise.</hi> It is said
in Rom. 14. 7. <hi>If we live, we</hi> are to <hi>live unto
the Lord.</hi> What the Apostle saith of <hi>Eating</hi>
and <hi>Drinking,</hi> may much more be said of <hi>Living;</hi>
as in 1. Cor. 10. 30. It must <hi>be unto the</hi> Glory
<hi>of God.</hi> God gives our Lives, God keeps our
Lives, and this is His reveled, His Preceptive
<hi>Will</hi> concerning our Lives; <hi>Man, I suffer thy</hi>
life, <hi>yea, I support thy</hi> life, <hi>that I may be praised,
loved, admired by thee as long as thou livest.</hi> It
was an heavy dismal Charge against <hi>Belshazzer,</hi>
in <hi>Dan. 5. 23. God in whose Hand thy breath
is, thou hast not glorified.</hi> The Almighty God
gives us notice of this, <hi>Thy Breath is in my hand;</hi>
at the same time He also requires this of us, <hi>Let
thy</hi> life <hi>be to my pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

his living upon God`s <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is therefore, <hi>Secondly</hi> this to be added
thereunto.</p>

                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:42919:61"/>
The <hi>Heart</hi> of man should Embrace this as the
<hi>End</hi> of our lives. It becomes every man to say,
<hi>I</hi> live <hi>that God who is worthy to be</hi> praised, <hi>may
have the</hi> praises <hi>of my Obedience to Him.</hi> It was
the godly purpose of the Psalmist, in Psal.
147. 2. <hi>While I</hi> live <hi>I will</hi> praise <hi>the Lord.</hi> And
a kin to this is the <hi>Right Thought,</hi> which every
man should entertain, <hi>I do</hi> live, <hi>that I may</hi> praise
<hi>the Lord.</hi> Hence this is one of the principal
<hi>Pleas</hi> which the Saints have used in their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>lications
for their <hi>Lives.</hi> Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pray'd
in his Distress, <hi>Lord, let me</hi> live. And what
was his Argument? It was that in <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 17.
18. <hi>The</hi> Grave <hi>cannot</hi> praise <hi>thee; the</hi> living, <hi>the</hi>
living, <hi>he shall</hi> praise <hi>thee.</hi> The heart of man
should readily close with such an <hi>End</hi> for the
life of man. Satan saies, <hi>Thou livest only to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the delights of the Flesh in the world; thou livest
only to seek, to get, and to tast the saecular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
provided for thee.</hi> The soul of man should
rise with unspeakable Indignation at this <hi>wild</hi>
proposal. On the other side, our God saies, <hi>The
Business of thy</hi> life <hi>is to</hi> magnifie <hi>Mee, to make
my</hi> Praise <hi>glorious.</hi> Here now, Here the Soul
of every man should fall in, and Reply, This
<hi>is all my</hi> Salvation, <hi>and all my</hi> Desire.</p>
               <p>But this leads to</p>

            <div n="2" type="proposition">
               <head>PROP. II.</head>
               <p>Prayers for <hi>life</hi> are then, and only then rightly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42919:61"/>
qualified, when they have Respect unto the Praises
of God.</p>
               <p>To clear this matter, there are these things
to be conceived.</p>
               <p>One Conclusion is, That the <hi>Living</hi> on Earth
have many <hi>peculiar Opportunities</hi> to be <hi>Praising</hi> of
God. Indeed, <hi>Blessed are the dead who dy in the
Lord,</hi> for they too are alwaies <hi>praising</hi> of Him.
But yet they rest from some <hi>Praises,</hi> when they
<hi>rest from their Labours</hi> here. The departed Saints
are continually shouting, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llelujah, Hallelujah,</hi>
before the Throne of God. The Saints, they
are <hi>joyful in glory;</hi> and the <hi>High Praises</hi> of God
are perpetually Proceeding from those blessed
Souls. But Christians in this world have their
<hi>peculiar Opportunities,</hi> to be Glorifying of Him
that made them. This did the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speak
in Ps 88. 11. <hi>Shall the</hi> dead <hi>praise thee?</hi> To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in some particulars:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Living</hi> here may be <hi>praising</hi> of God by
the Discharge of many <hi>Relations,</hi> which the <hi>dead</hi>
Saints are strangers unto. We may <hi>now</hi> praise
God as <hi>Parents,</hi> as <hi>Masters,</hi> as <hi>Officers</hi> in the
the Church or Common-Wealth. All those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
will <hi>dy</hi> with us, when we shall <hi>go hence
and be-no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The <hi>Living</hi> here may be <hi>Praising</hi> of
God, by Bearing many a <hi>Witness</hi> to the <hi>Truths</hi>
and <hi>Wayes</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ. We may
now bestow many <hi>Rebukes</hi> upon the <hi>Errors</hi> and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42919:62"/>
the <hi>Evils</hi> of a sinful World. We may part with
and <hi>esteem,</hi> an <hi>Estate,</hi> with our <hi>Ease,</hi> and our
<hi>Life</hi> it self, out of Respect unto the Name of
God. But our <hi>Testimonies</hi> expire with our Lives.</p>
               <p>Once more, The <hi>Living</hi> may be <hi>Praising</hi> of
God by Advancing His <hi>Kingdom</hi> here below. In
this Life we may be instrumental to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and Convert <hi>Vnregenerate</hi> Sinners, to build
up the <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jesus, and to Do
good among the ignorant by an <hi>Exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</hi>
But this is to be done only below the
stars.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, There are <hi>Graces</hi> proper to <hi>this</hi>
Life which God is <hi>praised</hi> by the Exercising
of. The Tears of <hi>Sorrow for Sin</hi> will be dry`d
up, when we come to the State in which all <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
shall flee away. <hi>Charity</hi> in Giving and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to them that need it,—there is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for that Charity among them that are <hi>above;
they</hi> are all perfect and happy there. <hi>Patience</hi>
under Tryals belongs to our present Condition
only; there are no <hi>Afflictions</hi> to trouble us,
when our <hi>few dayes full of trouble</hi> are passed away.
In a Word. Our <hi>Spiritual Warfare</hi> is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only in this <hi>Valley of the Shadow of Death.</hi>
We cannot <hi>fight the Battles of the Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we cannot <hi>shew the</hi> praises <hi>of the Lord,</hi> when
we are arrived at the <hi>End of our Faith the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Souls.</hi> Our <hi>Fight</hi> is done, our <hi>Crown</hi>
is come when we have been <hi>Faithful</hi> to the
<hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42919:62"/>
A Second Conclusion is, That <hi>Opportunities</hi>
for the <hi>Praising</hi> of God are the things for which
we should desire to be <hi>living</hi> on Earth. There
is a Three-fold <hi>Desire of Life</hi> which the Living
have. There is a <hi>Natural</hi> Desire of Life. This
is common both to <hi>good</hi> men and <hi>bad</hi> men. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
it self startles at the Approach of <hi>Death;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Nature shivers and recoyls, when this
<hi>King of Terrors</hi> is ready to lay his cold l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y hand
upon us. This was <hi>Ioab</hi>'s Desire: that valiant
Souldier, The <hi>Lord-General</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> himself, in
1. King. 2. 28. being in cold blood under Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of <hi>Death,</hi> fled unto the Horns of the
<hi>Altar,</hi> as a Sanctuary to save his <hi>Life.</hi> There
is also a <hi>Sensual</hi> Desire of Life. This is that
which <hi>Bad</hi> men are under the power of. Many
are loth to dye because they would not leave the
<hi>Pleasures</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> which did sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
them here. They are like the Miser
who on his Death-Bed, hugg'd his Baggs of Gold,
and cry'd out, <hi>Must I leave you? Must I leave
you?</hi> Their Love of their <hi>Life,</hi> comes from
their love of their <hi>Flesh.</hi> This was the <hi>Rich
Fools</hi> Desire, in Luc 12. 20. He wished for
<hi>many Years,</hi> that he might <hi>eat and drink,</hi> and <hi>be
merry</hi> here.</p>
               <p>There is likewise a <hi>gracious</hi> Desire of Life.
And <hi>this</hi> is that which <hi>good</hi> men are affected with:
They desire to <hi>live,</hi> because they desire to <hi>praise.</hi>
They would live, because they would honour
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42919:63"/>
God in those matters &amp; those manners for which
their Lives do afford them blessed <hi>Opportunities</hi>
and <hi>Advantages.</hi> Now this <hi>gracious</hi> Desire of
of Life is a <hi>Regular</hi> Desire. A <hi>Desire</hi> of Life
for the <hi>Praise</hi> of God, is the only <hi>Desire</hi> of
Life, that will have praise of God. This was
<hi>David</hi>'s Desire when he was visited with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when he was <hi>weak,</hi> and his Bones were
<hi>pained,</hi> then said he in Psal. 6. 5. <hi>O save me,
for in</hi> Death <hi>there is</hi> no Remembrance <hi>of thee, in
the</hi> Grave <hi>who shall give thee thanks?</hi> Such Desires
are the only <hi>right</hi> and <hi>chast</hi> Desires. It is not
fit for a Christian to say, I desire <hi>to</hi> live, <hi>because
I am</hi> afraid <hi>to dy.</hi> Much less is it fit for him to
say, <hi>I</hi> desire <hi>my</hi> life in <hi>the world, that I may turn
and wind still the Affairs</hi> of <hi>the World.</hi> But This
is that which Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>timates the Desire of Life: As
every thing is to be <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>roved</hi> for God, so every
thing should be <hi>desired</hi> for God. And thus <hi>Life</hi>
it self. We are daily <hi>Praying,</hi> as he in Psal.
102. 24. <hi>O my God, take me not away in the midst
of my dayes.</hi> Well, Our God enquires of us,
<hi>Why art thou unwilling to be taken away in the midst
of thy dayes?</hi> We should have this to be our
true Account of it, <hi>Because, O Lord, I am loth
to be taken away in the midst of my</hi> Praise.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="proposition">
               <head>PROP. III.</head>
               <p>The <hi>Judgments</hi> of God are to be sought and used
by us as our <hi>Help</hi> in those <hi>Praises</hi> of God which
are the End of our life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42919:63"/>
There are blessed <hi>Helps,</hi> which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for us, by which we may be both <hi>Assisted
in</hi> and <hi>Excited to,</hi> the work of our lives.</p>
               <p>Behold a <hi>double</hi> Help, <hi>both</hi> implyed in the
<hi>Iudgments</hi> of God. And he that shall consult
other passages in this Hundred-and-nineteenth
Psalm, will find both under this Notion insisted
on. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Truth, and the <hi>Troubles
of</hi> Life.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Word</hi> of God is to be <hi>sought</hi> as the
<hi>Help,</hi> of our <hi>Praising</hi> Him. The Prophet of old
could say as in <hi>Mich. 6. 8. The Lord hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee, O man, the thing that good is.</hi> Thus, the
Lord hath <hi>shewed</hi> us how to be <hi>praising</hi> of Him,
by <hi>living</hi> to Him. But Where has he shewed it?
Truly in the sacred <hi>Bible.</hi> The Bible is the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi>
given to us. Every Child is well taught
to say, <hi>The Scriptures of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are the Rule which God hath given to instruct
us how we are to glorify Him.</hi> To order a <hi>Life</hi>
in a dark world, is as hard as to manage a <hi>Ship</hi>
in a dark night, we are in the <hi>Dark</hi> about the
<hi>Practises</hi> which our lives are to be employed in.
What shall we then do that we may leave no
part of our due Homage to God unperformed?
The Apostle speaks fully to this Case in 2. Pet. 1.
18. <hi>We have a sure word of Prophecy, whereto ye
do well to take heed, as to a</hi> light <hi>shining in a</hi> dark
<hi>place.</hi> There, There it is: our Bible is our
<hi>Pole-Star:</hi> keep an eye to That and we shall
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42919:64"/>
shape a course Right. All the <hi>Directions,</hi> all the
<hi>Promises,</hi> all the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God, will be so
many Helps, of our Obedience. If any man ask,
<hi>How do the</hi> Scriptures <hi>of God help men in the</hi> Prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<hi>of God?</hi> Know, The Scriptures themselves
give an Answer thereunto, in Psal. 19. 7, 8.
<hi>The law of the Lord converts the soul, the testimonies
of the Lord make wise the simple; the statutes of
the Lord rejoice the heart; the commandments of
the Lord enlighten the eyes.</hi> That <hi>Conversion,</hi> that
<hi>Instruction,</hi> that <hi>Ioy</hi> and that <hi>Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> which the
<hi>Word</hi> of God affords unto us, will be no little
Help in the <hi>Praise</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Rod</hi> of God is to be <hi>used</hi> as the
Help of our Praising Him. The Lord sends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Afflictions</hi> upon us. An <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>man,</hi> is afflicted
in his mind: a <hi>Iob</hi> is Afflicted in his Estate;
a <hi>Gaius</hi> is afflicted in his Body, a <hi>Paul</hi> in his
Credit, and a <hi>David</hi> in his Children, they
<hi>live ill</hi> and they <hi>dy worse</hi> before him. What is
the Use we are now to make of these things?
Truly our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are to be the Help of our
<hi>Devotions.</hi> It is the Call of God in <hi>Mic 6. 9.
Hear the Rod.</hi> As we should hear the <hi>Voice</hi> of the
Rod, so we should use the <hi>Help</hi> of the Rod. By
our <hi>Afflictions</hi> we should be <hi>helped</hi> unto more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness,
more Watchfulness, more Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Now those things are to the <hi>Praise</hi> of the
glory of the grace of God. Our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are
the <hi>purgings</hi> &amp; the <hi>prunings</hi> bestow'd by our God
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42919:64"/>
upon us. What are they for? but, <hi>That we
may bring forth</hi> more <hi>Fruit:</hi> and we are told in
<hi>Ioh. 15. 8. Herein is my father</hi> glorified, <hi>if ye bring
forth</hi> much fruit. Observe it: a <hi>Learning</hi> the
<hi>Statutes</hi> of God, is a <hi>Rendring</hi> of <hi>Praises</hi> to God;
those <hi>two</hi> things are <hi>one.</hi> Now see what the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
saith, in Psal 119. 97. <hi>Tis good for me that
I have been</hi> afflicted, <hi>that I may</hi> learn <hi>thy Statutes.</hi>
This then is incumbent on us under every Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
Our study should be, <hi>What Advantage,
what Engagement to be more holy, is now put into my
hands!</hi> Every Afflicted man should ask, <hi>How
may the</hi> Sorrowes <hi>of my</hi> life <hi>promote the</hi> praises <hi>of
my</hi> God?</p>

                  <p>Some <hi>Evil Desires</hi> are hence Rebuked and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.

                  <p>First, <hi>Impatient</hi> Desires of <hi>Death,</hi> are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                  <p>Something is to be said by way of <hi>Concession;</hi>
and something by way of <hi>Correction</hi> about such
Desires.</p>
                  <p>First by way of <hi>Concession,</hi> I would say; There
are <hi>some</hi> Desires of Death <hi>well-becoming</hi> a Child of
God. Such were the Desires of <hi>Paul,</hi> in Phil. 1.
22. <hi>I desire to be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssolved and be with Christ.</hi> When
we think of the day, in which we shall go to the
the <hi>Spirits of just men made perfect;</hi> and to <hi>Iesus
the Mediator of the New-Covenant;</hi> When we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42919:65"/>
think of the day in which the <hi>Lord will deliver
us from the hand of all our enemies, and from the
hand of SIN;</hi> O the thoughts of it should fill
our Souls with Raptures of Joy! they should
cause our hearts to leap and spring within us. In
is an allowable thing to be almost angry with
<hi>Time,</hi> to call upon slow <hi>Time,</hi> and say, <hi>Fly apaces
Fly away, O Time; Come, O</hi> Eternity, <hi>come and
fetch me into the presence of the Lord.</hi> The Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Lord Jesus may cause us to say hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with aged, faithful <hi>Simeon,</hi> Lord, <hi>let thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
depart <hi>in peace.</hi> The Chariots of <hi>Death,</hi>
sent by the Lord Jesus to fetch us unto Himself
should be as welcom to us, as the <hi>Waggons</hi> of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
were to <hi>Iacob</hi> of old. It should cause us to
<hi>Rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,</hi> when
we think of the <hi>unspeakable joy</hi> and the <hi>full glory</hi>
which we are going unto. There are holy <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
and <hi>lookings</hi> of Soul, with which we may
cry out, <hi>Why, why are His Churiots so long i'com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Why tarry the Wheels thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By way of <hi>Correction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If these <hi>Desires</hi> are <hi>with</hi> Impatience, much more
if they are <hi>thro'</hi> Impatience, they become sinful
before the Lord. The embittered spirits of
Christians, have been sometimes too prone unto
<hi>such</hi> Desires. It was an inordinate passion in
<hi>Moses,</hi> when a froward people under his charge
provoked him to say, in <hi>Numb. 17. 14. Kill
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42919:65"/>
me, I pray thee out of hand.</hi> Had God granted
his Desire, he had lost Thirty years of eminent
Service in the World. It was an irregular
passion in <hi>Elias,</hi> when the persecutions of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men so tired him, as to make him say, in 1.
King. 19. 4. <hi>O Lord, take away my life.</hi> It
hath been an Observation, that <hi>Many good and,
great men sit under</hi> Elias's <hi>Iuniper tree.</hi> As culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was the Passion of <hi>Ionah,</hi> when the Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Guord had that Effect upon him in Cap.
4. 8. <hi>He wished to</hi> dy. The like <hi>pang</hi> of Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
did that <hi>Pattern</hi> of Patience, <hi>Iob,</hi> fall into
be spake as if he could hardly for bear <hi>laying violent
hands</hi> upon himself. Even so far do the <hi>distempered,</hi>
unbridled Wishes of many run. Their <hi>Desire</hi>
of Death is a sort of <hi>Revenge</hi> on God; they
would as it were deprive God of the glory
which He might have of them. Compose these
desires, O ye raging Souls; compose these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
Allay this <hi>Fever,</hi> this phrensy. Its not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>irreligious</hi> but an <hi>unnatural</hi> passion which
you are carried away withal. You desire to <hi>dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Well, are you sure that the <hi>Death</hi> which you <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi>
now, will not prove a <hi>Death</hi> which you shall
<hi>Deplore</hi> throughout eternal Ages. It is said of
the Believer in Psal. 91. 19. <hi>With</hi> long life <hi>will
I</hi> satisfie <hi>him, and shew him my Salvation.</hi> It is
a very disordered heart that will be <hi>dissatisfied</hi>
with so great a mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Vnsanctified</hi> Desires of Life are to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42919:66"/>
be Reproved also. Of these Desires there are
Three Sorts to be Reprehended.</p>
                  <p>There are, first. <hi>Carnal</hi> Desires of Life to be
blamed. Some desire to <hi>live,</hi> and wherefore is
it? It is because they desire to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> and
be merry. They cann't part with such <hi>Relations</hi>
and <hi>Possessions</hi> as are here to be enjoyed. The
<hi>Comforts</hi> of Life are the things that cause their
<hi>Desires</hi> of Life. One once beholding his fine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
made this Reflection thereupon,
<hi>Haec faciunt invitos mori<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</hi> these are the things that
make us <hi>unwilling to dy.</hi> Unmortified Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the causes of these desires. Remember
what the Lord hath said in Matth. 10. 37. <hi>He
that loveth Father or Mother, or Son or</hi> DAUGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
<hi>more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Thus
may the Lord well say to the <hi>Subject</hi> of these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
<hi>If you had rather be with your</hi> friends <hi>on</hi> earth,
<hi>than with your</hi> Father <hi>in</hi> Heaven, <hi>you are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be with me at all.</hi> And this by the way is
to be said of them that desire the life of their
<hi>Friends</hi> as well as of them selves. It is for the
Interest of the Lord Jesus Christ that the dead
<hi>Children</hi> which you lament, <hi>are dead;</hi> or else
they had not dyed at all. Now sais the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
<hi>If thou lovest those</hi> CHILDREN, <hi>those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
more than me, and hadst rather have them with
thy self, to my</hi> Prejudice, <hi>than to have them with
me, to thy own</hi> Bereavement, <hi>thou art not worthy to
have them with me at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42919:66"/>
Secondly. There are <hi>Careful</hi> Desires of Life
to be likewise blamed. Many desire to <hi>live</hi> only
upon this account, <hi>Some</hi> Child, <hi>or some</hi> Charge
<hi>they are concerned for.</hi> They have this or that
<hi>Child</hi> which they cannot believe will be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, when they are <hi>dead;</hi> or they suspect
what will become of such or such a <hi>Charge.</hi> There
is indeed a Desire of Life on such a Score, which
is not alwaies very severely to be found fault
withal. But oftentimes there is too much <hi>Distrust</hi>
in such a <hi>desire.</hi> Why cannot we venture our
Families and the Concernments thereof, in the
Hands of the faithful God? The Lord has said
in Jer. 49. 11. <hi>Leave thy fatherless</hi> Children, <hi>I
will preserve them alive.</hi> And he still saies, <hi>I will
be a</hi> better Father, <hi>and a</hi> better Friend <hi>unto them,
than thou thy self canst be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly. There are <hi>Fearful</hi> Desires of Life
which are blame-worthy too. When Death
comes with that message, <hi>Set thy</hi> Soul <hi>in order, for
thou shalt dy and not live,</hi> many persons are so
terrified as to be even at their wits ends. O how
they groan. <hi>I cannot dy!</hi> Indeed Sinners that
have not been <hi>born twice,</hi> may well tremble to
<hi>dy once;</hi> no body can blame <hi>them;</hi> there is a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Death,</hi> ready to sieze upon the forlorn souls
that are not Regenerate. But such as have been
truly turn'd to God in Christ, should not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Death with such Reluctancies. Can you not
uprightly say, That if you were sure to be <hi>freed</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:42919:67"/>
from <hi>Sin,</hi> you could be content to be struck by
Death? O then, be cheerfully willing to <hi>Dy.</hi>
Thy soul will no sooner pass into Eternity but it
shall experience that thing in <hi>Rom. 6. 7. He that
is</hi> dead <hi>is</hi> freed <hi>from Sin.</hi> It is often pretended
by men, <hi>I would</hi> live <hi>because, I would be more</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>before I dy.</hi> Tis well; but there is not seldom
a <hi>Deceit</hi> in the <hi>Pretence;</hi> often something else
is in the Bottom; <hi>A Rebellion against the Will of
God.</hi> Wouldst thou really and earnestly be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>
Be willing then to <hi>dy</hi> as well as to <hi>live.</hi>
Death is the way to <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Perfection of
it. In short: Good was the Temper of that
sick person who being asked, <hi>Which do you desire,
to</hi> live, <hi>or to dy?</hi> answered, <hi>I refer it to</hi> God;
and when it was again said, <hi>But suppose God
should refer it to you?</hi> reply'd, <hi>I would then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to him again.</hi>

                  </p>

The Psalmist could say in Ps. 119. 164. <hi>Seven
times a day will I</hi> praise <hi>thee O Lord; because of
thy Righteous</hi> Judgements.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Let the <hi>Rod</hi> of God <hi>provoke</hi> you to
His <hi>Praises.</hi> If you cannot <hi>Bless</hi> God <hi>for</hi> your
Afflictions, which yet, I think, is a thing attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
nevertheless, I'm sure you should <hi>praise</hi> God

                  <p>To Enforce these <hi>Three</hi> Things;</p>
                  <p>Consider <hi>that</hi> Thing wich is intimated in the
Text. The <hi>Lives</hi> of your <hi>Souls</hi> are enwrapped
in the praises of God. Saies the Psalmist, <hi>Let
my</hi> soul live, <hi>and it shall</hi> praise <hi>thee.</hi> So I may
say, <hi>Let thy Soul</hi> praise, <hi>and it shall</hi> live. A <hi>prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Soul, is a <hi>Thriving</hi> Soul. In this consisteth
<hi>Life Eternal</hi> it self, The <hi>Life</hi> of thy <hi>Soul</hi> in the
Third Heaven, will be the <hi>praise</hi> of thy <hi>God</hi> for
evermore. Praise God <hi>for</hi> thy Life; it is a
mercy well worth praise. Praise God <hi>by</hi> thy life;
so thou wilt begin <hi>Heaven upon Earth.</hi>
                  </p>

more peculiar interest in my <hi>Loves</hi> and <hi>Cares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tis to <hi>Young</hi> People here, that I take leave

the <hi>Praise</hi> of the everliving God. My Brethren,

Unregeneracy, if you have not yet begun to <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

<hi>My soul desires the</hi> first ripe <hi>Fruit;</hi> and He seem'd
to express as it were some <hi>Hast,</hi> for the <hi>First
Fruits</hi> under the Law of Old. The Lord in a
sort longs to see you serving of Him with the
<hi>First Fruits</hi> of your <hi>Age,</hi> and of your <hi>Praise.</hi> He
saies as in <hi>Cant. 2. 14. Let me hear thy voice, for
sweet is thy voice.</hi> The <hi>Voice</hi> of your <hi>Praises</hi>
makes a matchless melody in the ears of the God

that has call'd for them. The very <hi>Chatterings</hi>
of our infants are pleasant unto us; the
<hi>Praises</hi> and the <hi>Devotions</hi> of <hi>young</hi> persons are so
unto <hi>Our Father which is in Heaven;</hi> and he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for them with ungainsayable Importunities.
'Twas said unto a <hi>young</hi> man in 1. <hi>Chron. 28.
9. If thou seek the Lord, He will be found of
thee,</hi> Even so. <hi>If thou</hi> (that art a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
<hi>praise the Lord he will be pleased with thee.</hi>
One that owns an Orchard full of many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Trees,</hi> will take a most particular and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Notice of a <hi>young</hi> Tree beginning to have
some little Fruit upon it: <hi>Our Father is such an
Husband man.</hi> Young <hi>Iohns,</hi> are they that prove
<hi>the Disciples whom Iesus loves.</hi> Young <hi>Iosiahs</hi> will

are you not yet overcome to resolve,
<hi>I will now</hi> praise <hi>and</hi> serve <hi>the great God!</hi> O let

become <hi>Altogether</hi> so. As twas said of him, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

before the <hi>Charms</hi> of these Considerations?</p>
                  <p>Lord visit the hitherto-unperswaded <hi>young</hi> people
here; O make it the <hi>Day of thy power</hi>
with them; and keep these things
in the Imagination of the
thoughts of their hearts
for Evermore.</p>
