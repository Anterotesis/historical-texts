         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Aggrauation of ſmall things, when a

preſuming to giue Law to themſelues, and in
rage, to right their owne wrongs: At which

heare their outrages, he lookes vpon them, as
vpon intemperate ſicke men; therefore is not
angrie with them, if during their ſickneſſe they
haue beene ſo bold, as to ſpeake iniuriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. And as hee ſets light by all their
words of honor; ſo torments he himſelfe as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with all their deſpight &amp; inſolencies. For he
that is diſpleaſed for an iniurie that is done him,
will likewiſe be glad to be honored at his hands
that did it; which a wiſe man is free from. For he
that reuenges a Contumely, honors him that did
it, in taking it ſo much to heart, &amp; reſpecting it.</p>
               <p>Art thou angrie with thy Superior? Alas,
Death is at hand, which ſhall make vs equalls.
Doeſt thou wiſh him, with whom thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
any more then Death? Although thou
attempteſt nothing againſt him, he ſhall be ſure
of that; thou loſeſt thy labour then, in offering
to doe that, which will be done without thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7879:12"/>
We laugh, ſayth the wiſeſt of Philoſophers,
in beholding the Conflict of the Bul and Beare,
when they are tyed one to another; which after
they haue tyred one another; the Butcher at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for them both, to driue them to the
Slaughter-houſe. The like doe we. We chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
him that is coupled with vs, Brother, or
Friend, we charge him on euery ſide: meane
while, both the conqueror and conquered, are
neere vnto their ruine. Rather let vs finiſh that
little remainder of our life in quiet and peace,
that our end may be a Pleaſure to no man.</p>
               <p>Thou wiſheſt a mans death! and there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
but a little difference betwixt the day of
thy deſire, and the affliction of the Sufferer.</p>
               <p>Whileſt we are therefore amongſt men, let
vs embrace Humanitie; be dreadfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to no man; let vs contemne Iniuries
and Contumelies; for but looking backe, we
may behold Death preſently attend vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> that liued a Tyrant in <hi>Athens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his crueltie mocked and reproued by a
druuken man, anſwered, That he was no more
angry with him, then if a blind-fold fellow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his eyes bound vp, ſhould run vpon him.</p>
               <p>Another ſaid to his friend, I prithee chaſtiſe
my ſeruant with ſtroks, becauſe I am angry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
<pb facs="tcp:7879:13"/>
thus much, That a ſeruant ought not to
fall into his power, that is not maſter of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But now the compounding of Quarrels is
growne to a Trade: And as a moſt worthie
Father of Law and Equitie ſpeakes, there be
ſome Councell learned of <hi>Duells,</hi> that teach
young Gentlemen, when they are beforehand,
and when behind-hand, and thereby incenſe
and incite them to the <hi>Duell,</hi> and make an Art
of it: the ſpurre and incitement, falſe &amp; erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
imagination of Honor &amp; Credit, when moſt
commonly thoſe golden hopes end in a Halter.</p>
               <p>That Folly and Vaine-glory ſhould caſt ſo
thicke a miſt before the eye of Gentry! to fixe
their ayme and only end-vpon Reputation, and
end moſt lamentably without it; nay, fartheſt
from it: firſt, to hazard the eternall death of their
Soules, and the ſuruiuing Bodies, to die the
death of a Cut-purſe.</p>
               <p>A miſerable effect, and moſt horrid reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when young men, full of towardneſſe and
hope, ſuch as the Poets call <hi>Aurorae filij,</hi> the
Sonnes of the Morning, in whom the ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
and comfort of their friends conſiſts,
ſhall be caſt away and ruined for euer in ſo
vaine a buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>But much more is it to be deplored, when ſo
<pb facs="tcp:7879:13"/>
much Noble and Gentle bloud ſhall be ſpilt
vpon ſuch Follies; which aduentured in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Seruice, were able to make the fortune of
a Day, &amp; to change the fortune of a Kingdome.</p>
               <p>It is euident then, how deſperate an euill this
is, which troubles Peace, disfurniſhes Warre,
brings ſudden calamitie vpon priuat Men, Peril
vpon the State, and Contempt vpon the Law.</p>
               <p>They pretend aboue all things to regard Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
yet chiefely ſeeke the diſhonour of God
and of Iuſtice; and which is worſe then Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in thoſe men, that aduenturing to leaue
this life in Anger, preſume to preſſe into the
next, to the Supper of the Lambe, which is all
Peace &amp; Loue, without Peace, Loue, or Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
O that Gentlemen would learne to eſteeme
themſelues at a iuſt price, how dearely they are
bought, how moſt precious their Redemption!</p>
               <p>The root of this Offence is ſtubborne;
for it deſpiſeth Death, which is the vtmoſt of all
Temporall puniſhments, and had need of the
Seueritie vſed in <hi>France;</hi> where the Manſlayers,
though Gentlemen of great Qualitie, are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with their Wounds bleeding, leſt a naturall
Death ſhould preuent the example of Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>This punctualitie of Reputation, is no better
then a Bewitching Sorcerie, that inchaunts the
<pb facs="tcp:7879:14"/>
ſpirits of young men, like the Smoake of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that Witch <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which hath quite
blowne away the Smoake of Hoſpitalitie, and
turned the Chimneyes of their Fore-fathers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Noſes of their Children. And by all
Computation (if Computation may be kept for
Folly) I thinke the Vapour of the one, and the
Vaine-glorie of the other, came into <hi>England</hi>
much vpon a voyage, and hath kept as cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as the Report followes the Powder.</p>
               <p>For when, but in the laterneſſe of theſe
times, hath ſo much priuate and domeſtique
Bloud beene ſhed? Like the three <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in that perplexed Hiſtorie of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
who wanting Enemies, ſtill flew vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
So theſe malicious, vnthankfull Spirits,
fattened with the aboundant Bleſſings of a
mellifluous Peace, diſgorge themſelues vpon
their Chriſtian Brothers; like thoſe that ſurfet
vpon too much Honey.</p>
               <p>And well may this Vaine-glorie, or opinion
of Reputation, bee called a Satanicall Illuſion,
and Apparition of Honour, againſt Religion,
Law, Morall Vertue, and againſt all the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Preſidents and Examples of the beſt
Times, and valianteſt Nations. For hereby
haue Gentlemen loſt the true knowledge and
<pb facs="tcp:7879:14"/>
vnderſtanding of Fortitude and Valour. For
true Fortitude diſtinguiſheth of the grounds
of Quarrels, whether they be iuſt; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo, but whether they be worthie; and ſets a
better value vpon mens liues, then to beſtow
them idly; which are not ſo to be trifled away,
but offered vp and ſacrificed to honourable
Seruices, publike Merits, good Cauſes, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Aduentures.</p>
               <p>And behold here thy Folly; thou attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
a way, freely to loſe thy Soule eternally, but
not thy Reputation. Foole that thou art, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to ſaue that, which indeed is nothing,
thou loſeſt all! For Reputation is but another
mans Opinion, and Opinion is no ſubſtance for
thee to conſiſt of. For how canſt thou conſiſt
of a thing that is without thee? Which may be
any mans at an inſtant, as well as thine; and
when thou haſt it, it is but a breath: And of
what certainetie or permanence is it, when they
muſt die that giue it thee?</p>
               <p>Perhaps, becauſe ſome haue ſaid, that Fame
hath a perpetuitie; thou haſtenſt to loſe thy
Soule, to prouide for thy Name: How much
thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe? Why, it is no more
then the Eccho of a glory: For as an Eccho no
longer reſounds, then it is fed with a voyce, no
<pb facs="tcp:7879:15"/>
longer does Fame ſound forth mans Prayſes,
then it is ſupplyed and cheriſhed with deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings:
For when thy noyſe ceaſes in it ſelfe, it
will quickly ceaſe the noyſe of thee. How euer,
at the fartheſt, a generall Diſſolution will
come, when Fame, that is next to nothing
now, ſhall haue no being then at all.</p>
               <p>Happy is then the wiſe and vnderſtanding
Spirit: for though he be iniured, hee can loſe
nothing thereby, neither his Fame, nor Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for a wiſe man entertaines nothing that
is ſubiect to loſſe. Fortune takes nothing but
what ſhe hath giuen; ſhe giues not Vertue, nor
Wiſdome; therefore cannot take that away.</p>
               <p>The more thou thinkeſt vpon Reputation,
the farther off thou art from all contention, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
cuſtome in Ignorance, or wilfulneſſe in
Nature, make thee throw an abuſe vpon the
Word. For what is Reputation, but Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
A diligent weighing, conſidering, and
reuoluing in the minde? And that is quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to Raſhneſſe: Truth will ſhame thee, if
thou confeſſe not ſo much.</p>
               <p>There can be then no Reputation in Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that is manifeſt: And what are Quarrels,
but the fruits of Raſhneſſe? There can be then
no Reputation in Quarrels</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7879:15"/>
And as it is Conſideration, it were dreadfull
to thinke, that any man, in the ſtate of his beſt
counſell and aduiſedneſſe, ſhould attempt to
deſtroy the Image of his Creator, in the life of
his Chriſtian Brother. And therefore diuinely
haue our humane Lawes bent their hate &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
againſt the abhorred Act, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
in cold bloud; which is as wilfull an oppoſition
againſt mans life (conſidering what he does) as
Blaſphemy againſt the Word of Truth; the
Conſcience knowing it offends of ſet purpoſe
(the only ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.) And
as the body of euery true Chriſtian is ſaid to be
the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>1. Cor. 3. 16.</hi> What
does the accurſed Man-ſlayer, but in the bloud
of his Brother, deſtroyes the Temple, as the
Blaſphemer wounds the Lord of the Temple?</p>
               <p>Behold then, not without a face of Horror,
the miſerable condition the Sonnes of this Age
runne into. All they venture for, is to bring the
bloudineſſe of their Action into the compaſſe
of Honour (as if Honour conſiſted in deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
Now what impoſſibilitie followes that
labour, euen the weakeſt may coniecture. For
Honour is the Rumour of a beautifull and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Action, which redoundeth from our
Soules to the view of the World, and by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb facs="tcp:7879:16"/>
into our ſelues, bringing to vs a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of that which others beleeue of vs: which
turnes to a great peace, and contentment of
mind; Bleſſings which were neuer yet found in
a Bloudſhedder, let his cauſe be neuer ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And where there is no Peace, all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
haue a ceſſation. It is the onely health of
thy Soule; and that once loſt, thy ſoule ſickens
immediately, euen to death, and can no more
taſte or relliſh a Ioy after, then a ſick mans Pallet
his Nutriment.</p>
               <p>Is not this then a deluſion of Honour? Nay,
can there be any thing more deluſiue? Alas,
when it is at the greateſt height of humane glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
it is of a ſmall and ſlender efficacie, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
a ſtranger, and as it were ſeparated in the
Ayre from him that is honoured: For it does
not only, not enter into him, nor is inward and
eſſentiall vnto him, but it does not ſo much as
touch him. A poore and miſerable purchaſe at
the beſt, for ſo great and eternall a hazzard!</p>
               <p>Flatter not thy Soule then to her euerlaſting
ruine, in thinking Reputation conſiſts in Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding.
<hi>Sanguis clamat,</hi> as the Almightie
ſpeakes in the Letter of his owne Law; Bloud
cryes, and with a lowder voyce, to Heauen, then
thy Fame can ſound on Earth, Rumors, tenne
<pb facs="tcp:7879:16"/>
thouſand tongues, are hoarſe to that: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
but ſome Nooke, or Angle of the World;
the other reaches from the Field to Heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The voice of thy Brothers Bloud cryeth vnto me
from the Earth, Gen. 4. 10.</hi> And no ſooner the
Crye comes, but the Curſe followes, in the very
next words: <hi>Now therefore thou art curſed from
the Earth, which hath opened her mouth to receiue
thy Brothers Bloud from thy hand.</hi> And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
in the next, <hi>AV agabond and a Runnagate
ſhalt thou be on the Earth.</hi> Which ſhewes the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the guiltie Conſcience, which after the
deed done, would faine flye from it ſelfe: A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
which followes all the Children of
Wrath vnto this day.</p>
               <p>Well may peace then haue the excellencie of
her glorious name aduanced aboue all Titles
and Inſcriptions: And ſo much the rather, in
that it pleaſeth the Almighty Creator himſelfe,
to bee called the God of Peace, and the Author,
<hi>1. Cor. 14. 33.</hi> Nay, Loue it ſelfe, delighting in
the Name. <hi>1. Iohn 4. 16. GOD is loue, and hee
that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in

of the World, the Lambe of Peace. <hi>Iohn 11. 29.
Behold, the Lambe of God, which taketh away the
<pb facs="tcp:7879:17"/>
ſinnes of the World.</hi> There is Peace made in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſinne away, which is the only fuell of
Wrath. And <hi>Epheſ. 2. 14. Chriſt is our Peace, which
hath made of both, one, and hath broken the ſtop of
the partition wall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, the heauenly Souldiers, at the
Birth of Chriſt, prayſing God, ſaid: <hi>Glory be to
God, in the high Heauens, and Peace in earth, and
toward men, good will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as his moſt bleſſed Natiuitie was the
Fountaine of Peace, there wanted not the fruits
that ſprang from that ſacred Fountaine in his
departure, <hi>Iohn 14. 27. Peace I leaue with you, my
peace I giue vnto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
nor feare.</hi> Let not your heart, ſpeaking to many,
becauſe all his ought to bee of one heart, which
is a worke of Peace.</p>
               <p>And not leauing, but in the ſame Euangeliſt,
16. 17. <hi>I will pray my Father, and hee ſhall giue you
another Comforter, that hee may abide with you for
