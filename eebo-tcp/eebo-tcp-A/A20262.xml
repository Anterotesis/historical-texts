            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>IT shall not be necessary for me (most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brethren) to shewe anye causes for mine own excuse why I haue attempted the setting forth of this little <hi>Catechisme,</hi> as though I had rashly aduentured aboue that was méete, to set forth any thing to be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by my priuate aduise: Or as though I had presumed aboue mine abilitye to become so general a teacher, hauing my self so meane vnderstandyng. For in these daies in which there is so great licentiousnes of printyng bookes, as in déede it maketh vs all the worse, who can blame it that hath any taste or sauer of goodnes, be it neuer so simple, if it had no other fruite, yet this is great and plentyfull, that in reading it we shoulde keepe our eyes from much godles and childish vanitie, that hath now blotted so many papers. We sée it all, and we mourne for griefe, so many as in spirite and truth do loue the Lord. What multitude of bookes, full of all synne and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, haue nowe filled the world? No thing so childish, nothing so vaine, nothing so wanton, nothyng so ydle, whych is not both boldly printed, and plausibly taken. So that herein we haue fulfilled the wickednes of our forefathers, &amp; ouertaken them in theyr syns.
<pb facs="tcp:14460:3"/>
They had their spiritual enchauntmentes, in which they were bewytched, <hi>Beuis</hi> of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>Guy</hi> of Warwike, <hi>Arthur</hi> of the round table, <hi>Huon</hi> of Burdeaux, <hi>Oliuer</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, the foure sonnes of <hi>Amond,</hi> and a great many other of such childish follye. And yet more vanitie then these, the witles deuices of <hi>Gargantua, Howleglas, Esop, Robyn Hoode, Adam Bel,</hi> Frier <hi>Rushe,</hi> the Fooles of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and a thousand such other. And yet of all the residue the most dronken imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with which they so defiled their Festiual and high holydaies, their <hi>Legendawry,</hi> theyr Saintes lyues, their tales of <hi>Robyn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow,</hi> and of manye other Spirites, which Satan had made, Hell had printed, and were warranted vnto sale vnder the Popes priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to kindle in mens hartes the sparkes of superstition, that at last it might flame out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire of Purgatorie. These were in the former daies the subtile sleightes of Satan to occupye Christian wyts in Heathen fansies. And we as men that can not learne wisedom by anye examples to kéepe our selues from harme, but as though the wickednes of our forefathers were not yet full, we wyll make vp their measure, and set vp Shrines to the woord of God, and the wrytinges of all hys Saintes, which our forefathers had cast out
<pb facs="tcp:14460:3"/>
of all honor, that their own dreames and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions might be had in price. To thys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I trow we haue multiplied for our selues so many new delightes that we might iustefy the idolatrous superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the elder world. To this purpose we haue printed vs many bawdy songes (I am lothe to vse such a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some woord, saue that it is not fyt inough for so vile endeuours,) to this purpose we haue gotten our Songes &amp; Sonets, our Pallaces of pleasure, our vnchaste Fables and Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and such lyke Sorceries, moe then any man may recken. Yea some haue ben so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as new borne <hi>Moabites,</hi> which wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in their own vomit, and haue not bene a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shamed to entitle their bookes, The Court of <hi>Venus,</hi> The Castle of Loue, and manye such other as shamelesse as these. O that there were among vs some zealous <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that <note place="margin">Act. 19. 29.</note> bookes of so great vanity might be burned vp. The spirite of God wrought in them so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, that they contemned the price of so great iniquitie, in one Citie, and at one fire they brought together the bookes valued to twoo thousand markes, and burnt them al at once. O happy light &amp; cleare as the Sun beames, if we might sée the lyke in <hi>London,</hi> that the chiefe streete might be sanctified with so holy sacrifice. The place it selfe doth craue it, and
<pb facs="tcp:14460:4"/>
holdeth vp a gorgeous Idoll, a fyt stake for so good a fire. O Lord thou art able to woorke what thou wylt, let vs sée this day that <hi>Iacob</hi> may reioyce, and <hi>Israel</hi> may be glad. So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thine enemies, as they haue recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced thée. Of old they <note n="a" place="margin">Iere. 36. 23</note> burnt the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thy Prophets, and in their ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing they departed not from the synnes of their fathers, but gaue the <note n="b" place="margin">An. dom. 290. sub Dioclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, et anno. 1559 sub Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. 4.</note> holy labours of thy Saintes vnto ashes, nowe let vs sée the iust recompence of anger, and make our good Rulers the instruments to execute thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. We haue now long inough played with our own fansies, Lord rayse vp agayne thy word into honour, that our eyes may be occupied in holy readinges.</p>
            <p>And you deare Brethren that are yet in battail to fight against Satan, pray and cease not, that God alone maye be exalted in our daies, that Satan may be troden vnder foote, and that the woord of God, the strong weapen of our strife, may be geuen into the handes of all, that their lyfe may be in safetie. And be perswaded of this, that there is no one thyng more enemy to the woord of God, then these vaine and synfull imaginations of our owne vnbridled wits, which haue now filled so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny volumes. And therefore I trust I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue no blame to aduenture the setting out
<pb facs="tcp:14460:4"/>
of this short enstruction, sithe my desire is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aduance Gods glory, and edefie hys poore Church, that is yet so couered in darke ignorance: when so many haue found leaue to spread abroad their labours, that haue no other pleasure then offyn and wyckednes.</p>
            <p>Now for that that I haue taken vpon mee to set forth vnto many this enstruction, beare with me, I beseche you, and praye vnto God that we may all together hold the humblenes of mynde that was in Christ Iesu, that we be not wise in our own conceits, nor thincke of our selues aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is conuenient, but acknowledging the blindnes of our hart, and the ignorance in which we are borne, we may say with the most happy Apostle, we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we haue not receiued. And of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other I do willyngly professe it, I am the least, but by the grace of God I am that I am, and I trust hys grace is not in vayne in me. But this that I here present vnto the Church of God, I haue not done it alone: but another faithfull labourer in the woorke of the Lord, and a good brother in Christ Iesu, whom God hath endued with great knowledge, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with much vnderstanding, he hath taken the greatest paine, and the greatest fruit must grow of his labours. So that I haue not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured of my selfe, but haue onely bene an
<pb facs="tcp:14460:5"/>
helper of an other mans labour. And the cause y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath mooued vs both is suche, as hath made the Children of God euen to faynt in their mourning, vntil they shall sée the great mercies of God to take awaye the cause of their griefe. We sée the great ignorance in which the people are euery wher couered, the cloudes of darknes, more then the darknes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> haue so ouer shadowed them, that the light of the Gospel of the glorye of Christ, who is the Image of God, it doth hardlye or not at all shine in their vnbeleuing hartes.</p>
            <p>Scarce one of a great many can giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of their faith, yet <hi>S. Peter</hi> requireth it of <note place="margin">3. Pet. 4. 13</note> euery Christian. A very few haue tasted the beginninges of the Gospel of Christ, and yet <hi>S. Paule</hi> biddeth that the word dwel plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note> in eche one of our hartes. The Apostle blameth the ignoraunce of the people, who haue learned yet no further, then repentance from dead workes, and the first enstructions of the faith toward God: But O Lord, howe <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> many thousands of vs, of fayth and of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce can say nothyng? The Prophet speaketh of the kyngdome of Christ, that in those daies the earth should be ful of the know <note place="margin">Esa. 11. 19</note> ledge of the Lord, as the waters that do couer the sea: where is now that blessed spirite of vnderstandyng to be poored vpon vs? And
<pb facs="tcp:14460:5"/>
wher is this riches of the knowledge of God? Are not rather the multitude of our brethren clothed with darknes, so that they grope in their wayes as at midnight, &amp; know nothing of the way of lyfe? We pray dayly according as we are taught, <hi>Let thy kingdome come,</hi> if we speake not like the Parets, in woordes without vnderstanding, then this is our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: let thy spirite beare rule in our hartes, and the knowledge of thy woorde lighten the eyes of our mynde. And what do we then els but dally with the Lord, if we pray styll for knowledge, and yet sleepe stil in ignorance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Then thys is (louing Brethren) a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for our boldnes, if in so great necessitye, according to our talentes, we séeke to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto many.</p>
            <p>If any thinke that there are already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently set forth many <hi>Catechismes,</hi> I do easely graunt it, but they are not sufficiently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither yet can be. For it was necessary in the best and most godlye of these labours, whilest the Christian faith is plainly taught, to edifiyng of the simple, and conuincing of the aduersary, that the faithful teacher should vse moe wordes, then can be caried in mynde of the ignorant man. And therefore I thought itgood as briefly as I could, to comprehende the effect of all, that the begynninges beyng
<pb facs="tcp:14460:6"/>
made playne, and easely printed in memory, we might enter into reasoning and disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our selues, enstructing one another, and helping one an other, that we might haue the more fruit in the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger labours of others, but most of all that we might be encouraged to the most holy and liuely woord of God, to drinke wyth continuall desire of the fruitfull spring, euen vntyll the water of lyfe do flow vp in our hartes vnto euerlastyng gladnes, &amp; the day starre do arise in our hartes, which may lighten our mindes in to the knowledge of the God of glory.</p>
            <p>There is nothyng remayning more why this labour should be misliked, except anye man would thinke, that euery Congregation had a sufficient Pastor to instruct those that were ignorant, so that they should not néede any straunge Teacher: God graunt that in time to come this maye be found true. But yet we are farre from it, euen as light from darknes, or death from life, or as knowledge and vnderstanding is from insensible blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. O that we had eyes to see so great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: For sure it may not wel be iustified, that in so cleare light of the woorde, as God hath made now to shine vpon vs, that there was euer nation which had so ignorant Ministers We maye here in compare with the man of
<pb facs="tcp:14460:6"/>
synne him selfe. I do not knowe that in the midst of all hys abominations there was a more lothsome sight of that idolatrous priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, then we haue set vp among our selues, to be fellow labourers among vs in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For what though they excéeded in loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life? Yet their darke and barbarous religion was so thicke a cloude spread ouer their maners, that the fulnes of their lynnes was not easely seue: But we haue the light that hath made althinges manyfest, and the Sunne hath shined that hath disclosed iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so that there hath not bene among vs any popish Priest so dronken, nor any alehouse Chaplen at such a perpetuall truce with hys drinking pots, that hath possibly purchased so much discredite to his belly God, and kitchin faith, as our dum Dogs and guides, do dayly multiply against the God of Israel, and the faith of his anointed our onely God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. It gréeneth me to remember, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth me much more to rehearse the estate of the ministration into whych we are fallen. We haue good time now to complayne wyth the Prophet, like people, like Priest. Euen <note place="margin">Esa. 44. 2</note> the same coueringes of Israel that shadowed then their glory, they haue spread the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues agayne as the heauens, &amp; are come ouer our head in so great a tempest of blindnes &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb facs="tcp:14460:7"/>
that they haue shaken the foundations of all our comfort.</p>
            <p>We saw in deede <hi>Halcionios dies,</hi> the glad and pleasant daies in which our hope shined, when first our happy gouernment turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our sorrowes, brake the yoke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, deliuered vs from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and caryed vs among the Saints of God into the kingdome of light. But our hope hath since suffered a great Eclipse, from the fulnes of her beutie, (such hath bene the malice of Satan.) He attempted agaynst vs euen at the first his most pestilent practise, and hath brought accordinglye hys purpose to effect. When God had turned the wyl of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, <note place="margin">Deut. 1. 15</note> and enclined his eare to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding: when he had geuen vnto him courage to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Exo. 18. 21</note> the enemies of his truth, and planted true feare in his hart to establish his Gospel: then the subtile Serpent which had turned all his deuices hether, he bent his violence, and thys counsell pleased hym best: To corrupt the Priesthoode, who should instruct the Prince <note place="margin">Nu. 27. 21</note> by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> that if thus he might darken the light of the people, it might be the more easy to leade them out of the way.</p>
            <p>Then he entred againe, and with more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse into hys first assaultes, wherewyth he tempted once our sauiour Christ: He robbed
<pb facs="tcp:14460:7"/>
the Minister of his blessed hope in the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and made him seeke the wayes ful of vile shame, to get his bread. He hanged before his eyes an other veale of pompe and vanitie, that he could not with open counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance see Christ, but folowed the present plea sures that better liked him. And so first wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the head, the infection hath growen since into the other partes of the body, that now al most there is nothyng but woundes &amp; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and sores full of corruption. Looke wher we wyl among the people of the Lord, &amp; how hardly shall we funde the dwellyng place of the godly Pastour.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Ieremie</hi> were now aliue, he would take <note place="margin">Iere. 9. 1.</note> vp againe his old complaintes: <hi>O that myne head werefull of water, and mine eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for the slayne of the daughter of my people.</hi> For looke what agrement hath righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes with vnrighteousnes, and what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship hath light with darknes, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord Christ with <hi>Belial,</hi> or what part the bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with the Infidel: the same societie is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a great number of our English Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Uicars, with the true Preachers &amp; Ministers of the Gospell. Your selues good Christian Readers make the comparison, and be your own Iudges, what cause we haue to
<pb facs="tcp:14460:8"/>
complaine. The true Minister is the salt of the earth, to drye vp corrupt and noysome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13.</note> and to preserue the substance pure, that the world may be offered vp a swete sacrifice vnto God: But our Uicars and Curates, we haue some of them yet of the old morowmas Priestes, whose salt is vnsauerie with much popish leauen, that there is no taste in them of the Gospell of Christ. Most certaine it is, that the popish Priesthoode is no calling for a Minister of the Gospell: And therefore they that haue not openly forsaken that, and haue geuen a new promise vnto Christ, they may well haue the lyuing, but they cannot be the persons whom God hath called, nor yet the salt to season his elect and chosen.</p>
            <p>The true Minister is the light of the world, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14</note> which holdeth foorth the Gospell of Christ in his hand as a lanterne to lighten the steps of a great number, how to walke vnto Christ: but what daylight I beseche you, shineth in the Ministers of our making? They are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter séene in their seueral occupations, then in the knowledge of the word, which they should dispence vnto others. The true Minister is a fisher of men, by whom the parish is stirred vp to all loue, to God first, and then mutually one to another: but the Parsons nowe haue either nets so broken, or their baytes so yll,
<pb facs="tcp:14460:8"/>
that we sée the effect is, no gatheryng toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a wofull dispersion both of Priest &amp; people. How many examples do we sée of a continual dissipation in sutes and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies? the Parson against the Uicar, the Uicar against the Parson, the Parish against both, and one against another, and al for the belly. Among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither people, Parson, Curate, Uicar, one nor other hath anye care for the Gospel of Christ. As the Lord doth lyue, this is no other fishing, but to suffer that roaryng Lyon to catch al by his enchauntmentes, that he may haue large pasture in the Church of God. The true Minister is the eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 22 Mat. 9. 38 Mat. 22. 3 Ma. 23. 34.</note> the woorkeman in the haruest: the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger that calleth vnto the Mariage: the Prophet that telleth the wyl of the Lord: the wyse man that teacheth to discerne betwene good and euyll: the Scribe that doth expound <note place="margin">Ma. 25. 16 Lu. 24. 48 1.

Ro. 15. 16.</note> dispensers of the misteries of God: the Stew ard that geueth meate in due time, vnto the residue of the houshold: the Sacrificer of the Gospel of God, to make the oblation of hys flocke acceptable: the Minister by whom the <note place="margin">1.

               <pb facs="tcp:14460:9"/>
the Shepheard to féede the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his blood. <note place="margin">Ac. 20. 28</note> But alas and wo for vs, if we can sée our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, what one of these excellent vertues shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in our Pastors? I speake the truth, and God in his good time wyll geue vs eyes to sée his iudgementes. Scarce one Parish of an hundred hath found such a Minister, or scarce two and thrée in a Shéere whom God hath so blessed. If <hi>S. Paule</hi> say true, or if the voyce of God be fearfull in our eares, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleue except we heare, and we cannot <note place="margin">Ro. 10. 14</note> heare wythout a Preacher: where is our glory that we are the people of the Lord? Or where is our reioycing that the Gospell is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs? Were it not that the woorkes of the Lord preached dayly vnto vs, and their voyce had come into our eares, as fully as to <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 5.</note> our forefathers, euen in the strongest of our people, it would make their faith to wauer.</p>
            <p>For about vs in our Countrie, wher dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that Minister, or where is his name, that shall strengthen the weake harted, and rayse them vp in hope? He must faith <hi>S. Paule,</hi> he must be apt to teache that is made Minister: but we haue made the old saying true, <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet</hi>

            <p>Euen thus it is, both high and low, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as God hath sealed with a god spirite, they complayne of it. They say all with <hi>Ieremy:</hi>

He hath broken hys two staues of happy fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <note place="margin">Zech. ii. 13</note> both bewty and bandes, and geuen in stéede of them the instrumentes of a foolyshe Shepheard, and hath raysed vs vp Pastours which looke not for the thinges that are lost, nor seeke the tender Lambes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor féede that that standeth vp. <note place="margin">2. Chroni. 15. 3.</note> And therfore we may boldly say, God himself being our warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the Israel of the Lord is without his Pastour.</p>
            <p>But some perhaps wyll thincke this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to be gréeuous, God hath not delt thus with vs, but rather hath multiplied a great manye of learned and godly Ministers vnto vs, euen now in great aboundance, as in any age before vs: Most certainly true it is, that
<pb facs="tcp:14460:10"/>
God hath raysed vp in our dayes men of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler hope, full of excellent giftes, whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in yong yeares hath shined farre aboue the gray heares of their forefathers. Would God we were halfe thankfull inough for so manyfolde blessinges. The ioy of the whole earth, and the gladnes of al the world, that is the blessed hope of the Gospel, it shineth not a litle, euen in their countenances The Lord encrease them a thousand thousand fold, and geue them double his spirit, that they may be greater then all their enemies, &amp; abyde faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euen vnto death: that through them the Prince may reioyce, the Magistrate maye be glad, their fellowes may be encouraged, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> peo ple may be taught, al may haue hope, syn may be abolished, Idolatrye rooted out, Antichrist ouerthrowen, Satan troden downe, Hel may be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, the Gospel may encrease, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes maye shine, and God may haue the glory. This desire is the fruite of our lyse, and ther is not in the world a better portion: this we haue chosen, and in this we wil dwel, vntyl the fulnes of tyme, that we shall say in our course: <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we haue here not a litle feare, and we sée the stumbling blockes, that haue made our wayes daungerous. True it is many men

            <p>Satan hath so rent a sunder the glorye of our Ministerie, that fleshe and bloud is not halfe willing to beare the shame of the world that goeth after it. He hath spoyled it of the due reward: of al authoritie: of al obedience: loue, reuerence &amp; honor that man should gene vnto it. He hath layd vpon it much contempt, many reproches, great pouertie, intollerable bondage, so that though the calling be in deede the most precious inheritance vnder the sun, yet the glory is so darkned vnto mortal eyes,
<pb facs="tcp:14460:11"/>
that al Nobility is quite fled from it, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen afraid to come vnto it, the riche man rather chuseth any other kinde of life, the men nest estate so hardly contented with it, that <hi>S.

But God shall once geue agayne vnto his Ministerie beuty, in stéede of ashes, and ritch apparel in stéede of sackcloth, when he shal turne againe the captiuitie of <hi>Syon,</hi> &amp; build vp the walles of the promised <hi>Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In the meane season we wyll lyue in hope, and geue thankes vnto our God that hath brought vs hetherto. One other assault of Sathan hurteth as much as this: yea and so much the more, because it is couered with the cloke of benefite, &amp; sheweth vs a saluing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine against the former wound. For where as the Ministers liuing in most Churches is but smal, he hath found this remedy, that one man should haue many benefices: &amp; whereas the reproche is not litle, but euen the name is ful of disdain, as to be called maister Parson, Maister Uicar, Syr Iohn, a parish Priest. &amp;c. Agaynst this euyll he hath founde a remedye worse, and geuen liberty to al that wyll, to be <hi>Non residentes,</hi> to forsake their charge, to go where they wyl like masterles hounds, to fyl

the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth with worse then any ydle or vagabond persons. Loe this is the vessel of poyson that Satan hath set a broch, &amp; the cup of whoordome which the Pope hath begun of vnto al the world. This is the head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all spirituall darknes: the roote from which the glory of Antichrist dyd first aryse: the filthy spring of al abominations, which by pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t encrease hath ouerslowed kingdomes with most shameful slauery: brought Princes into contempt: &amp; set a vile person in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the world. And yet at thys day it doth so dull the spirites of many excellent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that their hartes are full of surfeting, and yet they foole not their disease, they wallow (as I said) in their own vomit, and yet they see not their shame.

               <hi>Aunswer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> The meaning of this is, that we shoulde not thinke God to be lyke either <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 4. 15. Act. 17. 29.</note> man or woman, or gold or syluer, or anye manner creature, that we should not woorshyp hym vnder the similitude of <note n="b" place="margin">Leui. 26. 1.</note> Sunne, Moone, or any other thyng what

            <p> The meaning of it is, that we shoulde not sweare <note n="a" place="margin">Leui. 19. 12</note> falselye, nor <note n="b" place="margin">Eccles. 5, 1.</note> rashly, nor in light matters, but with <note n="c" place="margin">Deu 28. 58</note> feare and reuerence make mencion of the name of the Lorde our God in <note n="d" place="margin">Iere. 4. 2.</note> truth, in iudgement, and in righteousnes, to the glorye of God, or maintenance of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye loue, in which causes we must sweare by the name of God <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 6. 13.</note> alone,

            </p>
            <p> To keepe holye the sabboth day, is to come together, and with feare and reuerence to heare <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 20. 7.</note> the word of God preached vnto vs: to receaue his Sacramentes with fayth and with repentaunce: <note n="b" place="margin">1.

            <p> Here in plaine wordes God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth all inward desire, what so euer is vnlawful to be done, which desire is not onely synful when we consent vnto it, but <note n="a" place="margin">Ro. 7. 7.</note> the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is enemy vnto God, and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from his presence.

Thys ought to be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in our eyes, that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hels and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s should not so much mooue vs. This is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of vertue, that God in it is gloryfied, &amp; thys is the great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and confusion of synne, that God in it is dishonoured.</p>

            <p> It is requisite in true praier fyrst that we pray <note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 50. 13.</note> onely to God: <note n="b" place="margin">Iaco. 4. 3.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that we be inwardlye tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the nede of the thing we aske: <note n="c" place="margin">2.

            <p> I desire of my heauenly Father, that his holy name may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among vs, both in his excellent works, &amp; in our liues: That he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be had in honour, &amp; all other set asyde.

            <p> By the ten commaundements I see my synne, and howe I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the wrath of God, &amp; euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting damnation. From which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:14460:28"/>
I coulde not be delyuered by mine own strength, the holy Ghost bi the preaching of the Gospel hath wrought in me fayth, in Christ my Redeemer, by which I am assured that he hath borne the punishment of my syns, &amp; made me heyre wyth him of euerlasting life. And of this that I should neuer doubt, he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me two Sacraments, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes and tokens to be seene and felt of me, that as surely as I see my selfe made partaker of them outwardlye, so the holye Ghost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlye enstructing me, I shoulde not doubt, but inwardly to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of Christ him selfe with al his benefites, that in hym and through hym I shall haue lyfe euerlastyng. And thus beyng regenerate into this liuely hope by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Gost, my waies should be directed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same spirit, to walke in holynes &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes al the daies of my lyfe.</p>
