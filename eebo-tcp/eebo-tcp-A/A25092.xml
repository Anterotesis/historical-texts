            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Diſcovery and Siezing OF <hi>Mr. Harriſon, and Mr. R—,</hi> On the Account of the Murther of the late Doctor <hi>CLENCH.</hi> WITH A Relation of the Examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of One of them, and of his Commitment to <hi>New-gate</hi> laſt night, the 6th. Inſtant.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Clench,</hi> having been moſt Barbarouſly and Inhumanely Murthered, by <hi>Two Ruffins,</hi> in a Coach, going towards <hi>Aldgate,</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> Inſtant, about <hi>Eleven</hi> at Night: Now, it being generally ſuppoſed, by all the Doctors Friends, that the Villains were inſtigated to Commit this Notorious Fact, more out of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge, than any Real Deſign as to Profit, on the Account of <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi> of Moneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which, mature Conſideration was taken, What Perſons had any <hi>Quarrel</hi> with the <hi>Doctor</hi> (himſelf being, in his Life-time, known to be a very Peaceable, Innocent, and Inoffenſive Perſon:) Upon which the following Concern came freſh to Memory; <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctor having, a conſiderable time ſince, Lent a certain Gentlewoman a Sum of Money, on a Mortgage, and afterwards calling in his Monys, for divers Reaſons, the Thing being but for the Gentlewomans Life, that the Mortgage was upon, and for Non-Payment, neither of the principle Money, nor Intereſt, the Doctor proceeded at Law, and in time procured the Rent being paid to him; upon which one Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> who was a Friend, and as ſome ſay, kept very Familiar Company with Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, going to demand the Rent, and they refuſing Payment, ſaying, it was now Docter <hi>Clenches</hi> right to Receive it; upon which he was heard to ſay, G—damn-him, he would ſpeedily be Reveng'd on the Doctor, and cure him of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, or Words to that effect; and, as 'tis ſaid, in other companys lately he has been heard to ſay, he would be the death of the Doctor.</p>
            <p>A Warrant being granted for the Apprehending of this Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>R—,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to be the ſaid <hi>Harriſons</hi> Accomplice in the Murther, they were both taken yeſterday, by Conſtables, Tipſtaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the former after a long and diligent ſearch (he often changing his Lodgings, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Lodgings, on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt,) was taken near <hi>White-Fryers;</hi> the latter at his own houſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> being brought before the Lord Chief Juſtice, and the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who drove the Coach when the Doctor was Murdered, being ſent for and preſent, Depos'd, That he verily believ'd, <hi>Harriſon</hi> to be one of the <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins,</hi> but that he had then Black Cloaths on; but now was in Coloured.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harriſon</hi> being Examined to give an Account, where he was from <hi>Nine</hi> to <hi>Twelve</hi> a Clock on <hi>Monday</hi> night; ſaid, He was at a Widow-womans Coffee Houſe near <hi>Fleet-Street;</hi> but ſhe being ſent for, Declared, <hi>That he was at her Houſe not above half an hour;</hi> which, as ſhe ſaid, was from half an hour paſt <hi>Eight</hi> till <hi>Nine,</hi> or thereabouts; tho' he before alleadg'd, that he was there Three or Four Hours; he likewiſe Alledged, that he had not ſeen Doctor <hi>Clench</hi> for many Weeks before, though it was proved that he had been with him but a few days before.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, <hi>Harriſon</hi> giving but a very ſlender account of himſelf, and there being very Corroborating Circumſtances fixed upon him, the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice committed him to <hi>Newgate</hi> that Night.</p>
