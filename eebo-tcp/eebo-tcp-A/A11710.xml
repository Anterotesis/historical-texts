         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as out of the royall and fatherly care which we have had of the good and peace of this
our ancient and native kingdome, having taken to our ſerious conſideration all ſuch things as might
have given contentment to our good and loyall ſubjects: and to this end had diſcharged by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
the ſervice book, book of canons, and high commiſſion, freed and liberate all men from
the practiſing of the five articles, made all our ſubjects both eccleſiaſticall and civill lyable to the
cenſure of Parliament, generall Aſſembly, or any other judicatorie competent, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and qualitie of the offence: and for the free entrie of miniſters, that no other oath be adminiſtrate unto them then that
which is contained in the act of parliament: had declared all by-gone diſorders abſolutely forgotten and forgiven: and for the
more full and cleare extirpating all ground and occaſion of fears of innovation of religion, we had commanded the confeſſion
of faith, and band for maintenance thereof, and of authoritie in defence of the ſame, ſubſcribed by our deare Father, and his
houſhold, <hi>in anno</hi> 1580. to be renued and ſubſcribed again by our ſubjects here: Like as for ſettling of a perfect peace in the
church and common-wealth of this kingdome, we cauſed indict a free generall aſſembly to be holden at Glaſgow the xxi. of
this inſtant, and thereafter a parliament in May, 1639. By which clement dealing, we looked aſſuredly to have reduced our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to their former quiet behaviour and dutifull carriage, whereto they are bound by the word of God, and laws both natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and municipall, to us their native and ſoveraigne prince. And albeit the wiſhed effects did not follow, but by the contrary,
by our ſo gracious procedure they were rather emboldened, not only to continue in their ſtubborne and unlawfull wayes, but
alſo daily adde to their former procedures acts of neglect, and contempt of authoritie, as evidently appeared by open oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of our juſt and religious pleaſure and command, expreſt in our laſt proclamation anent the diſcharge of the ſervice book,
book of canons, high commiſſion, &amp;c. proteſting againſt the ſame, and ſtriving by many indirect meanes to withdraw the
hearts of our good people, not only from a hearty acknowledgement of our gracious dealing with them, but alſo from the
due obedience to thoſe our juſt and religious commands, notwithſtanding we had been formerly ſo oft petitioned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for the ſame. By their daily and hourely guarding and watching about our Caſtle of Edinburgh, ſuffering nothing to be
imported therein, but at their diſcretion, And openly ſtopping and impeding any importation of ammunition, or other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
whatſoever to any other of our houſes within that kingdome: Denying to us their ſoveraigne Lord that libertie and
freedome, which the meaneſt of them aſſume to themſelves (an act without precedent or example in the Chriſtian world) By
making of convocations and councell tables of Nobilitie, Gentrie, Burrows and Miniſters within the city of Edinburgh, where
not regarding the lawes of the kingdome, they without warrant of authoritie conveene, aſſemble, and treat upon matters,
as well eccleſiaſticall as civill, ſend their injunctions and directions throughout the countrey to their ſubordinate tables, and
other under miniſters appointed by them for that effect. And under colour and pretext of religion exercing an unwarranted and
unbounded libertie, require obedience to their illegall and unlawfull procedures and directions, to the great and ſeen prejudice
of authoritie, and lawfull monarchicall government. And notwithſtanding it was evidently manifeſt by the illegall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formall
courſe taken in the election of their commiſſioners for the aſſembly, whereof ſome are under the cenſure of this church,
ſome under the cenſure of the church of Ireland, and ſome long ſince baniſhed for open and avowed teaching againſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
others of them ſuſpended, and ſome admitted to the miniſterie contrary to the forme preſcribed by the lawes of this
kingdome, others of them a long time ſince denounced rebels, and put to the horne, who by all law and unviolable cuſtome and
practique of this kingdome, are, and ever have been incapable, either to purſue, or defend before any judicatorie, far leſſe to
be judges themſelves; ſome of them confined, and all of them by oath and ſubſcription bound to the overthrow of epiſcopacie.
And by this and other their under-hand working, and private informations and perſwaſions, have given juſt ground of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of their partialitie herein, and ſo made themſelves unfit judges of what concerneth epiſcopacie. And als it was ſufficiently
cleared by the peremptorie and illegall procedures of the presbyteries, who at their own hand by order of law, and without
due forme of proceſſe, thruſt out the moderators lawfully eſtabliſhed, and placed others, whom they found moſt inclinable
to their turbulent humors, aſſociate to themſelves for the chooſing of the ſaid commiſſioners for the aſſembly, a laick elder out
of each paroch, who being in moſt places equall, if not moe in number then the miniſterie, made choice both of the miniſters,
who ſhould be commiſſioners from the presbyteries, as alſo of a ruling elder, being directed more therein by the warrants from
the foreſaid pretended tables, then by their own judgements, as appears by the ſeverall private inſtructions ſent from them, far
contrary to the lawes of the countrey, and lowable cuſtome of the church: by which doings it is too manifeſt, that no calme
nor peaceable procedure or courſe could have been expected from this aſſembly, for ſettling of the preſent diſorders and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions.
Yet we were pleaſed herein in ſome ſort to blinde-fold our own judgement, and over-look the ſaids diſorders,
and patiently to attend the meeting of the ſaid aſſembly, ſtill hoping that when they were met together, by our Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
his preſence, and aſſiſtance of ſuch other well diſpoſed ſubjects who were to be there, and by their own ſeeing the reall
performance of all that was promiſed by our laſt proclamation, they ſhould have been induced to return to their due obedience
of ſubjects: But perceiving that their ſeditious diſpoſition ſtill increaſes, by their repairing to the ſaid aſſembly with great
bands and troupes of men, all boddin in fear of warre, with guns and piſtolets, contrary to the lawes of this kingdome, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
obſerved in all aſſemblies, and in high contempt of our laſt proclamation at Edinburgh the xvi. of this inſtant: as alſo by
their peremptory refuſing of our aſſeſſors, authorized by us (although fewer in number then our deareſt father was in uſe to have
at divers aſſemblies) the power of voting in this aſſembly, as formerly they have done in other aſſemblies; and by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
unjuſt and unchriſtian refuſing, and not ſuffering to be read the reaſons and arguments given in by the Biſhops, and their
adherents to our Commiſſioner, why the aſſembly ought not to proceed to the election of a moderator without them, neither
yet to the admitting of any of the commiſſioners of the ſaids commiſſioners from presbyteries, before they were heard object
againſt the ſame, though earneſtly required by our Commiſſioner in our name. And notwithſtanding that our Commiſſioner
under his hand, by warrant from us, gave in a ſufficient declaration of all that was contained in our late proclamation and
declaration, the ſame bearing likewiſe our pleaſure of the regiſtration of the ſame in the books of aſſembly for the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the true religion to all our good ſubjects; And yet not reſting ſatisfied therewith, leſt the continuance of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together might produce other the like dangerous acts, derogatorie to royall authoritie, we have thought good, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening
thereof, and for the whole cauſes and reaſons above-mentioned, and divers others importing the true monarchicall
government of this eſtate, to diſſolve and break up the ſaid aſſembly. And therefore</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR WILL is, and we do diſcharge and inhibit all and whatſoever pretended commiſſioners, and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the ſaid pretended aſſembly, of all further meeting and conveening, treating and concluding any thing
belonging to the ſaid aſſembly, under the pain of treaſon, declaring all and whatſoever that they ſhall happen
to do in any pretended meeting thereafter, to be null, of no ſtrength, force nor effect, with all that may follow
thereupon: Prohibiting and diſcharging all our lieges to give obedience thereto, and declaring them, and every
one of them, free and exempt from the ſame, and of all hazzard that may enſue for not obeying thereof. And for this effect we
command and charge all the foreſaids pretended commiſſioners, and other members of the ſaid aſſembly, to depart forth of
this city of Glaſgow within the ſpace of xxiiii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> houres after the publication hereof, and to repair home to their own houſes,
or that they go about their own private affaires in a quiet manner. With ſpeciall proviſion alwaies, that the foreſaid declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
given in under our Commiſſioners hand, with all therein contained, ſhall notwithſtanding hereof ſtand full, firme and
ſure to all our good ſubjects in all time coming, for the full aſſurance to them of the true religion. And our will is, and we
command and charge, that incontinent theſe our letters ſeen, ye paſſe, and make publication hereof by open proclamation at
the market croſſe of Glaſgow, and other places needfull, wherethrough none pretend ignorance of the ſame.</p>
