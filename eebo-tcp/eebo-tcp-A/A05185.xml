            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the second, it is not presumption, that hath

not for that she wrote it:
but because the historye is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
made of her: for it maketh
mention that shee was a MOABITE,
and by what occasion she was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the religion of ISRAELL and
what she did; likewise how she was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to BOAZ a man of great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; was mother to OBED, DAVIDS
Grandfather. So the little booke ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER
hath the name fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Queen ESTER
the principall person which is spoken of
in that booke. Also the bookes of SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVEL
(that I may at this time speake
nothinge of others) are named of the
cheefe person. For though wee do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
graunt, that SAMVEL the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb facs="tcp:8809:5"/>
wrote the first booke vnto the 24.
chapter: yet it is certaine that he could
not proceede any further. For in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 25. chapter is his death
set downe, and the other six chapters to
the end of the book, do containe things
done after his death. The second book
which is also named after SAMVEL,
doth entreate onely of those thinges
which were done after his death, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be put in writing by him:
Yet it seemeth that it was therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the name of SAMVEL, because
it prosecuteth the historie of DAVID,
whome SAMVEL annoynted king by
the commaundement of God: and for
that it was written by some of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as NATHAN or GAD, &amp; put forth
vnder the name of their maister. Some
thinke that this little booke of RVTH
was written by SAMVEL, other some,
that it was gathered out of that great
book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
ISRAELL and IVDA: whereof there
is mention made oft times in the books
of the kinges: The which is lost without

For that it is, not that book of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
which is yet extát, I haue shewed
in my commentaries vpon that booke.</p>
               <p>But who gathered this history out
of that booke spoken of before, or
who wrotte the same, ESRA, or rather
some other Prophet, which florished in
the time of the Iudges or afterwards, I
cannot certainly tell, neither is it anye
great matter to know: how soeuer it was
this ought to satisfie vs, that this booke
by the agreement of al men, is nombred
amongest the canonicall bookes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

holy ghost are written of holy men, and
deliuered of God to his church, and so

dangers, to our comfort and learning. If
thou hast a notable priuilege, confirmed

thou hast not regard of the name of the

was not without the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God

courteously, and charge hys seruauntes
and reapers, that they hurt not her, she
thanking him, being laden by him went

She doth giue her counsell that shee

her mother in law, returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her countrey. All men marueiled at
NAOMIES comming. Lastly, is the tyme
noted when she returned home.</p>
                  <p>The first part, or first member of this
Chapter, doth shew how ELIMELECH
went with his wife and hys two sonnes,
out of BETHLEHEM into the land of
MOAB in the time of famine, and it
containeth many things in few words.
First, it sheweth when this history hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
namely in the time of the Iudges
of ISRAEL. But vnder what Iudge,
(of which many are named) this befell,
it is doubtfull. Some doe report, this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,
to be done in the time of EHVD:
some are of that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it was done
in the time of DEBORA and BARACK, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some say, it was done in the time of
IEPHTE, who after great mischiefes
which the MOABITES had done to
<pb facs="tcp:8809:10"/>
the Israelites, (from whence this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
arose which is made mention of
heere) at length hee tamed them. If you
say ELIMELECH should not haue place
amongest the MOABITES, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
by warre, but rather that hee
should haue bene torne in peeces of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at that time, they will aunswere that they
were so oppressed, and beaten downe
that they durst not hurt the Israelytes.
IEPHTE gouerned the people sixe yeers
his history is extant in the tenth eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th
and twelfth chapters of the IVDGES. IB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAN
succeeded him, whome the Hebrue
doctors wil haue to be BOHAZ DAVIDS
graundfather &amp; to haue had two names.
This man gouerned ISRAELL seuen
yeeres as it is in the twelfth chapter of
the IVDGES. IOSEPHVS includeth this
history in the time of HELI: but LIRA
sheweth vppon the first chapter of this
booke, that that agreeth not with the
accompt of times. But it nothing auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
to our saluation to knowe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer
time wherein these were done, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the holy Ghost woulde not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8809:10"/>
haue let it passe. It is inough for vs ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to knowe that this was done in
the time of the IVDGES.</p>
                  <p>The cause whiche doth moue this
man to leaue his countrey doth seeme
to be a famine,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> for the texte sayth that
<hi>there was a famine in the land of Israell.</hi> For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
holy fathers, will goe from one
place into another in the time of famine
that they may nourishe themselues and
their family more fitly. As in the 12.
chap. of GENESIS: ABRAHAM went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
AEGIPT in the time of famine, which
is called the barne of the worlde. So in
the 26. chapter ISAAKE when there was
a famine went vnto GERAR to ABIME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECH.
But God appearing to him in a
dreame warned him that he should not
goe to AEGYPT, but should keep himself
in those places which the Lord shoulde
shew him. Also the history is knowne of
IACOB or ISRAELL, how hee sent hys
sonnes for foode, into AEGIPT often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
Afterward the famine continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long he went himselfe and his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
to his sonne IOSEPH. Here also
<pb facs="tcp:8809:11"/>
may be added, the story of the SHVNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITE,
whose sonne ELISHA raysed from
the dead, hee bad her goe into another
countrie, for God would bring vppon
the land a famine, which should endure
seuen yeeres, as it is in the second book
of the kinges and the 8. chapter: whiche
woman following the counsell of the
Prophet was preserued in the time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
And for the same cause ELIME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECH
went together with his into the
land of MOAB, which peraduenture then
abounded with fruit: but the Hebrues
(as LIRA sayth) do imagine some other
cause. For they say that ELIMELECH
was a mightie and wealthie man, of
whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the famine raigned many of
his kinsmen and poore men did require
thinges needefull for them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he might be rid of his trouble,
and not spend his goods, left his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and went into the land of MOAB
with hys housholde, where hee being
driuen vnto great pouerty, died with his
sonnes. If he trauailed for this cause, as
it sometimes appeareth some doe, hee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8809:11"/>
coulde not be excused, for it is in the
Prouerbes of SALOMON. 21. chapter. He
that stoppeth his eares at the crying of
the poore, shal also cry and not be heard
for there is a iust reuenger of the poore
and afflicted. It is knowne to all men
what happened to that riche man clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in Purple, mentioned in LVKE. 16.
But who can but maruell from whence
the HEBRVES haue these fantasies, they
doe bring in many monstrous fables in
the expounding of the holy Scriptures.
For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had cast away Iesus Christ
the light of the world, they wer worthy
to walke in darknesse. And the doctrine
of the Gospell being oppressed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed
Christians harkened to
monstrous lies.</p>
                  <p>As concerning famine,<note place="margin">A famine.</note> against the
Prophetes, it is numbred amongst the
foure plagues, with the which GOD
doth punishe men, and these are they:
the pestilence, famine, warre, and cruell
beastes. Howe grieuous the trouble of
famine is, may be gathered by this, that
it doth driue men oftentimes into ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
<pb facs="tcp:8809:12"/>
Truly God doth send famine
for the sinnes of his people, where and
when he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be gathered that those that
be oppressed with famine are worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
others. For oftentimes godly men are
oppressed with famine, not because hee
would ouerthrow them, but that hee
might prooue them with this crosse,
and also stirre th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ones doe when they be in that case. The
HEBRVES saye that God punished the
ISRAELITES, with sharpe and cruell fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
because that after IOSHVA and the
ELDERS were dead, who had seene the
miracles of God, they were slack in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
hys commaundementes. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the story of the IVDGES how
the Israelites forsaking the lawes turned
to Idols, and so they were afflicted
with diuers afflictions.</p>
                  <p>The sonnes of ELIMELECH are called
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8809:12"/>
Ephrathites, of BETHLEHEM IVDA:
which is called so, that it may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from another City of the same
name that is in GALILIE of the lott of
ZEBVLON. As it is in the 2. chapter of
MATTHEVV: The Priestes and Scribes
of the people, being demaunded of
HERODE where the Messias should bee
borne, aunswered in Bethlehem Iuda.
This Citie is also called Ephrata as it is
in the 35. chap, of Genesis, RAHEL died
of childbirth in the way to Ephrata that
is Bethlehem: and IACOB raised a
piller vppon her graue. For the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were woont to haue theyr graues
neere the high wayes, and that is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by many Epitaphes set vpp for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelers.
As concerning the etimologie
of these names, Bethlehem doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the house of bread, that is after
the Hebrues aboundaunce of fruit: it
was situated in a good and a fruitfull
place.</p>
                  <p>Some wil haue Bethlehem to bee
called the house of bread, for that miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that Christ (who said in the 6. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:8809:13"/>
of IOHN, that hee was the bread of
life) shoulde bee borne there. But HIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROME
calleth EPHRATA KARPOPHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAN
which signifieth plentifulnes. So
this Citie for the agreement of the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the names is called both
Ephrata and Bethlehem. Some will
haue this Citie to be called EPHRATA
of EPHRATA CALEBS wife, but that
doth not please me, for that Citie was
called so long before. This Citie hath a
third name, for it is called the Citie of
DAVID, as it is in the second chapter
of LVKE. Ioseph went into the Citie
of DAVID which was called Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEM,
and afterward the Aungell sayd
vnto the Shepheards, this day a Sauiour
is borne vnto you in the Citie of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID
which is Christ the Lorde. It was
so called because it was DAVIDS coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
partly because he did reedifie it:
partly because Christ the sonne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
was borne there, who is also by the
Prophetes simply called DAVID.</p>
                  <p>ZVPH in the 1. of SAM. 1. chap. is
called an EPHRATHITE, because he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8809:13"/>
dwelled in mount EPHRAIM: these men
were called EPHRATHITES because
they dwelled in the country of Ephrata,
an EPHRATHITE and a Bethlemite
are both one. SO ISAI DAVIDS father
is called an Ephrathite: because he came
out of Bethlehem which was woont to
be called Ephrata: for it is written in
the 1. booke of SAMVELL the 17. chap.
Dauid was the sonne of an Ephrathite
of Bethlehem named Ishai, or peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
those which haue bene of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
are called Ephrathites: eyther
for some excellencie in them or by the
figure antonomasia: the Chalde inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
doth adde noble men.</p>
                  <p>It is accompted amongest the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
goodes to be borne in a notable
countrie, and of noble parentes: who
haue descended of good and noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
let them take heede that they do
not any thing vnworthie of theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes:
But they that come of base pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes:
let them vse diligence that they
excell their parentes in vertue. It was set
downe where they are borne, that it
<pb facs="tcp:8809:14"/>
shoulde not be thought, that they were
borne in the land of MOAB.</p>
                  <p>What did ELIMELECH when he
went with his out of the land of IVDA,
into the land of MOAB and dwelt there,
did hee well to depart from the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his auncestours into the land of
Moab? Of this deed it may be disputed
of in both partes. They which doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him maye vse these or some other
argumentes. First the Israelites were
forbidden the companie of that nation.
For in the 23. chapter of DEVTERONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIE:
God made a law that the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
nor the Moabites should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church vntill the tenth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
not that he would forbid them from
the hearing of the word of God, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brasing
of the true maner of worship,
but that they should not be put in anie
office in the church or common wealth,
and least they should haue anie voyce
in the elections or marry with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue
daughters: the Interpreters say
that the Hebrue phrases do signifie this.
There may be two reasons of that lawe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8809:14"/>
the first is, because they denied their
brethren the Children of Israell passage
comming out of Aegypt: The other is
that the hired Balaam the false Prophet
to cursse the Israelites. NVM. 22. and 23.
chapter: and because they made them
sinne in BAALPEOR for the which cause
many of them fell, &amp;c. Therefore because
Elimelech, went with his to that nation
which is an enemie to God it seemeth
a mater not to be praised: next to forsake
Israelll in afflictions againe they were
not his kinsemen.</p>
                  <p>For as they who doe forsake theirs in
the time of warre and pestilence, doe
seeme to offend: so they which forsake
theirs in the time of famine. Especiallie
when it may be gathered by the wordes
of NAOMI that he was riche. Men flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of theyr countrey are alwayes
badly spoken of. Who will not disalow
of their purpose nowe at this time, who
will get themselues in dangers amongst
the enemies of the Gospell. Also those
thinges seemed to fight with sayth: for
he thought that hee coulde auoyd the
<pb facs="tcp:8809:15"/>
punishment of God. The Israelite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
had the promises, that God would help
them in afflictions, and that they ought
to beleeue in him, and hang vppon hys
prouidence, and pray, and looke for a
good and happie end of the famine. For
God might aswell haue preserued him
in so fruitfull a ground as in the land of
Moab. For that which he doth is against
the fortitude and courage of the minde:
For hee shoulde rather haue borne anie
thing, then forsake the tabernacle and
worship of God, and goe to a prophane
people.</p>
                  <p>Further he casteth hys wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
into daunger of idolatrie. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bodie knoweth howe daungerous a
thing it is to dwell amongst Idolaters.
Amongst men of our own professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
are not without danger: what then if we
dwel amongst wicked men? Some of the
euent doth argue of his going that hee
did not wel, because hee was punished
for forsaking his countrey: for he fel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
extreame pouertie the which he fled,
and died with his sons in a strange land.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8809:15"/>
After this sort it fel out with IACOB and
IOSEPH and diuers of good men, so
that they may not iudge of the maners
and faith of a man, by things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
to him heere.</p>
                  <p>They who defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this deed, may bring
in these arguments: first that that hee
did, he did not by wordly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God: but by
the examples of godly men recited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue:
whome famine hath not once
constrained, but manie times to liue as
straungers. Next wee must not tempt
God: his promises maketh not vs sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that hee ought to prouide for
himselfe and his, and hee left his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
without the hurt of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trimen:
that hee might get foode for his owne
houshold. Further these thinges that he
did prospered well, by this the glory of
God was set forth, and the oracles ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
Although this argument may be
aunswered, that God often-times v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the falles of his to good, &amp; in hys
goodnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerteth those things which
are euill to a good end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8809:16"/>
It is true, holy men doe fall, somtime
into great sinnes: But because we know
not whether he went to the MOABITES
in contempt of the lawes, or of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes,
as the Hebrues will haue, or by
the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, or by some
speciall reuelation, or led by some other
necessary cause, nor how hee gouerned
himselfe in a straunge land: wee wil ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prayse his deedes nor condemne
him. When the scriptures doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
men let not vs accuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, especially
when the matters are doutful: we ought
rather to thinke the best of men. It may
be that they had the libertie of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Truely it appeareth that the
IEVVES kept their religion vnder the
ETHNICKE kinges, as they doe this
daye vnder the Christians. There was
not so great crueltie of those kinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the IEVVES, as there is now at
this daye of some Kinges and Princes
(which will haue themselues to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Christians) against the professors of
pure doctrine. In this place also may be
noted that it is written that ELIME<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>LECH
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8809:16"/>
was a straunger in the field of
Moab. Sometime it is said that NAOMI
returned out of the <hi>Field</hi> of Moab, the
Hebrue worde signifieth a field, also a
country, and the earth. Peraduenture he
would not dwell in the Cities but in
the fields that he might the lesse be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
In the Cities many occasions
are layd before vs to entrap vs: For this
cause it was that many dwelt in vilages
and desert places. IONADAB counselled
his sonnes the RECHABITES as it is in
the 35. chap. of Iere. that they shoulde
dwell in Tabernacles, and keepe sheep:
by which meanes they might serue God
best.</p>
                  <p>Generally we say out of the word of
God, that wee must not forsake those
places where the pure worde of God is
preached openly. For it is most daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to dwell there, where the worde of
God hath no free passage. For if thou be
in those places where thou hast the pure
exercise of the word of God and then
thou art sometimes in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who doe not loue the trueth, although
<pb facs="tcp:8809:17"/>
thou doest heare some sermons yet by
little and little thy faith will be weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
what will be done then, where no
mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made of Christ or of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and where we haue so many things
before our eyes which may weaken our
fayth.</p>
                  <p>But if necessitie doth constraine vs to
dwell in those places, as it sometimes
doth where wickednesse doth raign, we
must take heede that wee doe not denie
Christ. IOSEPH liued holily in the <hi>courte
of Potiphar</hi> in Aegipt, at last being gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of al Aegipt the called vnto him his
father and hys brethren for the greatnes
of famine to come to him. DAVID with
sixe hundred men went into the land of
Moab, great necessity driuing him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
though many interpreters finde fault
with this his flight. 1. SAM. 27. NEBV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHAD-NEZZAR
tooke Daniell, his
fellowes, and many others captiues: as
the Turke now hath in captiuitie flockes
of Christians in euerlasting bondage, &amp;
to dwell amongest idolaters whether
they will or no. But they should ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8809:17"/>
to liue amongest wicked men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably.
Ierem. 29. chap. hee doth
teach his people howe they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
themselues in Babilon, vnder Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchad-nezzar.
There are some who
will say commonly: If thou beest at
Roome, liue after the maner of Roome.
They commaund to apply themselues
to the times. But Christ in the 10. chap.
of MATHEVV, doth require of his belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
a confession of faith. They are
greatly to be reprooued who of theyr
own, will for gaine and such other light
causes forsake Ierusalem and goe into
Babilon.</p>
                  <p>We may learn by the example of the
Moabites to yeeld harbor to good men:
for though they were molested by the
Israelites: yet we read not they did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
ELIMELECH or anie of his. If thou
sayst that they were so oppressed of the
Israelites, that they did that against their
will: yet it is euident that they did yeeld
harbor to DAVIDS parentes when they
were olde, as it is in the 1. SAMVEL. 22.
chap. So the Aegiptians yeelded harbor
<pb facs="tcp:8809:18"/>
to Christ &amp; his mother. God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
commend vnto vs the state of
straungers. Men are banished for manie
causes, wee cannot alwaies stay in our
own countrey, though we would most
willingly there liue, let vs not shew our
selues in this part worse than Gentiles.
Aduise with thy self that the auncestors
were not alwaies in their owne country
but were straungers and pilgrimes: and
consider the wonderfull conuersions
which are of things, and the dayly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Empires, so that greeuous warrs
may easily arise, by whiche many men
are shutt out of their seates, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and being mindful of the changes
of worldly thinges, let vs deale wel one
with an other. ELIMELECH is constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to depart with his. But if thou sayst
that he was wicked, and that hee went
with his will and no necessite driuing
him: yet it is euident that there haue
bene many godly and good men in all
ages, which haue forsaken their countrie
and left their houses against their willes.
God doth in ISAI. 16. chap. threaten the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8809:18"/>
Moabites that hee will pull them out of
their nestes, and yeeldeth this reason,
because they do not harbour the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
that flee in the time of warre, or if
they do receiue them they betray them
to their enimies.</p>
                  <p>Also women haue a notable example
of NAOMI, who followed her husband
into a straunge countrie. SARA also did
not forsake ABRAHAM for his trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
estate, though she did suffer great
daunger not onely once for his sake and
fault. And also other godly matrons
haue with their husbandes, borne ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
and other troubles patiently.
But if men are despisers of true Religion
and go into a place, in which godly men
cannot be conuersant with a safe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
they ought not to cast themselues
into open daunger. What doest thou
thinke of those women which will shew
themselues hard to goe with theyr hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
from one street to another? what
doe ye thinke say I, of those women, if
theyr husbandes should take great iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
with great daungers and labours?
<pb facs="tcp:8809:19"/>

fornication after their Gods: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
entise thy sonnes to commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
after their Gods. Idolatrie (that I
may note it by the way) is euery where
in the scripture figured out by whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

as a wife, not onely his whole Church,

therefore they ought onely to depend

vpon him: but if they doe allowe other

of the Lord waxe hote against you and
destroy you sodenly. IOSHVA doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
the same in the 23. chap. in those
great assemblies, which he called a little
before his death: so likewise in the 3.
chap. of the IVDGES, and 1. booke of the
<pb facs="tcp:8809:21"/>
KINGES the 11. chap. And that those
lawes, are not to be vnderstood onely of
those seuen nations spoken of before:
but of other also, it is vnderstoode of
the generall reason, whiche is ioyned
to the lawe: for hee saith it will come to
passe, that they will be called back from
the embracing of the true GOD: the
which daunger they doe runne into,
which doe marrie Idolaters. EZRA in the

the 13. chap. are angrie with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did breake the law of GOD,
who did marrie the women of Moab
and Ammon. The like is read in the 2.
chap. of ZEPHANIAH. Neither is there
want of examples, which doe shew, how
vnprosperous those vnequall marriages
are. SALOMON married many straunge
women against the kingly law wrote in
DEVTER. 17. amongest whom, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
maketh mention of the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
and the Moabites. 1. booke of the

that they shuld build them temples
to their Gods, neither is it to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8809:21"/>
but that he had many probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for the defence of his deedes: but
hee threwe both himselfe and his into
great daungers. Hee had REHOBOAM of
his wife which was a Moabitish woman,
who was a most wicked man, and a great
cause of the deuision of the kingdome.
IEHOSAPHAT ioyned affinitie with the
wicked familie of ACHAB: For hee gaue
ATHALIA the daughter of ACHAB for
wife to his sonne IORAM: the whiche
without doubt he seemed to himselfe &amp;
others to haue done of a wise forecast,
who had perswaded themselues that by
this meanes that kingdom whiche was
cut and deuided, might be made whole:
but there wanted but little, but that the
whole familie of Iehosaphat was almost
ouerthrowne by this marriage. 2. Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
21. chap. It is said that IORAM the
sonne of IEHOSAPHAT liued no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then AHAB did, the cause is shewed
because he married AHABS daughter:
wicked women doe not onely entise
theyr husbandes to Idolatrie, but they
instill the same into their children with
<pb facs="tcp:8809:22"/>
their milke. But these thinges are not so
to be taken, as if it were not lawfull by
anie meanes for the Israelites to marrie
straungers, though they had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
to the truth. For there is a lawe
extant in the 21. chap. of DEVTER. that
a woman taken captiue might vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
conditions be married with an
Hebrue. SALMA who is also called SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON,
a Prince of the tribe of Iuda, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
RAHAB a Cananite. BOAZ married
this RVTH, which women are placed in
the genealogie of Christ, MATTH. 1.
DAVID married MAACHAM the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the King of GESVR. Neyther is
it to be thought, that those marriages
were vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>That we may come nearer to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whether did these two brethren wel
or no, in marrying wiues of the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
there can be no certainty said of it.
They who say that they did euil, do vrge
this, that the Scripture sayth, they did
take to themselues wiues of the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
saying that theyr Mother dyd
not geue those wiues to them: but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8809:22"/>
it may bee as easily aunswered that they
tooke their wiues with the consent of
their mother. Next that they had no
children of them, which was had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
amongst the Israelites: and God
doth threaten barrennes to them which
do breake the law of marriage. MALAC.
2. chap. also for that they died a sodain
death, which is numbred amongest the
punishments of sinners. But these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are weake, I will rather hold with
them, which say, that they sinned in
that, that they tooke them wiues of the
Moabites, not yet conuerted to the true
faith and worshippe of the onely God.
For I do gather that although ORPAH
was daily in companye with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet shee was not turned to the true
fayth, then that shee returned to her
countrie Gods. Also RVTH was not
fully conuerted to the true religion, I
gather of that, that LIRA sayth in the
last chapter of this booke: that NAOMI
doth perswade her to return also: which
she would not haue done, if she had bin
conuerted before, because shee would
<pb facs="tcp:8809:23"/>
not perswade her to returne, from the
fayth and worshippe of the onely true
God: but of this we will speake at other
tymes. But God would not haue them
that they should marrie with the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
and Ammonites, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were Idolaters, but also for
other causes, set downe in EXOD. 23
Chap. But NAOMIE doth confesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
that both these, did shew their
mariage fayth to their husbands. Those
two sonnes ought to haue returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their country &amp; married wiues there:
For they were not ignorant that by the
law the Israelites were forbidden mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with straungers, and this lawe was
repeated oftener the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once. But it is most
daunger when the Israelitishe virgins
do marry the Moabites, and other stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
Also in the new testament, marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with Idolaters are disalowed of. 2.
COR. 6. chap. PAVLE sayth, thou must
not drawe the yoke with vnbeleeuers,
which doth chiefly belong to marriage.
For this word <hi>Wedlocke</hi> is taken amongst
the Latines from a yoke: for that maried
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8809:23"/>
folkes are as if it were bound vnder one
yoke. But though thou doest vnderstand
these wordes of PAVLE generally, that
we must not keepe companie with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers:
yet hereof it may be inferred
that muche rather wee must not marrie
with them. 1. COR. 7. chap. when the
Apostle saith, that the faithfull must not
forsake the vnfaithfull wife (hee doth
speake of marriage contracted) and not
to be contracted. Therefore wee must
take heede, least we marry with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
for wealth, for power, or for other
temporall profites. Yet at least some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
ought to be had of these Children,
which comming of vnequall matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
are commonly badly brought vp: In
GEN. 6. chap. the sonnes of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did marry wiues of the daughters
of CAIN, because they were bewtifull,
and of them they had Giantes, that is
despisers and contemners of religion.
Superstitious mothers do corrupt their
children with false opinions, which they
do hold obstinately, and that they may
doe very easily, sith they are dayly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
<pb facs="tcp:8809:24"/>
with them, and they doe refuse
no labor that they may do these things.
IVDG. 3. chap. there is an other example
of the Israelites which did marry Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And there may manie newe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
be brought of them, who this way
haue cast both themselues and theyr
children into great daunger of wealth,
estimation, and the soule. Therefore let
the parentes being mindefull of these
daungers, beware least they giue theyr
sonnes to wicked women, much lesse to
giue their daughters to wicked hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes,
in which there is greatest daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
let not children choose them suche
wiues, thier parents being against them.
Although many say that they can turne
their wiues to the truth, yet they know
that they are not wiser then SALOMON:
who did hope (without doubt) that he
could do the same, but by the flatteries,
of women he forsooke God, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Of that that it is sayd that ELIME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECH
died, and both his sonnes, wee
must call to mind that all men must die.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8809:24"/>
HEB. 9. this is called the way of all flesh
in the scriptures, in which they may not
linger at their pleasure. As many as were
before vs are dead. In the booke of GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESIS
the 5. chap. wherein those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which liued long, are numbred,
who florished before the floud, &amp; of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them it is said, they re dead. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
daungers may be auoyded by some
meanes, but the daunger of death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be shunned. For he must die whom
order doth require, whether he will or
no: if that another woulde dye in his
place, that would not be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Euerie
body doth depart sooner for the moste
part then they thinke them selues. Not
onely old men but also young men doe
sometime dye sodenly. Who woulde
thinke that NAOMI should haue out li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
her sonnes? wee knowe not when,
where, or how we shall dye.</p>
                  <p>These thinges ought to stirre vs vp,
the fatall hower being at hand: for who
will not willingly die, hauing so many
companions in this iourney? who is so
bold to aske of God that he might liue
<pb facs="tcp:8809:25"/>
alone? If thy friendes dye, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thinke that they goe before thee: &amp;
that thou shalt followe by and by. For
there are farre better comfortes in the
scriptures, but these are not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
If thou art troubled with diuers &amp;
greeuous afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, thou shouldest think
that thou shalt dye, and that shortly: do
not therefore lay thy hand vppon thy
self, but wait for it patiently. Next when
we heare that we must looke for death,
let vs furnish our selues with necessarie
thinges, as men doe when they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a iourney, wee must beware of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
we must followe after godlines
and innocencie of life. They are to be
reprooued whiche are troubled when
they heare any mention of death. For
who will hope to haue helpe in war of
him who doth feare a sheathed sword
in peace? daunger is not ouercome by
despising.</p>
                  <p>And sith NAOMI being compassed
with many euils, did not despaire: wee
also being cast of God into greeuous
troubles and miseries, let vs not dispaire
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8809:25"/>
or accuse him. A woman for this onely
canse or name that shee is a widdow, is
miserable. For the husband in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is called the head of his wife: for
the body without the head is not a man
but a stocke. Widowes are often times
despised of theyr friends: this euill is
somewhat mitigated, if their husbandes
do leaue behinde them sonnes, to bee a
comfort and helpe, to their mother ae
widdow: But the death of her sonnes
followed the death of her husband E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMELECH:
so that shee seemed wholy
to be destitute of mans ayde. To these
was added pouerty, for the goods that
she had, were spent by little and little in
iourneis and other causes, which are not
knowne to vs. For what is more despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
than a poore widow? Adde to these
that she was now olde, and such cannot
well nourishe themselues, because they
are froward, and subiect to many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
And old age is a disease by it self.
Olde women as the common people
say, are vnworthy of life, and they are
mocked with many reproches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8809:26"/>
To this heape of troubles is added
that they were straungers amongest the
Moabites a nation noysome, cruell to
Israelites and superstitious. If her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and children had died in theyr
countrey, she had her kinsmen and men
of affinitie to comfort her: if she had
bene a straunger amongest people of
of her own nation, it would haue bene
greeuous, how muche more amongest
these? But if as some thinke she went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the land of Moab against the word of
God, she felt then the bites and stinges
of conscience, she remembred that those
troubles befel to her for her own sinne:
yet for all these heapes of troubles,
NAOMI did not dispaire, for shee knewe
that this is the lotte of the sainctes in
this world, that they are exercised with
many and great afflictions.</p>
                  <p>We must thinke in great afflictions
that they are not sent vs by chaunce, but
of God a moste mercifull father to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
profite, and also that hee will mittigate
those troubles and take them away by
and by if it be for our profite: we must
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8809:26"/>
thinke what wee haue deserued by our
sinnes: for God is wont to cast his own
children oftentimes into great troubles,
that hee may make them reioyce the
more afterwardes. Furthermore others
haue also their burthens. Let vs not say
that neuerman was so oppressed with so
many troubles: for as PAVLE sayth wee
haue not withstoode as yet to bloud.
God doth tame vs with great troubles,
that wee may seeke for eternall life, in
which we shall be freed from all trobles.
There are also other endes of troubles
which God doth send. Sathan doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure
to perswade vs in troubles that
God doth hate vs, and therefore that it
is needefull that wee prouide for our
selues, but we must patiently looke for
helpe from God, who also in his good
time did mercifully at the length deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
out of great troubles.</p>

In the first place is shewed
how as soon as she heard that
the Lorde hadde giuen plentie to the
Israelites, she presently betooke her selfe
to her iourny, that she might return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her countrey. Both her daughters in

her a little way as it seemed of no other

                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:8809:27"/>
We doe learne out of this place from
whence aboundance of thinges doe
come. For the scripture saith, God visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(which worde is taken both in the
good part and euill) his people and gaue
them bread: that is, fruit, corne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges necessary for the sustenance
of life. All which amongest the Hebrues
is called bread, as also in that petition,
<hi>Giue vs this day our dayly bread::</hi> GOD
therefore doth giue vs all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.
But as God in his mercy doth giue
vs aboundance: so of his iustice doth he
giue vs scarcetie: He worketh by second
causes, yet hee is not bound to them.
Therefore let vs pray that hee deale not
with vs according to our desertes, but
according to his great mercie.</p>
                  <p>But here is a notable example to be
followed of NAOMIE. For she by and
by assoone as the famine ceased, went
out of the idolatrous nation to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, as if it were to a haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so let
vs also as often as occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is offred flie to
that place, where we may serue God
with a pure conscience, let vs embrace
<pb facs="tcp:8809:28"/>
him with both handes especially if the
word of God be preached publikely in
our owne countrey. DAVID in bannish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did first complaine of this, that hee
could not be present in the holy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and as the Hart doth earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the riuers of waters, after that he is
chased of the hunters, so his soule thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

DAVID hearing that Saule was dead, by
and by he consulted with the Lorde, if
he should goe vnto ZICLAG into some
Citie of the tribe of IVDAH esteeming
nothing more then to returne home
with speede, hee being commanded of
God without delay went with his wife
and fellow souldiers to Hebron. If wee
liue in those places, where religion is
freely exercised wee can scarse containe
our selues in our callinges, what then
will become of vs, there where no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of the word of God, and so
many wicked examples are dayly set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes? Wherefore if thou fallest
by some necessity amongst wicked men,
assoone as thou canst commodiously,

chaung thy place: For there is a greater
care to be had of our eternal safetye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of all other thinges. Those Israelites are
euill spoken of, and also deseruedly,
which did not accept the allowance of
CIRVS, and would not return into their
countrie, but rather die in Babilon, than
leaue their nestes.</p>
                  <p>It is said in the 18. APOCA. allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie,
that wee must leaue Babilon and
Moab, that is idolatrie and wickednes.</p>
                  <p>NAOMIE doth exhort her daughters
in law, that ech of them should go home
to their mothers house, she doth call it
their mothers house not because theyr
fathers were dead, for afterwardes in the

she did leaue her father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and came into the land of Israell:
but because children and especiallie
daughters are most conuersant with the

GENESIS. 24. REBECCA doth call it the

<pb facs="tcp:8809:29"/>
we will speake in place conuenient.</p>
                  <p>She doth pray for their prosperitie,

after a certaine maner but whiche doth

&amp; this word EMETH is added, that
is, truth or fayth. GEN. 24. ABRAHAMES
seruaunt saith if ye now consult to deale
mercifully with my maister, shew it that
is if ye will doe him a good turne and
deserue well of him, giue your daughter
to wife for his sonne. 1. SAM. 15. It is sayd
of the Cenites, that they did shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to all the children of Israell when
they came out of Aegipt, that is that they
gaue them benefites: therefore they
were preserued when the Amalekites
were destroyed.</p>
                  <p>2. SAM. 3. chap. ABNER saith to ISHBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHETH
I haue dealt mercifully with thy
house, that is, I haue bestowed benefites
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8809:29"/>
vpon it. chap. 10. DAVID said I wil deale
mercifully with HANON the sonne of
NOHAS as his father dealt mercifully
with me, sending Embassadours who
shoulde comfort him after his fathers
death. And because he had receaued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of them, his will was to giue
them thankes. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What did these widowes? they did
loue theyr husbandes when they were
aliue, and they did serue them withall
kinde of honest dueties so farre as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
honest wiues, they did speake ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
of the dead, and they did so
lead theyr liues that the dead shoulde
not be euill spoken of for theyr causes.
Furthermore for their husbandes fakes
they did helpe theyr mother in-law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left alone, so they did shew mercy to
the dead. But no man ought to thinke
that of any preposterous zeale, they did
offer I know not what sacrifices, or mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vpp some prayers for them whiche
were departed. For without doubt
RVTH knew that those soules which are
departed in the faith of the Messias are in
<pb facs="tcp:8809:30"/>
rest. &amp;c. The Masse Priestes doe exhort
men that they shew mercy to the dead,
that is, hier Masses to be said for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of sinnes, and that they should
prouide to celebrate the seuenth daies
the moneths daies and yeare daies. &amp;c.
that their soules might be freed out of
purgatory. But sith that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
so many kindes of sacrifices yet
(as PETER MARTER obserueth) it is not
read that hee did appoynt any at all for
them that are tormented in purgatorie,
which he would haue done if our soules
shuld suffer any torments in purgatory.
It is euident by the holy scriptures that
there are onely two places for soules to
be in, namely a place of rest and a place
of torments, the third place which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
purgatory is inuented of man. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man wil do good to the dead, let him
bestow it on the widdow and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and friendes: also let him declare
the noble deeds done by the dead man,
neither let him do this, as at the request
of the man when he was aliue. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The other thing is that NAOMI doth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8809:30"/>
pray for her daughters in law, that they
may each of them find rest in their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
house, that is, she doth wish for
their happy estates and peaceable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryages,
she prayeth for good husbandes
and tractable with whom they may lead
their liues prosperously without pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(which is a common burthen of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage)
and without stroakes and blowes.
Afterwards in the 3. Cap: NAOMI said
to RVTH, I do seeke thee rest, that thou
mayest bee well, that is, I doe seeke
that thou mayest haue a good husband.
She did not think that marriage did lack
all troubles. For marriage hath her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as diuers diseases, troublesome child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrthes,
faults, burialles, and other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
lottes of children and many more of
this kinde, but God as NAOMI knew
will be present at godly matches &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
their troubles. But it is manyfest
that such husbandes as NAOMIE wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for her daughters in law are giuen of
God. Let not young men, nor virgins
enquire by superstitious oracles what
wiues or husbandes they shall haue, but
<pb facs="tcp:8809:31"/>
let them rather praye to God that hee
would prosper them in that matter and
let them depend vpon his prouidence.
We gather of this wish or praier of NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OMIE,
that she beleeued that God had
a care of mortall thinges, and that hee
doth reward good deeds with rewardes
and punisheth euill deeds with punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
                  <p>Next we do learne what things to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and praye for, for others and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for them which haue done vs good,
namely all those thinges which pertaine
to the leading of our life in godlynes.
The Apostles also do beginne their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
with prayers for grace and peace
from God. The Satiricall Poet doth
somewhere reproue the foolish desires
of those parents which do wish riches,
and beautie for their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and other
such like things: not those things which
are of great importaunce. Truly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
goodes without the goodes of the
minde do profite vs little. Furthermore
they do make bad prouision both for
them selues &amp; their children which do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8809:31"/>
cursse them as we do see them common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doe. If thou doest blesse them, yet
they are almost without any good, what
then will become of them whome thou
doest cursse? Furthermore see what wee
are to looke for of them which do deale
well and rightly with others, loue, fayth
and other vertues are rewarded of God.
If thou doest nourish thy parents when
they are old, and do to them all the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a sonne thou shalt find the like to
be done for thee of thy sons, but if thou
doest trouble them, thou shalt looke for
the same of thy sonnes towardes thee,
and whether thou wilt or no thou wilt
say or at least think I am wel dealt with,
for that I haue dealt wickedly with my
parents, the same will bee sayd of others
towards whom we haue not bene mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfull.</p>
                  <p>Also the office of married people is
heere to be obserued. NAOMIE doth
praise her daughters in law because they
shewed al the duties of humanity to her
sonnes, let other women performe the
same towardes their husbandes if they
<pb facs="tcp:8809:32"/>
gouerne themselues wel they may haue
good husbandes and tractable for the
most part: but if otherwise, they procure
to themselues &amp; others, great troubles:
she doth wishe them rest, that is peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
marriage. For maried people ought
not to braule and fight amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
but liue peaceably, for peace and
concord is especially praysed in matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
Many things are read of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of maryed folkes in the epistles of
S. PAVLE and PETER which is not
needfull to be repeated in this place.</p>
                  <p>NAOMIE kissed her daughters in law
they shed teares plentifully which shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
spoken afterward in place conueny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
NAOMIE afterwardes in this book
did call her daughters in law, daughters,
who did loue her better then their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye,
their parents and kinsemen. Good
Lorde how seldome at this day do mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in law and daughters in law agree?
for braules do oft arise amongest them
for light causes, many do wish their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in law to be at the furthest side of
Garamantes. &amp;c.</p>

Or she would say this, it shoulde
greeue me more than you, if for my sake
you shoulde come into any hard case.
Because the hand of the Lorde is gone

what will ye do with me, sith that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <p>NAOMI acknowledged that she fell

she confessed that the hand of the Lord
was stretched out against her, for no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions

But thou doest aske? wherefore shee

Was it not profitable, that they
shoulde be brought from idolatrie to
true Religion: as if it were to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

NAOMIE earnestly desired her two

The wise woman feared least the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

they vnderstand the matter to
be otherwise then they heard, they will
prosecute true religion with deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred:
we must deale with them with such
arguments as are drawn out of the word
of God. How much then doe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
who doe driue men to the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

MATT. Woe saith he be vnto you scribes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8809:35"/>
and Pharisies, for ye compasse sea and
land to make one of your profession,
and when he is made, ye make him two
fold more the childe of hel than you be.
Because they who were of their sect,
were instructed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this, that they
shuld be cruell enemies to Christ. There
are some at this day who doe study to
bring the Iewes to their religion &amp;, cast
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into greater dangers, teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the lawe prescribed to them of
God to worship Idols and beleeue in a
MESSIAS made of bread, &amp;c. Also no
man is to be forced to those things from
whence he cannot returne. A young
man is not to be driuen vnwillingly to
take a wife, nor a Virgine to take a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
for consent is required in marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Much lesse are they to be driuen to
liue alwayes sole, with entisementes, or
by craft, or by force or threatninges. If
NAOMIE should haue had sonnes, yet
shee woulde not haue her daughters in
law to tarry till they were men, for the
danger of the same: but now she wished
them good marriages, much lesse shee
<pb facs="tcp:8809:36"/>
would that they should vowe to liue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
widdowes, being in their flower
of youth. In the counsell that was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at Cesaraugusta it is recorded
that Virgines were not to be accepted
if they hadde vowed to GOD, except it
could be prooued that they were 40.
yeeres old, &amp;c. Afterwardes they were
taken in at 30. yeeres of age, all religion
being ouerthrowne, and at last all were
taken how young soeuer they were no
exception. The Apostle, 1. TIMOTHIE
5. chap. doth commaund widowes not
to be taken to the seruice of the poore
vntill they be 60. yeeres old, and young
widowes to marry and to haue children
and be house-keepers &amp;c. At this day
snares are laid for children of tender
age. For many whiche were more fit for
marriage are thrust vnwillingly into
Monasteries, and of this are many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
wickednesses begotten. It is not
onely a sinne in that, that simple young
ones are put in the Monasteries, but
this whole kinde of life as it is this day
in vse, is against the holy Scriptures.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8809:36"/>
Though men may see and vnderstand
this, yet doe they defend their inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
obstinately.</p>
                  <p>But if anie will contend that NAOMI
did therefore perswade them to returne
into theyr countrie, that they might
liue better amongest their acquaintance
than amongest straungers, not that shee
would trie their mindes. We aunswere
that she, if the matter was so, did sinne

what befell after she commanded them
to returne home. ORPAH returned to
her mothers house, but RVTH taryed
with her mother in law. Let vs heare
what maye bee gathered out of these
wordes for our edification. After NAO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIE
had exhorted them both, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reasons to returne home, they wept
agayne very much, which was a signe of
great sorrow which they tooke of thys,
that they were to part asunder. For sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
bringeth forth tears: as bloud sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8809:37"/>
out of the body if it be wounded:
so if the soule be wounded teares break
forth. Wherefore some do call teares
the bloud of the soule. As they offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not in weeping, so neyther do they
at this day, which shed teares when they
are drawn from their good friends. The
Stoyckes say, that it becommeth not a
man of courage to weepe, for that it is a
signe of a weak &amp; effeminate mind. But
the holy scriptures teach otherwise, for
in them there are many examples not
onely of women: but of most valiaunt
men who by teares haue testified theyr
sorrow, and are not yet accounted to
haue offended therein. IOSEPH wept
foure tymes when his brethren came to
him into Aegypt to buye corne. DAVID
who ouercame, and slew a Lyon, a Bear
&amp; Gyants, when ZIGLAG was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he wept so much that his strength fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him: his souldiours also did the like.
1. SAM. 30. &amp; 2. SAM. 15. DAVID descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

wept. ACT. 20. Our sauiour Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
wept often, therefore that Stoicall
sencelesnesse is not approued of God.
Yet as in other thinges so also in weepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their must be kept a meane, neyther
must we weepe for euery cause. For all
kinde of weeping cannot bee excused.
SENECA although he was a Stoick him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
yet hee sayth wee may weepe but
not howle out. But this makes greatlye
to our comfort, that in this little booke
it is written down twise, that these pore
women wept aboundantly, for heereby
we do gather, that God regardeth the
teares euen of them that be very poore.
DAVID in the PSAL. 56. 8. declareth
that God putteth their teares, and so the
teares of the godly into his bottle, and
and noteth them in hys regester. Good
Lorde how fewe daughters in lawe are

ORPAH kissed her mother in law: kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
was commonly vsed in Palestyne

also do, so they entertained their
friendes and gesse, at their comming,
and bad them farewell with a kisse: in
like maner they saluted them whome
they met with a kisse. Christ in LVKE. 7.
reprooueth SIMON the Pharasie because
he intertained him not with a kisse. OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAH
bidding her mother in-law farewel
kissed her. A kisse is a token of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and kindnes, and also of reuerence,
faith and obedience. PLVTARCH in the
life of CATO VTICENSIS writeth, that
when he departed out of his prouince,
the souldiers reuerently kissed his hand,
the which kinde of honour was at that
time onely giuen to Captaines or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,

POMPEIVS LETVS in his compendium

The Emperours first reached out theyr

he. Afterwardes the Romaine bishops
also, like vnto those tyrauntes whiche

that is, there

a kisse betrayed the sonne of God. This
is too too common at this day that men
whome they kisse, that is whome they
flatter before their face, they do secretly
backbite. It is to be supposed that this
ORPAH kissed her mother in law of a
sincere mind, not as that sonne of whom
it is in the fable, who faining that hee
would kisse his mother when he was led
to execution, with his mouth bit off her
eare. It is said that shee returned to her

for a time professe the true faith, but do

hope of prosperity or being discouraged

IOH. 6. of Christes apostles, when many

the whole world, they should not
finde any nation, whiche will chaunge

they haue chaunged his glorye with a

treue Gods. All nations do straightly
keepe those Gods which they haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.
Therfore it is a hard matter to turn
men from the worshippe of false Gods
to the worship of the true God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it had bene no maruel if RVTH had
worshipped straunge Gods, and refused
to imbrace a new religion. Furthermore
householde examples do much mooue
the mindes of men, for if they returne

if they be great men and many, diuerse
men although they loue true religion
<pb facs="tcp:8809:43"/>
beginne to fall away. Therefore it had
bene no maruell if RVTH had returned
to hers, being shaken and weakened by
the perswations of their mother in law,
And it seemed that NAOMIE was not
of that minde to constrayne RVTH to
go backe, but to trie her fayth, and shee
had a care least it should bee sayd after
that shee was forced by her mother in
law to receaue the Israelitish religion.</p>

the Lord: He that loueth father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that loueth sonne or daughter aboue
me is not worthy of me &amp;c. So hee that
preferreth his countrey, his religion and

not looke what other men doe whether
they be many or fewe, but rather howe
well they doe it and what God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of vs: and he is to be solicited with

But true Religion being decayed,

&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>RVTH addeth an othe by the whiche
she confirmeth that shee will not leaue
her mother in-law. <hi>The Lord doe so to me and
more also, if ought but death depart mee and
thee.</hi> Shee doth not simplye sweare
<pb facs="tcp:8809:45"/>
but curseth her selfe if she keepe not her
promise. This kinde of swearing is often
times vsed in the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Lord doe so to me and more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
But it is not expressed what euils they
do wish for themselues which vse those
words, or to what vengeance they yeeld
themselues if they falsifie their faith: For
the holy Ghost by these Aposiopeses
would teach vs, that we must deale wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in swearing, and beware least that
our toong runne before our minde, for
here that saying ought especially to haue
place: Toong whether doest thou goe?
It is to be obserued that godly men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
vsed swearinges in the old and
newe Testament. Not in all causes but
onely in graue and waightie matters.
And the maner which they vsed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for all othes are not of one sorte.
This maner which RVTH vsed, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that all they should at length perish,
who prophane the name of God by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
their othe, moreouer the sainctes
doe performe in deede, those thinges
which they promised by othe, as RVTH
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8809:45"/>
also did. There are some who do enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
these words conditionally. <hi>The Lord
doe so to me:</hi> and so forward: if God giue
me power and abilitie as hee hath done
hitherto I will be constant: and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
But the first sence, that it should
be the forme of an othe is more playne
and simple.</p>
                  <p>Here is a notable example in RVTH
propounded to vs, first her conuersion
to God, and confession of her faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
her own nation and religion. She
doth confesse that she will ioyne her self
to the true God and his people. RAHAR

and so forward.</p>
                  <p>Next here is an example of loue to

and especially by the inspiration
of the holy Ghost: the God of Israell

of the nations, she hasteneth her selfe to
<pb facs="tcp:8809:46"/>
that land, where the true God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
neyther doth shee suffer her
selfe to be hindered by any pleasures of
this life.</p>
                  <p>She might haue liued more pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amongest her friendes, and as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
haue gotten her a husband more
easily. Yet she had rather (as it is sayd of
MOSES in the Epistle to the Hebrues)
to suffer trobles with the people of god,
then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for
a season, esteeming the reproche of
Christ to be greater riches than the
treasures of MOAB: If she had bin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fayth shee woulde haue returned
home to the Idolaters, for euery imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a better marriage, of riches,
and such other commodities. She dyd
heare the word of God with profite, and
therefore she might be compared to the
tree well planted, and the house buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on a rocke. MATT. 7. cap.</p>
                  <p>Here we haue also an example of loue

wealth or counsell. LVKE. 10. NAOMIE
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8809:46"/>
being striken in age and care, did lacke
the helpe of others. Therefore RVTH
would not go away from her, who had
not receaued small giftes from her, and
though she also was destitute of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
thinges yet shee trusting in Gods
goodnes, would not forsake her mother
in law, whom shee esteemed as her own
mother. Good Lord how few are there
at this day, I say not daughters in-lawe
which will shew such friendship to their
mothers inlaw: but how fewe children
are there which will shew suche friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to their mothers inlaw or affection
to their parentes being olde? Many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be perswaded by any reasons be
they neuer so great to be present, and to
serue their parents when they are disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>But when their parents are in good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
they abhorre theyr company, if
they be somewhat seuere. They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rare who thinke that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
so many benefites vpon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
as they haue receiued from them:
yea they do oftentimes forsake them in
<pb facs="tcp:8809:47"/>
greatest daungers: and the cause of this
matter is, because they are destitute of
fayth and loue. In that that RVTH deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her countrie religion, and embraced
the Israelites religion, the vocation of
the Gentiles is prefigured, who leauing
their superstitions, turned to the God of
ISRAEL.</p>
                  <p>At last NAOMIE seeing her daughter
in law fully purposed to go with her, she
would trouble her no more: but when
shee had sufficiently seene and tried her
constancy, shee willingly tooke her as a
companion of her iourney, she did wish
also the other to bee conuerted to true
religion. Without doubt shee reioyced
and did thanke God that he had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her (being afflicted so many wayes)
so faithfull a daughter. For it should
haue bene a troblesome &amp; a hard iourny
to her, to trauel so farre without a trusty
companion.</p>
                  <p>Shee doth teach vs by her example

                  <p>Let men that are poore and afflicted ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>They were astonied, they had diuers
speeches of the comming of the poore
women: they did flocke to see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in
many Cities, they do sometimes behaue
themselues too too impudently, when
straungers come: they wonder at this
chaunge of thinges.</p>
                  <p>By this it appeareth that NAOMIE
was a woman of great renowne and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMELECH
her husband was a man of
some accompt. For at the comming of
poore men there is no great concourse
of people: They asked if this was NAO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIE?
<pb facs="tcp:8809:49"/>
that name signifieth plentifull
sweete and pleasaunt. The meaning is,
is not this that moste notable woman
which suffered so many trobles? or this
bewtiful woman? truely she aunswereth
not to her name. We haue bene Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Good Lord how much is she chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged!
For though some spake this of a
good minde, marueiling at so great a
chaunge, yet it is probable that some
laught her to scorne, because shee had
lost her beautie and her goods by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a better condition, according to
the maner of the common people. But
that doth greatly troble vs, when others
doe mocke vs, in our afflictions, and
doe not rather sorrowe with vs, we see
with such scoffes euen most valiant men
much troubled. By the way we doe also
learne that bewtie is a fraile thing which
perisheth by diseases, by olde age, by
euill vsage, and by many other meanes.
Therefore we must not haue too much
trust in beautie. There are excellent sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
concerning this matter amongst
the Ethnickes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:8809:49"/>
Shee doth desire them to call her no
more NAOMIE but rather MARA, that is
they should call her bitter, sad and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
because of the bitternes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God himselfe had touched her,
and that which shee had said in a worde
she afterwardes expresseth more fully: I
went out full, and the Lorde caused me
to returne emptie. I had a husband and
children and wealth, and nowe I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of all these, and therefore I doe
not aunswere to my name. My affaires
are no more in that estate wherein they
were when I was in flourishing age and
bewtie: God hath pressed and humbled
me with diuers troubles: therfore an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
name doth agree with my estate.
Wee learne by this, that godly men
wheresoeuer they be, whether at home
or abroad want not their crosses. When
NAOMIE returned into her country, she
was entertained with scoffes, no doubt.
But in the land of MOAB also, shee must
needes see &amp; heare many things which
greatly greeued her mind. God doth
graunt a truce to his children for a time
<pb facs="tcp:8809:50"/>
but in the meane season he woulde they
should gather their wittes togither, and
prouide for the troubles to come. Wee
must not desire of God to liue without
a crosse, who doth chasten them whom
he doth loue. HEBRV. 12. 2. TIM. 3. all
that will liue godly must suffer persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
ACTES 14. we must goe into the
kingdome of heauen through manie
troubles. Let vs not thinke then that it is
an argument that God is angry with vs,
when he doth afflict vs with diuers tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Secondly here is to be seene how
NAOMIE gouerned her self, in that new
affliction and other trobles, wherewith
shee was greatly oppressed. She ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all troubles with patience. She did
giue place to them that skorned her, so
that if it pleased them they might for
NAOMIE call her MARA. She spake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
impiously against god, or reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
against man: the old woman might
easily haue found some thinges, with
the which shee might haue vpbraided
those which so entertained her, saying
how impudent are you? what meaneth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8809:50"/>
this concourse? did you neuer see poor
&amp; afflicted women? haue ye nothing to
do at home? do you reioice at other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
troubles? Truely you doe shewe your
great foolishnes, or rather enuie. But she
vseth no suche wordes, shee doth deale
peaceably with them, and she doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
freely, that her estate was in a hard
case. But how could she beare the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the people, and lightly beare so
many troubles, when all of vs by nature
are vnpatient? first she doth confesse that
these thinges fell not our by chaunce
but that GOD was the first author of
these troubles, who gouerning al things
well according to his good wil, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
to no man. God hath brought me
back (saith she) he hath troubled me, he
hath afflicted me, shee doth not accuse
the Moabites nor her husband nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
nor fortune, but attributeth al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
to God. If we beleeue that God who is
a most iust and mercifull father doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the crosse vpon vs. Wee shalbe the
more patient. We haue an example of
IOSEPH, who said he was sent of God to
<pb facs="tcp:8809:51"/>
Aegipt: also DAVID who said that GOD
did commaund Shimei to cursse him.
We must not thinke what they are who
doe hurt vs, either in word or deede: but
what we are and with what sinnes wee
prouoke Gods wrathe against vs, what
we haue deserued, and let vs submit our
selues to him: if wee rest vppon second
causes, we shal neuer haue quiet minds.
Then shee doth acknowledge that God
did send her those troubles, for good &amp;
and not to ouerthrow her: for shee sayd
he humbled her. This word signifieth to
humble, to afflict: for of trouble humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
doth follow. Trouble doth giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
This NAOMIE was not
without her faultes. It may be shee did
not know before he was dead, how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a husband shee had, and the same
may be sayd of her children and wealth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d health. &amp;c. or els she had too much
delight in them, and trusted too muche
in them.</p>
                  <p>God doth take away those thinges
wherin wee put our hope &amp; confidence
that our whole hart may depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8809:51"/>
alone. DAVID sayth in the Psalme: it is
good O Lorde that thou hast humbled
me. This profite of the Crosse is great
which ought to teache vs patience: for
god prepareth a way to thinges greater
by troubling vs. As if any man taketh
down an old house that he might build a
new house better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. Further
she saith twise that shee is afflicted with
the almightie god, who can easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
troubles into prosperitie. In all tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
think that god is almightie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not hard to him, if he will and
the good of his children do so require,
to deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their troubles. Hee
doth make the poore rich, he doth heale
the sicke, he doth raise vp from the dead
hee doth decke the despised with great
authoritie. Furthermore he doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
bring his children into great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
for this cause, that they may
afterwards acknowledge him their only
deliuerer, and giue him thankes.</p>
                  <p>In the last place it is noted what time
of the yeare she returned into her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
namely in the spring time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
<pb facs="tcp:8809:52"/>
began to reape barly. About the feast of
the passeouer they began to reape barly.
The Chaldean interpreter saith that she
came the first day of the passeouer when
the Israelites began to reape the sheafe
or handfull of the first fruites whiche
was barely: LEVI. 23. ca: It is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
the 15. day of the month of Nishan they
offered a handfull of eares of the first
fruites of their corne, this was barely as
the Hebrue interpreters do affirme: this
matter is mentioned for the historie of
the chap. following how RVTH went
to gather cares and came acquainted
with BOAZ.</p>
                  <p>NAOMIE doth teach vs by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that we do not neglect occasion,
which is (as CICERO saith) atime which
hath in it selfe a dexteritie to doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
or not to do: this in attempting &amp;
performing matters is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

                  <p>RVTH asked leaue of her mother in

The Grecians doe call gleaning <hi>Calamon

which is lawfull by the lawe, LEVIT. 19.
when ye reap the haruest of your grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
ye shall not reape euery corner of your

goe againe to fet it, but it shalbe for the

When thou beatest thyne Oliue tree,
thou shalt not goe ouer the boughes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
but it shalbe for the straunger fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse,

they shalbe for the straunger, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse,
and for the widowes. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that thou wast a seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the
land of Aegipt, therefore I commaund
thee to doe this thing. Furthermore
LEVIT. 25. chap, hee doth commaund
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8809:54"/>
that the seuenth yeare be a sabbaoth to
the Lord. They ought not to sowe, nor
plant vineyards, but those which grew
of themselues, should they leaue to the
straungers and poore. Likewise in the
yeare of Iubile. MATT. 12. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
accused not Christes Disciples,
(whiche on the sabaoth daye did goe
through the corne, and gather eares,
and eate) of theft or spoyle, but of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sabaoth. Although it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for straungers, and widowes to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eares: yet RVTH woulde not doe it
without the aduise of her mother in
law. Daughters in law may learn by this
example, how to esteeme their mothers
in law, and how to honour them. This
woman did not contemne her mother
in law, though she had lost her husband
and had no children by him: moreouer
she is constrayned to nourish her, she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
her aswell as if shee had bene her
owne mother. The commaundement of
the Lord. <hi>Thou shalt honor thy parentes:</hi> doth
comprehend both mother in lawe and
fathers in law. Honour doth also consist
<pb facs="tcp:8809:55"/>
in this, that daughters in law doe aduise
with theyr mothers in lawe, when they
goe a iourney, or doe anie other things
whiche are of any moment. There are
now few daughters in lawe, or naturall
daughters whiche deale so modestly
with theyr parentes. If they shoulde
nourish theyr mothers in law as she did,
and should consult with them of things
to be done, good Lorde what brawles
would they moue? If theyr parentes of
naturall affection, or good will, whiche
they beare to their children, doe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them what they should doe, or not
doe, how greeuously will they vpbraide
them? howe many children are there
which walke the streetes in the night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their fathers willes? how manie
daughters which runne to all gasinges
and daunsinges? NAOMIE did aunswer
her friendly, (go my daughter) Let not
mothers in law being consulted with of
theyr daughters in law, mock them, nor
vpbraide them with bitter wordes: but
aunswere them courteously, that they
may thinke them selues to be esteemed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8809:55"/>
as naturall daughters. Againe shee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
her daughter, shee reprocheth her
not. It is profitable and comely for
straunge widowes (especially if they be
yong and bewtiful) to keep themselues
at home, and not to go alone, nor wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into the streetes, least they be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for vnhonest, or be rauished as wee
may read of DINAH the daughter of IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB.
Necessitie which is the extreemest
and greatest dart, constrained her to go
out of her house, that she might get her
owne liuing, and her mother in lawes.
Let not parentes be too rigorous, but
graunt those thinges whiche are conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
RVTH went into the fields to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eares. She did not like an idle hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
looke for foode from heauen, shee
did not steale other mens goodes, shee
did not lay out her body to sinne, to get
her thinges necessary, but shee applied
her selfe to honest labour, yea, and to
hard labor: for to reape corn, to gleane,
and to seeke eares through the fieldes in
the greatest heate of the sunne is a hard
and troublesome labor. Neither would
<pb facs="tcp:8809:56"/>
she be troblesome to anie bodie: for she
promiseth to goe into his fieldes in
whose fight shee found fauour, that was
to whome shee was acceptable, with
whose good wil she might gather eares.
She doth also obserue the time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of getting her liuing. She was not
vrged to labour as many must, but of
her owne good will, and diligently, she
did that which she shoulde doe. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
women ought to follow this notable
example of labor and humilitie. PAVLE
saith 4. chap. EPHE. who so doth steale
let him steale no more: but let him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and worke with his handes, the
thing which is good, that hee may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
vpon whome it is needfull. Not
that necessitie doth driue all men to
worke with theyr handes, but rather to
endure any extremities then to vse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites,
fraudes, or other guiles, al which
are comprehended vnder this worde
steale. There is not one kinde of labour:
there is a labour which doth more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the minde than the body, as to
giue iudgement, to gouerne a Churche
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8809:56"/>
or schoole, to minister phisicke &amp;c. For
who so thinketh that iudges, Ministers,
Shoolemaisters, and Phisitions do not
laboure, is no lesse foolishe, then they
which do thinke, that no body laboreth
in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hip, but the plumpers, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
&amp; not they which do hold the stern.
Agayne, there is a laboure which doth
especially require the body, and this is
not of one kind: for ther are many crafts
and occupations. As euery member of
the body haue their function: so in the
body of the common wealth, euerye
man hath his peculiar labour, and it is
not profitable that euery man shoulde
vse one art. The apostle commaundeth
to worke <hi>To agathon</hi> that which is good &amp;
honest. For there are <hi>mataiotechniai</hi> as
tumbling and iugling: there are some
deuelishe craftes, as engr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sers, vsurers,
baudes, which were better to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
then so to exercise their labours.
There are some which do onely serue
mens pleasures. But God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
vs honest labours. God placed
ADAM before his fall in paradise, and
<pb facs="tcp:8809:57"/>
would not suffer him to bee idell, but to
dresse the garden, the which hee might
haue done without trouble: after his
fall his will was, that hee should get
his bread with the sweat of his browes,
and that hee should till the earth with
hard labour, which was curssed for hys
sinne. SOLOMON PROV. 6. doth stirre
vs vpp to laour by the example of the
Antes, and he immitateth and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
the wordes of the sluggardes that
can scarse be drawn out of their beddes.
Also the wise men of the gentiles doe
commend laboure, and disprayse I dle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The Massilienses (as valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
doth testifie) did shut out all them
which would seek to liue sluggishly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of religion. If our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
had done so, in some yeers past
we should not haue had so many orders
of Monkes: but euery man ought not
onely to do that which is good, in hys
calling, but in a lawful time, and not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
daies forbidden, and while strength
doth serue. Neither is there anye cause
why any man should tyre out himselfe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8809:57"/>
with immoderate laboures, and those
things which thou hast gotten by thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are to be ascribed to the blessings
of God. The Appostle in the 1. THES.
4. and the 2. THES. 3. chapter, doth shew
the cause wherfore good men ought to
labour: namely, that they may help the
needy, and that they may haue thinges

idle fellows are. It befell that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any direction of man, shee came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the field of BOHAZ, or it came to passe
or chaunced: this word <hi>Mikraeh,</hi> signyfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the successe, the issue, or chance. 1.
SAM. 6. verse. 9. of the ark it is sayd, if it go
to Bethshemesh, it is he that did vs al this
euill: but if not, we shall know then that
it is not his hand which touched vs: but
it was a chaunce that happened vs, &amp;c.
If thou doest consider RVTHES will, it
was by chaunce that she went into that
fielde: if the purpose of God, he led her
as it were by the hand: those thinges
which seem to vs to be done by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
are not done without the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
<pb facs="tcp:8809:58"/>
God. We may haue an example out of
the law, where this matter is prooued:
EXOD. 21. and DEVT. 19. If two men fel
trees, and the axe slide out of the hand
of one of them and kill his neighbour:
he did this vnwillingly, and therefore he
was allowed a sanctuary: but as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God, hee deliuered him ouer for
certayn causes. HIEROM on the 12. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of IEREMI saith, that nothing falleth
out either good or euill, by chaunce, but
by Gods prouidence and iudgement: as
it is said in the Prouerbs of SALOMON:
Lots are gouerned of God. If a sparrow
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fall to the ground without Gods
wil? what can come by fortune in mans
affairs which doth not fall out by Gods
determinate councell? we see how God
doth direct and blesse those men which
take honest laboures in hand: of which
we will speake more afterwardes: but
shee was well accepted of BOHAZ and
his familie.</p>

RVTH hauing first gotten
leaue of her mother in lawe

came by fortune, or (that I may
speake more truely) by the prouidence
of God, into the field of BOAZ her kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but what befell to her there, the
holy Ghost doth diligently set downe,
in these wordes following. In the first
place here is shewed, howe BOAZ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:8809:59"/>
from Bethlehem into the field, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
his reapers, who aunswered, the
Lord blesse thee. The worde blessing is
vsed in diuers places of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and hath diuers significations.
Sometime it signifieth to prayse &amp; giue
thankes, as when DAVID saith to Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
in the 1. Booke of SAMVELL the 25.
chap. praysed be the Lorde God of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
which sent thee to meet me this day.
Sometime it signifieth to pray for good
thinges: as in the 48. chap. of GENE. IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB
the Patriarcke blessed his sonnes,
that is, he did wish wel vnto them. GEN.
the 37. chap. IACOB both at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the king, and at his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
blessed him: that is, he saluted him,
&amp; bid him farewell, he gaue him thanks
and wished him well. When it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God, it signifieth to doe well,
for God by his worde doth worke. It is
sayd in the 10. chap. of the Prouerbes:
The blessing of god doth make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rich,
that is, God doth increase and preserue
riches. What the simple vse of this word
is, we must consider by reading the holy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8809:59"/>
scriptures: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they say in this place.
The Lord blesse thee. The meaning is,
the Lord giue thee a fruitfull haruest, &amp;
and all good thinges, as well for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as for the soule.</p>
                  <p>We haue an example in this place of
salutation. The maner of salutation is
not onely olde, but moste profitable to
reconcile and confirme loue: which
our sauiour doth diligently commend
to all godly men. The Aungell saluted
GEDION as hee was threshing corne,
with these wordes. The Lorde be with
thee thou strong man. IVDGES 6. chap.
It is reckoned vp amongst the duetie of
the Priestes, to blesse the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l.
There is a solemne blessing set
downe in the 6. chap. of numbers. Some
Anabaptistes, will not haue men salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
citing that which Christ in the 10.
chap. of LVKE sayd to his seuenty disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
salute no man by the way: but he
doth meane nothing els then vnder the
colour of salutation, to suffer themselues
to be called from their calling or if thou
wilt vnderstand it according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:8809:60"/>
it was a personall and speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
and not a generall. The
Aungell saluting the blessed virgin vsed
this same forme, which BOAZ doth in
this place. Also Christ saluted his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
saying, peace be with you. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
PAVLE doth begin and ende hys
epistles with salutations. Hee putteth
downe their names whom he saluteth:
also the names of them which do salute
others. It is incredible to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how
much that will auaile to the getting of
good will, but we must take heede least
we doe it with an hypocrites minde. It
is a poynt both of curtesie and of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
to salute others, and to pray for
them. If great and mightie men doe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
poore men, they are marueilously
affected, seeing that they are not despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of them. Neither was it to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but that this salutation of BOAZ
was moste acceptable to the reapers.
There are some who doe of enuie and
hatred disdaine to salute others, who
shouide remember that commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, that wee must pray for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8809:60"/>
and wish well to our enemies. How oft
commeth it to passe that many who wil
not willingly salute one an other, after
they haue ben absent &amp; asunder, would
desire nothing more, then to liue togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to vse all dueties of humanitie
to eche other?</p>
                  <p>Here is an houshold example pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
vnto vs, of a good housholder
he goeth to his reapers, he looketh what
is done in the field, for the presence of
the maister helpeth much in any worke.
PLINIE in his 8. booke 6. chap. the
elders haue said that the eye of the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is moste fruitfull for the ground. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISTOTELL
in his 1. book of gouerning
a house doth write of a certaine man,
who being demaunded what dung was
the best: aunswered the steppes of the
maister. Although a man hath good and
trustie seruauntes and bayliffes, yet the
mayster being absent, they do all things
the more negligently and carelesly, TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS
LIVIVS sayth elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, those things
doe not prosper which are ouerseene
by straungers. Read the prouerbes of
<pb facs="tcp:8809:61"/>
ERASMVS concerning this matter, the
forhead is better than the hinder part:
negligent housholders doe spoyle both
themselues and their seruauntes. These
sayinges may be applied to greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
as to kings and Bishops, that they
doe not al things by other mens hands,
eyes, and eares, while they doe cocker
themselues with pleasures.</p>
                  <p>BOAZ asked his seruaunt which hee
had set ouer the reapers (IOSEPHVS cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him <hi>Agronomon</hi>) of RVTH, what shee
was, or whose wife, or daughter she was.
This he did not aske as some youthes
doe, that they might offer them some
villanie, but because he saw that she was
a straunger and painful: The Bayliffe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
shee is that Moabitesse, which
came of late with NAOMIE, and he gaue
her great prayse: hee little thought that
she should haue bene his wife, but see
how wonderfully GOD bringeth it to
passe.</p>
                  <p>As touching that BOAZ appointed a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
ouer the reapers, who shoulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their taskes, &amp;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8809:61"/>
see that they did euery thing in order, &amp;
without doubt an honest man, all hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
ought to followe it. For vnlesse
that in great families, euery one knowe
what to do, or haue theyr ouerseers and
guides, they may haue theyr things very
negligently done: as order is required
in an armie: euen so in a houshold. That
seruaunt did marke RVTH so diligently,
that hee coulde aunswere his maister to
that hee did aske<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so ought all seruants
to marke diligently euery thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to them, that they may giue
an account of euery thing to theyr mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                  <p>This also must be noted diligently,
that he praysed RVTH. He doth not, as
the enuious, disprayse and lessen those
thinges which are praise worthy in her:
Neyther doth he hate her, because shee
is a stranger, nor reproch her for it. They
are to be praysed for their vertues, who
are worthie of prayse: vertue must not
be hated. Oftentimes the poore men
being commended to the rich by theyr
seruauntes, they receaue great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
<pb facs="tcp:8809:62"/>
by them. This kinde of duetie is
required of vs, that if wee cannot helpe
the godly, by our owne riches or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell:
at least, let vs entreat others to doe
for them, which wee may doo without
our hurt.</p>
                  <p>But he doth shew two things of RVTH
which are worthie of prayse, and are to
bee followed of vs. The one that shee
did aske leaue of them to gather eares.
The law of MOSES doth graunt straung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and widdowes by name to gather
eares: yet she would not by that warant
gather eares in the field without the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
good will. There are many who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the minde and wil of the owners,
and agaynst the law of God and man,
do go into other mens fieldes, and by
theft and rapine, take awaye their fruite
and destroy their hedges and doe them
great hurt.</p>
                  <p>The other thing for which she is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
is, that she was painfull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
from the morning vntil this time,
namely, she plied her labour to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
By and by: assoone as she had eaten,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8809:62"/>
she returned to her labour, sauing shee
tarried a litle in the house. MVNSTERVS
enterpreteth it, except she eased her selfe
in the house. The Tigurine translation
sayth, that she sat a while in the house.
Some doe vnderstand it, that she taried
in the house not a moment. The old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
and Septuagintes wer of this
minde: Others doe think that she stood
still, and rested not, but when shee went
home, or taried in the tent, (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they had in the field to take the
shadow, and to recreate them in) Those
Countries are very hote in the time of
haruest, shee was not of the number of
those women which walke idelly in the
streets, and look the whole day through
the windowes: but rather she was such
a one as SALOMON speaketh of in the
Prouerbes, of whome amongest other
thinges he saith, that she laboureth day
and night: this ought to be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
of in women then bewtie.
There are this day fewe children, or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
seruauntes, which will work so hard
as she did.</p>

for the ease of their labours, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
they doe abuse theyr libertie, they
doe handle many shamefast and chaste
virgines very filthily, and doe many
thinges insolently: his seruauntes might
haue done the same, therefore hee doth
promise her that he wil admonish them
that they doe not hurt her. But it is the
duetie of housholders that they do not
onely preserue the chastitie of their own
maydes, but also of others, that no fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines
be spoken, whereby they might
be prouoked to lewdnes, let him shewe
them how filthie a thing whordome is,
and how harlots are defamed with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

from all thinges, which may prouoke
them to lewdnes, especially if he see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
gamesome or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ton, as from lewd talk,
from keeping companie with suspitious
men, from filthy shewes and daunsings
&amp;c. There are some who say that it is but
in vaine to keepe them straightly, but
youthes doe oft amisse for want of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
But howe wicked are they
<pb facs="tcp:8809:65"/>

they ought to preserue, and be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

them themselues? He ought also to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
least the body, fame, or goods, of
his neighbours or any others be hurt
by his seruauntes.</p>
                  <p>He must not onely keepe in order his
houshold seruauntes, but also his beasts
that they be not hurtfull to others, as
dogges, horses, oxen &amp;c. It is said in the

past, and it hath bene tolde his maister
and he hath not kept him in, and after
he killeth a man or a woman, the oxe
shalbe stoned and his owner shall dye
also, &amp;c. Also if the fire breake forth and
burne corne, and take into the stackes
standing in the fieldes, hee shall restore
the losse, that did kindle the fire. If any
man shall digge a pitt and shall not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

He doth adde this, that if shee were a
thirst, she should goe to the vessels and
drinke of the water, which the seruants
haue drawne. There is great scarsitie of
water in those places, PALESTINE hath
her floudes riuers and springes, but yet
in many places the springes are dried vp

them, because there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is a great benefite, that hee doth bid her
goe to take drinke out of the vessels, that

This seemeth to haue some force that

drawne: namely not without labour:

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8809:66"/>
and that with a good will. But what was
the cause of this humanitie and good
will towardes RVTH, when hee did not
know that he should be coupled in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
vnto her? Because shee had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God by faith, shee also had the
good will of men. God doth moue the
heartes of the enemies towardes those
whome he doth loue, as SALOMON saith
in hys prouerbes the 16. chap. Then hee
vnderstood by the speech of his Baylife,
that shee was indued with notable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and therefore that she was worthy
of fauour and good will. If hee had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
euill of her, peraduenture he would
haue conceiued some euill against her.
Furthermore she was indued with faith
which is the spring of good workes, and
he saw with his eyes the diligence of the
woman in gathering of eares.</p>
                  <p>This courtesie of BOHAZ is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of vs: the poore and straungers
are to be nourished and intreated friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Nouices in the faith are to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against those iniuries which they
are in daunger of. Next if we will haue
<pb facs="tcp:8809:67"/>
men kinde and friendly, we must especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seeke to please God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly here is shewed how RVTH
behaued her selfe towardes him. First
she fell on her face, and bowed her selfe
to the ground. She sheweth her selfe as
one vnworthie, that BOAZ a noble man
should vse so courteously, <hi>shicah</hi> to bow,
to submit or fall downe in the forme
hithpaal <hi>hishtaueh</hi> to cast downe her self
to bow the head or the rest of the bodie
to fall downe at any mans feete. The
Grecians doe render it <hi>proscunein</hi> And
the latines expound it by the worde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration:
EXOD. 20. in the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
which speaketh against
Images and Idols, it is said thou shalt
not adore them. The idolaters say that
they doe not worshippe them, and that
they are iniuried if these thinges be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of them, but truely they knowe
not or rather will not knowe what it is
to adore. The Hebrue worde signifieth
to bow and lie downe before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, but
will they deny that they doe this? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot be excused from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8809:67"/>
Amongest the latines also to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
doth signifie to bow the knees,
and to honor by falling downe &amp;c. it
was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner that they would
fall downe at the feete of them whome
they would honour, but wee doe not
bow our knees vnlesse we come before
Princes, before whome wee suppliently
fall on our knees.</p>
                  <p>Next shee doth wonder and make
great accompt of his courtesie, when
she being a straunger was so well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of him, for the moste part banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
men and poore men are despised
of the rich and mightie.</p>
                  <p>We haue a notable example in RVTH
of humilitie thankefulnes and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse.
She doth shew her humilitie,
partly by her outward behauior, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the gesture of the body, that is by
bowing &amp; submission, partly by words,
for shee saith, Wherefore haue I found
grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest
know me, or that thou doest knowe me?
For it signifieth (as MARTINVS BOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAVS
the diligent and learned expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:8809:68"/>
of gods word) no light acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut to acknowledge louingly and to
haue a regard of anie. She doth confesse
that shee is vnworthy of his benefites.
HVMILITIE is a notable vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
pride is opposite.</p>
                  <p>She doth declare her thankefulnesse
in this, that she doth not despise nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
this benefite bestowed vppon
her, shee doth not say, what is this that
thou doest bid me to gather eares? doth
not the lawe of God graunt this to the
poore? what is this that thou doest offer
me drinke when I am a thirst? water is
commonly to be vsed, wherefore doest
not thou giue me some notable gift sith
I am poore and thou riche? Truely the
benefite was not so great of it self, which
he did giue her, but because it came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a notable man and from a good will,
she made great accompt of it. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
sayth, gifte of a friend is best, She
by her thankefulnes did prouoke BOAZ
to be more ready and prompt to relieue
her pouertie. Let them diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
this which doe want the helpe of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8809:68"/>
others: let them not be vnpatient if they
haue not all by and by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
let them not despise those thinges
that are bestowed on them let them, not
threaten that they wil wreast anie thing
by force. But let them rather think that
others haue theyr burdens, and that
they by their importunitie do hurt both
themselues and others. For vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
stoppeth vpp the welspring of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites.</p>
                  <p>The shamefastnesse of this woman
appeareth in this that she fell downe to
the ground, and did not impudently
look on BOAZ, shamefastnes is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
prayse of women, for shamfastnes (as
CICERO saith) is the keeper of al vertue,
auoydeth vncomelinesse, and getteth
great prayse. Therefore this caused her
not to looke wantonly on BOAZ, nor to
speake long with him: both these vices
the Gentiles doe condemne in women
as the <hi>Satyrric<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>all</hi> Poet saith. Shee is so
bolde that she can keepe company with
men. And she can talke with armed cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
in the presence of her husband
<pb facs="tcp:8809:69"/>
without a blushing face and with stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out brestes. The prouerbe sayth
scilence doth adorne a woman, as it is
in this verse of Sophocles. <hi>gunaiza cosmon è

being a strunger: for the most part we
see it come to passe that straungers and
the poore are despised of the mightie &amp;

for the trust she had in the God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
&amp; loue towards her mother in law.</p>
                  <p>That she was indued with true faith,
of this it is gathered, that she forsooke
her natiue countrie her parents her kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks
and her country Gods and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Israelitish religion. ABRAHAMS
fayth is commended, who being called
of God into a straunge land neglected
all thinges, and followed him without
delay, she doth shew indeede that shee
was the daughter of ABRAHAM. For she
had rather liue in other nations for the
truth then to liue in her own countrie.
It appeareth also by this that shee had
true sayth, that BOAZ said that she came
to hope vnder the winges of the Lorde,
that is, that shee might liue safelye
vnder his defence and patronage. As
many as put their trust in God cannot
<pb facs="tcp:8809:70"/>
perish: Howsoeuer the deuill doth rage
he cannot pull them out of his handes.
Here is a Metaphore borowed from
birdes and hennes whiche with theyr
winges doe couer theyr young, nourish
and defend them. DAVID doth often
vse this Metaphore in the Psalmes, that
he might shewe the care of God in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
the godly. As a henne the kyte
besieging her doth cloke her chickens
and hide them vnder her wings, so doth
God defend the godly and call them
louingly vnto him. The Prophet sayth
in the 17. Psal. keepe me as the apple of
thine eie, &amp; hide me vnder the shadow
of thy winges. PSAL. 36. how excellent
is thy mercy O God, therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men trust vnder the shadowe of
thy winges. PSAL. 57. haue mercy on
me O God, haue mercy on me, for my

                  <p>ISAY 31. he sheweth that hee will de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fend
the Citie Ierusalem against the

borrowed from birdes, or hennes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as a bird that flieth, so shall the Lord

PAVLC in the 10. chap. to the Romaines
sayth, faith commeth by hearing, and
hearing by the worde of God. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that she had heard of her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
of her mother in-law, and her father in

her.</p>
                  <p>Also wee doe note by the way that
they which leaue Idolatrie and embrace
the true faith, doe carrye themselues as
it were into a hauen and sanctuarie: as
chickens wandering are as it were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to be spoyled and prayed vpon, by
hawkes and other rauenous byrdes, but
they are defended vnder the winges of
theyr dammes: so they which doe leaue
the true religion, and seeke for helpe of

into manifest danger of the soule.
Also God doth exercise his faithfull

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8809:71"/>
meane season hee doth comfort them:
Many thinke that they shall fall into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
danger both of life &amp; of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
if they should embrace the gospell,
therefore they doe retayne a false religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against their conscience, and in the
meane season being vexed with the
stings of conscience, they doe lead an
vnpleasaunt and a miserable life.</p>
                  <p>The other thing that BOAZ did praise
in her is this, that shee did loue her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law, though her husband depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of life, and left no childe by her,
and her mother in law was a straunger:
from whence it may be gathered easily
that she did loue her husband: she doth
by her example teache them that are
married mutually to loue togither, and
withall seek one to exceed the other in
all marriage dueties. It is knowne by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
what great good doth arise of
good marriages, and what great euils
doe befall by euill marriages.</p>
                  <p>It is after added, that hee did pray for
the prosperitie of RVTH: hee sayth the
Lord recompence thy worke, and a full
<pb facs="tcp:8809:72"/>
reward bee geuen thee of God, that is,
the Lord reward the, both in this lyfe &amp;
in the lyfe to come: wherof many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are euery where in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The papists do aleage this to shew
that we deserue the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by our good deedes. And they doe
not onely vnderstand by those good
works, those which are wrought by the
faythfull by the spirite of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his worde, but the deuised and
chosen workes, which the foolishnes
and coutousnes of man hath inuented,
and they go so far that the works which
ar called supererogatory they do sel to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for mony. Of this it came to passe
that they did put their hope and trust
in their deeds, and they atributed much
to their own forces, and so obscured the
doctrine of the merite of Christ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is profitable to know, how these
places are to be vnderstood where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of wages, rewardes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
&amp;c. The scripture teacheth
vs that God of his meer mercy through
faith for christs sake: doth forgiue sinnes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8809:72"/>
and giueth eternall life. There is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
place to the Ephes. 2. chap. It is the
gift of God &amp;c. But he doth promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for good deeds: not for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes
of them, but for the grace wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God doth imbrace beleeuers. AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE
writeth wel, God doth crown
in vs his owne gift, not our merites: for
first hee bestoweth vppon vs his grace
that wee maye doe that which is good.
Then of his meere grace, he doth adorn
with rewards that good which he hath
wrought in vs. Eternall life is called a
reward, but not properly, neyther doe

for their owne good deeds, but as
the free gift of God: wee do not denye
but that God rewardeth good deedes,
but we doe not by them deserue his so

wee haue not receiued? the Lord doth
geue vs both will and abilitie to do wel.
Next it is required in a desert that wee

17. chapter. Also it is required that there
be some equalitie and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
that which is geuen, and that
which is receiued. But what equalitie
can there be betweene our workes and
eternall life? If thou sayest we deserue

that therfore we deserue eternall life by
good works, it is not a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion.
For good thinges proceed from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of God, euill thinges from vs: euill
thinges are perfectly euill, but our good
workes are maymed and vnperfect. It
doth not so followe, this man can kill
himselfe, therefore he can geue himselfe
life. Then thou doest obiect: what do
good workes auayle? verye much, for
they do serue to the glory of our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and vocation, when we do finde
by their testimonie the vertue of Christ
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8809:73"/>
to encrease more and more in vs, they
prouoke others to liue holylie. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
also the outward duety, the hungry
are fed, the naked are clothed, the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are receiued into hospitalitie, &amp;c.
Furthermore they do testifie that we be
thankefull to God for the benefites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of him.</p>
                  <p>And we gather out of this place that
good deedes are to bee praysed, to bee
well spoken of, and to be garnished with
rewardes. The Poet doth also say: ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
being praysed doth encrease. AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISTINES
beeing asked howe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth should bee preserued, hee
aunswered if rewardes were appoynted
for wel doers, and punishments for euil
doers: yet wee must not set our delight
in vertue to thend that we may be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
but, for Gods commaundement,
though it commeth to passe that wee
are stirred vppe to vertue by rewardes.
How many are there this day who if
they should auoyd theyr country after
the example of RVTH that they may
publikely and freely heare and openly
<pb facs="tcp:8809:74"/>
professe the pure religion, would sette
themselues to be scorned at of others?
If any man doth loue his mother in-law
as his own mother they would call him
a foole. It commeth to passe so also in
other matters, but we ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in this vnthankefulnesse &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this world, with the iudgement
of a few good men. Principally this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple
doth teach vs to pray to God that
hee will render to the godly for theyr
good deedes, that they may receaue a
full rewarde for their good deedes, as
he hath prayd.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer we gather, what wee must
looke for of God if we cast away Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and serue him. For the prayers of
godly men are not in vaine, but they are
as it were promises. This praier doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

also in this life with trouble. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is that the godly should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted

They who will keepe it any longer, doe

also onelye sprinkeled with water) in

that they feele themselues by this drink
to be freed from thirst. Thou hast an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in BOHAS of ciuill behauiour at

himselfe but hee doth also reache meate
to others, we haue a like example of our

                  <p>After that RVTH had eaten her meat
she presentlye returned to her worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
and shee remayned at gleaning
vntil the euening, she doth not take the
shadow like an idle and a slouthfull hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife.
She is far vnlike them who when
<pb facs="tcp:8809:80"/>
they are full, do refuse labours. But this
diligence and carefulnes is greatly to be
praysed in this woman and all others.</p>
                  <p>BOHAZ being delighted with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
of this woman, doth commaund
his seruauntes, that they suffer her to
gleane amongest the sheaues which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wise is not graunted, some they
shuld leaue of purpose, othersome they
should scatter, neyther should they say
that this was for others, and so make her
ashamed, or blame her, but for this cause
that she should gather the more, and go
more chearefully to her mother in law.</p>
                  <p>Rich men do learne by this example,
that it is their duety to helpe the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
God doth geue great encrease, not
so much for the riche as for the poore.
Christ accompteth that as giuen to him
whatsoeuer thou shalt bestow vpon the
poore, MAT. 25. Furthermore hee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
thy riches, if thou hast the poore in
estimation. There are manye kindes of
poore men, but those are especially to
be helped: whoe do willingly gette by
their labour thinges necessary for them
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8809:80"/>
vnlesse great hardnes of dearth doth
hinder them. This example doth teache
vs how we must giue. He gaue RVTH
thinges necessary, not being desired, nor
commaunded, but willinglye and with
pleasure. For the Lord requireth a cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
giuer:
he doth geue liberallie, for she
being sufficed, she reserued some for her
mother in-law: he might haue giuen her
some certaine measure of corne. But he
thinketh it shuld be more acceptable to
her, if she might gather it by her own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
therefore hee commaundeth hys
haruest folkes to leaue her some part as
they reaped and gathered. By the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this notable man, we also ought
sometime to giue to poore labourers,
more than is due to them by couenant:
and to doe good to them that want al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

It is sayd in the latter ende of the chap.
that she did also gleane in the wheate

                  <p>It is to be noted, that the holy Ghost

dilligence doth preuaile muche in any
businesse. A drop by often falling doth
break or make hollow most hard stones.
They who are diligent and carefull in
theyr work, do quickly heape vp a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of necessary thinges. But wee must
pray to God, that hee will blesse our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
for vnlesse his blessing be with
vs, all our labors are in vayn which we
doe. S. IAMES sayth in his 4. chap. ye
fight and warre (a metaphore taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
warres) he speaketh of contentions and
brawles, wherewith they do greeue one
another) and get nothing, because ye
aske not, ye aske and receaue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ye aske amisse, that ye might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it on your lustes. Some complaine
that they cannot nourish themselues by
their artes, in the meane season they doe
not diminishe their lustes: they despise
God, not acknowledging him to be the
author of good thinges. SALOMON in
hys prouerbes sayth the dilligent haue
sufficient, &amp; the slougthful are famished.
PROU. 14. verse. 23. In all labour there is
aboundance: but the talke of the lippes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8809:83"/>
bringeth onely wante. 19. vers. 24. The
slougthfull hideth his hand in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and will not put it to his mouthe
againe, that is, he shall not haue to eate.
20. verse. 4. The slougthfull will not
plow, because of winter, therefore shall
he begge in the sommer, but haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And the 13. verse, loue not sleepe,
least thou come vnto pouertie: open thy
eyes and thou shalt bee satisfied with
bread. 21. verse. 25. The desire of the
slougthfull slayeth him: for his handes
refuse to worke. If God doth sometime
afflict great labouring men with famine,
he doth it for certaine causes, which we
haue in other places made mention of.</p>
                  <p>It is added, that RVTH shewed her
mother in law those thinges which shee
had gleaned, also that she brought forth
and gaue her, that which she had left of
her fulnes. It appeareth that RVTH was
notably affected towardes her mother
in-law, for that she might make her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
she did not onely shew her mother
in-law part of it, &amp; deuour the other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelie,
but she sheweth her all which she
<pb facs="tcp:8809:84"/>
had gleaned that day, and brought her
meate also out of her bag, scrippe or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
which was left. Thou shalt easily
finde daughters in-law, which will geue
nothinge to their mothers in-law, yea
who will rather cast meat to the dogs,
or els eat more then will do them good,
then bring any thing to their mothers
in-law.</p>
                  <p>Let children learne to feede and to
chearishe their aged parentes. For the
word of honoring doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend this
amongest others, as the Lord himselfe
interpreteth it MATH. 15. wher he doth
reprooue the PHARISIES and SCRIBES
because they do make voyde the law of
God through their traditions. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
also do thinke it meete, that we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue nourished vs. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sonnes &amp; daughters do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine,
that pouertie doth hinder them that
they cannot performe that duety: but if
they should spend much at the wine, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sumptuous apparell, and such other
vayn things, they would make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their pouertie. There are fewe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8809:84"/>
which haue regard of their parentes stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in age, as becommeth them. In the
history of the gospell it is oftentimes
read, that parentes entreated the Lorde
for their children, that they might bee
deliuered from diseases, but there is no
such thinge recorded of children. The
most part would wish them dead, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be poore or riche. If their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
be poore they are to be nourished
of them, and so they are a burden to
them, if they be riche they watch as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous
birds do for carcases. There are
also some who doe spoyle their parents
of whome (it is sayd) PROV. 28. verse.
24. He that robbeth his father and hys
mother, is the companion of a man that
destroyeth.</p>
                  <p>IOSEPHVS writeth that NAOMIE
brought forth some peeces of meate,
which her neighbours had brought her,
and the which she had kept for RVTH.
For the wordes in the text may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
both manner of waies: We do
therefore gather by this, how deare the
daughter in-law was vnto her mother
<pb facs="tcp:8809:85"/>
in-law, because she did not spend all, but
kept some for her that was abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; at la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
But it rather seemeth to agree, to
be vnderstoode of RVTH.</p>
                  <p>NAOMIE asked her daughter in-law,
where she had gleaned, shee aunswered
freely, and she shewed the name of the
man in whose field she was. Shee doth
teache parentes to haue a care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their children: peraduenture she
thought that it could not be, that shee
should gleane so much by her owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in so short a time. If children doe
bring anie thing home, which they say
was giuen them, or that they found it,
let parentes diligently examine them,
for they come by these degrees to theft.
Let them take an accompt of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children,
where they haue bene, with
whome, what they did, if any thing be
suspicious in them, let them examine
them, if they be found in a lye, let them
chasten them: let them also prayse them
which doe well, and so stirre them vp to
the desire of vertue. Let maisters do the
same, and others to whome the care and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8809:85"/>
charge of the yonger sort is committed.
Neyther let them only take an accompt
of the yonger sort, but also diligently of
the elders. I doe not giue counsell that
ye shutt in youthes at home: but in the
meane season, let them haue a care that
if they goe abroad with leaue, that they
ioyne themselues with good companie,
by whose conuersation they may be the
better. RVTH doth willingly giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to her mother in-law, shee doth
not aunswere her crookedly: shee doth
tel orderly what befel to her in the field.
Let children doe the like to theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,
and those that are set ouer them,
and let them gouern themselues so, that
they may without feare, make report of
those thinges which they haue done.</p>
                  <p>Before her mother in lawe heard the
name of BOAZ, shee sayd, blessed be hee
that hath knowne thee. The old transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

word of knowing is diuersly vnderstood
in the holy scriptures. Pro. 12. ver. 10. the

<pb facs="tcp:8809:86"/>
                     <hi>Iada</hi> and our wrirer doth vse Nakar)
that is, hee hath a care and a regard
of his cattell, he doth giue them prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
hee doth graunt them rest, or hee
hath mercy on his cattle: but the tender

who hath known thee, that is, who hath

because he had pitie on her. Truely God

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He talke which NAOMIE had
with RVTH, is partly pleasant,
and partly profitable: for it
contayneth manye thinges
which make not a little, both for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and comfort. Before NAOMIE
vnderstoode in whose fielde RVTH had
gleaned, shee sayth, blessed be hee who
hath knowne thee. And after shee had
heard his name, she vttered this blessing
in many wordes. Blessed be hee of the
Lorde: that is the Lorde rewarde hym
both in this world, and in the world to
come, or he is blessed that is, he is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Lorde, his grace is with him.
The blessing of the Lord doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the goods as well temporall as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall:
Hee that doth blesse another,
praieth that God would take him to his
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (through the MESSIAS in whom
we are blessed) that he would release his
sinnes, that hee would defend him, and
<pb facs="tcp:8809:87"/>
giue him successe in all his affayres, and
keepe him from all euill. She doth shew
the cause, for he ceaseth not to do good
to the liuing and to the dead, that is hee
ceaseth not to loue them and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
vnto them. But how he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,
to the dead, I will shew you by
and by. She doth add that BOAZ (which
RVTH did not knowe) was their
nigh kinsman <hi>Goel</hi> signifieth a reuenger
and a kinsman, who ought by lawe to
defend their bloud, and seek the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of hym who hath hurt them.</p>
                  <p>We doe gather out of these wordes,
what is the duetie of those that bee of
our kindred and affinitie, and of friends,
namely, that they loue mutually togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that they striue in giuing bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
amongest themselues (which are
not of one kinde) also that the riche doe
helpe the poore. BOAZ did prosecute his
friends (with loue) both dead and a liue,
and was beneficial vnto them. How did
he good to the dead? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as long as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMELECH
and hys sonnes were aliue
he was beneficiall vnto them, and after
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8809:87"/>
theyr deathes for their remembraunce
he did gratifie theyr widowes in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matters as he could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hee would
haue done the same to theyr children, if
they had anie, and this is to shewe pitie
or mercie towardes the dead. NAOMIE
vsed this phrase before. Truely if the
dead shoulde knowe what thinges are
done vppon the earth, they woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
at these dueties, not that thou
shouldest endeuoure to place them in
the place of Gods, and appoynt holye
daies for them, &amp; make praiers to them.
&amp;c. Manye haue little care of the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and children of their dead friends,
or if they do any thing once or twise for
their sakes, afterwardes they doe leaue
to be mercifull, that is, they doe cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the care of them, and send them to
others: hee was constant in friendship.
For true friends do not turne with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
PROV. 17. 17. A friend loueth at al
times, we haue some examples of such
friendes in the scriptures. The 2. SAM. 9
chaprer. DAVID hauing obtained the
whole kingdome, did aske if any remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:8809:88"/>
aliue of the family of SAVLE, with
whome he might deale mercifully for
Ionathans sake, that is, that he might be
beneficiall vnto him: and when MEPHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOSHETH
the sonne of IONATHAN was
brought vnto him, hee gaue him the
landes and the goodes of his father, and
although hee was lame and one cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
yet he setteth him at his table. It is
sayd commonly, that the dead do lacke
friendes, but DAVID d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th account him
as his sonne, for the remembraunce of
his father. Therefore God doth also
stirre vp to him faythfull friends: for in
the conspiracie of ABSOLON, CHVSAI,
ITHAI and others followed DAVID, and
not his sonn, although they did see him
florishe. Those friends which forsake vs
in aduersitie, are not true friendes, but
maye bee compared vnto those birdes
which flie away in the winter, comming
and returning againe in sommer. A sure
friend is tried in doubtfull matters. It is
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon at this day, that men which are
greate friends do striue amongest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
&amp; for light causes: friends are not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8809:88"/>
to be despised &amp; cast away, how poore
soeuer they be, for oftentimes they may
helpe much the riche and mightie with
their helpe, as in conspiracies, warres,
burnings, shipwrackes, diseases, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euils both publick and priuate. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
it is not only required of kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and friends, that they haue a regard
of the fatherlesse and wyddowes, but
of others whosoeuer they be. Therefore
howe much doe they offend, whoe for
small causes doe wrong to the children
and widdowes of them that are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and when they could not hurt their
parents and husbands, they seeke to bee
reuenged of these?</p>
                  <p>That which NAOMIE reporteth of
BOAZ, we may say more rightly of God,
that hee doth not forsake them whiche
trust in him, whether they be dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue:
Then breaking forth into heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayses, we must say, blessed be God
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The other is howe wee must behaue
our selues towardes them, who haue
bene beneficiall vnto VS. NAOMIE ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
<pb facs="tcp:8809:89"/>
the benefits bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and sheweth her selfe thankefull
to BOAZ and RVTH, she doth declare
this benefite both in wordes and deeds.
See doth blesse BOHAZ, not with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
blessing, or with an inchauntment
but with a heauenly blessing. This wee
must immitate to pray for good things
through Christe for our benefactoures.
There are many poore folkes who haue
receiued a long time many and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites,
either of some of their kinsfolks
or others, if they doe once suffer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse,
they fret, they are angry, and they
do curse them: if any man bestow vpon
them as much as they can, they yet look
for greater thinges of him, (if they be
not satisfied, they by and by wax angry.
But we ought not onely to geue thanks
in words to them) who haue bene bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
vnto vs, and pray to the Lord for
them, but to shew our selues thankful in
deede. That NAOMIE afterwardes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
a husband for RVTH, wee shall
heare in his place. Thirdly, wee gather
out of this place, that the benefites doe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8809:89"/>
not perish which wee bestowe on our
neighboures. For as NAOMIE praied to
God for a rewarde for BOHAZ her bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
he being ignorant of it: so there
shalbe some in all ages, who will prayse
and take acceptably those things, which
are bestowed on them, and will to God
in their prayers, commend the health of
them whose liberalitie they haue tryed:
nay, if they do not their duetie, yet the
worke it selfe if it proceede from fayth,
doth after a sort crie vnto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>IOB. 31. chap. purginge him selfe from
most heynous crimes, which were layd
agaynst him by his friendes, namelye
hipocrisie &amp; vngodlines, making a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his whole life beforespent, saieth
amongest other thinges: let these or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges befall on mee, vnlesse their
sides do blesse me, that are hott with the
fleeces of my sheepe. Hee doth bring
in by Prosopop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ia the sides made whot
by him that they did pray for him: that
is, that such a benefite should come into
remembrance vnto the Lord, although
hee was vnthankefull who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> receiued it.
<pb facs="tcp:8809:90"/>
This ought to stir vs vp to liberalytie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the poore. If thou doest compare
that which BOAZ gaue to these widows
with his wealth, it is not so glorious &amp;
great: yet it was very profitable to them,
and God doth greatly recompence it.
Our sauiour sayth in the Gospell the 10
chap. of MATT. Who soeuer shall geue
to one of these little ones to drink a cup
of colde water onely, in the name of a
disciple, verily I say vnto you, hee shall
not loose his reward.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly wee haue also a forme of
blessing: what thinges, of whome, and
how we ought to pray for the good of
our benefactors, for the benefits which
they haue bestowed on vs and ours.
The worde blessing doth comprehend
the goodes both temporall and eternal,
as wee haue sayd aboue. These good
thinges NAOMIE prayed for her kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
of the Lord, and she knoweth that
he can shew mercy to whome hee will,
and that he marketh and gouerneth our
wordes and deeds, as wel good as euil.
But those prayers and blessinges are not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8809:90"/>
in vaine, otherwise the sainctes woulde
not haue vsed them, neyther the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
woulde teache vs to vse them.
As prayers are not vnprofitable: so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are those wishes which are nothing
els then certayne kindes of prayers.</p>
                  <p>RVTH going forward to commend the
courteousnes of BOAZ doth say, that he
commaunded her further, that she shuld
accompanie his seruauntes, vntill they
had made an end of haruest. But he said
that she should go forth with his maids.
There is no diuersitie in these wordes,
for the seruauntes and the maydes went
into the field together. For the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doe oftentimes note that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which should be set before, some
say that he sayd, Ioyne thy selfe with my
seruauntes, in ieste to try her: Namely
that she might get her a husband. NAO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIE
aunswered: It is good, it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
thing, it doth please me my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that thou doest goe with his may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
She doth not perswade her to go
into another field the next day: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she did vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the good
<pb facs="tcp:8809:91"/>
wils of friendes are not to be abused:
yet she doth bid her to returne into the
ground of BOAZ: because he was theyr
kinsman, shee doth thinke that hee will
haue more care of her honestie, then
straungers and forrainers, for she might
easily come amongest some, who would
not defend her, if she were in daunger.
The olde translation hath, it is better to
goe with his maydes. The cause is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they meete thee not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
translateth it, least they enforce
thee. This worde <hi>Phaga</hi> signifieth to
withstand, to resiste to meete, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
commeth <hi>paegara</hi> an euill chaunce or
successe, so also to aske, to pray, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force.
If thou shouldst gleane in another
field, some body may withstand thee,
and say that other poore haue licence
to glean there: and some wanton yong
men may force thee, as it sometime co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to passe in the haruest: If thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretest
it to aske, per aduenture this is
the meaning, that some body might
prouoke thee to whordom. It is sayd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
she may be chast to whom no man
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8809:91"/>
moueth the question. There are some
which will take anie payns to defile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and virgins: but at length they are
punished for their vnpuritie. For theyr
children and wiues are often-times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
of others, by the iust punishment
of GOD, or they are so kindled
with ielousie towards theyr wiues, so
that they are miserably tormented both
day and night. Or at least RVTH might
haue bene suspected of vngodlines.</p>
                  <p>Let olde women, by the example of
NAOMIE, rightly teach the yonger, and
stirre them vp by prayse to the studye of
vertue, and commaund them to tarry at
home, and shunne all causes of often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
It is commonly sayd that the flaxe
must be taken from the fire least it be
burnt. NAOMIE had rather her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in-law should stay at home: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
necessitie droue her to runne into
the fieldes, shee commaundeth her to
ioyne her selfe in companie with mayds
not with men. Maidens cannot alwaies
stay at home, they are constrayned
sometimes to goe to markets, sometyme

to take long iournies, but they are to be
exhorted, that they doe not this alone,
but that they ioine themselues with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
companie in their way: let them
shunne talke with wanton young men,
or drunkardes or suspicious places: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in the night, let them keepe
themselues at home: And let them not
onely flee from euill, but also from the
outward appearance of euill. For if they
fall into the suspition of whoredome or
adultery, they cannot easily clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
If they be accused of theft, the
theefe being taken, their innocency is
shewed to all men: but this is farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
S. PAVLE in the 2. chap. to TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS.
The elder women likewise (as hath
bene spoken before of olde men) that
they be in such behauiour, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
holinesse, not false accusers, not
geuen to much wine, but teachers of
honest thinges: that they may instruct
the yonge women to be sober minded
that they loue their husbands, that they
loue their children: that they be discreet
chaste, keeping at home, good and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8809:92"/>
vnto their husbandes, that the word
of God be not euill spoken of. Hee saith
it is not inough for olde women to liue
well, but he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth them to frame
the youngers to vpright life both by
wordes, &amp; also by the example of theyr
lyfe. There are some which talke with
men, resort to daunces and banquettes,
saying that by this meanes they may get
themselues husbands, but this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
way, and not allowed of honest
and godly men.</p>
                  <p>RVTH regarding her chastity doth ioin
her self to the maidens, teaching daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by her example, to obey the good
counsels of their parentes: which many
doe not willingly, but because they are
hott, and are carried away with their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
they had rather hearken to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers:
afterwardes falling into manie
troubles, they repent, and doe bewayle
their lotte too late. But those which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselues to be gouerned of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they doe finde plentifull fruites
of theyr obedience. Shee kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
with them, vntill haruest was
<pb facs="tcp:8809:93"/>
done. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance at one work is praise
worthy, and that a man may become
constant, it auaileth muche in young
yeares to bee accustomed to laboures.
They which shift from one labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,

which NAOMIE gaue vnto

to be her husbande: in the other is sette
downe, how RVTH obeyed her mother

she was accepted of BOHAZ and sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
in the third, how she returning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

thinges orderly which befell vnto her.
Many things are contained in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which pertayn to making of marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
in which the greatest pointes of our
happynes or vnhappines in this life are
contayned.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the councell of NAO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIE,
first shee did promise RVTH her
helpe, that she would prouide for her a
good marriage. I seeke rest (sayth shee)
for thee, for so shee doth call marriage.
She doth adde, that it may be well with
thee: the meaning is: I will ioyne thee
with a good and a meet husbande, that
thou mayest know where thou shalt tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
and that thou mayest hereafter gett
thy liuing without so great labour. She
doth not promise her an idle life aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with delightes, shee doth not say
that she shalbe without all troubles, of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8809:94"/>
which this worlde is full, to the mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the whiche the Lorde hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
marryage. GEN. 2. The Lord
sayth it is not good for man to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
let vs make him a helpe. God will
that it be wel with them, and that they
haue rest. Yet many through their own
faultes do procure themselues great tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as when they do norish suspicious
ielousies &amp;c. Also marriage hath trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to it, especialy wher there
be many childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet they haue mo tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
who dispising this institutution of
God, doe wallow in whoredomes and
addulteries. NAOMIE doth not aduife
her that she should liue a sole life. For it
was better, that a straunge widdowe
should marry with some one of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God. Heere is an example of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
propounded to vs in NAOMIE. In
the first chapter she doth wish for a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
marriage for both her daughters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,
now that occasion is offred, shee
omitteth nothing, that shee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
a good husband for her, who had
deserued so well of her. There are some
<pb facs="tcp:8809:95"/>
which will be marueilous liberall onely
in promises, but they doe nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
oftentimes when they may bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
theyr friendes without troubling
themselues, they wil not doe it, but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe it, they will enuy them.</p>
                  <p>Next let parentes learne, to prouide
husbandes for theyr daughters, and
wiues for their sonnes, for this care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to them. Children ought not
in this matter to follow theyr own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
affections, but to vse the counsell of
their parentes. Let not parentes tiranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
constraine theyr children to many
against theyr will. NAOMIE doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with RVTH her daughter in-law of
marriage. Marriages to which children
are vnwillingly driuen, haue seldome
happie endes.</p>
                  <p>The maner is after set downe, howe
NAOMIE procured this marriage: shee
doth giue her preceptes, she doth teach
her, what she shall do, &amp; what she should
auoid: first she biddeth her to wash away
her sweate &amp; spots least she should smel
ill. And those washinges were common
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8809:95"/>
amongst those nations, and of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
not vnlawfull. Next she doth bid her to
annoint her selfe: the which was also v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
amongst the Estern people, as other
histories, aswell the Euangelical history
doth witnesse. Thirdly she doth bid her
to put on her apparell, to witt the best
she had. Fourthly to goe into the floore
and not suffer her self to be seen, before
that BOAZ had eaten and drunken. The
labourers seeme to haue better cheare
at the latter ende of haruest as at sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shearing.
We doe make a feast in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of haruest and vintage: so we do
giue more meate and drink to threshers
of corne in the barne and winnowers.
She doth commaund her to marke hys
bed, or the place where he layeth hym
downe, and remouing the couerlit from
his feete should lye downe by stealth at
his feete, and signifie vnto him what
must be done, according to the lawe of
raysing vppe children to the brother or
kinsman deceased. For he sayd after that
there was one of nearer kindred, with
whome hee would first conferre about
<pb facs="tcp:8809:96"/>
this matter. The law which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that the brother or kinsman shuld
marry the wife of the brother of kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
departed without a child, doth not
expresse by what way or meanes it shuld
be done, nor driueth any man vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to marriage. Therefore NAOMII
did vse these deuises, that she might win
BOAZ the easier: and might obtayne of
him, that he should doe, that which the
lawe commaunded him to doe of hys
owne accord and free will. For cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in women doth please men wel: and
husbandes do oftentimes abhorre thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
wiues for sluttishe apparell. Therefore
women doe combe and decke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
The night also a man being alone
with a woman alone, doth make manie
marriages. Furthermore beyng well
drunke they do many things willingly,
which if they had bin sober they would
not haue done. LOT committed incest
with hys daughters 2. SAM. 11. CAP. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID
by drunkennes sought to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the constancie of VRIAH and to
enforce him to lye with his wife. OVI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sayth. Night loue and wine do nothing
moderately, the night is without shame
and loue is without feare.</p>
                  <p>It was meete that RVTH should bee
marryed to BOHAZ, but there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wayes and meanes, by the whiche
shee might haue dealt with him about
this mariage, they myght haue brought
BOHAZ in minde of the law by some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
but peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they thought
it to be no matter, when they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that it was his duty according to
the law, to raise vp seede to the kinsman
deceased. But least anye man should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
this example and make marriages
in degrees forbidden, or defend baudry,
and excuse their faults by other errours
and faults of the saints, it is to be known
that ther is mention made, of four kinds
of examples of holye men in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>First certain deeds are described &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to vs to folow, as fayth in ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM,
patience in IOBE, chastity in IO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEPH,
&amp;c. the ardent prayers of DAVID
&amp; others: all the holy scriptures are ful of
<pb facs="tcp:8809:97"/>
examples of vertue worthy to be had in
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. How many doth the holy
ghost propose vnto vs in this litle booke
in NAOMIE RVTH and BOHAZ. As gold
smithes, paynters and others do set arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
works, before their schollers which
they should follow: so God doth put
before vs the examples of Godly men,
that hauing them alwayes in our sight,
we may immitate them in our life.</p>
                  <p>Next the deedes of the Saynts are
contayned in the holy scriptures which
are wicked, as the incest of LOT, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
of DAVID, the disobedience of
IONAS, the pride of the apostles, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of PETER, the vnbeleeuing of THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS,
&amp; many other. These are not reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the holy ghost to the end that we
should folow them, but we may see that
though they be saynts, to be yet corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their nature: &amp; in that they did ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell
in so many rare vertues, that was by
the goodnesse of God. These thinges
should make vs beware, for if such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
men haue fallen, what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
vs, when we are not to be compared
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8809:97"/>
with them? Next according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
of the Apostle: who so doth
thinke he doth stand, let hym beware
least he fall. And as they went not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in wickednesse but repented: so
let vs also repent, that God may forgiue
vs our sinnes and punishmentes due for
sins: also let vs receiue sinners which do
repent truely. But true repentance doth
acknowledge the heynousnes of sinne,
embraceth by fayth the mercy of God
proposed in his sonne, and doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
abstayne from sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the sainctes in the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did certaine thinges well, whiche
at this day were most wicked to follow.
They did circumcise their children at
the eight day, whiche is not at this day,
lawfull: because baptisme is in the place
of circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They did offer diuers sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to God, which at this day haue
no place. A brother ought to marry the
widdow of another brother, &amp; rayse vp
seed to him, which at this day were a sin
worthy of death. The same may be said
also of other ceremoniall lawes whiche
<pb facs="tcp:8809:98"/>
are taken away by Christ, the same also
may be sayd of some part of the iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles.
These therefore are not to bee
drawne into example.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there are some singuler
deedes, as that ABRAHAM against that
generall law: <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> would haue
slayne and offered his sonne ISAAKE:
That the Israelites did not restore, the
golden and siluer pottes and apparell
which they had borrowed of the Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:
we must not follow these thinges
we haue no warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>'t to do the same. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
(1. SAM. 5.) IONATHAN and his armor
bearer, in an vnfit place set on the power
of the Philistines, was done notably &amp;
heroycally, not proceeding from pride,
or couetousnes, but driuen vnto it by
the holy ghost: he looked vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and glory of God, and the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of his countrey. If any body bee
not led by the like spirite, and yet would
take in hand the like matter, they may be
accompted rashe. I omitte other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
by these promises wee may iudge
more rightly of the deeds of NAOMIE
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8809:98"/>
and RVTH. Therefore let vs say that this
is a peculiar fact, and we must not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it: Or those women were holy and
chast, yet they did offend in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
neither are those thinges recited in
the scriptures that wee should followe
them, but eschew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although the
successe was happy, yet it was not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the carefulnes of NAOMIE, but
rather to Gods mercy. Saynt PAVLE in
the first epistle to the THESSAL. 5. doth
bid vs to abstaine from the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce
of euil. But she is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to do that, which hath the outward
appearaunce of euill. NAOMIE vseth
those artes whereby baudes doe entise
young women to wickednes, for they do
vse baths, sweet oyntments, and fine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
&amp;c. Peraduenture the successe
would haue bene bad inough, if she had
not met with a godly man. If she could
not haue bene hid, but haue bene spied
of others, who would not haue thought
but that she came either for whordome
or theft? Furthermore who would haue
denied but that NAOMIE as much as
<pb facs="tcp:8809:99"/>
lay in her, cast her daughter in-law into
the danger of whordome: she which did
before please BOAZ might now displease
him by this deed: or if hee had bene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with wine might haue dealtwith
her, and that he might afterwards haue
put her away as a harlot. It is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to this, that by the law she was not
due to BOAZ, but to a nearer kinsman:
who vnlesse he had giuen ouer his right,
she had done him an iniurie. I wil speake
nothing of this, that men ought to woe
their wiues, and not wiues husbandes.
And although BOAZ did afterward
prayse it, yet it is not to be supposed that
he did allowe of all the circumstances.
Therefore no man ought to abuse the
example of these poore women, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus, if it were lawful for them, it is
lawfull for vs. For the falles of the saints
ought to make vs more warie, and not
to allure vs to sinne.</p>
                  <p>There are olde women, who when
they hope that by this meanes, they can
make marriages betweene young men
and virgins, they call them to night ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettes,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8809:99"/>
talkes, and daunces, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
exhort them, that they should goe
to bed together. There are also virgins
which doe entise youthes diuers wayes
to lye with them, saying that they did it
of a good purpose, namely, that they
might get a lawfull marriage: but marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
are not to be made by this meanes,
we must hold on a right course, parents
&amp; kinsfolkes are to be aduised with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

had a sorrowfull &amp; lamentable end?</p>
                  <p>And those youthes are to be reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which, that they may get their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of some women, doe promise them
marriage, and being defiled they driue
them away reprochfully as wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>res, and
denie that euer they did make mention
of marriage. Honest youths wil not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
them which haue bene defiled by
them, yea they suspect that they haue
geuen theyr bodies to be abused before
of others, or wil doe it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But what shal we iudge of them, who
being taken, doe geue as a cloke to their
<pb facs="tcp:8809:100"/>
whoredome the fauourable name of
mariage, when as they made no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it before? or what shall wee iudge of
those baudes men or women, who for
gaine doe match those persons together
whome they ought not?</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt also obserue by the way,
that she sayth that BOAZ winnowed the
floore of barly, that is the barly that was
in the floore. The Septuagintes haue
<hi>Licman</hi> that is to winnow, <hi>Licmos</hi> a fanne
or a vanne. It is added in the night. The
Chalde interpreter sayth, at the night
winde: peraduenture they coulde not
winnow it in the day for the heat. We
reade also of other holy fathers as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRAHAH,
ISAAKE, IACOB and GEDION:
so also of the Romaine Senators and
Captaynes that they did apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to husbandry, not to idlenesse,
drunkennesse, or surfeiting. BOAZ had
many which he might haue committed
this labour vnto, but hee had rather doe
it himselfe, partly for that by the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his body, hee might be the more
healthy, partly least he yeelding to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8809:100"/>
should giue place to euill tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
partly that he might stirre vpp his

those thinges which they commaund

43. The scripture sayth of IOSEPH, and

God doth command to cast away hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines

his feastes with ioy: Vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of SALOMON the Israelites came
togither in great numbers, eating drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and reioysing. The which is to bee
noted for certaine Anabaptistes and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
which do condemne pleasures
and ioyes which are permitted. GOD
doth giue vs wine, bread, flesh, fish, and
other thinges which wee are to vse for

if they who labour hard doe reioice

                  <p>That BOAZ lay all night in the floore
and slept by the heape of corne: he did
so, eyther that hee might betimes in the
morning returne to his labour, or that
he might watch the corne, least theeues
should carry it away. It seemeth that the
floers or the barnes were in the fieldes
and not so fully fensed, but that euerie
bodie might come in. VARRO. lib. 1. cap.
51. wryteth that the flooer ought to
bee in the fielde, in a higher place so
that the wind might blow thorow, and
especially round, and in the middle a
litle a slope that if it doe rayn, the water
may not stay. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He doth teache housholders, by hys

theyr owne negligence that is stolne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them which they haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great
labour. In the deepe of the night BOAZ
tourned himselfe from one side to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or bowed himself. <hi>laphath</hi> signifieth
<pb facs="tcp:8809:103"/>
to bow, to apprehend, to lye shrunk vp
together: some expound it to turn from
one side to an other. When he did turn
himselfe, and thrust his feet to the foot
of the bed, hee vnderstoode that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
laye there, and being afrayd, hee
boweth himselfe and by feeling (to witt
by the apparel) hee found it to bee
a woman, therefore hee asked who shee
was? It was no maruell that hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd,
hee might haue suspected some
euil spirit which had taken on it a body,
had lain at his feet. Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria
in the 2. booke chap. 9. writeth of a
certaine spirit, that as it seemed puttyng
away the bedd clothes, lay downe in a
bedd where a good man lay, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere as if it would haue embraced
him: and the other when he was nowe
almost dead for feare, shranke to the side
of the bedd, and when it came neerer he
droue it away &amp;c. Also looke in the 19.

                  <p>And it is not to be doubted but that
BOAZ being amased with a sodayn feare
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8809:103"/>
commended himselfe vnto the Lorde:
for godly men were woont to do so in
those soddaine terrours, when wicked
shapes and illusions of shaddowes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

                  <p>RVTH aunswered modestly that shee
was his handmaid and desired him, that
hee woulde couer her with the skirt of
hys garment: or throwe his winge ouer
her. <hi>Chanaph</hi> signifieth a wing, or a skirt
of a garment, also an end and a corner.
Lira noteth that the man contracting
marriage in those dayes layd his winge,
or the nethermost skirte of his garment
on the woman: So the meaning is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth
me to thee: and marry me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the lawe of a kinseman, or that

                  <p>She doth shew the cause, wherefore
hee ought to take her into his defence:

he saith this, that she had receiued great
giftes of God, and was acceptable vnto
him. That kinde of salutation is other
where extant. 1. SAM. 15. SAVLE meeting
SAMVEL saluting him, sayed: Blessed be

LVK. 1. chapter. The Aungell GABRIEL

women, that is, thou art in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with God: it is a great thing to be
in fauor with a prince, much more with
God. Thou art that happie and blessed
woman, whiche God chose out of all
womenkinde, that the messias might be
borne of thee: for vnder the name of
blessing, the Hebrues do vnderstand all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8809:105"/>
kinde of happinesse. Hee sayth that
her last pietie was greater then the first.
The first pietie or bountifulnesse was,
that shee did reuerence her husbande,
when he was aliue, and that shee loued
him, and also shee did not forsake her
mother in-law, her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d being dead.
Her latter pietie was, that shee, being at
libertie from her husband, did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
lust, she did not seek for yong men,
were they rich or poor, but she did keep
her selfe safe vnto her husbandes kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that shee might haue seede accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the law, and rayse vp the name
of the dead to their posterity. She might
haue had a young husband, eyther in
her owne country, or among the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:
but shee had rather marry an olde
man, than doe against the law. Notable
deedes are to be praysed, both in men
and women. BOAZ did not alow the
maner which shee vsed in seeking a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or at the least, he could not haue
praysed it in any other, which had not
the like cause. For that which shee did,
had an outward apeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of euil, but he
<pb facs="tcp:8809:106"/>
doth not iudge according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearaunce of this worke, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to RVTHES intent and purpose.
He thought that that which she did was
not of lightnes and lust, but at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of her mother in law, that
there might be seede raysed vppe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the law to the former husband.
For he doth consider that she hath liued
hitherto well, and so behaued her selfe
toward her mother in-law, that she was
worthie of a notable husband.</p>
                  <p>And because BOAZ did so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
iudge of that deede which had
an outward appearance of euill, &amp; doth
take it in good part, truely, we ought not
to interprete in the worst parte those
thinges, which haue the appearaunce of
good, and are in their own nature good
&amp; right: There are some who take in the
worsepart, the words &amp; deeds of others,
through a certain corruption of nature,
being led by no probable reason. Sainct
PAVLE in the 1. to the COR. 13. chap.
sayth, loue doth not thinke euill, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
al things, it hopeth for al things.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8809:106"/>
Wordes and deedes whiche are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are to be well interpreted, but not
the euill. Looke howe muche the worse
a man is, so much the more suspitious is
he. It is commonly sayd, he that is euill
thinketh euill, and in this matter they
doe follow the nature of the deuill. But
who so will not be suspected of euill,
must keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues from these things,
which make men to be suspected of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Numb: 32. chap. MOSES suspected
the two tribes and an halfe, begging the
land beyond Iordaine, which was verie
fertill, that they woulde forsake theyr
brethren in daungers. But after they had
declared theyr purpose, they took away
that euill suspition out of his mind, and
out of the minds of the other Israelites:
2. SAM. 10. chap. DAVID sendeth Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
to the king of the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
to comfort him after the death of
his father, but the king harkening vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
flatterers, suspected them of treason,
whereof most cruell warre arose. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must not harken vnto backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and flatterers, who doe put euill
<pb facs="tcp:8809:107"/>
suspitions into mens mindes. Also in
matters of religion, all thinges are to be
set foorth openly and plainly, least gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
suspitions arise in the minds of the
simple. For there are some, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they vnderstand the state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet they doe speake doubtfully
of many pointes of religion, least great
men shoulde be offended with them.
And the example of RVTH doth teache
vs, that we bee not ledde by our owne
affections, or doe that which is pleasant
to the flesh, neglecting the law of God.
RVTH coulde haue had a young hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but she married an old man, least
she should haue violated the lawe of the
Lord. There are widowes whiche may
easily haue riche husbandes, but either
they will not haue Idolaters, or they
will not forsake their fatherlesse childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Also there are men with whome riche
wiues would marry, if they would goe
out of those places wherein pure religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is embraced, into such places where
there is no mention made of it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
they do fauour theyr children, least
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8809:107"/>
that if they marry wiues suche as they
would, it shoulde be worse with them,
the which, the children ought to bee
thankefull for.</p>
                  <p>BOAZ comforteth RVTH whome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
he calleth louingly daughter, least
that she should be afrayd of him, but be
of good comfort. Peraduenture she fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
least shee should be accompted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamefast,
or, that hee, being not well
in temper, shoulde force her to commit
whoredome, or els be repulsed. He doth
add, that he would doe that which she
required, that is, he is ready to mary her,
for it is knowne to all the Citie that she
is a vertuous woman, worde by word it
is, euery gate knoweth, that is all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
eyther because that iudgement was
executed in the gate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the gate by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedoche
is put for the whole Citie.</p>
                  <p>First of al in contracting matrimonie,
thou must looke that the modest beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
and honesty of the woman, which
thou art about to marry, be knowne to
all men. But in our times, the first que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is of wealth, and the last of maners,
<pb facs="tcp:8809:108"/>
it is a good thing if a woman be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
if it be knowne to all the citizens
that she behaued her selfe well from her
youth: it is very filthie on the contrarie
parte, if it bee knowne to bleare-eyd-men
and to barbers, that she hath bene
a woman desiled and vnshamefast.</p>
                  <p>He addeth a condition, vpon which
condition hee will marry her. I doe not
denie, sayth hee, that I am thy kinsman
(some doe thinke that BOAZ was ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MELECHES
brother sonne) but there
is one of nearer affinitie to thee. I will
conferre with this man of this matter, if
he wil doe according to the law of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie,
and marry thee, it is well,
but if not, I wil marry thee, according to
the law of kindred. He had rather marry
her by and by, but he would not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the right of his kinsma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If he would
haue married her, BOAZ had done hym
an iniurie, if he had married her, before
he had aduised with his kinsman. The
same reason is also to be hadde in other
matters. Iustice is that vertue, whiche
doth giue so euery man, his owne. We
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8809:108"/>
ought to be so farre from withholding
those thinges which are another mans,
without his consent, that wee ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his right from others. And
in that hee doth not by and by, bid her
come to him, and promise her mariage,
hee doth admonishe them which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to marry, not to make too muche
hast, or runne headlong by followyng
theyr owne affections. For we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
least any impedimentes be found.
For there are some things which do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

BOAZ first, concluded the matter with
<pb facs="tcp:8809:109"/>
his kinsman. We vse in other contractes
to consider of all things thorowly, there
is more neede of great care in marriage.
Also we must beware in contractes, that
we doe not anie thing deceitfully. And
it is good, after marriage is contracted
not to delai the mater ouer long, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dangers which may arise of the same,
but to confirme it openly. He affirmeth
by an othe, that he will marry her, if the
other refuse it. It is also read of other
Sainctes, that oftentimes being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
they vsed othes in weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
This is to be noted against them,
which doe altogether reiect an othe. He
sweareth, that hee might put her out of
doubt. But vnlesse there were a greater
religion of swearing in the old time, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is nowe, truely hee could not haue put
her out of doubt. For sometime euen
great Princes doe deceiue others tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
swearing, and oppresse them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be aware. That which BOAZ
promised he thorowly performed.</p>
                  <p>He commaunded her to sleepe vntill
morning: he would not haue her in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8809:109"/>
night to wander in the streetes: It is the
part of women in the night time to stay
at home, for many dangers which may
befall them. Also it is very profitable for
youths, to be kept at home in the night,
for the night doth yeelde many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of great euils. Let them spend their
time at home in reading, or other honest
exercises.</p>

with silence, the dronkennesse of

He doth teache vs by his example
continencie and chastitie. Wee read in
prophane histories of great Emperours,
when they had vanquished Cities, they
would not see moste bewtifull matrons
and virgins, or haue them brought in
their sight, or being brought to them,
though they looked vppon them, yet
they did gouerne theyr lustes, and send
them backe againe vntouched, to theyr
parentes or husbandes, and so wanne
great fauour with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The great Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,
when he was bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he shuld
see the daughters of Darius king of the
Persians, which were prisoners and of
wonderfull beautie, woulde not goe,
saying, that it was not in him, that when
he had ouercome men, he should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
of women. But they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shadowes of vertues, then vertues
amongest the Gentiles: for that which
they did came not of true fayth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of ambition. IOSEPH is worthie to
be praysed, who oftentimes being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
by his mistresse, who was in loue
with his beauty, would not doe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
<pb facs="tcp:8809:111"/>
to his maister, nor violate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of God (which was not
yet set downe in tables) GENE. 39. For
as a man ought to shunne other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of euils, so also of adultery. And
though thou be alone with a woman,
yea in the night, yet the bridles of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastitie
are not to be let lose, we must
thinke of the commandement of God,
thou shalt not commit adulterie: wee
must thinke of the punishment of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
whoredome, and lust, we must not
iudge of sinnes according to the corrupt
iudgement of the worlde. Howe vnlike
are those young men, who eyther vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of mariage or by force,
doe defile mayds, or other mens wiues:
also some old men, which are decrepite
doe entise other mens wiues to adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
(as they did Susanna.) But what do I
speake of them, when Monkes, whiche
doe vowe chastitie, doe often-times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
matrones and virgins: And it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that for this purpose they doe vse
auriculare confessions, and sometimes
magicall artes: In the meane season if a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8809:111"/>
woman doe come into their monastery
they doe sweepe their pauement with
besomes. RVTH arose before one could
know another for darkenesse: that is, at
the dawning of the daye. For BOHAZ
sayde (as the olde translation hath) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
least any bodie do know that thou
camest hyther: or he commaunded his
seruaunts (as some will haue it) lest they
should tell, that she was at the flowre in
the night, which doth not like me. That
is more alowable, that IOSEPHVS sayth,
that he badd her to be gone, before hee
raised vp his seruaunts: although he did
know that hee was not guiltie, neyther
that he had done any thing, whereof he
might worthely bee ashamed; yet hee
would not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d others, nor lay a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
blocke before them. It is knowne
out of the Gospell; what they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, which do offend their neighbors
eyther in word or deede: he doth teach
vs to beware, not onely of the euill it
selfe, (as S. PAVLE warneth vs in the
1. THES. 5. chap.) but also he warneth vs
to beware of the appearaunce of euill.
<pb facs="tcp:8809:112"/>
There are many thinges wee may say or
do, with a good conscience, but we must
alwaies haue a regard of our neighbour,
and all our sayings and doings, must be
applied to the edyfiyng of others. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
woman will not be accounted for an
harlot, let her beware, least she shew the
appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of an harlot, either in speach,
behauiour, apparell, and such other. We
must haue a care of our good name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those common verses.</p>

                  <p>The losse of goods may easely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
by labour and diligence, but
if any body bee suspected of chastitie, it
is not so with it. Yet there are some wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men which take delight in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
ISAY 3. chap. sayth of his people,
that they haue boasted of their sinnes as
the Sodomites: he addeth, he wil bring
euill on them. IEREM, 3. chap. doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
his people, because they had the
foreheades of harlots, and would not
repent. How many are there now at this
day, which do boast of whordomes, of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8809:112"/>
adulteries, dronkennes, vnlawful vsuries
vniust slaughters, &amp; other wickednesses
which shuld not be known that they did
it, if they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues held their peace? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they which do hide their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
shal not escap their punishment. We
ought also to haue regard of other mens
good names and honestie. BOHAZ doth
diligently take heed, least any shuld sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that they had done euil. At her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture

or sheete wherewith shee was couered,

carry it to her mother in-law which was
poore, and that shee might haue also to

                  <p>Let rich men learn, to vse their riches

which do seeke by this to defend

know, who are worthy or vnworthy of
almes.</p>
                  <p>Rabbi SOLOMON writeth (as Lira testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth)
that those six measures were signes
of the six blessinges of God, which were
to come on the messias which should be
born of RVTH by DAVID, according to
that which is written in the 11. cap of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAY.
There shall come a rod forth of the
stocke of Ishay &amp;c. and the spirite of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and vnderstanding, the spirite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>councell,
&amp; strength, the spirite of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and of the feare of God was on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8809:113"/>
him. Hee addeth out of this saying of
RABBI SALOMON, two things to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
on, that the scripture of the olde
testament, is not onely to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
historically, but also sometime mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically:
the other, that that saying of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAIAH
is alleadged, and vnderstoode of
Christ, euen of the Hebrues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
                  <p>BOAZ went into the Citie, without
doubt he accompanied RVTH for her
defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; for her honestie sake. For, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
virgins and matrones, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
that they doe not wander in the
night times in the streets, without light,
and honest companie.</p>
                  <p>RVTH came to her mother in-law,
who asked, what hath befallen to thee
my daughter? or who art thou? that is,
how go thy matters? how doth thy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
goe forward? hath thy kinsman
married thee? Parentes ought to take an
accompt of their children, yea, if they be
well growne in yeares, and they shall do
muche good, if their neighbours and
kinsfolkes doe not dissemble, the faultes
<pb facs="tcp:8809:114"/>
of the children to them. RVTH is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the prouder for the hope of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but aunswered modestly to her
mother in-law, shee doth not aunswere
frowardly, but she doth rehearse in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what was done. Also childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
are well aged ought to geue an accompt
to their parentes: And if theyr parentes
be poore, they ought to prouide for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and to nourish them: and they ought
not to take away those thinges priuilie,
which they haue gotten by great labor:

                  <p>Let riche men learne, that they send
not away them which be poore in deed

daughter in law to her mother in law,
whome he knewe to be oppressed with
pouertie, emptie: Who so doth giue to
the poore, doth lend to the Lord. Let vs
rather giue many giftes to them, then

                  <p>The mother in-lawe doth bid her

she will not that shee should publishe it,
as certaine talking women would. Shee
doth adde that BOAZ will not be in rest,
before he hath ended this busines: good
matters are not to be deferred, but that
which is meet is to be done by and by.</p>
                  <p>Let mothers learne out of these
wordes, to instruct their daughters wel;
to teach them good thinges, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
them from euill. NAOMIE, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
RVTH sit downe, that is, be in rest
and to looke for the successe, and in the
meane season not to doubt of BOAZ his
faith. They are to be instructed in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; good maners, not onely in words
but in example of life. Next we see how
credite is gotten. NAOMIE trusteth this
man, that hee will keepe promise with
RVTH, because she saw him indued with
some vertues, otherwise she would haue
doubred of his fidelitie: neyther would
shee haue beleeued him by and by after
hee had promised her. That is true cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
when the sayings or deedes of anie
<pb facs="tcp:8809:115"/>
man be of force with others. As if hee
shoulde speake or promise anie thing,
men would not doubt of his troth, if he
doth any thing, men would accompt it
for right. If he commaund anie thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will obey, if he doe giue counsell,
others do receaue it, and do make great
accompt of his iudgement. But howe is
this estimation gotten? Not by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
nor by dissembling, but by vertue
often shewed, with a happie successe.
For mens mindes are kindled with the
admiration of vertue, and opinion of
Gods helpe. Manie thinke that dignitie
is gotten, with an outward shewe of
sumptuous apparell, by great titles and
by flatterie. These truely are of great
force amongest fooles, but not amongst
men of knowledge. But this is a singular
gift of God, necessary for magistrates,
doctors, fathers of housholdes, also for
artificers and merchants. IOB. 29. decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
howe muche hee was esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all men, because he did his duty
faithfully: &amp; did not leaue of to deserue
well. Estimation is lost, if we do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8809:115"/>
those thinges which wee do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
or that those thinges which we do
speake are false, or those thinges which
wee do are worthy of reproofe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many vndeseruedly do complaine,
that they haue no credite, when they
themselues doe not that whiche they

to the opinion of the Hebrues,
who sayd that he was IBSAN the Iudge,
and when the kinsman came by (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Moreouer we learne, that it is lawful
for a godly man, to sell, to buy, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,

                  <p>But that wee may the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this and the former chapter, and
also other places of the holy scriptures,
I will repeat the wordes themselues of
the law, of raysing vp of seed to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is thus read in the 25. chapter of
DEVTER: If brethren dwell together
(in the same Citie or village, that is to
say at the same time, and both their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
in one place) and one of them
dye and haue no sonne, the wife of the
dead shal not marry without, that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a straunger, but his kinsman shal goe
in vnto her, and take her to wife, and do
the kinsmans office to her. (Targu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth
that hee should marrie with her
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8809:122"/>
Santes dothe translate it, that hee
should contracte affinitie with her)
And the first borne which she beareth
shall succeede in the name of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is dead, that his name be not
put out in Israell, (or let him succeede
or hee shall succeede in the name of
his brother, some menne thinke the
meaning is, hee shalbe called the sonne
of the dead, and the inheritaunce of the
dead shall pertaine to him) And if the
man will not marrie his kinswoman,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let his kinswoman go vp to the gate
vnto the elders, and say my kinsman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to rayse vppe vnto his brother a
name in Israell: hee will not doe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a kinsman vnto me. Then the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his Citie shall cal him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with him: if hee stand and say I
will not take her. Then shall his kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
come vnto him in the presence of
the Elders, &amp; loose his shooe from hys
foote, and spit in his face: R. SOLOM:
doth interprete it, before him, and so
bring shame to the vnthankefull man,
and answere and say, So shall it be done
<pb facs="tcp:8809:123"/>
vnto that man, that will not build vp his
brothers house. And his name shalbe
called in Israell, the house of him whose
shooe is put off. This lawe hath manie
points. First, If a brother doth dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
children, his widowe ought not to
marry a straunger, that is, a man of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
familie: but to a brother or to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinsman of their former husband:
and one refusing, let another succeede
who is moste nigh, as it appeareth by
this booke: Secondly the first son which
was borne of her ought to be called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the name of the dead brother
&amp; succeed in his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. 3. If the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of him that is departed shall refuse
to marry his widow, she ought to shew
that to the Iudges, that they should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
him of this lawe, and perswade
him by diuers meanes, whereby he may
be perswaded to marry her. 4. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be perswaded to these thinges, that
widow shall openly come and vnloose
openly his shooe, and spit in his face, &amp;
as if it were to note him by this publike
ignominie. Some men doe thinke that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8809:123"/>
these ceremonies doe signifie, that she
was at her owne libertie after this, and
had power to marrie whom she would.
Also there was an olde custome before
the lawe as it appeareth by the history
of ONAN in the 38. of GEN. that the
brother should raise vp seede to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without this cause it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a brother, to mary the wife of the
brother that is dead. For there was a
law against this kind of incest. LEVI. 18.
and 20. chap. Where the degrees forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by God are noted. If she had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the former husband, it was also
incest, if a brother shoulde marry that
widow. Also in the newe testament, S.
Iohn Baptist doth greeuously rebuke
HERODE, because he defiled himself, by
keeping companie with his brothers
wife, he being yet aliue.</p>
                  <p>God sheweth the cause wherefore he
made this lawe: yet hee is not bound to
giue vs an accompt of his lawes and
iudgementes, but such is his mercy that
he doth oftentimes shewe to vs the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherefore he doth or commaund vs
<pb facs="tcp:8809:124"/>
something. Which of vs doth shew hys
seruant the reasons wherefore hee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him to doe this or that? but what
cause doth he render of this lawe? least
his name be blotted out of Israell, least
his family doe perisne, and his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce
be translated vnto other families.
If widowes should marry strangers, and
part of their goods should be translated
into other families; their inheritaunces
should be scattered and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
&amp; their families should perish-tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
pouertie. For oftentimes wee see
it come to passe, that good families are
dispersed through pouertie, but GOD
would haue a distinction of tribes and
families in Israell for the promises of the
Messias, who according to the fleshe,
should come of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
And it is very profitable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealthes if they haue olde and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
families amongst them: for they can
take in hand great matters, which come
of them, and especially for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the common wealthe. For we
willingly submitte our selues to them to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8809:124"/>
whome the dignitie, and the noblenes
of theyr family doth bring authoritie.
Also they who haue noble auncestors,
will doe nothing vnworthy their vertue
to bring themselues into infamie. For
new start vppe men doe eyther vse theyr
gouernment wantonly, or are hindred
by the enuy of other men, the whiche
both the olde histories of the Romaines
and the Greekes and other nations, and
also experience doe witnesse. Therefore
God would after this maner doe good
to the common wealth of Israell, that
they might alwayes haue fit men, who
might profitably gouerne the common
wealth. But it oftentimes commeth to
passe, that the sonnes of noble men are
faultie, yet if a sparke of their parentes
vertues shine in some of them, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie
of their auncestours and credite
they had in common wealth, doth get
them great aucthoritie. Furthermore
this lawe doth prouide for widdowes,
for vnlesse this lawe did defend them,
many shoulde by and by be cast out of
theyr houses, which they haue gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:8809:125"/>
well before: but by that lawe it is
lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe theyr husbands
possessions, if they marry the brother or
the kinsman of hym that is departed.
Also Gods will was to preuent the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of Brethren. Some doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wishe the death of their brother,
that they might possesse their inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but this cannot come to passe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the brother doth dye without chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Also this lawe doth admonishe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of their dueties towards the dead,
least they suffer their names to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
Aphricanus noteth an other
cause of this law, who as Eusebius wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
writinge of the genealogies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
reported by MATT. and LVKE, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
other thinges sayth, those are
accompted naturall successions, which
descend from a true seede or bloud: and
those are legall when a sonne, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
by another doth possess. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they had not yet the hope of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
they did hereby immitate as it
were a certain image of the resurrection,
least the name shoulde be blotted out
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8809:125"/>
through barrennes. Augustine agaynst
Faustus the Manich. lib. 32. cap. 10. Tom.
6. doth expound this law spiritually. In
that a brother is commaunded to marry
his brothers wife, that hee might rayse
vp seed to him, and not to himselfe, and
should call that childe which is borne
to him by his name: what other thing
doth he shew in a figure, then that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
preacher of the Gospell ought so to
labour in the Church, that hee might
rayse vp seede to Christ for the brother
that is dead, who dyed for vs all: and the
seede which shalbe raysed vpp, shall be
called by his name, &amp;c. some men do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thinke that it signifieth that they who
are once numbred as Citizens of the
spirituall Israell, shall not perishe. Christ
in the Gospell sayth, Reioice because
your names are written in the kingdom
of heauen. And if any shoulde obiect
whether could not their families be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
by other meanes and those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

This law continued long, whether it
be ceremoniall or iudiciall, their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were confused by the Assirians
and Babilonians, that there coulde no
distinction be seene, and so for a time
this law had no vse, but after that the
Iewes returned into their country, they
began to distinguishe theyr possessions
and kept them agayne as it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

                  <p>But after that Christ had suffered the
death of the crosse for vs, as other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
&amp; politicall laws were abolished,
so were these also: and sith al the policies
of the Iewes are blotted out, and they
are dispersed through the whole world:
although they would gladlye keepe this
law, yet they cannot: therefore let no
man take this lawe as a collour of hys
wicked lust and incestious marriages, for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8809:126"/>
the cause being taken away, it hath now
no more place. And although the laws
ceremoniall and iudiciall be abrogated,
yet their marrowe and kernils are to be
obserued, as in this law that wee haue a
regard of the dead: that wee doe not
chaunge inheritances (the which both
others and especially adulterers doe,
which oftentimes doe priuily thrust in
a strange heyre) also that brothers shuld
be carefull to preserue the children of
their brothers and kinsfolkes.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be vnderstoode by all
these; wherfore BOAZ would not marry
RVTH before the other kinsman had
yeelded vpp his right. And because that
kinsman woulde redeeme the ground,
BOAZ added that hee could not buy the
ground, except hee did marry RVTH,
and preserue the seede and name of hys
kinsman.</p>
                  <p>But before I leaue this, it seemeth
not to be omitted, that some men doe
reconcile that law whiche is written in
the 18. cap. of LEVI. of the shame of thy
brothers wife, which is not to be vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
<pb facs="tcp:8809:127"/>
with the other law which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the 25. chapter of Deuteronomie
of raising vp the seede of thy brother, as
they say, that is to be vnderstood of the
wife of thy brother remaining yet aline,
which doth not yet agree, for the same
might be said of other perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is not lawfull to marry. Furthermore
they which are not of so neere of kinne
are forbidden. S. Augustine writeth thus
of this sentence in the 6 quest, vpon
LEVIT. Thou shalt not vncouer the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of thy brothers wife for it is the
filthinesse of thy brother and of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The question is asked whether this
is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the brother aliue or dead
and it is not a small question. For if we
say the scripture speaketh of the wife of
the brother liuing, for both of these are
contayned in one general commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby a man is forbidden to
come to another mans wife, therefore
what is the matter that hee doth so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
distinguish these persons, which
he calleth of the same stocke by proper
prohibitions? Also whether is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8809:127"/>
of the wife of thy father, to
be vnderstood of thy mother in law, thy
father beeing aliue or rather dead? For
thy father being aliue, who doth not see
it muche more to bee forbidden, sithe
a manne is forbidden to defile the
wife of anye other man by adulterie?
Therefore it seemeth to bee spoken of
those persons, whiche not hauing hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
may marry, vnlesse they bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by law: as it is reported to bee a
custome amongest the Persians. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
if wee vnderstand that hee is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to mary his brothers wife, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead, it is contrary to that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
biddeth of raysing vp seed, if he die
without children, &amp; by this that prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being gathered with this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
the exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be vnderstood
least they be contrarie one agaynst ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is, it is not lawfull for any man
to marry the wife of the brother decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
if the brother deceased doth leaue
children: or els that was forbidden
as a thing not lawfull to marry a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife if shee hadde bene put away
<pb facs="tcp:8809:128"/>
from him by a byll of diuorcement: for
then as the Lord commaunded, that
MOSES should giue foorth a bill of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement
for the hardnes of the hearts
of the Iewes, and by this dimission hee
might thinke that any might lawfully
marry with his brothers wife, where he
did not feare adultery, because she was
put away by a bill of deuorcement.</p>
                  <p>And others do take this law in LEVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICVS,
that thou shalt not marry thy
brothers wife simply without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
as the lawe against manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
adultery, theft, &amp;c. least incest should
seeme to be commaunded and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawes seeme to be contrary among
themselues: neyther say they must wee
thinke that God graunted this marriage
for an outward profite, which he called
before incestuous. For by the name Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in that former law is not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
natural brethren but kinsmen,
after the maner of the Hebrues, &amp; truely
euen those whose marriages were not
forbidden. For brothers children and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
children are called brothers. But
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8809:128"/>
that I may note this by the waye, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sonnes are called <hi>Patruelis,</hi> Brothers
and sisters sonnes <hi>amitini,</hi> Sisters sonnes
<hi>consobrini.</hi> In this selfe same chapter, ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MELECH
is called the brother both of
BOAZ and of his kinsman. S. Augustine
writeth thus against Faustus, Manich.
the scriptures declare that kinsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
were wont to be called general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brothers or sisters. LOT is called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRAHAMS
brother when that ABRAHAM
was hys vncle, by the vse of the whiche
worde, they are called the brothr of our
Lorde in the Gospell not onely those
which the virgine Mary bore, but all his
kinsemen which were of his kindred.</p>
                  <p>ABENEZER testifieth vpon LEVITICVS
that the old Hebrueswere of this mind.
But the Cabalistes, hauing wayed the
matter better, were not of this mynde.
Also in our time there was a certayne
learned godly man deseruing wel of the
Churche of God, and hee was of this
minde. And so hee expoundeth the 22.
chap. of MATT. of the 7. brothers which
married one widdow, because they wer
<pb facs="tcp:8809:129"/>
kinsmen amongest themselues: but in
those degrees, wherein it was lawfull for
them to marry one &amp; the same woman.
It may be prooued by two argumentes
that this law of raysing vpp seede to the
brother is to be vnderstoode of naturall
brethren, out of this little booke of
RVTH. First NAOMIE who coulde not
be ignorant of this lawe, doth perswade
her daughters in lawe that they shoulde
goe home, for if she should haue a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and should haue hope of children
yet it was not needefull for them, that
they shoulde stay vntill they were men.
Next BOAZ sayth, that the other kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
shoulde buy the ground by right,
and marry RVTH because there was
none neerer then he. Next the second
kinseman was not admitted of him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the former refused. ONAN was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for this cause because he would
not rayse vp seede to his brother. GEN.
38. Furthermore wee must not by and
by depart from the proprietie of the
wordes in the lawes, especially if they
be not set downe other where. And the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8809:129"/>
Hebrue word <hi>Iabam,</hi> signifieth no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than a husbands brothers <hi>Iafamah</hi>
a woman, which is to be married in this
case by the lawe of affinitie or kinred.
Therefore this lawe is first to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
of naturall brethren, next it is to
be applyed to other kinsfolkes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that other iudiciall or municipiall
law in DEVTER, is an exception against
that generall and morall law in LEVIT.
which as we haue sayde God hath lefte
out for certaine peculiar causes. Neither
is there any cause wherefore we should
haue it this day in vse.</p>

say that NAOMIE would sell
her field, sayde by and by I
will buy it according to the

he must also marry RVTH by the same

the cause, least he should destroy his

destroy it? peraduenture RVTH was
young and he feared least he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

had wife and children before, it is not
set downe. Also the law of marriyng thy
sister in-law, doth not expresse whether
a sister in lawe ought to marry a brother
hauing a wife and children before.
Truly if he had a wife &amp; children before
it would haue bene very vnprofitable to
haue marryed a newe wife, and begat
more children. For children begotten
of diuers mothers, doe very seldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

should come of RVTH, if he had married
her: because that it is written in the 23.

                  <p>And after this kinsman denyed to
marry RVTH, and to take her ground, he
doth exhort BOAZ to vse his priuiledge:
he doth renounce his right, by wordes,
and by an outward signe and token. The
law doth command a sister in law, if her
kinsman will not marry her, to pull of

his shooe, and spit in his face, adding;
so let it be done to the man, who would

this mans house shal be called the house

simply declare, that this was a solempne
custome amongest the Iewes of buying
and selling of fieldes, as if anie body
will deliuer ouer his right, and giue hys
possession to another, his shooe beyng
drawne off hee giues it to another, and
he drawes it off himselfe. And therfore
I thinke that by the shooe is signified,
that the buyer hath hereafter power to
walke and goe through it, or ouer that
field whiche was deliuered him of the
seller. Some men doe thinke that in the
conspiracie of ABSOLON, DAVID went
barefooted, because the putting off of
the shooe was a token of giuing place.

of Conradinus the last Duke of Sueuias,

as Auentinus writeth in the 7. booke of
Chronicles of the BOIARS complaineth
much of the iniuries of the bishops of
Rome, nowe yeelding vp hys necke to

sayd, that he yeelded vppe by hys right
his kingdomes of Arragon, to the kyng
his kinsman, &amp;c. and these thinges fell
out, anno. 1258.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth that the Elders in manie
thinges did vse the same rites and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.
As in betrothinges amongst the
Romanes, the Bridegrome gaue to the
Bride an iron ring, Plinius in the three

Also they did vse water &amp; wine in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting

in the house of the married wife,
the keies are giuen her, and when shee is
deuorced, they are taken away from her

which is a signe of making marriage. At

did, after that the kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(whose name the holye
ghost of purpose concealed)
had yeelded vp his right. First he sayth
plainely, that he hath gotten the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of ELIMELECH and his sonnes;
then that he will take RVTH the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
to wife, and that not for lust, but lest

should be blotted out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongest
his brethren, that is, his kinsmen, &amp; from
the gate of his place: that is, from Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem.
By which words, he sheweth the
excellencie of his stocke, that manye of
his kindred haue sate in the gate; that is,
haue beene Iudges. And it had beene a
<pb facs="tcp:8809:137"/>
thing to be lamented, that so noble a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
shuld perish, which might in times
to come yeeld gouernors for the people</p>
                  <p>Here it is demaunded, whether BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAZ
did not against the lawes, for bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to marrie straungers, within the
which, though the Lorde comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
those nations whiche hee had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to destruction, yet wee haue
shewed before, 1. chap. 3. Sermon, that
they also do extend to other infidels, by
reason of the daungers of idolatrie. But
where there was no daunger of falling
awaye, it was not altogeather vnlawfull
to marry. RVTH was now conuerted to
the fayth, and to the worshippe of God
alone, and had geuen testimonye of her
fayth by her especiall good workes. So
the father of BOHAZ, SALMON DAVIDS
great gandfather, married RAHAB a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanite,
who had preserued the spies and
had made a notable shewe of her fayth.
There must alwaies be more regard had
of the true worshippe of God, then of
riches and kindreds. ABRAHAM. GEN.
24. bound his seruaunt by an oth, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8809:137"/>
he should not go to the cananites, but
to his owne kinsfolkes to seeke a wyfe
for ISAACKE his masters sonne. ISAACK
or rather REDECCA sendeth her sonne
IAACOB to LABAN, least he should mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with Idolaters. GEN. 28. It behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
parents to followe this example,
when idolaters go about to make marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
they promise many thinges which
they do not afterwardes performe. He
that loueth daunger (as it is sayd) shall
perishe in it. The daughters which are
bestowed vppon superstitious men, are
subiect to more daunger, then young
men which are married with superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Idolatrous women. Let children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
remember theyr duties, and not seek
for such matches agaynst the good wyll
of their parents. It is accounted as a fault
in ESAV, that he offended his parentes
by marrying idolatrous wiues, GEN. 27.
That matrimony which is lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
with the godly hath many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
what good then wilt thou look for
of that vnequall marriage? Otherwise
to be conuersant with the Idolaters, it is
<pb facs="tcp:8809:138"/>
dangerous and troublesom, what if thou
wert wholly bound to them? Deceaue
not thy selfe with a vayne hope, that
thou canst win thy wife, or the wife the
husband, for we see the contrary come
to passe, for the moste part. And it is
commonly knowne what befell to SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMON
the wisest man that euer was,
when hee married idolatrous women.
BOAZ dealt publickely in the place of
iudgement, of both these poyntes, first
of the possessions: then of the marriage
with RVTH, and he did nothing secretly
admonishing vs by this his fact, that we
shuld so bargaine, in buying, in selling,
in changing, and redeeming, as if we did
the same, publickely in the iudgement
place before many witnesses, or in the
sight of all men. Howe many are there,
which doe so bargaine with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
that they dare not for shame tell,
howe they made it, and what were the
conditions of their bargaines? They
name a somme of money, whiche
they shoulde haue giuen to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
they say they dealt lawfully with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8809:138"/>
him without deceite, when they knowe
they lye: Furthermore they will haue,
their lying bookes witnessed with good
mens seales. It should haue bene consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that there is an accompt to be
giuen, and that wee shall haue two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against vs, namely, our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and God the beholder and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger
of our sinnes. But marriages
must not be contracted secretly, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
witnesses, no man must be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in marriages, but all thinges must be
done with good faith. Secret marriages
which are commonly made by baudes,
vayne promises, dronkennes and suche
other means haue seldom a good &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
ende. Let not maydens hearken to
yong men which promise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marriage,
if they would first deliuer them their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to be abused. For if they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
they had rather begin theyr marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with thee with prayers made in the
holy assembly, then by lying with thee.
It was also both wel, and wisely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the olde fathers, that they which
should be married, should be ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:8809:139"/>
by the minister of the Churche
publickly in the holy assemblies. For
hereby we doe declare that marriage is
a holy thing, and not a worke of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereof wee should be ashamed.
They whiche doe euill doe feare the
light, and doe seeke for corners &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Herein are also other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
For wee see which are lawfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which not. This also prouoketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which are married to performe the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
fayth, ech with others, because
that they promised the same by wordes
and by giuing of the hand in the holy
assembly, the minister of the Churche
going before. If any man, in the presence
of three or foure, promiseth that, he will
do any thing, hee will throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the same, if hee be a good man,
and may doe it with a good conscience,
how much more, ought married people
to performe those thinges, which they
haue promised one to an other, in the
sight of God, and his aungels, and the
whole Church? Furthermore, the whole
Church, prayeth that the marriage may
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8809:139"/>
be happie and prosperous, wherof more
shalbe said hereafter.</p>
                  <p>BOAZ said to the Elders and all the
people, ye are witnesses (afterward hee
rehearsed it) that these and these things
I haue done. They aunswered, wee are
witnesses, as if they should haue said, if
it be necessary, we will testifie, how this
matter was brought to passe. Let witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
speake those things which they haue
heard, seene, or knowe, vppon some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ground, let them not be light per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or liers. They doe offend greatly,
which will say nothing, least they shuld
offende anye man, or doe not speake
those thinges rightly which they doe
speake, they doe vtter another mans
wordes in another sence, some thinges
they add, some things they omit, which
doe appertaine to the matter.</p>
                  <p>These are false witnesses, whome SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMON.
6. PRO. nombreth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst those
sixe or seuen thinges, which the Lorde
abhorreth, and in the 19. chap. hee sayth
twise a false witnesse shall not be vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and hee that speaketh lies shall
<pb facs="tcp:8809:140"/>
perish. A false witnesse offendeth gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously,
for he deceiueth the Iudge, who
beleueth the witnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es that were sworne
according to that saying, in the mouth of
two or three witnesses euery cause shall
sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or fal. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hurteth his neighbor
greatly in goodes, credite, body, &amp; lyfe.
Furthermore hee doth great iniurie to
God, whome the false witnesse maketh
the patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his falshood. For these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
there are sharpe lawes, both deuine
and ciuill against them. Wherefore let
euery man deale faythfully in witnesse
bearing. And let vs not onely vse wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in matters of great importaunce,
which it may be was sufficient at that
time, but also let vs prouide that those
thinges which we buy and our bargains
and such other thinges, be written in
bookes or otherwise noted diligently,
and without ambiguitie, least contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that hee would not onely
take his kinsmans fields, but
also take the widow to his
wife, the Elders &amp; all the people, which
were come together in the gate, do say
first that they are witnesses, that BOAZ
tooke RVTH to him in marriage. Then
they prayed that God would vouchsafe
to blesse their marriage: and especiallie
they wishe them many children: the
which they declare by two examples.
God make (say they) RVTH like RAHEL
and LEACH. IACOB the Patriarke, who
<pb facs="tcp:8809:141"/>
otherwise is called ISRAEL had foure
wiues, whereof these two were chiefe.
LEAH whome hee married first, was the
elder, and is here mentioned last, and
RAHEL, is set before her, it may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loued her best for bewty, and
other excellent giftes. For her sake hee
serued LABAN, and should haue married
her first, if he had not bene deceaued by
his father in lawe: GEN. 29. It may be,
that for this cause she is principally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
IACOBES wife: GEN. 46. and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that LEACH was not also his wife.
Of these two he begate eight sonnes, of
whome there came and were named so
many tribes of Israell. And this is it
which they say that they builded the
house of Israell, for by them his familie
and posteritie was encreased and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
yea and continued vnto Christ.
Afterward they doe say, let thy house be
as the house of PHAREZ, whome THA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAR
bare to IVDAH. IVDAH the sonne
of IACOB, almost by the like case tooke
THAMAR to wife, a stranger, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in law, of whom he begate twinnes,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8809:141"/>
PHAREZ and ZARAH, and so the stocke
and kinred of IVDAH, was encreased:
for from them descended many noble
families. From PHAREZ, camethis BOAZ
by whome descended the line of oure
Lorde Iesus Christ, for of him was hee
borne, into this world, according to the
fleshe. If thou wouldest read this whole
historie, in the book of GEN. thou shalt
the better vnderstand this prayer.</p>
                  <p>In the olde testament it was accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as a great blessing, if any had manie
children: barrennes was holden as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch:
the which is manifest by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of RAHEL, of whome mention is
made in this place, who at the first was
barren, and of other matrones, as wee
will shew afterwardes. REBECKAES pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
GEN. 24. blessed her at her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
saying, growe into thousand
thousands, &amp; thy seed possesse the gate
of his enemies. The prophet singeth,
PSAL. 128. thy wife shalbee as the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vine, on the sides of thine house, &amp;
thy children, like the Oliue plantes,
round about thy table. The fruitfulnes
<pb facs="tcp:8809:142"/>
of married folkes, is also mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
the blessings of the Lord in the
lawe. But that which is spoken of the
multitude of children, must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of them which are obedient, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and of good disposition: for degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
children, are rather a cursse: holy
children, are the seminary of the church
and common wealth. And as the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of children, so the multitude of
men, ought generally to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
Gods blessings. But many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so straight (thou sayest) that

that is rather through the fault of

Neyther is it vnlawfull for men to bee
diligent in gathering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby they
may maintaine themselues and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
Concerning the which matter,
there are many sentences, and precepts
written in the Prouerbes of SALOMON.
But we must take heede taht we do not
attribute, the encrease of riches, to our
wisdom and diligence, but rather to the
blessing of the Lorde. For his blessing or
fauor maketh riche, Prou. 10. All our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are in vaine, vnlesse the Lord giue
successe. Luk. 5. The Apostles laboring al
the night, tooke nothing, but letting
downe the net when Christ commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they enclosed so great a multitude
of fishes, that the net brake. Riches must
not be sought afterwith an insatiable de
sire. psa. 62. If riches increase, set not your
heart thereon, &amp;c. Some doe gather ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by right and wrong, but they are
cursed riches, whiche profite not their
house, but rather ouerthrow the same.
But if thou hast no riches, or at lest very
<pb facs="tcp:8809:143"/>
small, remember that which SALOMON
sayth, Prou. 15. Better is a little with the
feare of the Lord, then great treasure &amp;
trouble therwith, 17. better is a dry mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
if peace be with it, then a house full
of sacrifices, with strife, 16. Better is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
with righteousnes, then great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
without equitie.</p>

shall not reioyce in the riches which he
shall restore in place of them, which he
had gotten by rapine, chap. 31. 25. If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced

to that point, wherfore
this booke is especially writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
namely that BOAZ took
RVTH to wife, and begate of her a sonn
called OBED, DAVIDS grandfather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
the scope of this booke is to shew what
Patriarcks there were which came from
IVDAH, to whome the Schilo was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
euen vntil DAVID, to whome the
promise was renued: But the holy ghost
doth comprehend many things in these
few wordes, according to his custome.
He sayth BOAZ married RVTH; and shee
was his wife. When the other kinsman
<pb facs="tcp:8809:146"/>
had giuen him leaue to marry RVTH, he
did not deferre their marriages. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they are betrothed, it is not good to
diferre it long. For Sathan in the meane
season can sowe tares, and turne agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
into disagreementes. This also
is to be praised in him, that he doth not
vse the marriage acte before, but after a
lawfull contract and approoued marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>But out of this, that the holy Ghost
was not ashamed in this place to report
of BOAZ, and other where of other holy
men which married wiues: of RVTH &amp;
otherwhere of other matrons: likewise
of conceiuing, bearing, midwifes, nurses
and bringing of children, we doe gather
the married life doth not displease god.
And therare other things which do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vnto vs marriages as not inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by men, but first instituted by God
himselfe in paradise, before the fall of
ADAM and EVE our first parentes. And
that God ioyned them togither, and
blessed them, and there are many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the holy scriptures which declare
<pb facs="tcp:8809:146"/>
that God doth alow of mariages which
are diligently to be noted and obserued
of Gods people. Marriages are defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
by the law of God, thou shalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
adultery. Christ our sauiour would
be borne of a married woman in Cana
of Galilie, hee adorned matrimonie by
his owne presence, and by the miracle
of turning water into wine, he also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by his Apostles, the proper du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of married folkes, and by the loue
betweene him and his spouse, he doth
propound and set foorth to vs an image
to be followed in Matrimonie. These
and such other of the like kind are to be
opposed against the iudgement of those
men which doe condemne, or forbid
marriage. For Sathan settes himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
marriage in all ages. Before the
Apostles departed out of this life, hee
stirred vppe the Nicolaitans who vsed
women as in common, of whome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made in the reuelation. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the Tatians and the Eucratians
arose, affirming, that whoredome doth
nothing differ from marriage, and they
<pb facs="tcp:8809:147"/>
take no man that is married to their sect.
At length the Monkes, and Nunnes &amp;
Priestes, arose vpp, which vowed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
sole life, and fayned that thereby
they deserued remission of sinnes. They
extolled virginitie with woonderfull
prayses, as if these prayses belong to
those filthie men. They did so speake of
marriage that many forsaking theyr cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and marriage in theyr olde age,
tooke vpon them the habite of Monkes
and Nunnes. Howe many haters are
there at this day of marriage, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
their wandring lustes? Therefore
those thinges are diligently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
which the scriptures doe note of
the dignitie of marriage, and in all the
troubles of marriages our mindes are to
be comforted, with the consideration
of this, that God doth allow &amp; approue
of marriages.</p>
                  <p>Next it is to bee obserued, that the
Scripture sayth, he went in vnto her, for
he had to doe with her: hee doth note
with modestie, and shamefaste wordes,
that which is done honestly in lawfull
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8809:147"/>
marriage. So it is sayd Gen. 16. ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM

the whiche amongest the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues
was accounted as a great
benefite, especially in the tribe
of Iuda, out of the whiche the Messias
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8809:150"/>
shoulde bee borne, according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature: he is begotten according
to his diuine nature, of the substance of
the father fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al eternity, by an vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meane. It foloweth that the Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehemitishe
women, reioyced at the
graundmother of this childe, They say,
God is to bee blessed or praysed, who
would not, that thou shouldest lacke a
reuenger, or a kinseman. Vnlesse a sonne
should be borne vnto her of RVTH, shee
had bene destituted, of all kinsemen. For
although that other kinseman remained
yet she could looke for no helpe of him.
For there is no man so welthy, or migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
who hath not sometime neede, of
the helpe of his friends. It is sayd in the
PROVERBE, a friend is more necessarye
then fier and water: for which cause
the Latines do call friendes by another
name more fitte, as necessary men. Poor
men which haue the helpe of rich kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and aliaunces, are not so soone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried
by others, as they which wante
them. But though we be without frends
yet wee must not dispayre, for wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:8809:151"/>
God not onely as a friend, but also for a
father, if wee trust in him, and lead our
lyfe aright. Then they shew, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of childe, that new borne babe shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,
and what he shall do.</p>
                  <p>First they say, his name shalbe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in Israell, that is, he shal be famous
and of great renowne. Which they doe
gather of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his parentes were
godly and notable: they doe likewise
hope, that hee shalbe well brought vp,
and he shal become famous for his own
vertues, and famousnes of his parentes.
Those children which haue famous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,
maye easilye become famous, if
they behaue themselues well.</p>
                  <p>Secondly they saye, this childe shall
bring thy lyfe againe. In the first chapter
shee sayd, shee was bitter, for the Lorde
had afflicted her: nowe they say, this
childe shall comfort thee: while he was
little, with his sportes and playes, hee

is knowne by hys doinges, whether his
worke, bee pure and right, and so shee
may be of greater comfort. SALOMON
hath many sentences, whiche importe
that children of good hope, &amp; toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and indued with vertue, shall make
the parentes merry. Pro. 10. and 15. A
wise sonne maketh a gladde father, but
a foolish sonne is a heauinesse to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And chap. 23. The father of the
righteous, shall greatly reioyce, and hee
that begetteth a wise childe, shall haue
ioy of him. Thy father and thy mother
shalbe glad, and she that bare thee shall
reioyce.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they say, hee shall cherishe
thine olde age, that is, hee shall not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thee to want thinges necessarie, for
the sustentation of thy life. There is a
reason added: for thy daughter in-law,
hath borne him or vnto him: and she is

haue seuen, that is, many children.</p>
                  <p>The number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is a number of multitude. 1. SAM. ELKA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAH
<pb facs="tcp:8809:152"/>
sayth to HANNA: am not I better
to thee then ten sonnes? They hoped
that RVTH, woulde not chaunge her
mind with her estate, so that, she hauing
gotten a riche husband, should despise
her poore mother in-law, as it commeth
oft to passe. Furthermore they hoped,
that RVTH would teache her sonne to
loue her mother in-law, that hee might
norish her in her age, for it greatly beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mothers to informe their children
rightly of their kinsfolkes and others.
And they doe greatly offend, which do
prouoke the children, sometime against
parentes, graundmothers and their kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes.
There is a like example of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation
in the new testament. LVK. 1
When ELIZABETH had brought foorth
her sonne Iohn, and her neighbors, and
cousins had heard tell howe the Lorde
had shewed his great mercy vppon her,
they reioysed with her. Out of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioysing
of these women, some things are
to be gathered, for our instruction.</p>
                  <p>First wee learne, to giue thankes to
God, and to reioyce with them, whiche
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8809:152"/>
haue the blessing of the increase of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
riches or other good things. PAVL
commaundeth vs to reioyce with them
which doe reioyce, and to weepe with
them which doe weepe, not to be mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and enuious, nor that we shoulde
reioice at the miseries of others. For this
is a preposterous ioy, which God suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not to be vnreuenged. If we ought
to reioice with others, &amp; to giue thanks
to God for these good things, which he
bestoweth vpon them, how much more
if he imploy his benefites vppon vs, and
especially for that generall benefit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be had in remembraunce, that he
would that his sonne our Lorde Iesus
Christ, should become man of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Mary, that he might deliuer vs from
eternall death? Now in our times if any
man haue a childe, an office of dignitie,
or any other good thing, they doe feast
and banquet, but God is seldome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
                  <p>Next, in that they doe prayse God,
and giue him thankes, that NAOMIE
hath another kinsman, they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
<pb facs="tcp:8809:153"/>
that this is a singuler gift of God:
wee doe not thanke any man for any
thing, which wee haue not receiued of
him. Al good things do come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
the onely fountaine of all good thinges
he doth as yet preserue families, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
vp friendes for vs. Oftentimes wee
haue such neere vnto vs, which doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
vs, but God can easily bring it to
passe, that they shall loue, embrace and
vse all good dueties towardes vs. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
doe sometimes l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue vs, and further
our commodities, the which wee must
also acknowledge as the worke of God.
But when, the waies of men, that is there
studies, doe please the Lorde, hee will
make also their enemies at peace with
them, as it is in SALOMONS prouerbs
the 16. chapter. Thinke not that it is
without cause, that men doe hate, or
loue thee, be enemies, or friendes vnto
thee.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore wee perceiue by the
wordes of these women, what is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of children towardes theyr parentes,
namely to comfort their mindes and to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8809:153"/>
cherishe their age. They which doe not
make glad their parentes, but by theyr
wicked life doe cast them into greeuous
heauines and sorrowes, are not onely
murderers of parentes. Nature it selfe
teacheth that parentes are to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in their olde age. For it is meet that
shoulde nourishe them, of whome wee
wee haue bene nourished, and whiche
haue bestowed innumerable benefites
vpon vs. Howe oft behoueth it the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to abstayne from certaine kindes
of meates wherein they delite, least they
should hurt the children in the wombe:
How oft doe both the fathers and the
mothers abstayne from meate, least the
children shoulde be famished with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
Howe oft doe children with theyr
crying breake their parents sleep? How
oft are the parents made afraid through
sundry, and sodayne falles of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
                  <p>Say not therefore, that they are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and complaining, thinke rather
what thou hast bene, and what thou
shalt be, through the weakenesse of age,
<pb facs="tcp:8809:154"/>
if the Lorde graunt thee to liue many
yeeres. The Ethnickes haue many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
examples of the pietie of children
toward parentes. What an example is it
of that daughter, which with her owne
milke norished her mother in prison, of
whom Valerius Maximus maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Pausanias lib. 10. writing of them
which wer called the godly Cataneans,
sayth when the fire, burnt hotly out of
Aetna into Catana, (a Citie of Scicilea,
which was at the foote of this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne)
they made no accompt of golde
&amp; siluer, but flying away, this man tooke
his mother on his shoulders, that other
bare his father. But because they went
not away with speede, the flame hasting
the fire ouertooke them: but they cast
not away theyr parentes so. Therefore
they say that the flames parted in two,
and passed ouer both the young men, &amp;
also the parentes, not hurting them at
all. He sayth that these men in his tyme
wer greatly honored of the Cataneans.

will not suffer it: in like maner the sons
would doe, but the daughters in-lawe
shew themselues very straight: of whom
that cannot be sayde which these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
doe speake of RVTH, that she is to
her mother in-law better then many
sonnes. The sonnes doe oft excuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
by theyr pouertie, but yet they

against all order apparell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and are at manie vaine expences.
If the parents haue many children, they
are sent vp and down, from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
especially if they haue milked their
mony from them before: therfore they
doe wisely, which keepe their goods to

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8809:155"/>
Of this, that it is sayd, that RVTH is
better vnto her then seuen children, we
do gather this comfort, that we wanting
the helpe of children, God can easily
rayse vppe other men who may doe vs

before God.</p>
                  <p>Out of this, that God gaue RVTH so
great ioy, partly by matching her with
so notable a husband, partly by giuing
her a man-childe: wee are taught that
God doth sometime euen in this lyfe
blesse those children which doe honour
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8809:156"/>
theyr parentes. RVTH was faithful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
her mother in-lawe, therefore
God hath graunted her a blessed and
a quiet marriage, much riches and great
renowne. Therfore O ye children deale
well with your parentes, geeue them
those thinges whiche are necessary for
them: and prouoke them not to wrath.</p>
                  <p>Next wee doe gather, that God can
easily restore to perfect estate, men, be
they neuer so much afflicted. Hee doth
not onely for a time vse to ouerwhelme
his children with the crosse, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
hee doth suffer them againe to
come out of it. These widowes were a
long time in a poore estate, but nowe
God doth exalt them both: hee geueth
to NAOMIE a sonne in-law, and of him
a nephew to nourish her. As after great
tempestes, there commeth a calme, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a sharpe winter in a pleasaunt course
there followeth a delectable spring, so
ioy followeth sorrow. But God tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it with some trobles, least we shuld
wander out of the way of saluation. The
sacred history is full of publicke and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb facs="tcp:8809:157"/>
examples: therefore in aduersities

our selues with the consideration
of such like examples.</p>
                  <p>The neighbours sayd that there was
a sonne born to NAOMIE: but NAOMIE
was not his mother, but RVTH her
daughter in law: but they speake in this
maner, because the graundmothers are
as mothers to the nephewes.</p>
                  <p>Those sonnes are also accompted
their children, which haue adopted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Or it is such a phrase of speeche, as that
in ISA. 9. a childe is giuen to vs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in LVKE 2. This day a sauiour is born
to you in the Citie of DAVID, which is
Christ the Lorde and this is for your
good.</p>
                  <p>They called his name OBED, OBED
signifieth a husband-man, a seruaunt, a
tiller: There is noe cause expressed
why they called him by this name. It
may be because that RVTH who had
this child by a man of renowne, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
serued NAOMIE faithfully: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that RVTH labouring diligently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8809:157"/>
the seruauntes of BOAZ was,
knowne of him and planted into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie:
Or which rather liketh me that he
might serue God. All true worshippers
of God are called the seruaunts of God.
The auntient fathers gaue not vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
names vnto their children: but of
some especiall occasion, that both they
and theyr children being alwayes put in
minde of the benefites of God, and of
theyr dutie, might be stirred vp to fayth
and thankes geuing. Sometimes they
continued the memorie of thinges past,
by geuing of a name. Israell gaue names
almost to all his children, according to
the successe. MOSES EXOD. 18. called
his sonne GERSHOM because hee was a
soiourner in a straunge land: and he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the other ELIEZAR, because the
Lord had holpe him. SAMVEL was so
called because HANNA had prayed to
God, that she might haue him. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
some being willing to continue or
renue the memorie of their parentes or
kinsmen, they named theyr sonnes by
theyr names. LVK. 1. The neighbors and
<pb facs="tcp:8809:158"/>
kinsfolkes contending about a name for
Iohn, would haue called him Zacharias
but his mother said, hee shall be called
Iohn. And when they sayde there was
none of thy kindred that is named with
this name, they referred the matter to
his father, he wrott in writing tables, his
name is Iohn: For the Aungell hadde
commaunded that it should be so: And
this name is deriued of grace, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had obtayned muche grace of
God, partly because hee should preach
to the worlde, the grace of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in giuing of his sonne. For GOD
himselfe gaue sometimes names vnto
men, to signifie thinges either past, or to
come: sometimes also before they were
borne. He gaue ADAM his name of the
earth out of the which hee was made, &amp;
HEVAH because she should bee the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all liuing creatures: ISMAEL be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God had heard HAGAR, Gen. 16.
SALOMON because there should bee a
long peace in his raigne. Iesus because
he should saue his people. Sometime he
chaunged names, as ABRAM, he called
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8809:158"/>
ABRAHAM, because he shuld be a father
of many nations, GEN. 17. SARAA be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many princes should come out of
her. Christ our Sauiour named SIMON
PETER, because hee had neede of great
fayth and constancie. The Romaine bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
immitated this when they were
created, they called themselues by other
names: the which custome bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they
writte in the time of SERGIVS the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who was before called, <hi>Osporci</hi>
Swines face, and for the filthines of hys
name, he called himselfe SERGIVS: and
so it continueth vnto our times. And
though it auayleth nothing to saluation
by what name any man be called, yet it
beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth christians in geuing of names
to keepe themselues from superstition.
In some yeeres past they consecrated
theyr children to the worshippe of that
Sainct, by whose name they wer called.</p>
                  <p>And there are some which of a kind
of vayne ostentation, called their chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by heathenish names, as Hannie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,
Scipio, Catyline, &amp;c. There are
many notable names, which do admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
<pb facs="tcp:8809:159"/>
children of theyr duety amongest
the Hebrues, as ABRAHAM, IAACOB, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAIAH:
Greek as Chrisostom, Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
Theophilus: latine, as Benedictus
Fortunatus, &amp;c. The Germanes haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
many notable names which haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
significations. It is meet for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
parentes to giue their children suche
names, as the remembrance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may
prouoke them to vertues. As often as
we heare our name, so oft ought wee to
thinke, that in our holy baptisme we are
receiued into the houshold of Christ. If
we be named by the names of holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
let vs endeuore our selues by fayth and
holinesse of life, to followe their steps.
There are other names also, which are
giuen according to their offices, wherof
it were in vaine to write in this place.</p>
                  <p>But why OBED was called the sonne,
not of Mahlon, but of BOHAZ his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
father, S. Augustine sheweth in the
question vpon Deut. 46. The law (sayth
he) of marrying the wife of a brother,
that seed might be raysed vp to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who is dead without children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8809:159"/>
he, shalbe called after the name of him
that is dead, and his name shall not bee
blotted out of Israel, that is, the name of
the dead seemeth hereby to bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
that he which is borne, bee called
by this name, wherby the dead was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
to whom after a sort he succeedeth,
&amp;c. Vnlesse it may bee vnderstood this,
not that he shal haue this name, but that
hee shalbe accounted as the sonne, not
of him that begat him, but of that dead
man to whome the seede is raysed, and
whose heire he is made. For that which
is added: And his name shall not bee
blotted out of Israel, may so bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
not that the childe should conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be called by his name, but that
he should not seeme to dye without po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and therefore his name, that is,
his memorie, remaineth. For if hee had
gotten a sonne himself, and had not cald
him by his owne name, yet his name is
not blotted out of Israel, because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
not out of this life without chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
and the brother is commaunded
to perform this towards his wife which
<pb facs="tcp:8809:160"/>
he could not doe: for though hee had
no brother, but the kinseman married
his wife, that died without children to
rayse vp seede to his brother: as BOHAZ
did by marrying RVTH, that hee might
rayse vp seed to his kinsman, whose wife
she was, and had no childe by him: yet
that childe which shoulde be borne of
her shuld continue the name of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deceased, because he is called his son:
and so it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe that the name
of the deceased should not bee blotted
out of Israel, and yet not bee called by
his name, &amp;c. Thus farre Augustine. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say that the children begotten in
such a marriage, should be called by the
name of the brother which is dead: but
it seemeth that this was somtimes neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
because there wanted some bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or because many had rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
children for themselues, then for
their brother.</p>
                  <p>The last thing to bee considered in
these wordes is, who this OBED was,
namely, the father of ISHAI, the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
of DAVID the King, of whose ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie

mention is made of him in the 11. chap.
of the Prophet ISAIAH. Of this man the
<pb facs="tcp:8809:164"/>
Christians are sometimes called Iesseits.
Hee was also called by another name
NAACHAS that is a serpent. 2. SAM. 17.
The Chaldei interpreter vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
saith, that he was therfore caled a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
because he was endued with great
wisedome, whereby hee auoyded the
subtleties of the deuil. Reinerus Rinec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius
a man very learned and diligent, in
booke of the noble families of the kings
and priestes of Israell noteth, that in his
opinion Nahaz was another man and
not Iesse. For it might be that Abigail
was DAVIDS sister of one and the same
mother but not of the same father. It is
read that ISAI had eight sonnes. 1. Sa.
16. vers. 10. ISAI. caused his seuen sonnes
to come before SAMVEL, he afterwards
asked are there no moe children but
these? In the Chronicles Dauid is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                     </gap>,
SIMEAH, who was also called SAMAH,
NATHANIEL, RADDAI, HOSEM, DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID.
The name of the eight sonne is not
reckoned, some thinke that he dyed in
<pb facs="tcp:8809:165"/>
his youth, and left no children behinde
him, others do thinke that IONADAB the
sonne of Shimeiah, or some other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
was nombred amongst his sons.
He had two daughters; Zeruia and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail,
Zeruia had three sonnes: Ioab, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shai,
Asahel, which are mentioned in the
sacred historie. Dauid names them after
their mother, the sonnes of Zeruia, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
because that their father was
but a meane man, Abigall had a sonne
called Amasa: of Dauid descended nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
Kings, Salomon, Rehoboam, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The question is moued in this place,

togeather in two generations, when
as the course of the historie, euinceth it,
from the first yeare of Iosuah, (wherein
they thinke that Ierico was taken, and
Rabab preserued) vnto the time of Ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,
(whom they will haue to be Bohaz
the sonne of Rahab) so likewise vnto the
times of Eli (wherein Iosephus writeth,
that this RVTH came with NAOMI to
Bethlehem) manye yeares were past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.
<pb facs="tcp:8809:165"/>
I do simplie answere that it doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
not euidently appeare by the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
how many yeares after the taking
of Ierico were past, before Salmon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Rahab, and when he begate Bohaz
of her, or when Bohaz married Ruth: so
likewise, whither this Bohaz was one &amp;
the same with Ibsan the Iudge, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not necessarie that with some
of the Hebrues and Lyra, we shuld ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
three Bohazes, which shuld succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely
follow one another, as the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
the sonne and the nephew, which
three should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended vnder one
name. Furthermore, it is no absurditie if
we should say, that God prolonged the
life of Salmon &amp; Bohaz for many yeres,
as he did also many others of the fathers
after the stood.</p>
                  <p>But it is to bee obserued, that in the
catalog of the genealogie of Christ, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heynous sinners are rehearsed. Iudah
the father of Pharez, committed manye
grieuous offences. Naasson was defiled

and will of God, that Christe
should come of such parentes, lest anye
man should think that this was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrought
through the merits of the Patriarks: and
also for the comfort of sinners, lest they
should fal into dispair: but might know
that hee came for sinners, according to
that saying. 1. Tim. 1. This is a true saying
Iesus Christe came to saue sinners, &amp;c.
God will be mercifull vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through

                  <p>The mother of Phares, and also the
mother and wife of Bohaz, were heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
women, which were conuerted to

the sonne of God to come of them, that

taught him first from a vision from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that he should not abhor his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
                  <p>And in that God exalted Dauid to
so great maiestie, being born, of parents
of so meane estate, (for though he came
of so noble a familie, yet his father was
a husbandman) hee did it to make hys
mercy and hys power knowne. DAVID
