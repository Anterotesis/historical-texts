         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE High Court of Parliament, SITTING AT WESTMINSTER: <hi>The Illegal and Immodeſt Petition of</hi> Praiſe-God Barbone, <hi>Anabaptiſt and Leather-ſeller of LONDON;</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Moſt impudently ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner hath lived a great while, and indeed long enough to have had more wit, and more honeſty; That Satan finding his head empty of all goodneſs, did one day ſtuff it with Heretical Notions and Whimſies, even as full as men are wont to ſtuff Fillets of Veal with ſweet Herbs, that the Protector called him to be a Parliament man, which ſo fatten'd his meagre Ambition, that he hath had ever ſince a very itching deſire to be medling with State Affaires. That he findes as long as <hi>ENGLAND</hi> is governed by ſober and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, he is like to get nothing more then his Shop will afford him: That the two largeſt pooles of troubled waters for Self-ſeeking men to fiſh in, are Diſtraction in the State, and Unſettlement in the Church. That your Petitioner likes no Government of a ſingle Perſon, unleſs it be that which was ſet up in <hi>Munſter,</hi> and to ſuch a one he prayeth a longer continuance. That Religion, Conſcience, and Morality have bin now uſ'd long enough in the world, and that 'tis fit there ſhould be ſome new <hi>Innovation</hi> invented to ſucceed them. That it is time now, ſince he hath got nothing all this while, but onely an Order to be Comptroller of <hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall,</hi> to be ſtirring and looking out for Portions for his Children with hard Names. That as he is a Leather-ſeller, he ought to ſee all the Adverſaries of his Lunatick devotion, flead and ſoak'd in the Tan-fat of Oppreſſion, that he may have their skins to ſell to all thoſe Drummers that ſhall have occaſion to march before the ſaints to the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi> That if Truth and Righteouſneſs do ever kiſs each other in <hi>England,</hi> he hopes, and it is his earneſt deſire that it may onely be a parting kiſs. Your Petitioner alſo further ſheweth, That it is not, norever was the cuſtom of the Anabaptiſt, to give an accompt of their Faith, or to know what they profeſs, And therfore he he further ſheweth, That he holds that <hi>Feake</hi> is a very able Divine becauſe he is mad, and hath a Demoniack faculty of alwayes raving againſt the <hi>Powers</hi> in being; So that when you ſee him in the Church, you would think him to be the mad man among the tombes. Here is onely the difference between that man and your Petitioners Patriarch, that Chriſt diſpoſſeſſed the former, but if he ſhould offer the other ſuch a courteſie, he would think himſelf wiſer and more ſanctified than his Savior, and ſcorn the motion. And from his Example your Petitioner further ſheweth, That if there be a factious, unſanctified, illiterate Heretick in the world, he is one, and will ſo continue as long as he lives; unleſs your Honors will give him a thouſand pound a year to turn Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>In Conſideration of which Premiſes, your Petitioner humbly prays, That the Myſtery of Jeſuitiſm, and the Works of <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> may be read in Churches, in ſtead of what is now more commonly uſed, whereby the People may be inſtructed in all ſorts of Knavery one towards another, and in all ſorts of Rebellion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to their Superiors.</p>
            <p>That the Commandments may be taken down from the end of the Chancel in every Church, and the Heads of the <hi>Cracovian Catechiſm</hi> placed in the room thereof, till the ſaid Churches ſhall be pull'd down.</p>
            <p>That as ſoon as may be all Churches in <hi>England</hi> may be pull'd down, and the Materials thereof given to your Petitioner toward the Repair of his Windows, and ſetting up a New Sign; And that your Petitioner may be forced to give no further Accompt of the Sums ſo gathered; Neither can this deſtruction be unlawful for that St. <hi>Paul</hi> being a leading Apoſtle, and his Church being fallen, all other Churches ought to be made to follow the Example of his.</p>
            <p>That all Schools and Univerſities be demoliſhed, and their Revenues given to buy us more Armes, in ſtead of thoſe which were lately taken away, that we may be in a readineſs when we ſhall be call'd forth to <hi>Butcher</hi> our Enemies.</p>
            <p>That all Divines and Learned men in <hi>England</hi> may be maſſacred, and thrown to the fowls of the Air, that we may be no more troubled with their Syllogiſms, to the utter hinderance of all out important Deſigns; And that all Books may be burnt, except <hi>Nailors, Feaks,</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Works, and <hi>Larner</hi>'s Hymns, wherein the Unity of Chriſt and his Church is moſt ſweetly chanted forth, to the Tune of <hi>Jookies-march.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there may be a Free Toleration of Bawdy-houſes, becauſe your Petitioners houſe looks now ſo like one, the Windows being all broken; And that none but Anabaptiſts may go to them, for the Propogation of our weak Faction.</p>
            <p>That general Supplications may be made, for the Continuance of Satans Reign a thouſand years longes then is ſet down in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, That you would confer upon your Petitioner Six hundred pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> in ſtead of his Comptrollerſhip which he hath now loſt, to the great impoveriſhment of him and his family.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
