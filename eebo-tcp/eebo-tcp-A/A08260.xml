            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20678:7"/>
a Regall Castle, called <hi>Vpsale,</hi> where the kings of <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be Crowned and buried.

The Countrey being (as I say) a long time ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by these foure <hi>Dukes,</hi> in the kind of an <hi>Aristocratie,</hi> that is, The gouerment of the Nobilitie, as was the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the first and former Romane Peeres and Consuls: was in the end of the Raigne of <hi>Henrie</hi> 7.

This <hi>Gustovus</hi> (being in the life time of his Father, Duke of <hi>Doland</hi>) was a Prince very absolute, both in the perfections of his body, and his mind, excellently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the one, and honorably disposed in the other. Of an indifferent stature, neither too high, nor too low. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion sanguine, his haire bright, his countenance chéere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and pleasant to looke vpon, full of grace, and Maiestie. In warre stout, and industrious, in Counsell wise and full of respect, in the Court he carried such a Port and State, as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all eyes to gaze vpon him. In priuate places full of affabilitie and delightsome recreation: To conclude, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Nature and vertue had both ioynd together to frame in him the most absolute patterne of a Prince in his time.

The Quéene being throughly instructed by the Lords, takes the aduantage of time, in her complaint to the king, Tels him that his sonne aspired, and would shortly aspire against him, that he affected popularitie, receiued like <hi>Absolom</hi> his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects Petitions, not in loue, but Ambition: That he kept a Court, and Port greater then the King, and that all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did more sauour of Soueraigntie, then subiection. The Lords, they second the Quéene in her vniust information, alleadge matters probable to confirme it, The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, and in the error thereof, hates Truth, imbraceth Treason. Thus all being inuerted, Nature rebels in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but Loyaltie remaines in the Sonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The plot was hereupon laid for his apprehension, <hi>Gustovus</hi> being then at Court, who noting a straunge alteration in his Fathers

countenance towards him, began to suspect the drift of the Queene, vpon the distrust of the Noblemen about her: Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being almost abandoned, deuiseth with himselfe how to auoyd the daunger. A Gentleman of the Kings, comes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to <hi>Gustovus,</hi> and tels him that the plot was laid that night, for his Attainder. The Prince being amazed at the suddaine immiuence of such a perill, posteth presently from the Court with a few of his Retinew, and the next day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers his Dukedome of <hi>Doland,</hi> where he meant to stay, till he heard further of the Kings proceedings. His depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was soone made knowne, at which the Queene, and the Lords (though they mist of their purpose) were not much sorry, foreknowing that his suddaine flight from the Court in that manner, would strongly confirme their accusation. The King by them againe is incensed, and messengers sent into <hi>Doland,</hi> by whom the Prince was Summoned by a certaine day to make his appearance in <hi>Vpsale</hi> Castle: which the Prince refuseth to doe: affirming by his submissiue Letters to the King, that though he knew his cause to bee iust, and his heart loyall, no probable suspition of any misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menour from him, either in act, or intent, that yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he durst not hazard his life in the heat of the kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, for that he knew his aduersaries were so great in power, and in so gratious account, that it would be an easie matter to haue his Maiesties grace, and Nature her selfe peruerted to his vntimely and vniust destruction: And that the onely cause why he retired himselfe into his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, was to stay the time, vntill these mists of his Maiesties iealousie and suspition were blowen away, that the Sunne of his alleagiance might shine cleere, farre from the cloudes of all distrust, or disloyaltie. This answere being returned, but not accepted, the King by the Queenes continuall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations was more, and more prouokt, insomuch that a great power was suddenly raised to fetch him by violence out of his Dukedome. Which the Prince perceiuing, and being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able, nor willing to resist his Fathers forces, giues way

to necessitie, and in the habite of a slaue, purposeth secretly to goe into Germanie. And hauing past some daungers in his flight by the Kings pursuers, at last he crossed the seas, and holding on his course for <hi>Lubeck</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> not many dayes safely arriued there, All this while he kept his disguise, for though he knew that the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> were heretofore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him, yet he doubted what minds they would put on in this chaunge of fortune, Remembring <hi>Pompeyes</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in his flight by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> King of Egypt, and the like of <hi>Hanniball</hi> by <hi>Prusius</hi> king of <hi>Bithinia.</hi>

                     </gap>tovus</hi> his flight out of <hi>Swethland,</hi> before his comming thither, was diuersly intertained in <hi>Lubeck:</hi> Some pittied the state and condition of the young Prince, that so Noble a Gentleman, so full of hope, and expectation, euen in the prime of his youth, should in this vile manner suffer violence: Others spake against him, supposing that his owne naturall Father, and others of his blood, would not in this manner haue proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, if he had not showne himselfe dangerous vnto the State, as the mindes of the people are in this case diuersly distracted. The Prince after his comming to <hi>Lubeck</hi> staied certaine dayes in a common Inne, not daring to discouer himselfe, and to auoid the suspition of a stranger in such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, found meanes to preferre himselfe vnto a rich Merchant of the Towne (if such a place in the meanenesse of his fortune at that time may be called preferment.) Being there entertained, he contented himselfe to doe any bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb facs="tcp:20678:9"/>
in the house, striuing to suite his minde vnto his misery, yet could hee not so well counterfeit this part of his sinister fortune, but that the Merchant did soone suppose him to be a better man, then hee seemed to bee, and perhaps the man hee was. So hard a thing it is for Nature to learne to forget her custome. Staying some few moneths in the Merchants house, hee heard of a <hi>Gasant</hi> sent from the king to the State of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> being supposed hee would bend his course thither. The tenor of the <hi>Gasants</hi> message, was to deliuer to the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> that the kings desire was, that either they should not entertaine him at al, or els send him backe to <hi>Swethland,</hi> for that hee was knowen and proclaimed to bee an enemie. But they being at that time ignorant of the Princes abiding, answered for the time to those things, that might stand with the Kings pleasure. The <hi>Gasant</hi> being dispatcht, <hi>Gustovus</hi> liued in a continuall feare of being discouered, as well for that many great men in the Towne had before seene him in <hi>Swethland,</hi> and might then remember him: As also for that his Master would many times prie into his countenance, and behauiour, and vtter strange words, and shew strange pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, euen in his presence, sometimes repeating the name of <hi>Gustovus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince holding thus a Wolfe by the eares, in doubt whether to stay or goe, (in both which he found danger) was wondrously perplexed: Sometimes he thought to discouer himselfe, opposing his mind against the worst of fortune, that if the Towne did betray him, his blood should be shed in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and he be rid of that torment: wherin his mind was diuersly distracted betwixt Hope, and Feare, and Feare the predominant: but at last resoluing with himselfe to stay, hee still framed his mind vnto his businesse. One day cleauing of wood, in the strayning of his bodie, a button that held the flappe of his Ierken, brake, and there withall a little Chaine of gold, whereon did hange a Iewell of inestimable price, fell from his necke: Which a maid seruant in the house (beeing by) perceiuing, was desirous to see it: but hee suddainely
<pb facs="tcp:20678:9"/>
snatching it vp, told her that it was a thing of no worth, but giuen him by a friend of his, in the remembrance of her. The maide dissembled her opinion for the present, but soone after told it to her master. The Merchant vpon this accident, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes his former suspition, and hauing now matter more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue then before, enformed the State of <hi>Lubeck</hi> with this circumstance. The Burgomasters of the Towne, sitting then in Counsell, sent for the stranger by a guard, to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, How the Message was entertained by the Prince, let them iudge that haue vndergone the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture. There was no deniall, nor possibility of escape, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey he must, And it is a hard thing when Princes must obey. Being brought before the Magistrates, it was demaunded of whence he was? he answered, of <hi>Swethen.</hi> They askt him of what degree? He told them, as meane in birth as in fortune: what mooued you (quoth they) to forsake your Countrey? The Prince replied, my vnkind vsage there. A principall Senatour of the Towne looking all this while stedfastly vpon his countenance, perceiued that it was <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovus,</hi> and whispering the rest in the eare, assured them, that it was the Prince. The matter was before concluded what they meant to doe, Whereupon this great Citizen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speake in this manner. Your birth (quoth hee) is farre better then your fortune, Therein you dissembled, but your fortune beares the blame, your first and last answere is true, for we know that you are of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and your name is Prince <hi>Gustovus,</hi> and the vnkind vsage of your Countrey hath driuen you from thence: what we meane to doe, you shall vnderstand shortly. In the meane time repose your selfe securely and hopefully in the rulers house. The Prince acknowledged himselfe, and thankt them for these signes of their good will. And if you shall find (quoth he) my protection, or defence to prooue dangerous vnto your State, Let my life rid you from that feare: I shall be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, so I may free you from danger, to be your Sacrifice; Whereupon they all imbraced him, with the teares stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

The Prince stayed as prisoner, but honourably attended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two yeeres in <hi>Lubeck.</hi> During which time, the king his Father sent diuers <hi>Gasants</hi> with faire words, and large promises to haue him deliuered, but it would neuer be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Howbeit they promised that they would keepe him safe from attempting any innouation.

               <p>Within two yeeres after, the king his Father died, and the State of the Countrey proclaimed the Queenes Sonne, King of <hi>Swethland. Gustovus</hi> had quickely intelligence thereof, as such newes flies euer with the Swallows wings, receiues Letters from many Noble men, and other of his friends in the Countrey, wherein he was aduised to vse all means possible for his return, with assured co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of their assistance The Prince shewes the Letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> solicits them in his own behalfe for aide, giues them princely pomises of their requitall.

When all things were established, and the summes of money paid backe to the <hi>Lubeckers, Gustovus</hi> was shortly after with all solemnitie Crowned king of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:20678:10"/>
not long after was honourably married out of Germanie, His Queene being nobly borne in that Countrey, By whom he had foure sonnes: Prince <hi>Erick</hi> the eldest, Duke of <hi>Doland, Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Finland, Magnus</hi> Duke of <hi>Warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the youngest Duke of <hi>Estergutland,</hi> that now liues and inioyes the Crowne of Swethland.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gustovus</hi> Raigned peaceably and happily, Laden with many yeeres, but with many more Trophies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, The care and loue hee bare vnto his subiects was well seene in their reciprocall respect to him. His sonnes brought vp in all princely knowledge, acknowledged faithfully their naturall duties during his life, Though after his death they fell at vnnaturall debate, one with another.</p>
               <p>In the last of his yeeres he shewed the best of his affections, different from the obseruance taken in other Princes, who after a long continued Soueraignetie, doe much decline from the gentle behauiours of their beginnings. But at last (as euery thing is vnstable, &amp; each estate, that hath being in this world, holds his vncertaintie) This noble king deceased, at that time, wherein his life was most desired of his subiects: whose loue had bene the like vnto his sonnes, had it not bene crost by the nature of the tumultuous times that followed: The dead corps being now the sadde remnant of a king, was with all solemnitie conuaied and enterred in <hi>Vpsale</hi> Castle: His friends following it with all tokens of sorrow, calling him the proppe and protector of Religion, the defender and preseruer of his Countrey, the honour and glory of the Swethen Nation. His fame went before him, dilating his Noble acts, and princely vertues, that (not buried in the graue with him) returned backe, posting through the world, and still sounding foorth the prayses of <hi>Gustovus,</hi> whose name shall neuer die, so long as the memorie of the Swethen State indures.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20678:12"/>
but this is certaine, that the king being vpon the coast of <hi>Norway,</hi> such a strange foggy, thicknes did so cloath the ayre that the kings Fléete had soone loste sight of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And then followed such horrible thunders, and vnheard of Tempests, that it séemed heauen and earth had met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the disturbance of this intendment. The king being at his wits end long before hée came to his waies end was so perplexed in his thoughtes, that he knew not what to do, either to goe forward or to returne: The sight of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Eye was so taken away by the the thicknes of Aire, the beneu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Eare was consounded by the noyse of the thunder, the waters rose so high as if they meant to kisse the Cloudes: Noe light but what the flashes of lightning made which amased them all, the raine fell so thicke that they could scarce kéepe the Hatches, the maister calles to the Boatson, and is not heard, the Sternes-man cryes to the Maister, and is not regarded. Thrée daies togeather, continued these thrée nightes of darknes, wherin was séene neither sunne Moone, nor starre: the kinges Fléete was diuersly dispearst, some into the coast of <hi>Denmarke</hi> others back againe into <hi>Swet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the king himselfe vpon the Coast of <hi>Norway</hi> looks eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hower for his buriall in the Sea. At last entering into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation with himselfe, he thought that God had suffered his pride to be thus punisht, for that he vndertook a Mariage with such a Quéene, whose fame and glory was so great, as well from her State, and gouernment, as for the riches and strength of her Crowne, and kingdome: that entering into cosideration of it, he held himselfe much vnworthy of such a fortune. Upon this, the king rashly vowes that if it would please God to deliuer him from that daunger, he would giue ouer his ouer high attempt, returne into his Countrey and learne hereafter to suite his desires to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.

The most and best part of the Nobility being by these and the like suggestions wonne vnto his party, a way was quickly made for the Duke to Wooe for himselfe, which was not long a doing for the heart, that was already so strongly assaulted, was soone framed to yeeld.

who with an honorable traine being conducted into <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was there Royally entertained, and shortly after with Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> her husband, in all princely manner, Crowned King and Quéene of <hi>Swethland</hi> at <hi>Vpsale</hi> Castle: Many Statutes he repealed which the King his brother had made, being found preiudiciall vnto the Country, and others hee enacted, that were held more profitable: To all Sutors he shewed himselfe very gentle and gracious: And because the treasure of the kingdome was much exhauste in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into <hi>Poland,</hi> he was driuen to borrow many great Summes of money both there, and of his Friends at home: Hee kept a Princely port, and was very liberall in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, delighting much in all Martiall exerrises. His li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality was equall to that which was so highly commended in a worthy Captaine of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who when hee had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned a victory against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> tooke onely of all the spoile but one sword, distributing the rest amongst his Souldiors, saying, Fellowes in Armes this I Challeng because I wrong it out of the hand of mine Enemie. Whatsoeuer else is yours, as the reward of your trauells, for, the <hi>Theban</hi> Senatours warre for honour, not for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Mercenary Man that beareth Armes for hier, and for his ordinary Paye, feareth not to venture his life in the face of his Enemy, hauing but his wages, hath but his due: So that if hope of spoile, and the bounty of his Captaine did not encourage him in his attempts, he would both doubt the danger of his person and scorne for so little gaine to ranne vpon such imminent perills. His liberality towards his associats in Armes, and his experient wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and valour in Martiall enterprises made him both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured feared, and held in worthy estimation. Thus by this and his other vertues Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> in short time Crept into the hearts of his Subiectes. The first yeare of his raigne the Quéene brought him a goodly Boy which was Christened by the name of <hi>Sigismond,</hi> the Emperor beeing his Godfather, which <hi>Sisgismond,</hi> is now King of <hi>Poland.</hi>

About the Tenth yeare of his raigne, King <hi>Iohn</hi> made an honorable iourney into Russia, vpon the breach of a League made betwixt them. From whence he returned victorious. The rest of his raigne was quiet and peaceable: And set a side the staine of his brothers death, he was doubtlesse a most excellent Prince and worthy of the Crowne and kingdome, and although there were many times iarres betwixt him, and his brother Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> yet alwaies the matter was so handled, that they were soone reconcilde againe. By which were cut off all occasions of Ciuill warre. In the twelfth yeare of his raigne his father in law the King of Poland dies, for whose death the Quéene his daughter mourned heauily. The young Prince <hi>Sigismond</hi> her Sonne was elected King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and with an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conuoy being guarded thither was with all solemnity in all Princely manner Crowne King of <hi>Poland</hi>: Shortly after Marries honourably into the house of <hi>Austria;</hi> and in the twelth yeare of his raigne in <hi>Poland,</hi> King <hi>Iohn</hi> his Father dies: whose death being much bewailed of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, he was with appertaining solemnitie buried in the Chappell of the Kings in the Castle of <hi>Vpsale.</hi> Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Estergutland</hi> after the death of his brother sends into <hi>Poland</hi> for his Nephew <hi>Sigismond</hi> to come to receaue the Crowne of <hi>Swethland, Sigismond</hi> takes heauily the death of his Father, and deuines before hand of the troubles that followed in that kingdome: Great preparation is made for his iourney into <hi>Swethland,</hi> and doubting of his vnckles minde &amp; proiectes, carrieth a great power of <hi>Poles</hi> with him to preuent all daungers. The king arriues safely in <hi>Sweath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is with all honor and signe of loue receaued by his vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and the rest of the Nobilitie of <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> He is honorably conueyed to <hi>Vpsale</hi> Castle, where hee was louingly receaued of the Quéene his Mother, whom he comforteth being a sorrowfull widdow for the death of King <hi>Iohn</hi> her husband. Shortly after he was crowned K. of <hi>Swethland</hi> without any disturbance. A Rex-day was

held in the castle of <hi>Vpsale,</hi> where all things being establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, <hi>Duke Charles</hi> is made vicegerent of the kingdome: hauing with him ioynd in Comission foure Noblemen, of the <hi>Rexen-road</hi> whose names were <hi>Hergusten Bonner, Hersten Bonner,</hi> his brother, <hi>Herrerick Spare,</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Belk:</hi> These fower Noble men, being great in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but not very great with the Uicegerent, were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose ioynd by the King in commission with the Duke to curbe or Controule all ouer haughty and headstrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, that the Duke might happely Commit by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his place and power in the absence of the King, who was then ready to returne to <hi>Poland.</hi> The Duke perceaues the drift, but dissembles it. before the Kings departure, order was set downe by the King with the Duke and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for the payment of certaine sommes of money, which King <hi>Iohn</hi> his Father did owe vnto many Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that were yet vnpaide since the time of expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Russia,</hi> and vnto many Merchants of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and other Nations for the prosecuting of that warre. After all things were thus setled and ordered, the King returnes to <hi>Poland,</hi> leauing behinde him that fire that afterward consumed the peace of the whole Kingdome: for the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Commissioners being commanded by the King, (that was euer iealous of his Unckle <hi>Charles</hi>) to obserue and enforme his Maiestie of the manner of his gouernment, did so oppose themselues against him in all his procéedinges, and especially in the payment of this money, that the Duke plainely perceiued, that this new gouernment was but laide as a trap to ensnare his life, A Rex-day was holden at <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale,</hi> no order Concluded, nor money paide, and much adoe there was to kéepe them from factions, the Commissioners would haue these summes paid out of the Subiectes purses, the Duke out of the Common Treasury: which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners refuse, alleaging the Kings want of money, The Duke writes faithfully, The Lords falsly to the King. To whom they intimate feare of innouation, and that the Duke
<pb facs="tcp:20678:15"/>
by all likelyhoods aimed at the Crowne, that he had paid parte of the money due to the Souldiours out of the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Dukedome, to draw their affections to him, that he sought to further the State, and wealth of the Commons more then stood with the loyall nature of a Subiect, that he kept the Porte and State of a King rather then a Deputie, and that it was not like he would long yeeld his honors vnto Uassalage, whose fortunes in such a minde and State as his might attaine to Soueraignty, if preuention were not spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily made. The Duke intercepts these letters, and sends them inclosed in his own vnto the King, to whom he writes very humbly, and with all protestations of duty, and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: the king receaues the letters, but beleeues the Lords and dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Duke notwithstanding hauing intelligence of this plot, beganne to looke about him, hasted into his owne duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and raised a great power of men, Some say that if hee had but staide one hower longer in <hi>Vpsale,</hi> the plot had beene effected, and the Duke vtterly vndone. The Lords were in a maze vpon the Dukes departure, knowing that their deuise was discouered, they now perceaued their owne weakenesse to resist the Duke, being in power, place and opinion, and farre aboue them, And though they had the Kings authority, yet was he farre from them, and they néer vnto their danger, they knew not well what course to take, sometimes they purposed to flie to the King, and then they feared the waies were forelayd. To stay in the Castle of
<pb facs="tcp:20678:16"/>
                  <hi>Vpsale</hi> were no safety, it being a place of pleasure, not of defence: whereupon they determined to depart from thence: Thrée of them vnto the Castle of <hi>VVasten</hi> in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Finland,</hi> and <hi>Hartourbelk</hi> to <hi>Calmer</hi> Castle. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Castles deliuered vnto them, they purposed to stay there to vnderstand the Dukes procéedings, and in the meane time dispatcht letters vnto the King of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of these troubles: The Duke (as I sayd before) hauing raised a great power of men, marcheth spéedily towardes the castle of <hi>Vpsale,</hi> but vnderstanding of the Lords departure towards <hi>Wasten,</hi> bends his course thither. It is a world to sée what numbers of men came vnto the Duke from all parts proffeting their seruice to him: All which hee gently welcomed. Some he entertained, and the rest sent home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with speciall charge to looke vnto the Kinges peace, signifying further that the cause why hee was now vp in Armes, was but to right himselfe of such wronges done by those Lords, who neither loued the King nor him. The Lords that were in the Castle of <hi>Wasten</hi> vnderstanding of the Dukes approach with such a power of men, sodenly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the castle, and not being able to defend it, fled in all hast to <hi>Poland,</hi> whome the Duke would not pursue, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the castle put in a strong Garrison, and presently hast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to the castle of <hi>Calmer,</hi> which <hi>Hartourbelk</hi> had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken in the Kings name, who standing at defence and defiance with him, the Duke besiegeth both the Citie and castle, the cittizens more willing to entertaine him, then resist him. The Duke plants his ordinance against the Gates of the Citie, and thereupon the Citizens resisting the command of <hi>Hartour Belk,</hi> open the citie Gates and recaue him in: The Duke besiegeth the castle, and in short time by the helpe of the Towne Winnes it, takes and keepes <hi>Hartour Belk</hi> prisoner, and dischargeth all the rest.</p>
               <p>From hence the Duke sent letters to the King, informing truly the cause of these troubles, That the vniust attempts of the Commissioners against him, did moue him to raise
<pb facs="tcp:20678:16"/>
these powers in defence of his state and liberty, not in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of his Maiesties peace, nor to make any innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Land, &amp; beseeching him that no false or fained sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of his aduersaries, might stand as a barre betwixt his Maiesties grace towards him and his owne fidelitie: Affirming further that it lay in his power to stopp their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage into <hi>Poland</hi> and that hee would at the Kings pleasure disperse his forces, surrender vp the castles, that he had taken, be content to resigne his charge of gouernment, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer it pleased the King, Prouided that hee might bee assured of the quiet enioyment and peaceable possession of such Lands and honors, as he was born vnto by Nature: and this (quoth he) I learne of necessity, which teacheth euery creature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it selfe.</p>
               <p>The King receiues the Dukes letters, but giues no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his protestations. During the time of the Dukes stay in the City of <hi>Calmer,</hi> and vnderstanding of many disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and misdemeanors that were commited in a Nunnery, standing in the Towne, One daye Came to visit the Nuns, accompanied with certaine gentlemen of his house, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding some of their mindes to be discontent with their orders, and some of their bodies well knowne to the Friers, dissolues the Nunnery, and transposeth the Nunnes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own disposing, Some into other nunneries, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to their Friends, the most to Mariages. The King by this time had answered the Dukes letters very coulorably, that hee was sorry for the tarres that happened betweene him, and the Lords, That as soone as his businesse would giue him leaue, he would visit the Lordes, and him. In the meane time he requested that hee would deliuer <hi>Hartour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belk,</hi> or intreat him kindly. The Duke though hee beléeued not what the King had written, yet hee receaues the letters gladly, and honourably feasted the messenger. In this time another dangerous plot was laide, to entrappe Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and to enforce him Prisoner, in the Castle of <hi>Litto</hi> aforesaid, whereupon there were forces very secretly, and
<pb facs="tcp:20678:17"/>

The charge being giuen by the Duke was semblably answered by the contrary party, and now the voice of the Ordinance, (that was many yeares a stranger in those parts) carried such hideous noyse in the Land, as much amazed the quiet mindes of the inhabitants, when they heard that the haruest of their Peace was now like to be reap't by the vngentle hand of warre: Then began they to forethink the troubles that were like to follow these fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beginnings, but happely not to remember the causes thereof: it is either a naturall or Customary stupidity in man to be senselesse in the vnderstanding of their owne offences, Pride, Blasphemy, Auarice, Extortion, Luxury, and other the like enormities are in particular men the generall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the disturbance, nay sometimes of the depopulation of a whole kingdome, when the mindes of Princes corrupted with Ambition are stirr'd vp, though in their owne respects, euen by the power and sufferance of the almighty to plague (by warre his consuming Minister) the vnrepented sinnes of the people.

Low shrubs féele least tempest, In valleys is heard least thunder. In Country rooms is great rest, and in little wealth the least disquiet. Dignitie treadeth vpon glasse, and honor is like a fading herbe, that when it bloometh most gorgeous then it blasteth. Sometimes hee thought to disguise himselfe &amp; with his cloathes to change his thoughts, that beeing poorely attyrde, hee might bee mearely minded, and measure his actions by the present fortune, not by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer estate. Yet in the summons of these diuers thoughts and cogitations hee had some respectiue regard of his honour, though all false, yet his heart should not faint, for the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of a man is shewed in his resolution. In the middest of his extreames hee held it his safest course, to flye by night with all his power, sister, and friends, with a full purpose to attempt the winning of <hi>Wasten Castle,</hi> being thrée or foure daies iourney from <hi>Steckborow.</hi> But the Duke that had waded through many dangers, and in many aduentures both prosperous and lucky, had gotten such reputation, that he was highly preferred in the estimation of that Country put the King into such a Continuall feare of his pursuite knowing his strength vnable to match his Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Duke vnderstanding the King to be vnstayed in his resolution, and to stand thus wauering betweene warre and peace (which danted the hearts of his people to bee seene in

field, leades his Army, plants his ordenance against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Steckborow</hi> and takes the kings fléete with seuen tunne of Gold, and all his regall Ornaments. The King had conuaied himselfe to the Castle of <hi>Linnekeeping,</hi> and was there royally entertained, howbeit in the middest of Solemnities, the sad newes of that vnhappy accident was brought thither vnto him: At the hearing &amp; relation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though hee was much agast, yet with that kingly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that his vnfortunate successe had left him, he burst out into this or the like passion.
<q>If my moderation (quoth hée) in prosperity had béene answerable to the greatnesse of my birth, and state, or the successe of my last attempts to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of my minde, I might haue come to <hi>Linnekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> in my accustomed honour, and Royalty, and not as a man thus wasted and spoiled, and to be rather gazed vppon, then honourably entertained. But what cloud soeuer hath darkned my present state, yet haue the heauens, and nature giuen me that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in birth &amp; mind, which none can vanquish or depriue me of. I sée that my enemies make their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, the subiect of my miseries, and in my calamity as in a myrour may bée beheld their owne glory: yet let them know this, that I am, and was a prince, furnished with strengh of men, and abiliments of warre, and what maruell is it, if it be my chance to loose, séeing experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that the euents of warre are variable, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of policy guided by vncertaine fates: The desire of souerainty admits no limitation, and if Duke <hi>Charles</hi> must command all, then all must obey. For mine own part whilst I am able, I will make resistance, and will bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to submit my neck to a seruile yoake: For so farre the law of nature alloweth euery man to defend himselfe, and to withstand force by force.</q>
This passion of the King filled the peoples hearts and eies with wonder, and delight, and with their best comfort and encouragement they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their ioynt performances of duty. Insomuch as the King did therewith attempt the taking of <hi>Wasten Castle.</hi> But
<pb facs="tcp:20678:20"/>
hee whom fortune had before striued to make vnfortunate did in this also faile, and hath nothing left him to glory in that attempt, but his lossé of men, and of much expectation. These crosse accidents sat néer the Kings heart, who with much cares and trauells had wearled his spirits, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spent the strength both of himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his people. For whatsoeuer hee determined, was not carried with any such secret or politike course, but that by some meanes or other the Duke had some notice thereof, and still apprehended his drifts. For this was no sooner plotted, but the Duke sends letters secretly to the Captain, that he should not deliuer the Castle with his priuity.</p>
               <p>The King lying in <hi>Linnekeeping</hi> sends fiue hundreth men secretly to surprise the Castle, yet was the same able to defend it selfe as indéed it did, and the Captaine therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Dukes will, and retainde his credit, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaches of his valor. Questionme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were made whether they might enter into the Castle in the kings name, but a perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory answere was returned, that without mandatory let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Duke, there was nothing there to be expected but resistance: vpon this the kings mind was disquieted, and a world of inward Conflictes encountred his cogitations, as he stood doubtfully distract, what he were best to doe: at last as fire cannot he hid in straw, nor the nature of man so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but that at last it will breake out, and haue his course: Soe fares it with the king, who perceiuing his pleasure to be like Sicke-mens wills that are parall (which hauing no hand nor seale, are the lawes of a Citie written in dust, and are broken with the blast of euery wind) commanded that forthwith the Duke and all his adherents, should bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to stand in the state and nature of Traitors.</p>

hither and thither, protested that that day should bee the full end of their misfortunes, and the beginning of their happinesse, or else his owne perpetuall seruitude and bondage. The Souldiers vpon this shewde as great forwardnesse, and as Ecchoes redoubled his wordes, vowing neuer to yeeld, eyther for woundes or for life, which they were all ready to sacrifice in the cause of their Country: which resolution appearde in the squadron of Captaine <hi>Hill,</hi> who leading his Army, mette the Enemy with such a showre of shot, that many were slaine, and many wounded: <hi>Andreas Lemerson</hi> giues the second charge, and that with so fierce an encounter, that he seizeth vpon the enemies ordinance, and turnes the same vpon them.

The Duke, though it somewhat troubled him, yet shewed no signe either of feare or sorrow, but hartned on his souldiours to the reuenge of their fellowes deaths. There was nothing that aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him more then his Celeritie in all his attempts, for whensoeuer any aduantage was proffered, hee would neuer pretermitte the least occasion. <hi>Duke Charles</hi> vpon the newes of this ouerthrow, vnderstanding of new succours shortly to come out of <hi>Poland</hi> in the aide of <hi>Fernesbeck</hi> sodainly raiseth his (Army, his Enimies supposing that the late ouerthrow had much quaild his courage, and nothing lesse suspecting then what he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded) marcheth with all spéed to the Citie of <hi>Venden,</hi> into which <hi>Duke Fernesbeck</hi> but two daies before had made his triumphant entrance.

<pb facs="tcp:20678:25"/>
Ferns-beck</hi> staying within the Towne, euery hower looking for his new supplies, when he saw himselfe (thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for) confronted by the Duke, and his Army, stood so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed that a long time he was in doubt what it were best to doe. At last made a shew of resistance of the Enemy, and defence of the Towne; till the approach of the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, In which time he deuised such a plot, that vtterly lost his honor, and the Loue of all his friends within his Dukedome. For in the beginning of the night hauing throughly instructed his Commanders, and followers, what hee meant to doe, No Townesman supposing what he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, made an absolute spoile of the Towne, ransacking euery mans house, and carying away their plate, money and iewels, flyes closely away and leaues the Towne abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Duke <hi>Charles</hi> had sodaine intelligence hereof, and with all hast pursues him, and in the way he takes certaine of <hi>Fernesbeckes</hi> Espials, whome hauing threatened, was by them conducted to the place where Duke <hi>Fernbecke</hi> that night encamped, and hauing giuen the charge to Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Hill,</hi> that was desirous to reuenge himselfe of his late ouerthrow, sodainely set vpon them being at rest, slew the most part of them, recouers the goods taken a little before so violently and dishonourably out of the City, <hi>Fernsbecke</hi> himselfe with a few of his followers hardly escaping.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> hauing thus recouered his late losse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes with his Army to the Citie of <hi>Venden,</hi> where, with all acclamation of ioy hee was honorably entertained: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus seated in <hi>Venden,</hi> within two daies after his aboad in the Town he sendeth Eight hundreth men vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte was to besiege <hi>Cokenhouse,</hi> being then and at this day the strongest Castle in christendome. The duke thought
<pb facs="tcp:20678:25"/>
if he could gaine this castle, he were then thoroughly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of all the dukedome, hee himselfe purposed shortly after to second him. This gallant young gentleman with all speed, and with a full spirit marcheth to this honorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, and encampeth his Army close to the walles of the Towne, which being very strong, &amp; faithfull to their Lord, endured a long siege with great effusion of blood on both sides, but at the comming of the Duke, the Towne was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and vpon a breach in the entrance of the Towne, this young captaine was vnfortunately (but honorably) slaine with the shot of a Musket in his priuities, sent from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: Duke <hi>Charles</hi> was very sorry for his death, making a vow that he would neuer raise his Army, till he had either forced the castle, or followed the fortune of this gallant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Three moneths the Duke lay before the castle with continuall batterie, and in the end takes it, and keepes it at this day. Upon the taking of the castle he was sufficiently reuenged for the death of <hi>Peereslompe.</hi> Thus all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, houlds, and fortresses, in <hi>Liefland,</hi> were in this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer brought vnder the command of Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> onely the castle of <hi>Ree,</hi> which was second to none but <hi>Coken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> was yet left vnassaulted. Duke <hi>Charles</hi> hauing thus in a manner the entier possession of <hi>Liefland,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now wearied with this long toyle, hearing no newes of Duke <hi>Fernesbeckes</hi> returne, in the latter end of the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, hauing ordered his affaires in that countrey returned to his dutchesse into <hi>Swethland,</hi> lying then in <hi>Stock holland,</hi> before his going he left the cities &amp; castles in the dukedome, being thoroghly maned, vnder the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his friends.

<pb facs="tcp:20678:26"/>
whole Army safely within two daies, within 15. myles of <hi>Ree.</hi> His purpose was to haue sodainely beleaguerd the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle before the rest of his enemies forces were Landed out of <hi>Poland,</hi> which he vnderstood were ready to bee shipt: and to that end (hauing refreshed his Army) hee marched speedily and out of order, in the latter end of the day towards the Castle of <hi>Ree,</hi> supposing by the benefit of the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the better to haue ensconc't and fortified himselfe. But as no man, though neuer so circumspect, can warrant to himselfe the assurance or continuance of successe, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the actions of warre, where fortune bears a sway so this noble Duke found the nature of her fauours, which shee had powred vpon him, to be so vnstable, that in a Minute she snatcht from him, what a long time before she had prodigally bestowed. For <hi>Fernsbeck</hi> hauing intelligence of the Dukes landing, sodenly issued out of the Castle with thrée thousand of his followers, and hauing a place of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage about thrée myles from the Castle, the way that Duke Charles must of necessity passe, tooke the benefit of the place and the night, lying there in Ambush for the Dukes comming, and giuing directions not to stirre till the vant guard of the Dukes Army had past them, and then sodenlie to charge the battaile, and the Rereward to giue the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum to the Castle, At which time a Polish Captaine with thrée thousand <hi>Poles</hi> was appointed to charge the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the Dukes: which on all sides was accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht. The Duke being in the Battaile, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so sodainely and dangerously inuiron'd, gaue (according to the Tyme) the best directions, resist hee must of necessity, Retyre he could not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherfore ryding chéerefully vp &amp; downe his Army, gaue encouragement to his Souldiours, making still the danger lesse then it was, But <hi>Fernesbeck</hi> stirrd vp with a desire of reuenge, and recouery of his dukedome, and hauing aduantage of the place, so violently assayled, that at the first Charge he made a great breach into the body of the Dukes battaile, she like was performed at the instant vpon the rereward by one <hi>Stockland,</hi> a gallant young Polish Captaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20678:27"/>Thus all parts of the Army beeing assaulted, that before was weary, weake, and fainte, through a long Marche, they were sodenly put into such a fear, as begat much amazement in them, so as men desperate of all hope to resist, they flong away their weapoas and fled, hoping to saue themselues that way, wherein was least hope of safeguard. The Duke did what lay in his power to stay his flying Souldiers. But in this perplexed face of flight, where nothing but the Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of feare and despaire could be séene, no words could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor any commanders tongue be regarded, but in this confused manner they ran vpon their deaths, whilst the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my stood ready to receaue them. And in this horrour of blood and massacre, the Dukes horse was slain vnder him, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hurt, and perceiuing no hope either by fight or flight, hee fell downe (as dead) among the dead Carcasses, reteyning a hope that way happely to saue himselfe. Of fifteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, fourtéen thousand and odde were put to the sword, the rest fled to their shippes. Euery man supposing the Duke to be slaine. The sad newes of this fatall ouerthrow and of the Dukes supposed death, was soone brought into <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which vpon the hearing thereof, shewed such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral face of sorrow, as if the whole land had put on one entire mourning garment, to attend his sad and vntimely funerals They now saw their Prince sode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly snatcht from them in the spring time of their hopes, &amp; in the prime of all his glory, they found themselues naked, and open to the Polish Tyranny. They feared their Religion and gouernment would now be forced and adulterated by the tyrannous command, and superstitious customes of <hi>Poland,</hi> wherewithall they knew their King was wholly corrupted. No heart so Noble, no head so circumspect, no hande so victorious, to order the state, manage the affaires, and fight the battailes of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, Now he was dead all hope was buried, and all their happines, and fréedom should be laid in the graue with him, and last but not least of their sorrow, they wanted his body to giue it honorable funerall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20678:27"/>But as this false newes made them true mourners, so this passion of sorrow for his supposed death, was afterward turned into the contrary passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ioy, for the Dukes strange and vnknowne deliuery: to whome wee will now returne, hauing left him before among the dead carkases of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. There was a young Gentleman of <hi>Swethland,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant to the Duke (whose name I could not learne) that saw the Duke when he fell, thinking him with the rest to haue beene slaine, and desirous to doe the last seruice to his Prince, kept close (hauing a place fitte for his purpose) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to recouer the body of the Duke, and finding in the darke of the night, a certain Gentleman of <hi>Poland,</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly slaine, shifteth armour and apparrell with him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the <hi>Polish</hi> tongue, vndertooke as one of <hi>Fernsbecks</hi> souldiers to rifle the dead bodies, and hauing found the place where the Duke lay, all imbrued with the bloud of his Souldiers, and comming neere to raise the body, the Duke beganne to striue: The Gentleman amased, askt in fayre termes if he were aliue: to whome the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, Art thou my friend? the Gentleman told him his name and purpose, and sith he was aliue, he should horse him selfe vpon the Gentlemans horse, and flie vnto his ships, vsing the benefite of the night for his escape, while hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would make what shift he could to follow after. The Duke being thus raysed from this graue of bloud worse then <hi>Golgotha,</hi> embracced him, thankt him, and spake these words, <hi>God prosper thee, whome if it please, that thou shalt liue to out liue the fortunes of this night, there was neuer man so deare, as thou shalt be to thy Lord</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Duke mounted, and with all speed hasted to his shippes, where the ioy of his comming was so much the greater, by how much the feare before of his death was the stronger.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman whom hee left behind, being vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely discouered, was vnfortunately slaine, which though the last, was not the least honour he atchieued, to die in the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Prince. The Duke stayed long for his returne,
<pb facs="tcp:20678:28"/>
but at length suspecting that which had happened, hoyst saile and safely arriued in <hi>Swethland.</hi> It is a world to heare the concourse of people that from all parts came to sée him: Upon the newes of his landing, they strewd flowers in the way, as thinking the Earth vnworthy to beare him: they shewed all signes and tokens of ioy, as now holding themselues free from those feares, which the report of his death had before possest them with. Now as men newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, they beganne to entertaine new hopes, and to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselues with a perpetuall stability of their estates: The Sunne, which they supposed had made an eternall Set from their Horizon, did now shine againe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of their <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
