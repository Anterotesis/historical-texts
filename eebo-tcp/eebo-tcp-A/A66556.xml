            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is not any pleasure in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemick Discourses that hath engaged me in this Contest. A Work of this kind is so far from affording me any true delight, in these declining years of my life, that if so concerning a Truth as I have here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to defend, had not call'd for a seasonable Vindication against the assaults of a Daring Adversary, I could, with much more ease, and better satisfaction to my self, have sat down with silence. I cannot but think, that by all, who take the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greatest
<pb facs="tcp:53782:4"/>
part whereof do better understand their own Language than another; I accounted the Objection less valuable, and so resolved to proceed. But whereas I have here and there reflected upon some passages in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of <hi>Ludovicus Wolzogen,</hi> as they came in my way, I give my Reader to understand, that this ariseth not from any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against the Person of that Noble Author, to whose Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Parentage and excellent Learning I shall ever render all due respects. But finding him to have so plainly injured the cause he undertook, and so unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely treated our most eminent Protestant Authors that have with much Judgment and Solidity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it; I am hopefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb facs="tcp:53782:4"/>
that those few Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions which I have made upon his Writings, will not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Friends of Truth. The intricacy and perplexedness of his Discourse, hath put me to some pains to understand his meaning: for I have not satisfied my self with a slight or transient view: but have perused his Book over and over with intenseness of mind, that I might be sure not to mistake or misrepresent him. And I hope it will appear to the Unprejudiced, upon consulting his Book, and comparing mine with it, that I have done him right. One Advertisement more I must add: <hi>viz.</hi> That my Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the said Authors Book, <hi>De Scripturarum Interprete,</hi> relate to a second Edition of it, as it
<pb facs="tcp:53782:5"/>
stands before his <hi>Censura Censurae:</hi> and threfore the numbers of the Pages cited, are not those on the top of the Leaf, but those in the Margin, relating to the first Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I suppose (for I have not seen it) was Printed in a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Volume.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53782:8"/>
judge it consentaneous to his unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wisdom, to order the Writing of them in such a manner, as that his Mind, in them, might, in the due use of his appointed means be understood by those, for whose use and benefit they were intended: And though the subject matter they treat of be often very deep and misterious, yet the way of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal is very condescending; and what ever is of necessity to our duty and happiness, is obvious to the diligent and humble Inquirer. Nevertheless many passages in these Sacred Records have those difficulties in them, that may exercise the study of the ablest under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings. Now in our searching out the Mind of God in Scripture, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in those darker places, the question is, what course we are to take, and by what Rule we must be guided, that we may not bewilder our selves, or wrong the Scriptures by our mistakes?</p>
                  <p>To prepare the way for a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Question, I must briefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise somewhat touching these three Terms, the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53782:8"/>
of Scripture, and the <hi>Rule</hi> of that Interpretation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> we speak of, is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Volume of Holy Writ, containing all those Books both of the Old and New Testament, that are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be Canonical. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I mean, not the Words or Phrases of Scripture taken singly by themselves; but as they are conjoin'd in Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Sentences; and as those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions stand in such a contexture, and with such a dependence on and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what goes before and after; and as in this Frame and Order they are the Instrument of declaring the Mind of God to Men. Now, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the whole Scripture, though it have the same Divine Original, and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the same ultimate end, yet contains in it great variety of Matter, Doctrine, History, Prophesie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is the two former that we are especially concern'd in; and therefore shall wave the Prophetick part (what is yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>fulfill'd) further than it may fall in with any of the other; the best and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53782:9"/>
most convincing Interpreter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies being the event, unless God should beforehand unfold them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inspiration; which we have not in our days any ground to expect. It is therefore the Doctrinal and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical parts of Scripture that I chiefly intend in this Debate.</p>
                  <p>Interpretation is either Verbal or Real. The former is all one with that which is commonly called Translation. This I shall not meddle with, further, than as it is a necessary requisite to the latter; which is usually called Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which is the opening of the true Sense of Scripture, or unfolding the Mind of God signified to us by those Words and Sentences of Scripture that we are searching into. Now we here suppose two things, which to a sober and considerate Reader need no proof. First, That the Scriptures are not a heap of insignificant Words, or unsens'd Characters, as some late Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists, who cry up Oral Tradition for the only Rule of Faith (so great is the power of prejudice and partial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53782:9"/>
have ridiculously and profanely affirm'd: but that they have a true sense <hi>Originally</hi> and <hi>Essentially</hi> in themselves, given them by their Author when they were first indited. To deny or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, were to impute that to the most Wise God, that common Civility forbids us to charge upon any man of ordinary understanding. Secondly, That the Sense of Scripture is fixt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, not varying with the times, or altering according to the differing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church: which was most absurdly asserted by Cardinal <hi>Cusanus</hi> in <hi>Epistola contra Bohemos;</hi> as I find it attested by many credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <note n="*" place="margin">Flac.

                  <p>The next thing to be considered, is the Rule of Interpretation: By which we can understand no more than the Measure, by agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which we judge of the Sense of the Scripture, whether it be right or wrong, whether it be indeed (what it pretends) the true Sense of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53782:10"/>
under Inquiry, or a mistaken Sense unduely fasten'd upon it. Or, in fewer words, the Rule of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is that which gives us the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Evidence by which the true Sense of Scripture is discern'd, and for which it is received.</p>
                  <p>Here let it be observ'd, that it is one <note place="margin">§ 2.</note> thing to inquire what means we are to use in searching out the Sense of Scripture, and another what is the Rule that must guide us in determining what that Sense is. For though the Rule he also a Means, yet every thing that is to be used as a Means, hath not the place of a Rule. The Means are many, the Rule but one; understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not of any subordinate or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Rule, but of that which is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Autocratorical. For that is the Rule under our present inquiry.</p>
                  <p>The Means subservient to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, are either Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or Special.</p>
                  <p>The General are two, Méditation and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53782:10"/>
1. There must be a fixed intending of the Mind to consider of what we either read in, or hear from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and of whatsoever we meet with that may help us to understand it. This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of, as the daily practice of every Holy-Blessed Man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1, 2. and professeth it of himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 15. 97.</p>
                  <p>But, secondly, there is need of Prayer also for Divine Assistance to enable us to understand the Mind of God aright. This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> used, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 18. 19, 26, 27, 73. Though he had the Copy of the Law by him (according to that command of God which we have upon Record in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19.) and did use daily to read it and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on it; yet he thought not this enough, but begs of God to have his Eyes opened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our discoursed with his Disciples after his Resurrection, concerning Himself and his Sufferings, it is said, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45. that he opened their Undestand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they might understand the Scriptures. He did not only open the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53782:11"/>
Scriptures by External Instruction, as it is said before, <hi>vers.</hi> 27, and 32. But (as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> observes upon the place) he opened their Minds by the Internal Illumination of his Spirit. This the Apostle prays for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and <hi>Colossians (Eph.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9.) though they had the Doctrine of the Scripture already published to them. And the same Apostle writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exhorted him to consider what he had said to him, he adds this Prayer for him, <hi>The Lord give thee understanding in all things.</hi> I would gladly suppose there are none that call themselves Christians, but do own the need and use of Prayer for the understanding of Gods Will: which necessarily carries with it an interpretative acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the need we have of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from God, above our natural abilities to understand the Scriptures. And I do profess my self to have had the better and more honourable esteem of that great Schoolman <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> since I read this of him, that it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53782:11"/>
was his manner, whensoever he was <note place="margin">Lud. Croc. praeloq. in <hi>S.</hi> Theol. c. 3. ex Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dov. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natensis.</note> either to study in private or discourse in publick, to pray fervently to God for assistance, that he might learn of <hi>Him,</hi> what he was to teach others: and that he did candidly acknowledge in secret to his intimate Friend <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus,</hi> that what Divine Knowledge he had, was attained by Prayer, more than by any humane Wit or Labor.</p>
                  <p>But whose expects success in seeking Divine Assistance, it behoves him to bring with him a meek and humble Heart, awed with the holy fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of God and of his Word: For want of which too many have greatly polluted these Holy Mysteries with the wanton conceits or prophane excursions of an unhollwed Wit; and mortally poisoned themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by their corrupt handling this Bread of Life.</p>
                  <p>The Special Means of Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are two-fold. Some are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, which I shall only name, not intending any Discourse about them, because my work lies another way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53782:12"/>
These remote helps are. 1. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of and recourse to the Original Tongues, wherein the Scripture was first penned, with a due observation of the proprieties of each Language. 2. Skil to discern between the proper use of the Words and Phrases of Scripture, and that which is Tropical and Figurative. In these, <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> have their use. 3. Some insight into the peculiar Laws, Customs and Proverbial Speeches of those times and places that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture relates to: which requires some knowledge in History. There are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry passages both in the Old and New Testament, that have respect to the known Customs of the Gentiles, as in their Divinations, Idolatrous Worships, Publick Games, and many more that have relation to the peculiar Rites and Modes of speech in use among the <hi>Jews.</hi> So that there is no part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lology but may have its use in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture. 4. There is great use of the several parts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, not only <hi>moral,</hi> but <hi>natural;</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53782:12"/>
for the clearing of many things in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that are of natural cognisance; as about the structure of Mans Body, and the faculties of the Soul; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, motion, and influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies, the temperament of the several Regions of the World; as also about the Elements and Meteors; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Numbers and Measures; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Properties of several Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Beasts, Birds, and Plants; and many other things treated of in the Bible, either by way of History or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. 5. Logick hath also its use here, for the better discerning the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one thing in Scripture upon another, and collecting of one thing from another.</p>
                  <p>The more immediate Means are chiefly two, 1. A due observation of the several circumstances of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be Interpreted; who it is that speaks, where, &amp; when, and to whom, &amp; upon what occasion. Here also comes in the consideration of the coherents with antecedents and consequences, together with the scope and design of the Speaker:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53782:13"/>
all which are of great use to discover the Sense of Scripture. 2. Comparing Scripture with Scripture, or consulting other Scriptures whether paralel with, or seemingly opposite to the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consideration.</p>
                  <p>Now to the use of all these foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Means or Helps, both General and Special, Remote and Immediate, I think all agree. But about the Rule of Interpretation there is not so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal an accord.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> for the most part will have this Rule to be the Judgment <note place="margin">§ 3.</note> of the present Church, meaning their own. But I shall not deal with this. It's weakness, in what Sense soever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (for they agree not among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) hath been sufficiently discovered by the worthy labours of many, both formerly and of late <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingflect,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tiliot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Some few there are, who tell us, that the Scripture supposes the Rule and Summary of Religion delivered from one Age to another, which we are to be guided by in searching out the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53782:13"/>
of Scripture. And this Rule, they say, is to be found in the Monuments of the Church, that is, in the Writings of the Fathers, and Determinations of Councils; from whence we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sense of the Catholick Church, and thereby know what was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the first Age; and according to that interpret the Scriptures. But if this must be our way of proceeding, we may very well despair of ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Scriptures, except when they speak with so much plainness, that they stand in need of no Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>For what a heap of uncertainties must we lay for the Foundation of our Faith? It is sufficiently known, that the Fathers do oft differ from each other, and many times, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with themselves. Councils have determined contrary one to another. And some things that were (as far as appears to us by all extant Monuments of Antiquity) agreeable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sentiment in our Age, were laid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53782:14"/>
aside in another. Besides, either the far greatest part of the Doctors of the Church in the first Ages wrote nothing, or their Writings are lost: and of those that now go under venerable names, many are plainly spurious, and many dubious; nor is it easie in several of them, for the most sagacious Reader to find out the right. Insomuch as we cannot have any tolerable assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance what was the consentient judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Church in any one age about the whole Doctrine of Faith, if we set the Scriptures aside. Therefore to frame such a Rule of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation as this, is no better than to build a House of Straw upon a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stream. There were very few Writers in the two first Centuries; and in the two following not very many: and after this the Church did much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and degenerate as well in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as Manners. Now suppose we were sure that the Writings in each Age were undoubtedly theirs whose names they bear (as it is past doubt we are not) who can assure us, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53782:14"/>
what was published by those few, was the consentient Judgment of all, or the major part of the Doctors of that Age wherein they lived? Might there not be a greater number differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them, who either wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or whose Works are perished? The plain truth is, That this way of Interpretation does in the upshot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Faith of <hi>Christians,</hi> not into the certain authority of the Divinely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inspired Writings, but into the fallible Testimony of the most uncertain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But for the Readers further satisfaction, I refer him to <hi>Monsieur Daille's learned Treatise about the right use of the Fathers;</hi> a Piece of that worth, that the Lord Vicount <hi>Falkland,</hi> and his dear Friend Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> did highly esteem it, and made great use of it in their Writings against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists;</hi> as we are informed by Mr. <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> (sometime Member of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Colledge in <hi>Cambridge)</hi> in his Epistle prefixed to the <hi>English</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that excellent and elaborate Discourse: who further also tells
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53782:15"/>
us that we have in that Tractat, a sufficient Confutation of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Perron</hi> his Book against King <hi>James,</hi> and by consequence of the Marquis of <hi>Worcester</hi> against King <hi>Charles;</hi> and of Doctor <hi>Vane,</hi> and other Epitomizers of the Cardinal, which I do the rather take notice of, that it may obviate the groundless prejudices that some have of late entertained against that Incomparable Piece.</p>
                  <p>The received Doctrine of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> Churches, both ourown and those abroad hath been hitherto, that the Scripture is its own Interpreter. But of late there hath been an attempt to justle the Scripture aside (as to this use) and place Reason and Phylosophy in its room.

in Theology that <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had done in Philosophy, and professeth that supposing Scripture for the Rule of Faith, all the difference in opinion among Dogmatical Divines (as he calls them, in opposition to Scepticks) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him to arise from hence, that none of them could certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove their Interpretations of Scripture: and that after long inquiry, he found this to be the onely sure and <note place="margin">Ib. cap. 5. par. 1.</note> infallible Rule of Interpretation which himself had now found out; <hi>viz.</hi> the principals of Reason, and dictates of Philosophy. And in this new way (which he glories in the invention of) he professedly declares his dissent from Papists, Protestants, Socinians, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants. <note place="margin">Cap. 16. par. 8.</note> But he bends his greatest force against the Reformed Churches, endeavouring with all his might to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate what they unanimously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning the perspicuity of the Scriptures, and the singularity of the literal Sense, and especially about the Rule of Interpretation.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53782:17"/>
For our more clear proceeding, it is requisite I should explain my meaning before I come to the proof of my As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. Let it therefore be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That Reason may be three ways taken.</p>
                        <p>First, For that power and faculty in Man whereby he is enabled to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, judge, and discourse of such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are presented to his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now this falls under a two-fold conception, according to the two-fold state of Man, Innocent or Fallen. Mans Reason as it was originally, when God first made him, was pure and clear, not clouded or blinded, not depraved or distorted, there was nothing to darken or disturb it. It was then a glorious Beam streaming forth from the Eternal Light. But Mans Apostasie, as it vitiated his other faculties, so it benighted his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and exposed it to further depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the prevalency of disordered Passions and sinfull Lusts. Yet even in this state his Reason is not lost, though it be much corrupted I am far from that late Authors mind, that says, <note n="*" place="margin">Lud. Walzog. in Censura Censur. p. 59.</note> 
                           <hi>Quae fallet, aut falliter ratio, minimè ratio
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53782:18"/>
dicenda. Reason that deceives, or is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is not to be called Reason.</hi> Mans Reason, notwithstanding its pravity, is still kept in a Capacity to understand his greatest Concerns, by the assistance of those gracious aids that God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him; and hath in all ages been of great use for the good of Mankind, in reference both to mens perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and politick affairs. Therefore I need not fear to say, that next to Holiness, Mans Reason is his greatest Glory.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Reason is taken for the exercise of this intellectual Power, in inquiring, discovering, comparing, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects propounded. It is by these actings of our Reason that we search after Truth, and make use of it when we have found it, for the conduct and comfort of our lives: and by these it is that we defend the Truth of God against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ainsayers.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is taken for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reason, known or knowable by natural light. And these are either Natural, or Acquired. The Natural or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53782:18"/>
Primary Principles of Reason are those that carry their own evidence with them &amp; therefore upon the first represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, are forthwith embraced by our Reason, without any Discourse. And they are called Natural, not as being <hi>formally</hi> imprinted, or properly engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our Minds by <hi>Nature</hi> (for we are not born with Actual Knowledge) but because they are <hi>founded</hi> in, and do necessarily <hi>result</hi> from the Nature of things and their mutual Respects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as in a Glass, our Undestanding sees them represented, and is disposed to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to them at the first view. The Secondary or Acquired Principles are those which are not so obvious as the former, but by rational Discourse, are truly and soundly deduced from them.</p>
                        <p>And here falls in the consideration of Philosophy, which is made up of these Principles methodically digested. And by it I understand that true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his Works which is attainable in this mortal state, by the improvement of that Light that is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to the Mind of Man.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53782:19"/>
This, though it be much inferiour to Scripture-Light, yet it is both an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and an advancement, of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; a noble Study, and of excellent use if rightly managed, not only for the beautifying, but the bettering the Mind of Man, and raising it to an high admiration, and humble adoration of that Infinite Being, whose Wisdom, Power, and Goodness is so eminently conspicuous in all the Works of His Hands. And if there be any such in the World (as some say there are) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or reproach sound Philosophy, or the Dictates of Right Reason, as I know them not, so neither shall I plead their cause.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the Case before us,</p>
                        <p>First, It is undeniable, That for the <note place="margin">§ 2.</note> Interpreting of Scripture, there is a necessary use of the Faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the several actings of it, as instrumentally subservient to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Sense of Scripture. Faith doth not exclude Reason, but elevate and advance it by giving it a clearer
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53782:19"/>
light; it doth not silence, but regulate and conduct it. There is nothing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but what is perfectly rational, and suitable to mans intellectual nature. It is to our Rational Powers that the Scriptures are propounded: and as our belief of them is one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est acts of Reason, so it is by our Reason in its due exercise that we search into them, not only to find out the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Words and Phrases of Scripture, and discern the difference between proper and Figurative Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, besides many other things that tend to their Verbal Exposition; but likewise to observe the dependence of one Clause on another, and compare the several parts of Scripture together; thereby it is that we gather Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from Scripture-Principles; and hereby do we instrumentally judge of the Mind of God, as signified to us by the Words of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We also grant, That the Principles of Reason have their use about those things in Scripture that are discoverable by Natural Light;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53782:20"/>
as that there is a God, and that God is to be worshipped; that the Soul is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; that good is to be done, and evil to be avoided; and many such like. But even in these, considered as they are delivered by the Spirit of God in Scripture, I think Reason is not Magisterially and Authoritatively to Judge of them, being (under this notion) to be received as the Decrees of a higher Court, wherein Man's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is but a Servant. In this Case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Reason only gives in its suffrage, and ministerially subscribes, by vertue of its own impressed notions to Scripture-Dictates. <hi>Aquinas</hi> propounding a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <note place="margin">Aqu. 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he plainly gives the pre-eminency to Revelation above Reason, even in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53782:20"/>
the Natural Principles of Religion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I grant that there is great use of Natural Principles in points of pure Revelation, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew that these are not against sound Reason, and to disprove the objections that are made against them from a pretended contrariety to Natural Light. It was no small advantage to the <hi>Christian</hi> Cause in the Primitive Times, that the Ancient Fathers in their Apologies for the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> against the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosophers, turned their own Weapons upon them, and repelled their absurd Cavils by their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Maxims.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, I further grant, that no Sense of Scripture is to be admitted for genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, if we do indeed find it to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inconsistent with or contradictory unto any true and undoubted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Reason. For God, who is the Author of all truth, as well natural as supernatural, cannot contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This, I confess, is a very ticklish point, and calls for great wariness and circumspection; it being so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>asie and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53782:21"/>
so ordinary for Men to be swayed by Imagination, Interest, and Prejudice, to call that Reason which is as far from being so, as midnight is from being high noon. And Men may, through Ignorance, Incogitancy, or Pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, suppose a contradiction where there is none. Nevertheless, this we may safely say, that whatsoever is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and undeniably proved to be a Principle of Reason, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Scripture that really contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it.</p>
                        <p>But, Fifthly, The Knot of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie lies here, whether Humane Reason by its own Natural Principles, or those Philosophical Axioms that are thence deduced, as its Supream Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Rule, must guide and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us in examining and deciding what is the Sense of those parts of Scripture that are purely of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation? And this is that which is here denied.</p>
                        <p>The affirmative is maintained by <note place="margin">§ 3.</note> some: and indeed it seems to be the great <hi>Helena</hi> of that sort of Men,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53782:21"/>
who have imbibed the new Divinity of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and the Foundation of all their <hi>Heterodoxies:</hi> upon this account it is that they so vehemently oppose the Trinity of Persons in the Godhead, the Eternal Deity of our Lord Jesus, the Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of the Holy Ghost, the Doctrines of Original Sin, of the Satisfaction of Christ, and Justification by his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteousness; with sundry other material points, that are commonly called to the Bar of Humane Reason by these Doctors of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Faith. Not that they have any sound Reason on their side: for their Novelties are extremely irrational, as hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly demonstrated by those ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Authors that have dealt with them. But trusting to their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and its Dictates in matters so far above Nature, this hath led them into these dangerous precipices.</p>
                        <p>True it is (whether in pretence to blind the Eyes of others, or out of the conviction of Truth, or out of the usual fate of Error to contradict it self) these Men sometimes let fall that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53782:22"/>
which carries with it a fair appearance of disclaiming the Judgment of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Matters of Faith: as may be seen in their great Master <hi>Socinus</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Author. Script. cap. 1. p. 16 &amp;c. 4. p. 66. &amp; 71.</note>. And such passages in him and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers may possibly give some colour to the Exercitator to charge the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines with wronging the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in saying they make Mans Reason the Rule of Interpretation <note n="*" place="margin">Phil Scr. Int. cap. 16 par. 7. &amp; 8.</note> (for himself seems to be ambitious of the honour of finding this out) and it may be they have no where asserted it <hi>in Terminis,</hi> or spoken it out so broadly as this Gentleman hath done. But notwithstanding all this flourish, when they argue against the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Doctrines, received upon clear Scripture-warrant by all the Christian Churches in the World, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Christianity; their grand objection is drawn from Reason, to which they appeal in all these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies as to their Oracle; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon set their Wits at work to wrest and winde the Scriptures (alledged in defence of those Doctrines) every way
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53782:22"/>
they can imagine, to evade their plain meaning, and fasten on them a Sense of their own making, suitable to their beloved Maxims. Besides many other passages there are of that Party that discover what their Mind is in this point.</p>
                        <p>But these are not the first that set this presumptuous Doctrine on foot. I find it laid to the charge of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees (as irrational and absurd as their Conceptions were) that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly suspended the Articles of Faith upon the judgment of Reason, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Men to believe nothing but what they could prove by Reason.

                        </argument>
                        <p>NOW that Reason or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy cannot in the Sense given, be <note place="margin">§ 1.</note> the Scriptures Interpreter, I prove by the following Arguments:</p>
                        <p>First, Man's Reason, though fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the best Principles and <note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> richest Endowments, that Nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords it in this lapsed State, is so dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and depraved, that it not only is much disabled for apprehending the things of God, but sets it self against
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53782:23"/>
them; and therefore it is not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by its own Principles to interpret Scripture-Doctrines.</p>
                        <p>Something Natural Light discovers of God; but al as! how little? The Principles of Natural Knowledge are but general and confused, not sufficient to guide Man in the things of greatest concernment. It teacheth Man that there is a God; but when he comes to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what an one He is, how lame and imperfect, how unsuitable and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming are Mens natural apprehensions of him! The Apostle says, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. that, <hi>in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God.</hi> Where he means not the rude and ignorant multitude, but the wisest and most accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Natural Abilities: these, with the study of Philosophy (which is the consideration of Gods infinite Wisdom in Creating and Governing the World) did not arrive at the right knowledge of God. The same Apostle tells us of the unconverted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Eph. 4. 18. <hi>that they had their understandings dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and were alienated from the life of

                        <p>But let us hear what the Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <note place="margin">Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 2.</note> says to this place. <hi>The Apostle,</hi> says he, <hi>speaks not here of a Man that by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Phil. Scr. Int. cap. 7. par. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Light hath attain'd the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth and Goodness; for a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53782:26"/>
truely wise Man never censures what he does not discern; whereas the Man here spoken of, is one that knows not the things of the Spirit, and yet accounts them foolishness; which cannot be meant of the true Philosopher; for such an one suspends his judgment of things till such time as he hath attained a clear and distinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of them. Therefore the Apostle must needs be understood either of a man utterly ignorant, or of one that follows the sway of his blind affections. Such an one,</hi> says he, <hi>receives not Spiritual Things, that is, the things that belong to the Rational Soul, which is a Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this (passing by so much of it as <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> is met with already in the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception) I answer several things.</p>
                        <p>First, Whereas he says, that by the Animal or Natural Man is not meant he that hath by Natural Light attain'd the right knowledge of truth and goodness. I say so too; for the Apostle means by it, one that hath no other than natural light in searching after truth and goodness; who may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therefore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53782:26"/>
easily, yea who will certainly mistake, having no better guide.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Whereas he says, a true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher never is rash in his censure of things, but always suspends his judgment till he hath attained a clear perception of them, and that therefore such an one cannot be thought to judge the things of the Spirit foolishness before he know them; this is all one, as if he had said a true Philosopher is a Chimaera: for (it seems) he is one who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines of any thing till he clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives what it is, and then what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines is undoubtedly true: whence it will follow, that every true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher is infallible. And where was such an one ever yet to be found? Certain it is, that the most eminent Philosophers (not inferior in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Learning to this Exercitator, or any of his Companions) did in the first breaking out of the Gospel, make a mock of the whole Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. Thus did the Philosophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> when they heard St. <hi>Paul:</hi> and thus did <hi>Porphyrie, Celsus,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53782:27"/>
others, after the Apostles dayes.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, When this Author will have no more meant here by things Spiritual, but things belonging to the Rational Soul, which is a Spirit; he is grosly over-seen, to speak no worse. For the Apostles words are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the things of the Spirit of God: which certainly is not the Soul of Man, but the Holy Ghost. And when the Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> describes the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, or natural, by <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Spirit, surely he did not mean they had no Rational Soul; but that they were destitute of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Spirit of Grace. And that of this Spirit the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is to be understood in the place under present consideration, the whole tenour of his Discourse, from <hi>vers.</hi> 9, to 15. doth undeniably manifest: If at least (by this Gentlemans good leave) the Scripture might be allowed to interpret it self.</p>
                        <p>The wofull ignorance and pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness concerning the things of God, that <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>

discovered it self in the wisest and best civilized part of the World, and such as had improved their natural light to as high a pitch as any other we can read of, is an abundant evidence of what I assert concerning the darkness and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Mans Reason. They became (as the Apostle says) vain in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their foolish heart was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 22. They acknowledged a Deity, and that God was to be worshipped: but in the manner and way of worship, how wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully were they mistaken! yea those times and places that were best culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and that flourished most in all Humane Learning, were of all other the most sottish in their Idolatrous Worships, giving religious adoration to Brute Creatures, to Dumb Pictures, to Diseases and Humane Passions, yea to Hellish Furies. And whereas, some that were more sagacious than the rest (as <hi>Socrates, Cicero,</hi> and such like) saw enough to condemn that way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that was then in use (observing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53782:28"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>They had what is indelibly planted in all men a desire of happiness: but they were miserably bewilder'd in their search after it. And whereas they were, some of them, sensible of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blow that Man's Nature had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, discerning a Combat in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves between their Reason and their Sensual Appetite; and saw the World generally over-run with wickedness, and consequently vexed with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual succession of calamities; yet as they could never by natures light find out the source and spring of all this, and what it was that first brought sin and sorrow upon Mankind; so in vain did they weary themselves in inventing ways of reconciling themselves to God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53782:28"/>
and procuring his Favour, whom they saw to be displeased, and of curing the Maladies of their disordered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed Natures: in both which they took such strange and horrid cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as did but increase the evil they lay under, and exceedingly multiply their own guilts. Now it being thus, how can the Principles of Reason and Philosophy be a safe Rule, whereby to interpret the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <q>It will be said, That this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds of Man's Reason, while <note place="margin">Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1.</note> he is destitute of the Written Word; but reacheth not them who have the Scriptures to enlighten them.</q>

                        <p>To pass by other Answers that may be gathered from what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note place="margin">Sol.</note> said; This Exception yields the Cause: For it supposeth Man's Reason unable to discover the Mind of God without Scripture Light. And if so, then whatsoever Revealed Truth is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53782:29"/>
more darkly delivered in any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one part of Scripture, must receive light from the Scripture it self somewhere else, where it speaks more plainly: without which Man's Reason (notwithstanding the best Natural Principles to assist it) would leave him at a loss: consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not the principles of Reason and Philosophy that must be the Rule of Interpretation, but the Scripture it self, as shall be shewn hereafter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But, say some, when we say Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">§ 2.</note> by its Principles is to Interpret Scripture, we mean it of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <note place="margin">Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 2.</note> proceeding upon sound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and not of Reason depraved, and Principles corrupted.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I answer, these are smooth Words, but what do they signifie? There were <note place="margin">Sol.</note> some colour for this reply, if uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Reason (either in the Faculty or the Principles) were infallibly to be found. The Exception speaks of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>abstractly</hi> and in the <hi>Idea,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it freed from all those depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and entanglements that have cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53782:30"/>
and debased it: Whereas we are speaking of Reason as it is in Men, who are to make use of it. And we know what is said of Man, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. God saw that the wickedness of Man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onely evil continually.</hi> Every Man is thus depraved from his birth; so that we have all need of renewing in our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est faculties, <hi>in the Spirit of our Mind, Eph.</hi> 4. 23. And this original depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is increased by a farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted malignity through vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and deceitfulness of sinfull lusts. In the <hi>most</hi> it remains wholly thus: and in the <hi>best</hi> in this life it is but in part renew'd; and therefore in danger to mistake, and that grosly, in things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, when it goes to work onely by its own natural Principles. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may be thought or said, there is no danger so long as Reason performs it works aright: I reply, how shall that be known? by what Rule shall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and find out when Reason pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a right judgment? or how shall the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53782:30"/>
Principles that Reason pretends to use in matters of Revelation, be tryed, if not by the Scriptures? Shall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Word of God be brought to the Bar of Man's Reason, and be tryed by its Dictates? and shall these Dictates of our lame and imperfect Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in things of God and Eternity be uncontrolable, and admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any debate in matters of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, as if they were the only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeLaw, over-ruling all supernatural discoveries of God's Will? do we not know that mens conceptions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principles of Reason are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?

                        <p>This is certain, that sundry Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of old, who were cried up for Men of strong Reason, and many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men of late, who profess a high esteem of Reason, and frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to that, in their <hi>Novel Opinions,</hi> are chargeable with many gross absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in their Tenets, inconsistent with the plainest principles of natural light. Yea, are not many learned <hi>Atheists</hi> reckoned, by themselves and others, great Masters of Reason?

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53782:31"/>
in <hi>Weigelius</hi> and his Followers, and a late <hi>Carmelite</hi> Frier; beside what <hi>Aristotle</hi> says of some ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Great is Mans proneness to judge according to his inclinations and interests. It's a known observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Such as a Man is, such he thinks God to be.</hi> And according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing bent of his Heart, so are his Conceptions of Truth or Falshood. And it was an old complaint, <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum esse volumus quae nostra sunt.</hi> Be it therefore granted, that there are some common Maxims wherein all agree, being such as shine by their own light, and which the Scriptures always sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: Yet these are so <hi>general</hi> and so <hi>few,</hi> that they will not reach far, to be sure not beyond those things that are merely natural. And as for those acquired Principles that are drawn by deduction from the former, there is so great variety of Mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions concerning them, that they cannot be allowed in this case for a sufficient or tolerable Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For in these we see that those
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53782:32"/>
who are for determining all by Maxims of Reason, are greatly at odds amongst themselves; and some in that variety must needs err, if not all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But perhaps it will be said, That Mens Expositions of Scripture are <note place="margin">Inst.</note> likewise various, and many times erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; and yet the Scripture is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, because that is always the same and incorrupt; so though Mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions about the Principles of Reason be various and mistaking, yet the Principles themselves are the same all the World over, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in all Ages uncorrupt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may well be admitted for a Rule.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I answer:</p>
                        <p>As the Scriptures are the same and incorrupt (notwithstanding Mens va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">Sol.</note> and erroneous apprehensions and Interpretations) so we can tell where to find them, and have recourse to them, and consult with them: they are a standing Record open and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our search. But for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53782:32"/>
of Reason in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they lie <hi>fundamentally</hi> in the nature of things; yet if we lay Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aside, they are not to be found <hi>formally</hi> existing any where but in the Minds and Writings of Men, who are confessed to be various, and liable to mistake: and accordingly Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are variously conceived, and may be dangerously perverted: so that if we had not the Scriptures as a surer Test to try all by, we should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at great uncertainty, and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger of miscarrying. For I take it to be a certain Truth, that the Bible is the most perfect comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Principles of Religion, as well Natural as Supernatural: Nor know I any of the former of these (for of the latter no question is made) but what is more evidently and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be seen in the Scripture than in any other Record whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But Reason, say some, is of God, <note place="margin">§. 3. Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 3.</note> and therefore cannot deceive us.</q>

                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53782:33"/>
I answer:</p>
                        <p>1. Our Senses also are of God, and yet they may and do deceive us. 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s <note place="margin">Sol.</note> Reason was of God; and yet that deceived him, even in his first state, much more may ours now. 3. Though Man's Reason be of God (both as to the faculty and all its sound Principles) yet every thing that Man's Reason sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth is not of God. There is (as the Philosophers complained) a <gap reason="foreign">

And how shall I know whether that which pretends to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to be of God, be so indeed, but by bringing it to the Test of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where God hath made known his Mind about Matters of Religion: (for of them I speak) more plainly and more fully than by the clearest Beams of Natural Light.</p>

Understanding it of sound Reason, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> this is all granted. But then let it be considered. 1. That every thing is not to be accounted contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that Reason cannot reach. 2. The former difficulty recurrs; How or where shall we be assured that what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for sound Reason, is so indeed, excepting self-evident Principles, which are, as I said but General and Few) where shall it be tried? seeing there have been, and are many <hi>Maxims</hi> or <hi>Axioms</hi> commonly received among learned Men, that will not hold. 3. What if there be no contrariety, but only an appearance thereof? It doth not therefore follow, that Scripture is to be controll'd by Reason: but if there seem any opposition, the dictates of Reason are to be reduced and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Scripture. For the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reason (such I mean as are true and sound) may carry an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing opposition to some Scripture Assertions, because perhaps the said Principles though generally received,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53782:34"/>
do admit of some limitations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions, which through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and imperfection of our Reason, we are not aware of. In this case it were bold and dangerous to bend the Scripture to those Principles. That which is variable and fallible is to be over-ruled by that which is fixed and unerring, as the Holy Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is: and whatsoever is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contrary to the Voice of God speaking in this Sacred Volume, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretence it may have of Reason or Philosophy, it is but <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>MY second Argument is, That there is no proportion between Mans <note place="margin">§ 1. Arg. 2.</note> Reason, and the Mysteries of Divine Revelation. These are so sublime, they are out of the ken of a Natural Understanding; they are of a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind from the highest Natural Principles. How little is it that Mans Reason by its own Light can discover of the Nature of God, and his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counsels. The Heathen, who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scripture Light, did but grope as Men in the dark, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27. How greatly are we to seek in judging of the Wisdom, and Goodness, and Power, and Justice of God, if we have no higher light than Natural Reason to direct us? Nor need this seem strange, when we see how much the most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53782:35"/>
Men are at a loss concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the nature and faculties of the Soul, and the manner of its union with the Body, and how little insight they have into many of the <hi>minuta naturae.</hi> Can it then be wondred that Mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should be unable by its own light to have a clear view of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that are infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible? Whence was it that so many of the wisest Heathens were so gravell'd at the proceedings of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, when they saw good Men suffer, and bad Men prosper? How did <hi>Cato,</hi> that severe Moralist, stumble at the success that <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had against <hi>Pompey?</hi> But what shall we say to that great Mistery of Mans Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Christ?</hi> The line of Mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is too short to reach these <gap reason="foreign">

of Angels. It is true, that all Men could not but know God to be very good; they found it and felt it in the daily effects of his sustaining and preserving Providence, and his wonderful patience and forbearance towards them: and they did know also that God is Just, and a Righteous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of Sin; this they might see in the Judgments that he brought upon the World, beside the inward witness of their own accusing Consciences. <hi>The wrath of God was revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of Men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18.

But now how to reconcile these two, the Goodness of God to his Creatures, and his severe Indignation against Sinners, so as with any satisfaction to hope for pardon and acceptance with him; here their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason faill'd them. They saw themselves in a very ill case, and that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53782:36"/>
there was a necessity of somewhat to appease the provoked Anger of the Divine Majesty; but how or which way this should be, they could not tell; and therefore lost themselves in a Maze of infinite Mistakes in their attempts about it. Now it being so, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that Reason by its Natural Principles should be a competent Judge of Scripture-Revelations. It must therefore submit its own conceptions and Dictates to the Doctrine of Faith contained in the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Here possibly it will be replied (as <note place="margin">§ 2. Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> before to the precedent Argument) <q>That all this may be granted of those that enjoyed not the Gospel and Written Word: but where this is, Reason may be allowed to judge and determine by its Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things there revealed.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I answer two things:</p>
                        <p>First, This implies a contradiction; <note place="margin">Sol. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> for it is not the Words or Sentences of Scripture that reveal any Mistery to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53782:37"/>
us further than thereby the Mind of God is made known to us. Now if this cannot be found out from the Scripture it self, but from Principles of Reason, then it is Reason it self that first discovers the Mistery. I grant that Reason (that is the faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) is and must be the instrument whereby we apprehend what God speaks in the Scripture. But if there be any part of Scripture so dark, as that its meaning cannot be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Words, neither conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by themselves, nor compared with other Passages of Sacred Writ; I would know how comes Reason in Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such an obscure place (supposing it to be obscure) to find that such and such Words so placed do contain in them such an Assertion, when the Words and Sentences themselves cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve us? You'll say, our Reason tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us by the light of its own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions, that this and no other must be the meaning of such a place. Is it not then plain, that Human Reason fetcheth that Truth (if it be a Truth)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53782:37"/>
from it self, and not from the Scriptures? For the Scripture (according to this Hypothesis) gives an, uncertain sound, onely Reason determines it. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we are speaking of matters of pure Revelation. Now if the Sentences of Scripture under debate do neither by themselves, nor with the help of any other, clearly and certainly signifie any such thing as is fasten'd upon them; such Arguers cannot say, they have it by Divine Revelation, unless they will pretend to that Enthusiastick Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they profess to decry, and falsly charge upon their Opposites.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I add further, that there are sundry things revealed in Scripture, whereof God gives us no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son than his own Will. And if our Reason will not rest satisfied with that, it will but weary it self in fruitless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and dangerously miscarry by its bold determinations. For instance, what account can our Reason give why God should provide a Saviour for lost Man, and none for the lapsed Angels? Why he should cloath his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53782:38"/>
only begotten Son with our disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured nature, and expose him to so bitter Sufferings for the Sin of Man? Why he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> severely punish the Crucifiers of his Son, when what they did was fore-determined by himself, in order to Mans Salvation? And why he should suffer so much wickedness to be done, which himself hates, and could, if he pleased, by his Almighty Power hinder? These and many more such instances might be given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mans Reason is puzzl'd, as not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing wherein it can acquiesce, but the Will and pleasure of God that thus it should be. Again, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we should believe him upon his naked Word, though we know not which way that which he says can be; And accordingly he so manifests to us his Mind, that he will not gratifie our vanity or pride in resolving the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and satisfying the objections that our curiosity may start about the Truth revealed. It is enough for us to know what he hath said, and to take it upon the Authority of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53782:38"/>
word without asking <hi>how</hi> or <hi>why?</hi> And it is indeed the highest Reason imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we should give absolute cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to what he speaks <note n="*" place="margin">

How dangerous and deceitfull a thing it is to affirm any thing for certain either of the Nature or Will of God, beyond what we have in Holy Writ, by the sole conduct of Humane Reason, we are taught by the many dissentient opinions, not only of Schools, but of particular Philosophers among themselves. Nor is this any great wonder; for if they ran out into very differing apprehensious when they disputed about the nature of their own Mind, much more must it needs be so with those who are desirous to determine any thing concerning that Supreme Mind that is so far above us. If prudent Men count it dangerous to search into the Counsels of Kings, which by all our search we cannot discover; who is there so sagacious, as can hope by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures to find out what God will do, among those things that depend upon his meer pleasure.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>IN the third place, If the Sense of <note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> Scripture be to be regulated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Natural Principles, then the last resolution of a Mans Faith in those points (as to the formal object of it) will be into Man himself and the dictate of his own Reason. For the ultimate reason or ground of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in this case will not be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God, speaking in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but the Voice of our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, persuading us from its own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when we can see nothing in the Words of Scripture to require it. And this plainly falls in with the absurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Quakers: who commonly profess to own nothing that is laid down in the Bible, as the Mind of God, but what is witnessed by the light within them. Which is no more in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53782:40"/>
other terms than this, That they will take nothing from the Scripture but what is agreeable to their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

                              <hi>A fourth Argument from another absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> viz. <hi>That in Matters of pure Revelation the Mind of God may be better known by Natural Light than by Scripture; Or that all supernatural Revelation is to be shut out.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>FOurthly, It will follow from this supposal, That in matters of pure <note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> Revelation, the Mind of God may be better known by the common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Natural Light, than by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures: which carries with it a palpable contradiction. For matters of pure Revelation are supposed to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural; and if these as laid down in Scripture, cannot be understood from the Scripture it self, but must have such a Sense given them, as the Maxim of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason shall determine; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not Revelation, but Reason that discovers them: And so what need will there be of Scripture. Indeed this conceit looks very like that absurd dotage of <hi>Weigelius</hi> (if it be not the same with it) that Mans knowledge of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53782:41"/>
all things whatsoever must be fetcht from within himself, &amp; not from without. <hi>Tenôris</hi> (says he) <hi>&amp; omnia nôris; omnia enim es, non minus quam Deus.</hi>

And that this lies at the bottom of the Exercitators Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I find reason enough to suspect, if not conclude For (besides what he says in his sixth Chapter, the first Paragraph which I shall wave insisting on) in his Epilogue at the end of his Book, he propounds an Objection against his whole Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <q>That if Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy be the Rule of Interpreting the Holy Scripture, then the Scripture is useless and written to no purpose: for seeing the truth of all the Senses of Scripture, which are to be search'd out and tryed by Philosophy, must first be perceived before they be drawn out and examined, to what end is it that we should have recourse to Scripture to learn any thing from it. This is the Objection which himself makes against his own Position.</q> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53782:41"/>
whereto he runs out into a long Harangue of words, and (as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) propounds a frivolous distinction, and tedrously dilates upon it to amuse his Reader. But the sum of all comes to this, That the words of Scripture are of no further use than as they are signs of conceptions and things; and under that consideration they cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, unless the things signified by them be first known, at least in some gross and confused manner. Whereof he gives us this instance, that where we sind in Scripture that <hi>God is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient,</hi> we cannot understand this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we first know what <hi>God</hi> is, and what <hi>Omniscience</hi> is. Therefore, says he, all the benefit that any can get by any Book that is written, is but this, that it stirs up the Mind of the Reader to reflect upon the clear and distinct <hi>Idea's</hi> of those things in his Mind which the Book treats of; not that the Book can, of it self bring him to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, much less that it can beget any clear or distinct <hi>Ideas</hi> in his Mind which were not there before. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53782:42"/>
thus he tells us it is with the Scripture; all the use of it is to stir up the Reader or Hearer to think of the things that it propounds, and inquire into them, and examine them whether they be so as they are there propounded; and that they may do this, they must make use of Philosophy to try what is there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Therefore (adds he) the Scripture is to be used, not that it should of it self inform us in the truth, or render the truth more clear and distinct, or make it more firm to us; but that it may give us occasion and matter of meditating on those things which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps otherwise we should never have minded. Therefore (says he still) the utility and excellency of the Scriptures above other Books consists onely in this, That the things it speaks of are of so great concernment to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting blessedness; not for any use they are of to instruct us in the Truth. This is all the use that he allows the Scripture: from whence I think will inevitably follow that he owns the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of no knowledge of God or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53782:42"/>
Religion but what is natural. And so all supernatural Revelation, or at least all necessity of it is denied. And if there be no other use of the Written Word but what this Author assigns it, its put into the same rank with a Crucifix, or a Deaths Head. Indeed the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his Book, and of that other <note place="margin">Tractatus Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-politicus</note> Tract that is prefixed to its latter Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (written, as is supposed, by the same Author) is utterly to undermine and overthrow the credit of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. We need not wonder that he so often derides and calumniates the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Doctrine of the Spirits internal il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the Mind, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in curing the indisposition of the Subject, and fitting it for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Heavenly Things: (of which more hereafter in an Appendix to my present Discourse) when he will not allow the necessity of so much as an Enternal Light for the Revelation of Supernatural Objects, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging no such things. And he that is thus principled, must needs be very ignorant of himself, and of the ruines

that Sin hath made among the whole Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the woful depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mans Nature by his first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie. But for the Readers full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about the necessity of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation, I dare commend to his perusal (besides many other useful Discourses that might be named) that excellent Piece of the Eminently-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd Sir <hi>Charles Wolsly,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Reasonableness of Scripture Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>

anew by this Engine. The heretical Blasphemies of <hi>Servetus</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> which sprang up of late years; and those of the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> that infested the Church in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; together with the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some impurities of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (who esteemed themselves the only knowing Men, or to speak in the new mode, the onely <hi>Rational Divines)</hi> have fair way made them by this Trim Device.</p>
                        <p>First, Let us instance in Matters of Faith, whatsoever is said in Scripture about the Creation of the World, the Conception of our Saviour in a Virgins Womb, the Personal Union of the two Natures, the Resurrection of the Body at the last Day; these, with many more that might be named, let them be brought to the Bar of Reason, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its Principles (as they are to be found in the Minds of Men) and what will it come to? We have seen already what use some Men have made of this way to subvert the weightiest Truths of the Gospel.</p>

                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53782:44"/>
But here it will be excepted perhaps <note place="margin">Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> by some, <q>That the Fundamentals of Christian Religion being clear and plain in Scripture, there is no fear of this inconvenience.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I answer:</p>
                        <p>First, If Divine Revelations must be <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> no otherwise received or understood, than as Men see ground for them in their own Reason, the plainest and clearest Doctrines of Scripture will be rejected. I shall here give two Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as I find them quoted by a late learned Author. The one is of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who says, <hi>That he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>

                           <hi>Christ to have satisfied for our Sins, though he should read it once and again in Scripture; the infallibility of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer not being sufficient to establish it, unless he had declared it by its causes and effects, and so satisfied Mens Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son concerning the possibility of it. Smalcius</hi> is the other, who says, <hi>That</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hom. 8. on John 1.</note> 
                           <hi>he would not believe the Incarnation of the Son of God, though he should meet

                           <hi>that in case any such unchangeableness of Gods love (viz.</hi> as should assure the Saints infallible perseverance) <hi>were to be found in, or could regularly be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Scriptures, it were a just ground to any considering Man to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Authority, or whether they were from God or no.</hi> And a late Belgick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator, having affirmed that the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <note place="margin">Tract.

The experience of the present age puts it past all denial or dispute, that when Men have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poused an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> which they are not willing to relinquish, they will quarrel with the most evident Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, accusing it of obscurity; and to make their charge good, they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by their strain'd glosses, to raise a dust, and darken the Sense of it, though it shine never so clearly by its own light to every impartial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader. Hence it is that the Papists do so frequently with open mouth charge the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> with obscurity in his Writings; because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he speaks more clearly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than they would have him, for that great Doctrine of Justification by the imputed Righteousness of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53782:46"/>
against Justification by our own Works. And it may be, some will be as ready to find fault with the same Apostle, when he says, <hi>Ephes. 5. 18. Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is excess; but be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Spirit:</hi> as speaking too darkly; because indeed they think he speaks too broadly against the debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery that they practice; and so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Spirit, which they scorn and deride.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Nay more, some are grown to that heighth (as I shall have occasion <note place="margin">3.</note> to shew more fully in my second Part) as to assert that the Scripture is plain in nothing, but universally obscure; and make this their great ground for their setting up Reason and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy as the Rule to determine the Sense of the Bible. And let this be granted them, they will soon make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speak whatsoever themselves please: and so the Bible shall be but as a dead Image, and Mans depraved Reason like the <hi>Daemon</hi> within shall give the Oracle.</p>

                           <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53782:46"/>
2. Come we next to matters of <note place="margin">§ 2.</note> Practice. It is easie to instance in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral commands of God in Scripture, that are directly opposite to the whole corrupt interest of lapsed nature: As, when he requires the mortifying of our earthly desires, the love of our deadliest Enemies, the denying our of selves in whatsoever is dear to us in this World, even to the laying down of our lives for the defence of his Truth, upon the bare hope of an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible happiness in another World. Now considering how Mans Reason is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and enslav'd, and no where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, if Mens Reason must by its own Principles interpret the Sense of Scripture, how numerous are the objections that will be made against these and all other Precepts that are not to the <hi>Gust</hi> of Mans degenerate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Thus did the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> of old plead for denying the Faith in persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting times to save their life: for <hi>what!</hi> (said they) <hi>Doth God delight in the death of Men? he stands in no need of our Bloud: Christ came to save Mens
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53782:47"/>
lives, and not to expose them to hazard.</hi> And with these reasonings they shisted off the-command of owning the Truth in the face of danger. And what the Author of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> hath written of this, with a specious, though falaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of Reason, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
                        <p>But I shall instance in two extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary commands given to particular persons. The one is that which God did by immediate Revelation give to <hi>Abraham,</hi> requiring him to offer up his <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> onely Son <hi>Isaac</hi> for a Burnt-offering. What would the Principles of Natural Reason have said to this, might they have been admitted to interpret this Command. <q>What? Can infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness require such an unnatural act as this, for a Father to lay violent hands on his own Child? Hath not God strictly forbidden Murder? Hath he not always manifested his tender regard to the life of Man? And hath he not planted that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection in the Heart of a Parent, that makes him abhor to embrue his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53782:47"/>
hands in Childs Bloud? Therefore surely (would Mans Reason say) the meaning of this injunction is something else, far different from what the words seem to sound: there is some more mysterious sense to be found out, and a milder interpretation to be made of this Divine Oracle, such as may consist with those Notions of God which we are taught by that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light that shines in the Hearts of all Men. It is most rational there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to interpret it by an Allegory; <hi>Isaac</hi> must be sacrific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d <hi>in Effigie,</hi> or a Lamb out of the Flock must have <hi>Isaac</hi>'s name put upon it, and so offer'd up to God: or (according to the notation of his name) we must sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that joy and delight that we have had in our Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> wherein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we have exceeded, by mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our affectious to him, and have him hereafter as if we had him not.</q> The other instance shall be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given by our Saviour to the Rich young Man, to sell all, and give to the Poor, and follow Him in hopes of a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53782:48"/>
Treasure in Heaven. We may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly suppose, by the Mans turning his back, what objections his Reason made against it. <q>Are not my Possessions the good Gifts of God? and shall I unthankfully cast away what he hath given me? I am to love my Neighbor as my self; therefore surely not to strip my self of my subsistence to help my Neighbor, and so lose the use and benefit of what I have.</q> True, here is a plain Command. But could not this mans Reason have excogitated some hidden Sense to satisfie the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet save his Goods? Yes sure, had the Man learnt but this new Art of Interpreting that some have got now adays, he might have thought within himself, <q>That selling all was the disengaging of his affections from them; and giving to the poor, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them in a convenient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so as still to preserve his Estate; and follow <hi>Christ</hi> he might in a good and holy life, though he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways personally attend him.</q> But now would not this way of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53782:48"/>
in either of the forenamed instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have been a plain eluding of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command? And yet I am sure the bold attempts of some in our Age, who are great Pretenders to Reason, have in sundry considerable and clear Points of Religion, gone as far as this comes to, and much further, in torturing the Scriptures into a Sense as contrary to that which they fairly give us of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as darkness is to light. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the help of this Engine, what will not be adventured by auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wits, that have cast off the awe of God, and of his holy Word; Men whose glory it is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>? Let but others follow the Tract that some have already trodden out to them, and they will make the whole Bible one great Cipher, utterly insignificant of his Mind and Will by whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it was endited; and that which <hi>Erasmus</hi> feared in his time, <hi>Ne sub ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentu priscae literaturae caput erigere ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet Paganismus,</hi> may be unhappily fulfilled in our days.</p>

                           <q>That the next and immediate Sense of the Scripture is manifold, and whatsoever Truths occur to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Mind in the perusal of any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are all to be taken for the true intended sense and meaning of that Scripture: and Philosophy being the true, certain, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knowledge of the nature of things demonstratively deduced from the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53782:51"/>
Principles of Natural Light; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this the several Truths that lie in the Scripture, may be best drawn out and demonstrated, and all false Interpretations discovered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently this is the infallible Rule of Interpretation.</q> This is the Sum of his Argument. For answer, Here are <note place="margin">Sol.</note> many things crowded together in this captious <hi>Sorites,</hi> which must be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly discussed, that the vanity and folly of the whole may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He supposes the immediate Sense <note place="margin">1.</note> of Scripture to be manifold, and that one and the same Sentence of Scripture affords great variety of different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. This I deny: and do maintain with the consentient Judgment of the Reformed Churches, that the Sense of Scripture is but one. Thus much I grant:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there may be varions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications or accommodations made of one and the same Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eral Sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, so it be done with due caution; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o otherwise can that threefold
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53782:52"/>
Sense which some speak of, <hi>Allegoricla, Anagogical, Tropological,</hi> be allowed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That one single Sentence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may and frequently doth contain many very weighty Truths in it; but these are not <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> Senses of the same Proposition; this is but one; the rest are but either some <hi>Specials</hi> included in their <hi>General,</hi> or some deductions from Scripture Assertions, as of Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from their Principles wherein they are virtually comprehended.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I further grant, That sundry pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Scripture (especially in the Old Testament) have a mystical Sense besides the Literal; to wit, when one thing is propounded as a Type repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting somewhat else. But then the thing signified by the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is but one, namely, that onely which the Literal Sense exhibits, which propounds the Type. The Antitype is not signified by the words in those Scriptures, but by the Type, which those words do immediately speak of. For example, when we find in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 8, 9. how by God's command <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53782:52"/>
set up a Brazen Serpent upon a Pole for the Bitten <hi>Israelite</hi> to look on that he might be heal'd; these words that relate the History, signifie no more than what they literally import. But the Brazen Serpent there spoken of did indeed signifie somewhat else; for it did tipically represent the future Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of <hi>Christ</hi> for the Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as our Saviour himself hath taught us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                        <p>Indeed this conceit of the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Senses serves our Exercitators turn very well, because it helps to render the Scripture <hi>ambiguous</hi> and thereby obscure; and that is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal strength of his Cause; of which I shall speak hereafter in due place. Mean while let us see what he hath to say for this fancy.</p>
                        <p>Two kinds of proof he uses, the one from Reason, the other from the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. cap. 4. par. 4.</note> of learned Men. His Reasons are drawn from Gods Omniscience and Veracity. God perfectly knows all the several significations of the words that he hath uttered in Scripture, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53782:53"/>
the Reader can apprehend in them: and he is also most true and faithful, and therefore would not deceive or delude any by his Words. Hence he gathers, that whatsoever sense may be made of any part of Scripture, if it be in it self a Truth, it must be own'd for the true meaning of the Spirit of God in that place.</p>
                        <p>To this I answer:</p>
                        <p>Were all this intended only of the multiplicity of <hi>subordinate</hi> Senses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on and deducible from that <hi>immediate</hi> Sense, which is but one, the Argument will hold firm. For if any thing do truely lie in any Mans words, or by due consequence be deducible from them, which himself did not mean when he spake them, he must needs be charged to be either ignorant or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious. But being intended (as it is by the Author) of a multiplicity of <hi>colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Senses, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a miserable inconsequence.</p>
                        <p>Next he attempts to prove this by the Testimony of Learned Men; and begins with the <hi>Jewish</hi> Rabbins, whose.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53782:53"/>
childish and absurd conceits need no confutation: witness that instanced by this Author, their proving the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Senses out of <hi>Psalm</hi> 62. 12. (the 11. in our <hi>English</hi> Translation) <hi>God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God.</hi> That is, say they, God hath propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one single Speech, but such as I can understand two ways, that is, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways (a certain number being put for an uncertain) by drawing several Senses from it: wherein the Power of God consists, that he can so order and dispose his Speech, as thereby to teach men a multitude of Truths. And is not this a goodly gloss upon the Text, and an irrefragable proof of the matter in hand? Whereas the <hi>Psalmists twice</hi> hearing what God had <hi>once</hi> spoken, is no more but his diligent and attentive minding of that great and weighty Truth, That Power belongs unto God.</p>
                        <p>What he further cites out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerning the fecundity of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, containing much in a few words, is all granted, being understood (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53782:54"/>
of <hi>subordinate,</hi> not <hi>coordinate</hi> Senses. For that the Scripture should be as a formless Mass, capable of being turned by Philosophy into a thousand shapes (which this Authors conceit tends to) never was, for ought I can find, any part of their meaning.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whereas he says Philosophy is a true, certain, undoubted knowledge <note place="margin">2.</note> of the nature of things demonstrated by Natural Light; I ask, doth Philosophy comprehend the knowledge of all things? Or, is the nature of all things discernable by Natural Light? There are in Scripture many things <hi>Historical, Prophetical,</hi> and <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof depends wholly upon Supernatural Revelation: What can Philosophy do here? And even in those things that are Natural, and belong to the cognisance of Philosophy, how short is that knowledge that the most learned have attained? Therefore, whereas this Author so proudly derides <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. cap. 5. par. 4.</note> our Reformed Divines for complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the darkness of Mans Natural Reason; if he were not too wise to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53782:54"/>
taught, he might have learnt more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty from the ancient Philosophers, the best and wisest whereof did greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the darkness of Mans Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Even <hi>Aristotle</hi> (who never, I think, was judged to have disparaged Humane Reason) acknowledges that our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, even as to the most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest things in nature, are but as the Eyes of the Owl and Bat to the day-light. And though both he and others of them, being unacquainted with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, could not clearly discover the true original of this darkness, yet some weak conjectures some of them have made of it, and (whether by any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition received from the <hi>Jews,</hi> or by some other means I shall not enquire) some general and confused inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they had, that Man had lost his Primitive Excellency, that the Wings of his Soul (for so they express it) had by some sad fall been so bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that he could not arrive at any considerable measures of knowledge by his greatest industry. And hence arose that fond mistake among some of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53782:55"/>
them, that the Souls of Men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had a pre-existence before their union with their Bodies, and having offended in that State, were for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their Error, thrust into these gross terrestial receptacles and that this caused the imperfection and obscurity of Mens Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But to those who own the Scripture, and may learn from thence what Mans Primitive State was, and how he fell, and are any whit acquainted with themselves, methinks it should be no strange Riddle, that the Mind is clouded and benighted even in things <hi>Natural,</hi> and therefore in <hi>Supernatural</hi> much more. But where is that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy that this Exercitator cryes up for so certain and infallible? and which another Author of like Principles does <note place="margin">Lambert. Velthus. de usu rationis in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</note> with profane boldness, magnifie as equal to the Holy Scriptures for its compleat perfection and infallible certainty? Where is it? In the Clouds? Sure it never was extant among men, save in the crazy conceits of some haughty self-admirers.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53782:55"/>
3. As to what our Author speaks of <note place="margin">3.</note> Philosophy being usefull to detect false Interpretations of Scripture; I grant, that where such false Interpretations are given, as do really entrench upon the undoubted Principles of Reason, the weakness and folly of them may well be discover'd by Philosophy: But all corrupt or perverse expositions are not to be so limited; nor is this enough to render Philosophy a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rule of Interpretation. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosophers could discover the error of their vulgar Religion, but could not direct men to the true and right, as I have shewn before. The like may be said in the present case.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whereas our Exercitator further <note place="margin">4.</note> adds in the close of this Argument, that from the beginning of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, those who were the most profound Philosophers, were generally confessed to be the happiest Interpreters of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I am far from being of his mind, none having more corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved the Scriptures, than Men of greatest eminency for Philosophick
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53782:56"/>
Learning: which I do not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to Philosophy (truly so call'd) but to the rashness and folly of Men, who being desirous to advance that wherein they would be thought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, have adventured to make use of their Philosophick Principles in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a quite different and more sublime nature. But suppose we the utmost that can be supposed; That an eminent Philosopher were furnished with all the most necessary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments for the understanding of Scripture, and should duely improve them for that end; yet this would no more prove Philosophy to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream rule of Interpretation, than Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar or Rhetorick; which are every whit as necessary and useful to such a Work, if not more. No further doth any thing help us in understanding the Scripture, than it directs us to those <gap reason="foreign">

                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <q>EVery one, saith the Exercitator, is the best Interpreter of his own <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> Words, and God being the Author <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. cap. 6. par. 1.</note> of Philosophy, to him is to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed whatever Interpretation is made of the Scripture by the Maxims of Philosophy, and consequently that is to be owned as the Rule of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this is a strange way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation <note place="margin">Sol.</note> in a Man that pretends to Reason.

For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This Argument may with full as much or more strength, be retorted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and that two ways;</p>

                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:53782:57"/>
First, If because God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Philosophy, therefore Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>phy must unfold all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Scripture: Will it not as well follow, that seeing God is the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable Author of the Scriptures, therefore the Scriptures are to resolve all the difficulties in Philosophy? If it be said, that the Scriptures are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for any such end, nor fitted for such an use as to untie the knots of Philosophy; their use and design is of greater and higher concernment. I answer, neither is Philosophy designed to clear doubts in matters of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation, its use being limited to matters of an inferior Orb. Again, we may thus also retort the Argument; If God be the best Interpreter of his own Mind, then doubtless the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of his Mind is to be fetcht from that which is the onely certain and undoubted Record of his Mind, and that is the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That God is the Author <note place="margin">2.</note> of all true and sound Philosophy, I grant; nor needed the Exercitator to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53782:57"/>
have given himself the trouble of spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. c. 5. par. 3.</note> so many lines to prove it. But I must mind him of some few things to rectifie his mistakes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He is widely out in supposing that the Wisdom spoken of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by him alledged, is no other than Philosophy. The Holy Ghost in most, if not all, of those places, speaks of something higher and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than meer Natural Knowledge.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whereas among other Humane Testimonies that the Author heaps up to prove Philosophy to be of God, he brings in <hi>Lucretius, lib. 5. de rerum natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> the learned <hi>Vogelsangius</hi> hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <note place="margin">Indignat. Justa p. 67.</note> his shameful mistake, telling him, that the God whom <hi>Lucretius</hi> there means, when he says,</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>—Deus ille fuit, Deus, inclyte Memmi,</l>
                           <l>Qui Princeps vitae rationem invenit eam, quae</l>
                           <l>Nunc appellatur Sapientia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>is no other than <hi>Epicurus;</hi> and must <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Philosophy be the Scriptures Interpreter?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This I must add by way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to my former concession, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53782:58"/>
God is not so the Author of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as he is of the Scripture. He is so far the Author of the Scripture, as that he hath infallibly directed his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in penning its several Parts, and preserved them from Error in that Work: But he is not so the Author of Philosophy, as infallibly to direct any Man in the World so as not to Err in his Philosophy. Here therefore is a very great difference: and seeing that this Philosophy (which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so far as it is sound and true, to be God's Gift) is no where to be found but in the Minds or Writings of falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men, by what certain Rule shall we judge of the Maxims of Philosophy in matters of Religion, whether they be undoubtedly true or no? Or which way shall we be assured that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Maxims (supposing them to be unquestionably true) are duely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the matter in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie? Whither shall we go in this case to find out such solid satisfaction as may give sufficient ground for that Divine Faith, that we certainly owe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53782:58"/>
to the Doctrine of Scripture?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Suppose (what is not) that we had a clear and perfect Model or System of Sound Philosophy to have recourse to, so as we may truly say of it, that it is all and every Part and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of it of Divine Original, and so complete, that there is no defect in it; yet still we must remember that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy hath its Bounds, and discovers nothing to us but those necessary Truths which fall within the compass of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and so far we might take it for the Voice of God: But as for Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Verities, the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>discovery</hi> whereof depend upon Gods absolute Will and Arbitrary Revelation He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended that Philosophy should be our guide in these: But here we are to keep solely and wholly to what he hath said in the Scriptures.</p>

                           <q>WHatsoever, saith the aforesaid Author, is necessary to the <note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> Rule of Interpretation, perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <note place="margin">Ph.

For they are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly true, free from all danger of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and therefore cannot deceive, being grounded upon unmoveable Foundations; admitting no appeals, impartial, not inclined to this or that side; in a word, so sure and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they will force assent; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be not bended or swayed by Mens prejudices, or vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, as I said before, where is this Philosophy to be found? If it be any <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> where, how comes it to pass, that those who have in all Ages been most devoted to the study of it, and most perspica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53782:59"/>
and successfull in searching the secrets of it, have yet in many things, especially that concerning Religion, so foully erred, and have been at so great odds, not onely one with another, but each with himself? Certain it is, that the Principles of Reason and Philosophy, let them be never so Sound and Stable, yet they can prevail upon none any further than they are received into the Mind: and they are no where received but according to the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and capacity of the Subject; the darkness and imperfection of whose Understanding much alters the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the soundest Principles.</p>
                        <p>Besides, my third Answer to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent <note place="margin">2.</note> Argument will serve here; for let Philosophy be never so infallible, it must be kept within its own proper sphere, and not be applied to matters Supernatural, that are wholly out of its road, and above its reach. Of all Parts of Philosophy, the Mathematicks are generally esteemed the most demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative, and irrefragable. But if any should attempt by Mathematical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

                        <p>This, I confess, the Author doth not <note place="margin">Sol.</note> make use of among the Arguments that he produceth to defend his Cause: yet because it tends to beget a conceit (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the drift of his Discourse)
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53782:61"/>
that what Men apprehend themselves to have a clear knowledge of by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Philosophy, is infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and thereby qualified for the sure Interpreting of Scripture, I thought fit not to pass it over without some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion.</p>
                        <p>This Assertion is a piece of wild somewhat (for whether I should call it Philosophy, or Divinity, Sense, of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, I know not) that if entertain'd, gives ground to Men of corrupt Minds to father their most enormous Conceits upon God and his Holy Spirit.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53782:65"/>
Which by the way serves a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to abate my wonder at the daring folly of some Novelists, in whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings I find many absurd, distorted, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicting Expositions of Scripture, not without the highest scorn cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all dissenting Interpreters. It seems they are of this Authors persuasion, and perhaps have lighted their Candle at his dark Lanthorn. But truly, as I do not very well relish the modesty of our Exercitator in this Discourse, so I do as little admire his Logick. For what a wilde consequence is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Ancients used the <hi>Platonick</hi> or <hi>Eclectick</hi> Philosophy as their Rule of Interpretation, and the Schoolmen used the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> as their Rule of Expounding; therefore the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy, that differs widely from them all, is the surest and most infallible Interpreter? Let no man mistake me, as if I hereby intended any sinister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on that noble Author, whom the person I am dealing with pretends to follow. I willingly allow him all the honour that his great Parts and Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53782:66"/>
Inquiries may have merited, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least detraction: Though I think some of his greatest admirers have done him no small injurie, partly by their Superlative Elogies given to him, together with their ready swallowing, and pertinacious defending all his dictates; but especially by extending his Rules and Methods to matters of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation, beyond his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared meaning, if his own word may be taken, which I am not concerned to examine.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What use soever former Writers Ancient or Modern have made of their respective Philosophy in expounding Scripture, it doth not yet appear that they own'd it for their Rule: and if they did, I am sure they did amiss. I highly honour the memory of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers; but I never took them for infallible in their Interpretations, nor did they themselves; nor I suppose doth the Exercitat or, who yet contends for Philosophy to be the Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. And for the Schoolmen, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self cites some Authors, and might have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53782:66"/>
cited many more, and those of great eminency in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, who have long since complained of them for corrupting Divinity by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with their Philosophick Notions; and yet we never find any of these so absurd as to assert Philosophy to be the Scriptures Interpreter.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53782:68"/>
other things not competible to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, much less to an infinite and immutable Being. Touching which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, whereas it is truely cautioned by Divines of all sorts, that these are to be explicated by such Scriptures as speak otherwise of God, suitably to his immaterial and unchangeable Being: this Author boldly affirms, that the Scripture of it self is insufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us; and that there is no way to resolve us which of these different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Scripture are to be taken properly, and which not, unless we take the Principles of Philosophy and Natural Reason for our guide.</p>
                        <p>To this I answer: That Gods infinite and immense Perfections are much more <note place="margin">Sol.</note> clearly and fully discover'd to us in Scripture than by Natural Light. The Apostle says, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. What man knows the things of a Man, save the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Man which is in him; even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.</hi> Therefore the best and safest Conceptions we can have of God,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53782:68"/>
are those which we learn from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God speaking to us in and by the Scripture. And if this Author were not extremely prejudiced by a partial fondness for his own darling conceits, he might know, that plain ordinary Christians, who never had ought to do with Philosophick Learning, have by their sole acquaintance with the Scriptures, come to much clearer and sounder conceptions of God, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Attributes, than the learnedst Philosopher that ever the World had, could attain by all his Wit and Study without Scripture Light: and that to any Reader that is not prepossessed with false and absurd Notions of God by his own vain imagination, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Reason, the Scriptures that speak so differently concerning that Supreme Being, if prudently compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the circumstances on each side considered, do sufficiently to the satisfaction of sober Minds, discover to us their true and genuine Sense, without giving the least countenance to the sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and irrational conceits of the <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites;</hi>

though a cavelling daring Wit may and will find something to quarrel with, where the matter is as clear as the noon-day Sun.</p>
                        <p>His next instance is, The Words of our Saviour at the institution of his last <note place="margin">§ 2.</note> Supper, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> which the Papists interpret for Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Lutherans for Consubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: The Reformed Churches deny both, understanding the words <hi>tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;</hi> whose Sense he says can be no otherwise defended but by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Natural Philosophy.</p>
                        <p>For answer to this, I grant, That in <note place="margin">Sol.</note> clearing this controversie, there is good use of the Principles of Philosophy and Natural Reason; and so there is also of <hi>Sense;</hi> which undeniably convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us, that what we see, and feel, and taste, is Bread. Yet sure we are not to make Sense the Rule of Interpreting Scripture. But the true and proper Rule of Interpreting our Saviours Words, <hi>[This is my Body]</hi> is that which the Scripture it self, and that alone
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53782:69"/>
hath taught us; <hi>viz. That Christ assumed a true Humane Body:</hi> which is a truth that Reason and Philosophy could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inform us of, it being a matter of pure Revelation. Now this being laid down as the chief <hi>Postulatum;</hi> the thing to be inquired into is, <hi>What is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Humane Body?</hi> and what are the essential Properties of all natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? And this Natural Philosophy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs us in, as being no matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, but lying within the compass of Natural Light, which teacheth us that every Natural Body is quantitative and divisible, and confined to one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place; consequently that the Bread in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be properly and substantially the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> which (as Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us) was once nailed to the Cross, but is now glorified in Heaven. Now the force of all this for the expounding of our Saviours Words, lies in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer supposition, <hi>That our Saviour assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a true natural Humane Body,</hi> together with what was even now mentioned; <hi>That the same Body of Christ which he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53782:70"/>
assumed, is at the right Hand of God in Heaven:</hi> both which are Scripture-Revelations. Besides, there is a wide difference between these two, a <hi>help</hi> to overthrow a false Interpretation, and the <hi>Rule</hi> of establishing the true one. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy may do the former, but not the latter. As in this controversie, the Principles of Reason and Philosophy do convincingly assure us that Bread is not, cannot be the Body of a Man. But they cannot assure us what was our Saviours meaning, when holding the Bread in his Hand, he said, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> this must be resolved by what the Scripture it self speaks either there, or elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>His third and last instance is the Doctrine of the Trinity, which he says <note place="margin">§ 3.</note> cannot be cleared without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <note place="margin">3.</note> to Philosophy: and here, having derided the attempts of many to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and confirm this great Mistery by their Metaphysical Speculations; he highly applauds the learned <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> for his happy endeavors in unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and demonstrating it, <hi>Ex immotis

Philisophiae fundamentis,</hi> out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Foundations of Philosophy.</p>
                        <p>To this I answer, That the curious <note place="margin">Sol.</note> speculations and Philosophick nice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ies of the Schools about the Doctrine of the Trinity, have done it more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice than advantage, and given greater occasion to the adverse part to reject it, when they found so strange and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible a Mystery defended by such thin, airy, cobweb notions. It had been much better, if Men had content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves with those discoveries the Scripture makes of this inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mystery, it being a Doctrine pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Supernatural Revelation, and not at all discoverable by Natural Light. The Arguments from Reason and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy brought for the proof of it, by the learned <hi>Keckerman,</hi> and by <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius</hi> a late <hi>Cartesian,</hi> are examined by <hi>Vogolsangius</hi> in his <hi>Indignatio Justa, &amp;c.</hi> and discarded as insufficient. I grant, that in this, (as in many other Doctrines) it may be of good use to shew that there is nothing in what the Scripture says of it, that contradicts
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53782:71"/>
any sound Principle of Reason. But to go about by the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Philosophy positively to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the truth of it, is a thing which I take to be impossible. I chuse to say of this Mystery, as one does of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence, <hi>Credendo intelligitur, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando enarratur.</hi> It is best understood by believing, and best declared by ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>He</hi> (saith the late Bishop of <note place="margin">Duct.

                           <hi>Down) that should go to Revelation to prove that nine and nine make eighteen, would be a Fool: and he would be no less, that goes about to prove a Trinity of persons by natural Reason. Every thing must be derived from its own Fountain.</hi> Thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> tells us, <hi>He that by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>

                           <hi>Reason attempts to prove the Trinity of persons, doth a double prejudice to the Faith. 1.

He hinders others from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Faith, by using such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are not cogent; which renders it obnoxious to the Infidels contempt.</hi> This is plain in Scripture, that the Father is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53782:71"/>
God, and the Holy Ghost is God: and that these are three, and all three are but one God: and for other subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and curious inquiries of busie and presumptuous Wits, without and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Written Word, I think the Truth of God never was, nor ever will be beholden to them.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53782:72"/>
it self from the Words themselves: and therefore do judge, with the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the place, that the Apostle calling upon Christians <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, even their reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble service;</hi> doth evidently oppose this to the Sacrifices of the Ceremonial Law, which were no other than irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creatures, first killed, and then offered up to God. But,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Be it given (but not <note place="margin">2.</note> granted) that the Apostles meaning is what these Men put upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Service God requires of Christians, is agreeable to Reason: I have already premised and asserted, that Christian Religion is perfectly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; whence it will undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there is an excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, a full and complete accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Reason and Religion. And although some daring Wits that make high pretences to Reason, have, by their profane Jeers at the Misteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and their turning the Doctrines
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53782:73"/>
and Phrases of Holy Scripture into Drollery, contributed not a little to the Atheism of the present age; yet I am past all doubt, that no man is or can be an Atheist, that hath not first baffled and besotted his Reason. If any therefore hath gone about to set Reason and Religion at variance, it hath been through some misprision, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some groundless imagination for Reason, or some corrupt opinion or practice for Religion. But if any shall hence argue, that Mans Reason is to be the Rule of Religion, or that Doctrines of Supernatural Revelation are to be interpreted, and the Sense of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Natural Principles, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the consequence, and leave them to prove it.

                           <hi>Rule</hi> of interpreting his Commands, I think few would be found so blind or foolish (except Men of profligate and debauched Consciences) that would admit of such an absurd Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53782:73"/>
And there is no less absurditity in this, That because Religion is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Service, therefore our Reason must be the Rule of interpreting the Doctrinces of Rëligion.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THe Exercitator having (after his manner) asserted his own Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">§ 1.</note> comes, in the seventh Chapter of his Discourse, to answer the Scriptures that some have made use of to oppose it. Before I deal with them, I cannot but take notice of the disingenuity of <hi>Ludovicus Wolzogen,</hi> who having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the Patronage of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Cause against this Adversary, doth so shamefully throw down his Arms,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53782:74"/>
and run out of the Field: For when he comes at this seventh Chapter of his Antagonist (and again at his twelfth) wherein the Exercitator endeavors to evade or enervate the Scriptures <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lud. Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zog. de Scripturar. Interprete p.</hi> 217.</note> brought against him this: valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion not only waves the vindication of them; but for his own more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuse, expresly maintains it to be a preposterous thing in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about the Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to use or admit the testimony of Scripture at all; and affirms that the Cause must be decided by Reason: And therefore, as all along his Discourse, he never makes use of Scripture to defend himself, or strike his Adversary; so he lays an imputation of folly upon all our Divines that use this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the present Case. And he gives two pitiful Arguments to prove this fond Assertion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <q>One is because the Controversie <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Id. ib. p.</hi> 219.</note> is about the Scripture it self, which is not to be heard in its own Cause, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less such places can be alledged in the explication whereof both parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:53782:75"/>
To this I answer, <note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. If this be granted, then whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever controversie we have with the Papists about the Authority, Perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Perfection of the Scriptures, though we have never so clear proof in the Scripture it self for these things, they must all be waved as invalid. But these have hitherto been accounted controverted Points of Faith, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be resolved from Scripture the only Rule of Faith: &amp; so is this about the Scriptures Interpretation: however the Exercitator, and with him this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, denies it; while yet both of them acknowledge it to be a Question, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole of Religion is concerned, and (next to that of the Scriptures Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) <note place="margin">Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo, &amp;c. 1. Wolzog. ubi sup. 5. &amp; p. 90.</note> the very foundation on which all Doctrines of Faith and Manners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; and which involves in it whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Differences or Controversies there are between dissenting parties in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that own the Scriptures. And is it not strange that Men should own this Controversie to be so momentous
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53782:75"/>
and fundamental, and yet to deny it to be a matter of Faith, or to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Scripture Testimony? But,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Why may not the Scripture be heard speak for it self, as well as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">2.</note> for it self? The Question under debate is whether the Rule of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting Scripture, be the Scripture it self, or Mans Reason? Does not this as nearly touch Reason as Scripture? And yet must that be allowed to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony in its own Cause and not the Scripture? It appears by this (as by many other passages in his Book) that this Author is a better friend to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitators opinion, than to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Doctrine. And indeed,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This is the very Language of our <note place="margin">3.</note> Popish Adversaries; who tell us, the Scripture cannot be its own Interpreter, because the Question is concerning it self. To which our Writers answer <note place="margin">V. Riveti Isagogen, cap. 19. § 30.</note> truely, That the Scripture being the Voice of God, its testimony for it self is above all other whatsoever, even in its own Cause.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53782:76"/>
His other Argument is, <q>Because till <note place="margin">2. Wolz. ubi sup. p. 247.</note> the dissentient parties have agreed about the Interpreter of the Scriptures alledged, they have no Sense, and therefore can testifie nothing:</q> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this account he condemns those of the Reformed Churches that alledge Scripture in this Controversie, and blames the Exercitator for answering their Allegations.</p>
                        <p>To this I answer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That any part of Scripture is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Sol.</note> its Sense till it have an Interpreter, is a gross absurdity and falshood. The Scripture hath its Sense, whether any Man interpret it or no. Interpretation doth not (I am sure it should not) bring the Sense and put it into the Scripture, but receive it from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This Author acknowledges some Scriptures to be so clear, that the Sense is obvious: and if such Scriptures can be produced in the present Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie (as no doubt they may) Why should the difference about the Interpreter, preclude them?</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53782:76"/>
3. Were this Argument allowed, it would for ever debarr us from alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture against the Romanists in any Controversie that we have with them: it being notorious to all Men, that this is one great difference betwixt us and them, <hi>who must be the Supreme In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scripture?</hi> which they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge as the Priviledge of their Church; and we ascribe to the Scripture it self.</p>
                        <p>But it is a miserable Plea that this <note place="margin">§ 2.</note> Author makes elsewhere for himself, <note place="margin">Lu. Wol. Cens. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surae p. 233</note> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <q>That he had to do with one whom he esteemed to be no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but an Heathen (for so he accounts the Exercitator) who would no more regard the Testimony of Scripture in this Case, than a Jew would regard any proof from the New Testament; and therefore it was, that he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dealing with him about those Testimonies from Scripture.</q> It seems then he would make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that what he had said about this, was onely spoken <hi>ad hominem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:53782:77"/>
By which it plainly appears, that our Author began to see he could not <note place="margin">Sol.</note> stand his ground, but was not so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as to confess his Error, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore runs behind this Bush to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His Words, which I quoted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of his Book, <hi>De Scripturarum Interprete,</hi> do evidently shew that he speaks according to his own Mind, that it was a preposterous thing in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie to alledge the Testimony of Scripture; and that in this Case no such proof was to be allowed, (see him page 217. 219. and 247.) and not only so, but alledges the Reasons beforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (such as they are) for this wilde Position.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He knows very well that the Jews (to whom he compares his Antagonist) do not at all own the Authority of the new Testament, but professedly reject it: Whereas the Exercitator (whatever his Religion be) does avowedly own the Divine Authority of the Scripture, and delcares himself willing to be dealt with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53782:77"/>
in that way, in that he cites our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines Arguments from thence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to answer them; for which this Author reproves him. So that the case is not the same. And yet I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Authors Reason: Should any Jewish Writer either cite any Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of the New Testament for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or endeavor, by his own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to evade any Testimonies thence alledged against him (which is plainly the Case here) whether should a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that pretends to answer him, do well to say, That the New Testament is not here to be heard, and that it were a preposterous thing to alledge it? Should he not rather endeavor to answer the objections that are made, and clear the places cited? And if in case he should do, as this Author doth here, might he not justly be condemned for a Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Christian Cause? If it be said, <note place="margin">

them; and therefore it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to use Scripture to him, till they had agreed about the Rule of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I answer, The Exeroitator does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed charge the Scripture with obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Sol.</note> because of its ambiguity; but it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, because, hesays, all words whatsoever are ambiguous: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this should shut out the Scripture from bearing witness in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, then all Arguments from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, must upon the same account, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded too; for they must be made up of Words and Phrases, the ambiguity whereof (according to the Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Doctrine) will render them obscure, as well as the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Come we now to speak something to <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the Scriptures alledged by our Divines, <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. c. 7.</note> which the Exercitator labors to evade. But methinks it is a pleasant thing to see how he betrays his own Cause, by acting against his own Method and Principles. For having all along cried up Philosophy as the onely Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture; when himself comes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53782:78"/>
interpret the Scriptures brought against him, one would think he should bring his own Tools to this Work, and labor, by Philosophick Principles, to make out the Sense that he gives of these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. But he waves this, and seeks to fetch out his own Sense from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it self, by examining the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Consequents, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors scope. Now he either takes this way of Interpretation to be right, or he does not: If he do not, he doth but juggle with his Reader, and designs to cheat him: but if he do indeed think it to be right, he yields the Cause, that not Philosophy, but the Scripture it self is the Rule of Interpretation.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Scriptures alledged: The <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 19, 20. 21. 1 Cor. 2. 6.</note> first is that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. where the Apostle speaks very contemptibly of Humane Wisdom; the like may besaid of the next, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. Now in these places, saith the Exercitator, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle does not go about to deny or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn true Wisdom, but the earthly, sensual Wisdom of the World, that is grounded upon vain opinions, and puts
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53782:79"/>
Men upon the eager pursuit of earthly things, such as Riches, and Honors, and Sensual Pleasures.</p>
                        <p>I answer, The Apostle, having to do with those who thought meanly of the <note place="margin">Sol.</note> Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> Crucified, and affected a name for that which the world count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wisdom; endeavors to lay all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wisdom in the dust, and to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its insufficiency to conduct man to true happiness; for which he prefers the Doctrine of the Gospel (which was so derided as foolishness) above that which the World so much admired. This therefore is no impertinent allegation against the Exercitators opinion. That in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is true any where, is true every where. Here therefore our Author may put up his Dagger.</p>
                        <p>But there is one thing which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">§ 2. Ph. Scr. Int. c. 8. par. 2.</note> well pass over, That the Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pretending to confute those who assert a contrariety between the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Philosophy and Divinity, and instancing in these two, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> and <hi>Idem non potest, numericè re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produci,</hi> Instead of solving the knot, he cuts it, and plainly affirms both these
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53782:81"/>
Principles to be true, absolutely, and without limitation both in Philosophy and Divinity, confidently asserting that the Scripture doth no where teach us, <hi>That the World was made of nothing,</hi> or that <hi>the same numerical Body shall rise at the last day.</hi> And here <hi>Wolzogen</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily deserts the Christian Cause, not vouchsafing to write one word in vindication of these grand Truths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this bold Adversary; but tells us he is content the Man should enjoy his own opinion, though, he says, he could easily have refuted him: Which makes his silence the more inexcusable, and brings him under greater suspition of Heterodoxy, notwithstanding all his Rhetorical Flourishes. But it is time I should return to our Author, who, if he had not been too much in love with Novelty, might without the least prejudice to his Cause (unless it have some other Monster in the Belly of it that is not yet come to the birth) have answered, that these Axioms are true in a limited Sense both in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Divinity; <hi>viz.</hi> That by a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53782:81"/>
created Power, nothing can be made of nothing; and that by the like limited power, the same numerical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that perisheth, cannot be reprodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But that nevertheless to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power all things that imply not contradiction are possible.</p>
                        <p>But it seems by this Authors words, <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> that he disowns the received Doctrine of the worlds Creation out of Nothing; and the Reproduction of the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Body.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By denying the former, he must necessarily maintain the Eternity of Preexistent Matter: whereas if God be the Maker of all Beings besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (as the Scripture sufficiently assures us) then nothing besides himself could be Eternal; but he must in making the World make the <hi>Matter</hi> whereof the World consists, which <hi>Matter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be made of nothing. The first Article in the most ancient Creeds (as the Reverend Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> hath <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Dr.</hi> Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Expos. of the Creed, Art. 1.</note> observed) had instead of these words <hi>Maker of Heaven and Earth,</hi> or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53782:82"/>
with them, this Clause, <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things visible and invisible,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to that of the Apostle, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1. 16. which distribution is so comprehensive, that it will not admit of any Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all things whatsoever being either visible or invisible: and whatsoever can be supposed necessary to the making of the World, it must of necessity come under one of these two Members of the distribution, and consequenly be of Gods making. And indeed if it were otherwise, then something else besides God, must have a <hi>necessary, uncreated, independent</hi> Being: which carries with it so broad a Contradiction, as Mans Reason left fair to it self cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Again,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By disclaiming the latter, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor evidently denies the Resurrection; for that imports the rising again of the same Body that fell, according to that known Speech of <hi>Damascen</hi> so oft ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Divines, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:53782:82"/>
this is not a Resurrection but a new Creation; and then the first Creation of the World may as aptly be called a Resurrection as that which is so stiled by the Holy Ghost in Scripture. But I think the Scripture speaks plain enough in this Case, (though this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not own it) when it says, that at the last day, <hi>This corruptible must</hi>

20. 13. <hi>The Sea shall give up the dead which are in it, and Death and the Grave deliver up the dead which are in them. But if the same Bodies did not Rise, they which are in the dust, should not revive; If God should give us any other Bodies than our own, neither the Sea nor the Grave should give up their dead. That shall Rise again which the Grave gives up; the Grave hath nothing to give up, but that Body which was laid into it: therefore the same Body which is Buried, shall at the last day be revived.</hi> And whereas the Socinians (who are our Adversaries in this, as well as in many other Articles of our Faith) to evade this Argument, will have the <hi>Graves</hi> spoken of in <hi>Joh</hi> 5. 28. to be the <hi>Graves</hi> of ignorance and impiety there meant; and the Rising to be Mens coming to the knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c. the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said learned Person answers them, <hi>That Christ expresly, speaks of bringing Men to</hi>

                        <p>But if the Exercitators Principles will allow him to write after the rate he here doth, I think none that hath any veneration for the Scriptures, will be over-fond of such a corrupt and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpreter.

Interprete p. 26. &amp; 42.</note> use of speech, common to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures with other Writings: and gives us his Reason why this must be the Rule of Interpretation, because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use is the onely Master of Speech, and the Custome of Speakers and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gives Law to the signification of <note place="margin">Ib. 46, 47, &amp;c.</note> Words; and that the use of Speech is formed by much and long Custom, which, when it hath at last prevailed, does, as it were, imprint a publick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon Words, which come by <hi>tacite</hi> consent to be received of all: and <note place="margin">Ib. p. 70, 71 72.</note> he professes he sees no Reason why any should deny that the Interpretation of Scripture depends upon this use of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53782:86"/>
Speech: which himself says is founded upon Humane Institution, but adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and approved by the Wisdom of God in Enditing the Scripture. Now that this <hi>Usus loquendi</hi> should be the Rule of Interpreting the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is far wide from the Truth, and from the Judgment of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and as far as I know of all other Expositors. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When they say the Scripture is its own Interpreter, (or which is all one) the Rule of Interpretation to it self, they understand it of something in the Scripture, that is peculiar to the Scripture, and not any thing that is common to it with other Writings: But the vulgar and customary use of Speech is the same in all Writings, where the same Language is made use of.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is granted on all hands, that this <hi>Usus loquendi,</hi> or Custom of Speech, hath its place among those means that I spake of in the entrance of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that do remotely conduce to Interpretation; but it reaches no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nextly and immediately than to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53782:86"/>
Verbal Interpretation (which is called Translation) by guiding us to the right understanding of Words and Phrases, and the several Modes of Speech. But this comes not up to that which we call Real Interpretation, which is the Exposition of the Author's Mind signified by those Words as they are so and so placed. We do not therefore shut out the <hi>Use of Speech,</hi> but suppose it, and look at something further. For instance, suppose I were to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sense of that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. (which is the instance given by <hi>Vander Weayen)</hi> I may, by the <hi>Use of Speech,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Advers. Wolzog. li. 2. p. 12.</note> know what these several Words, <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> signifie: But I must have something else to guide me to the right meaning of the entire Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> And <hi>Wolzogen</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <note place="margin">Lu. Wol. li. 2. p. 107.</note> that there is a wide difference between words taken singly, and in their first original, and taken as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in Propositions. I may add with very good reason, that there is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53782:87"/>
also a wide difference between Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions taken singly, and taken in such or such a contexture of Discourse. Now the use of Speech will not help us to distinguish here.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How can the common use of Speech be a Rule in Matters of pure Revelation? I think all acknowledge, that the Sense of Words varies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the difference of the subject matter about which they are used. Now matters of pure Revelation are so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from vulgar use, that they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been spoken or written by any Men, if the Holy Ghost had not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited them, and communicated them to us in the Scripture. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, that these things are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>not in Words which Mans Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 13.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. If the common use of Speech be so sure a Rule of Interpretation as this Author makes it, I wonder what was in his Mind, to say of the Penmen of Scripture, <hi>That if they were now living amongst us, they could not be the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53782:87"/>
Interpreters of their own Writings, because they often wrote they knew not what.</hi> Certainly the customary use of Speech which obtained in the times wherein they wrote, must needs be much better known to them than it can be to any now living. Why then might not they interpret their own Writings, if they were now with us, having the best insight into that which this Author cries up for the onely sure Rule of Interpretation?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If the customary use of Speech must be the Rule of Interpretation, the inconvenience urged by the Exercitator <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>par.</hi> 6. will not easily, if at all, be avoided: <hi>viz.</hi> the interpreting of Scripture according to the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprehension of the Vulgar.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If this be so certain a Rule, as he will have it, so as that he who uses it, shall not fail to find out the true Sense of Scripture (for so himself speaks<note n="*" place="margin">Wolzog. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53782:88"/>
that in many things (not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation) let the Reader be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so diligent in his search, he cannot find the meaning of Scripture: and the reason hereof, he says, is to be fetcht, not from the nature of the thing, nor from the darkness of our minds, but <hi>ex</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Id. ib. p. 15, 16 &amp; p. 172, 173, 174.</note> 
                           <hi>ipsa constitutione Scripturae,</hi> from the very frame of Scripture it self.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, But now, whether this learned Author did not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">2.</note> what he wrote, or had not well digested his own Notions, or whether he designed to amuse his Reader with intricacies and ambiguities, or whether he were aware of the inconvenience of his former Expressions, and their liableness to exception, or what other were the cause, I shall not inquire: But this is plain to any that attentively reads his Discourse, that when he had once and again given the honour of being the onely sure Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, to the <hi>common and customary use of Speech;</hi> he afterwards falls to <hi>a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular use of Speech,</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Id p. 76, &amp; 227.</note> distinct from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, arising from the different Character
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53782:88"/>
of the Writer, the different occasion of Writing, the different nature of the things about which he Treats; and that under this singularity of the <hi>usus loquendi,</hi> the custom of Speech, we are to consider the Antecedents and the Consequents of a Text, <note n="b" place="margin">Id. p. 79.</note> and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel places. And elsewhere he says, <note n="c" place="margin">p. 132, &amp; 137.</note> all the circumstances of the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consideration are to be examined: and this he calls, <hi>Usus loquendi Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturarius</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">p. 127.</note> the Scripture use of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And when he objects against himself, <note n="e" place="margin">p. 138.</note> that the customary manner of speaking is dubious and uncertain, he answers it thus, That though it be <note place="margin">v. etiam p. 262, 263.</note> so, yet God's manner of Speech in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is fixed. So that what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>vulgar use,</hi> is now confined to <hi>God's use,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture-use</hi> of Speaking; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does not receive Law from the custom and consent of Men; but is wholly framed and ordered by the disposal of Divine Wisdom, though in it he makes use of such words, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their single signification from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:53782:89"/>
Besides, this Author tells us elsewhere <note n="f" place="margin">Cens. Cens. p. 121</note> that <hi>Usus loquendi,</hi> or custom of Speech, includes in it the Analogy of Faith, and all other things that are taken out of Scripture, in order to the finding out of its true Sense. Now if this be indeed the meaning of his <hi>Usus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi,</hi> his opinion comes very near to that of the Reformed Churches, if it be not the same with it. But then what needed all this stir, as if our Divines had not discovered their Minds plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distinctly, but this Author must come and mend it? whereas he hath rather darkned and obscured it by his intricate and inconsistent Discourse. For whoever before him, took <hi>Usus loquendi</hi> in such a sense as this? And I much wonder that he who is so much for the <hi>custom of Speech,</hi> should vary so widely from it in his Writing. For I am sure this Phrase <hi>Usus loquendi,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that mode of Speech that hath hitherto obtained, was never taken so comprehensively as to include the scope of the Text, with the Antecedents and Consequents, and all other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53782:89"/>
and the Analogy of Faith, and what ever lies in the Scripture that serves to the discovery of its true sense. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Men will assume a power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of coining a new Sense of Words, I cannot imagine what ground they can have to talk after the rate of this Author.</p>
                        <p>Our Divines speak much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">§ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </note> and clearly in this business, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Spirit of God hath, in Enditing the Scripture, so attempered his Speech, and so ordered and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the several Parts and Parcels of this Sacred Book, that his Mind (so far as it is necessary for us to know it) may be discovered, either from the obvious sense of the particular Sentences and Propositions of Scripture considered in that Order and dependence wherein they are placed, or by a due compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of one part of Scripture with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so as that the Reader may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sense of Scripture from the Scripture it self. This is that which our Divines mean, when they say that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53782:90"/>
the Scripture is its own Interpreter. And when they say at any time, that the Spirit of God is the Interpreter of Scripture, either they speak of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective evidence</hi> that the Spirit gives of the Sense of Scripture; and then they understand it of the Spirit as speaking in the Scripture; which being the Voice of the Spirit, is to us (as I said) our Supream Rule: Or they speak of the Spirit as the <hi>efficient cause</hi> of that <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective light</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hat is let into our Minds inabling us to understand the Scriptures. And this belongs to another inquiry, and doth not concern the Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Rule of Interpretation. Now when our Writers say, the Scripture is its own Interpreter, they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Metonymically.</hi> As when they say the Scripture is the Supream Judge of all Controversies of Faith, they mean no more but that it is <hi>Judex Norma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53782:90"/>
of Controversies, whether they say the Pope is the infallible Judge, or the Sentence given by the Pope is the infallible Rule of decision, it comes all to one. So when our Divines say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that the Spirit speaking in the Scripture is the infallible Interpreter of Scripture, and other while, that the Scripture is the infallible Rule of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, here is no such difference as should just give occasion to any to say, that our Divines speak variously or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly, or that they agree not one with another, or with themselves; for in the issue the meaning of them all, is one and the same.</p>
                        <p>Now here I must look back upon what I had said in the Introduction to my Discourse, concerning the special, immediate means of Interpretation; <hi>viz.</hi> a due observation of the several circumstances of the Scripture to be Expounded; and the comparing of Scripture with Scripture. In the use of which means lies the applying of the right Rule of Interpretation: It is the using of Scripture to expound Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53782:91"/>
And when a dark or difficult Scripture is compared with some other, wherein the same Truth or Doctrine is more clearly and perspicuously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, this is conceived by many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men to be intended in that of the Apostle concerning <hi>the Analogy of Faith, Rom.</hi> 12. 6.

                        <p>I proceed to some Arguments for the confirmation of this Second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, I shall pass over many of those that are numerously brought in by other Writers; chusing to insist upon those that I take to be of greatest force; and against which the greatest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been used to overthrow them.</p>
                        <p>My first shall be this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Scripture is of all other best fitted to be the Rule <note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> to guide us in the determining of its own sense and meaning. Nothing else is so well qualified for this use. And this may be evinced by its three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, its Perfection, Perspicuity, and Authentickness. It is the most Perfect,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53782:93"/>
Perspicuous, and Authentick Record of the Mind of God. Of these Three I must distinctly Treat.</p>
                        <p>First, this, and this only, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">Branch 1.</note> Record of the mind of God, fully manifesting it to us so far as it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to know it, in order to our duty and our happiness. The Apostle speaks clearly and fully for this, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. <hi>From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Christ Jesus.

Here two things are evidently Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scriptures contain in them what is sufficient both for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ to Teach, and for any Christian to know, to make him wise unto Salvation. Neither of which can be, if there be not that in the Scripture it self, out of which the Mind of God therein deliver'd may be sufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood without the suppliment of some other over-ruling Principle. For 1. How can the Scripture make any man wise unto Salvation, if it fall short
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53782:94"/>
in point of objective Evidence necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to beget that Divine Knowledge, wherein all saving Wisdom consists? 2. How can it sufficiently furnish a Minister for his work of instructing his Hearers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conducting them to Life, if from thence he cannot fetch enough to clear the Truth he is to deliver to them?</p>

Whatsoever may be the ignorance or darkness of Men, which hinders them from knowing what God hath said in these Sacred Records; yet the <hi>objective perspicuity</hi> of them is generally asserted by <hi>Protestants</hi> against the <hi>Romanists.</hi> Not that all Truths revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are so low and common as in their own Nature to be obvious to Man's Understanding: but that (as to the manner of their delivery) they are so laid down in the Scripture, as that they may be understood by and from the Scripture: yet we mean not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part or passage of Scripture is clear: (For that there are many difficulties therein we acknowledge.) But that the mind of God is somewhere or other in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53782:95"/>
Scripture plainly propounded, so far as it is necessary for us to know it, one part of it giving Light to another; so that the whole Scripture taken together is a Perspicuous Manifestation of his will. This is proved by <hi>Moses</hi>'s words in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 12, 13, 14. Speaking of the Law; and the Apostles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Speaking the same of the Gospel. Hence the written Word is frequently compared to a Light, and is <note place="margin">Ps. 19. 7. 8. Ps. 119. 105. 130. 2 Pet. 1. 19. 2 Tim. 3. 15 Matt. 22.</note> said to give understanding to the Simple. Had not the Scriptures been Perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, how could <hi>Timothy</hi> in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood have understood them? How could our <hi>Saviour</hi> out of them have convinced the <hi>Sadduces</hi> of the Doctrin of the Resurrection? Or the <hi>Apostles,</hi> out of them prove irrefragably the <note place="margin">Acts.</note> truth of their Doctrin against the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying <hi>Jews?</hi> Or how could the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> try the <hi>Apostles</hi> Doctrin by search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures? These are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable <note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> Proofs that the Scriptures are Perspicuous, and that they have a plain and certain sense obvious to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate Reader. But all this will
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53782:95"/>
signifie nothing, if the Scripture have not that Light in it that may discover it self, and clear up its own meaning without borrowing Light from some other Principle.</p>
                        <p>Now because much of the stress of this Cause lies on this, we must a little consider what is said against it. The late Romanists do generally cry out, that the Scriptures are obscure; partly that they may have the fairer colour to take them out of the Peoples hands, lest they should mistake, or pervert them, (though none among them have been more guilty of that than their Doctors of greatest name for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:) partly, that they may bring in their unwritten Traditions, as exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Scripture-Revelations; and partly also, that they may establish a necessity of an Infallible, Visible Judge here on Earth to Interpret Scriptures, and decide all Controversies. Yet I know not any of them, but will own that many things in the Scripture are clear. But there is a late Writer, that denies this. My next work therefore
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53782:96"/>
shall be to deal with him, and clear the Truth from his exceptions in some of the following <hi>Chapters</hi> of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

                     <div n="4" type="chapter">

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Exercitators exception against the Scriptures Perspicuity, from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of words Answered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THe <hi>Belgick Exercitator</hi> whom I have oft mentioned before, that he may make sure work, rises higher in denying the Scriptures Perspicuity, than any that I have ever met with: and with confidence affirms the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be universally obscure, and that no part of it is of it self clear and <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 11. par. 6. Ibid. <hi>c.</hi> 6. p. 1. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 11. par. 9.</note> plain; and thereupon denies, that one part of Scripture can be expounded by another. Yea, this he laies as the foundation of his main Assertion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53782:96"/>
against the Scriptures Interpreting it self.</p>
                        <p>And one great Reason he gives, is <note place="margin">Exception. 1.</note> (what he hath taken a great deal of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious pedantick pains to prove in his third Chapter,) <q>That all speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up of Words and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is abscure and doubtful, because the words whereof it consists are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of different significations, and consequently may be taken in a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sense: and thus it is with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it is universally ambiguous, and therefore obscure.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I Answer, 1. If this Reason <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> hold, then there is no Speech or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the World, but will fall under the same unhappy fate. No Law of the Land, no letter of a Friend, no Oral Discourse, no Treatise of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Subject, and how accurately so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever written, shall be accounted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. For all Writings and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are made up of the same kind of Words and Phrases, and capable of being adorn'd with the same Tropes and Figures that the Scripture is, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53782:97"/>
every whit as liable to be taken in for different senses. And thus no man shall know how to speak or write any thing that can be clearly understood: and that excellent gift of <hi>Speech</hi> which God hath bestowed upon men to be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of society and converse, shall be of no other use, but to be made an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of deceit and treachery.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if things be thus, to what <note place="margin">2.</note> end did this Author trouble himself to Write, and others to read this Book of his? if all Speeches and Writings be ambiguous and obscure, and not to be understood without an Interpreter, of what use is this Jewel of his fancy? Did he hope to lead the whole World of Interpreters out of their Labyrinths into the right path, by such an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that by its ambiguities and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties may scare and amuse them, and carry them hither and thither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wind of their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations? Or hath he attain'd to a faculty above all other Writers? even the best and holiest to write in such Words and Phrases as might open his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53782:97"/>
meaning, without entangling his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in ambiguities? If he thinks his Book be free from this blemish, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he might have had the modesty to conceive, that the Pen-men of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture knew how to write as well as he: If his thoughts of his Book were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he might have kept it to himself, and fed the Moths with it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, yet again, if it be thus, that all words in whatsoever contexture be <note place="margin">3.</note> so ambiguous and obscure, what will become of this Infallible Interpreter, which our Author would set up? For whatsoever Interpretation be made of any Scripture, it must be framed in such words as other men use, and as all kind of Writings are drawn up in: and if when all is done, these be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, what are we the better? For certainly according to this Authors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, even the first Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the most unquestionable Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of Philosophy, when turn'd into Words and Sentences, will be as ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, and consequently as dark as the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="182" facs="tcp:53782:98"/>
Fourthly, whereas his impeaching the Scriptures of Ambiguity and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, <note place="margin">4.</note> is not only to disable them from expounding themselves, but that he may set up <hi>Philosophy</hi> as the only Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he instances in several Scriptures, <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 3. par. 24.</note> which he says are thus Ambiguous and Obscure; in the clearing whereof <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> cannot possibly afford us any help. As for Example, when he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of our Saviour's Words in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, That it's doubtful whether this be to be taken <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> search the Scripture: or <hi>Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> ye do search the Scriptures. Can any Principle of <hi>Philosophy</hi> satisfie us whether the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> there used, be of the <hi>Indicative mood,</hi> or of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative?</hi> So when he says it's doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether our Saviours words to <hi>Peter, John,</hi> 21. 16, 17, 18. should be taken <hi>Interrogatively, Dost thou love me?</hi> Or <hi>Affirmatively, Thou dost love me.</hi> And his words to his Disciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 45. Whether they are to be read <hi>Imperatively,</hi> sleep on now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or <hi>Interrogatively,</hi> Do ye sleep on, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:53782:98"/>
And so of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s words to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> Whether they are a <hi>serious</hi> question, or an <hi>Irony.</hi> In these and many other, if the matter and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence do not resolve us, <hi>Philosophy</hi> cannot relieve us. How then do these Allegations serve our Authors end? which is that the Scripture cannot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it self, but all its Interpretation must be regulated by <hi>Philosophy?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bùt Lastly, I deny this Charge laid <note place="margin">5.</note> against the Scripture, (of its being Universally Ambiguous, and Obscure) as highly contumelious to God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. For it supposeth, either that he could not, or that he would not speak his Mind to the Sons of Men; (for whose Eternal concerns he design<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed this Sacred Volume,) in such a manner as they might understand it, and be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by it. As it was out of Love and Mercy to Sinners that the Scriptures were Endited, that they might have a sure Guide to Blessedness; so they are Written for all sorts and ranks of Men to make use of: and therefore they are for the most part drawn in a vulgar
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53782:99"/>
condescending style. But if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood without <hi>Philosophy</hi> (yea a very great insight into <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> as this Author sometimes inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates) not one of a thousand of them that have the Scriptures, will be able to understand the Mind of God in them: they being (according to this Mans words) so totallydark and doubtful.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>
                           <q>SEcondly, whereas it is usually said <note place="margin">Except. 2.</note> by our Divines that such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture as are clear and plain in themselves, do Interpret such as <note place="margin">Phil. Scr. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 11. par. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> are obscure; the great Question is, what do they mean by a place that is clear and perspicuous in or of it self? I have made inquiry about this, (saith the Exercitator) and can find nothing solid or satisfactory.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I answer in few words, That <note place="margin">Sol.</note> Place or Text of Scripture is plain and perspicuous in it self, whose sence so fairly riseth out of the Words, and their connexion with what goes before and after, that the Intelligent Reader need not miss of it, if he be not wanting to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53782:100"/>
himself. And I appeal to any man that is not resolved to cavil, whether there be not thousands of Scripture-Sentences whose sense is thus clear and evident.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But here the Exercitator Replies, <note place="margin">Object.</note> The words whereof Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions consist have their significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Humane Institution, and their <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>par.</hi> 3, 4. 5.</note> sense depends upon common use. If therefore the sense of Scripture be any where so plain as to be known by the Words then it is not Scripture, but <hi>Usus Loquendi,</hi> the common use of Speech, that is the Rule of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But this, <hi>says he,</hi> is of all other the most dangerous and deceitful Rule to go by, causing many monstrous conceptions of God and things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, suitable to the apprehensions of the Ignorant and besotted Vulgar.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this captious Objection I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> Two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We are now speaking of such Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures whose sense is obvious, and so (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Phil. Scr. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 2. par. 7.</note> to the Exercitators own Rule given in the beginning of his Discourse) need no Interpreter. For he plainly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53782:100"/>
sayes, (if at least there be any plain sayings to be found) that the proper Object of Interpretation is such a Speech as is obscure. This Cavil therefore is here is very disingenuous, being against his own premised Rule.</p>
                        <p>In Scripture there is somewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">2.</note> with other Writings, and something proper to it self, as each particular Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hath. The words it useth are of the same kind with those of other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and, singly taken, are supposed to have the like signification according to common use. But as those words are framed into Propositions in the Scripture, and those Propositions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in such a contexture of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; so they may, and oft do, carry a peculiar Sense, which ariseth not from Humane Institution appointing the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of such Words, but from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordination placeing those Words in such an Order, without which they would not signifie what they do. And though the several Words and Clauses of Scripture taken separately from the place wherein they stand, may have a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53782:101"/>
dubious or indeterminate Sense; yet take them together, with the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to which they belong, and whereof they are parts, and the Sense may be undeniably clear and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And this is one way whereby Scripture expounds itself, as the other is, (what hath been most insisted on) by comparing dark places with those that are plain.</p>

                        <p>
                           <q>BUT that which is plain to one <note place="margin">Except. 3. Ph. Scr. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 3. par. 3.</note> may be obscure to another, saith the Exercitator; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon asserts, That there is no Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, or Obscurity, but what is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relative to the Understanding of the Reader or Hearer:</q> and (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wonted modesty) condemns the Reformed Divines, (and he might have added the Ancient Fathers) for affirming the Scriptures to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Perspicuous, though Obscure, in regard of the indisposition of Mens Minds.</p>
                        <p>I Answer, 1. If there be no Objective Perspicuity, nor any-thing clear in it <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> self, but only as it relates to the actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Mens apprehensive Faculties; then it seems there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a clear day, and a cloudy, but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53782:102"/>
only in reference to our sight: and the Sun must not be said to shine bright, because Men that have lost their Eyes, or are shut up in a Dungeon cannot see it. But I think the vanity of such a conceit is Perspicuous enough, whether the Exercitator see it or not. It hath been hitherto esteem'd by all Men (as far as I know) a considerable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in any Writer, that his Speech and Stile is clear and perspicuous; and the contrary, Darkness and Obscurity hath been blamed in those who affect to Speak or Write cloudily and enigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: which certainly implies, that there is a Perspicuity, and a contrary Obscurity, that is absolutly inhering in the Speech it self. And yet in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of this, <hi>Wolzogen,</hi> and his friend <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusius</hi> joyn with the Exercitator, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him, that there is no Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity in the Scripture, but what is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to those that Read or Hear it. And this they endeavour to confirm or illustrate by Similitudes. <hi>A Speech,</hi> says <note place="margin">Li. 1. de Scr. Int. <hi>p.</hi> 104.</note> Wolzogen, <hi>can no otherwise be cal'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous absolutely in it self, than a Mans
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53782:103"/>
Blood can be said to be red while it runs in his Veins, and no Eye sees it; or the Snow that falls in the extream North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, where no man feels the horror of it, can be accounted Cold. These,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>do consist in Sense, without which, we cannot have any Conception of them. And so nothing is Perspicuous further than it is perceived.</hi> To the like purpose <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusius</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">De usu Rat. in Theolog. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> speaks; <hi>That Light is not in the Object, but in the Sense; as heat is not in the Fire, nor cold in the Ice; but in the Sense of him that Feels either the one or the other; no more than pain is in the Sword or Knife that makes a Wound. So</hi> sayes he, <hi>neither is clearness in the Object that is to be known, but in the Mindes perception of it.</hi> Truely, I do not much admire these Mysteries of the New Philosophy. Hitherto both Light and Colour, Heat and Cold have been esteem'd qualities inherent in their proper Subjects, and not to consist in a Relation. But if it be as these Men say, it seems nothing is Cold or Hot, Light or Dark, save only <hi>as</hi> and <hi>when</hi> it is discern'd by one that sees and feels
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53782:103"/>
it. But on the contrary (to pass by other Arguments) we find in the History of the Creation, that <hi>darkness was upon</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2, 3</note>

Perhaps it will be pleaded, that the Scriptures were not written to teach us Natural Philosophy. Be it so; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they penned to teach us any falshood, or to deceive us into mistakes concerning God or any of his Works.

Int. <hi>p.</hi> 104, 105</note> the Scriptures are so framed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting in them to render them perspicuous. And truely, as far as I understand, this is all that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Divines mean, when they say the Scriptures are perspicuous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. What's the matter then? why he tells us their meaning is very good, but the Expression is incommodious. Which is but another taste of his Civility; this being his humour throughout his Book to nibble at somewhat or other in the most learned Writers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. But I return to our Exercitator. And,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I answer, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <note place="margin">2.</note> says, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. 16. that <hi>some of those things</hi> whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> Treats in his Epistles, <hi>are hard to be understood,</hi> if there be no perspicuity or obscurity but what is Relative, he might as well have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53782:104"/>
said that they are all hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: for doubtless there are some Men so stupidly ignorant, or obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverse, that they understand none of them. But surely when the Apostle says, that some of them were difficult, he did not intend to say they were all so.</p>

Lastly, to conclude this, I wonder <note place="margin">4. Ph. Scr.

For having premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the obscurity of Speech ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth chiefly from its ambiguity, and at large discoursed of the several sorts of Amphibolies in Words and Sentences (all which do evidently prove, if any thing, an obscurity that lies in the Speech it self, without respect to the Reader or Hearer) he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly tells us, that there is a two-fold ambiguity of Speech; the one abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, <note place="margin">Cap.

By which he unravels what he had said in his third Paragraph, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that a Speech may be ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and consequently obscure in it self. And if there be an absolute ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, there is also an absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity; for which he before derided the Divines of the Reformation.</p>

It is <hi>by Him,</hi> that is, by the Merit of his Blood, by the Light of his Doctrine, by the Conduct of his Pattern, and by the Power of his Spirit.

                        <p>A further instance is given in those <note place="margin">3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Ph. Scr.

                        </p>
                        <p>But I suppose he cannot be ignorant, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> that there are considerable Doctors of the Romish Church, eminent for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who have acknowledged, that they should never have entertained that sense of the words which asserts Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, if the Authority of the Church had not moved them. And our Writers have abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the gross absurdity of that sense; and among others, Dr. <hi>Brevint</hi> in his late excellent Discourse of the <hi>Mystery of the Romish Mass,</hi> hath clearly, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53782:108"/>
to great satisfaction, proved the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sense of that speech of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours from the very words themselves. I cannot well understand by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors discourse, of what setled Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he is in matters of Religion. He now and then insinuates something that carries with it a dislike of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists and their way: But it is plain enough by this, and many other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in his Book, that the Reformed Churches are little befriended by him.</p>

1. As for the places where God is <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> called <hi>Lord and King,</hi> and said to <hi>Reign over the Nations,</hi> with all of like import; in these we are taught, by what we find elsewhere in Scripture, to remove from God whatever savours of imperfection, and to ascribe nothing to him but what suits with a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and most perfect Being. Nor do the aforesaid Expressions, in their plain and obvious sense, signifie either more or less, than that God is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Sovereign of the World, Ruling his Creatures with infinite Wisdom and Power, according to their different natures and conditions; the Inferiour sort by instinct and natural necessity; his Intellectual Creatures by Laws, as the proper Instrument of Moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

If he be for that Novel Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Thomas Anglus ab Albis,</hi> that God doth not properly Govern us by Laws, (as Kings do their Kingdoms) but, as an Engineer doth his Engine, by Physical Motion; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

To his Eternal

Generation, in reference to which he is called the Eternal and only begotten Son of God. The truth of which Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we are upon Scripture-testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to receive, without searching into the manner; it being a Mystery infinitely above our reach: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that will boldly intrude into, may justly fear to be overwhelm'd with its Glory.

And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it hath been no unusual thing for Men that write only to make ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Learning, and draw the eyes of others upon them, or to make trial of their Wits in their attempts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture, to vent some odd No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that serve rather to amuse than edifie the Reader, and leave him more in the dark than when he perused the Text alone without their Gloss: as it hath fared with some voluminous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators upon <hi>Aquinas;</hi> who under pretence of expounding their Author, have run out into so many intricate and frivolous Questions, that by that time they have done, they have left the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Text less intelligible than it was before they medled with it: Truly so it is with some that have undertaken to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53782:114"/>
write upon the Holy Scriptures. But I take such Mens Writings rather for Depravations than Expositions. And the chief cause of this evil hath been (what this Exercitator is not well aware of) that they made too much use of their Philosophick Notions in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Interpret Scripture-Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. On the other hand, if Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries or Annotations on Scripture be such as do contribute any help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the unfolding of the true sense, this hath been chiefly by collecting and comparing the several parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture together, and considering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of each Text expounded, and so fetching the sense of Scripture from the Scripture it self; which is the only sure and warrantable way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53782:115"/>
evident: God best knows his own Mind; and he hath no where so plainly and fully revealed his Mind as in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Certainly there can be none so sure and infallible Interpreter of these sacred Records, as the Holy Spirit that endited them; and he Interprets them, not by suggesting to us any thing for their understanding which is not there already; but by speaking to us more clearly from some part of Scripture, what is deliver'd more darkly in others. Can any Man, or sort of Men in the World, pretend to know the Mind of God better than himself? or give us better assurance what his Mind is, than the Word which himself hath appointed to be written for this very purpose? Whatsoever sense may be put upon any Scripture-Assertion, and by whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever framed, it cannot challenge our undoubted reception, unless we can discern the Voice of God in it. And that is no where to be heard with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and assurance, (especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Supernatural Revelation, which is that we chiefly deal with in this
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53782:115"/>

                        <p>But here the Exercitator comes in <note place="margin">

Int <hi>c.</hi> 13. resp. ad arg. 9.</note> with his Reply: <q>For acknowledging that without controversie God is an Infallible Interpreter, and that the Scripture is the Voice of God; he nevertheless denies that therefore it will follow that the Scripture can be its own Interpreter, or the Rule of Interpretation to it self; because, says he, the same Author may write several Treatises, and yet it follows not that the one should Interpret the other.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I answer, The comparison <note place="margin">Sol.</note> is very unequal. Men write of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subjects many times, and for very different Ends; and may withal so far forget themselves, or be so unconstant to themselves, as to cross in one Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course what they have written in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But God, the Author of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath designed that whole Volume to one and the same Use and End, to be a Declaration of his Mind to Men, that they may thereby be directed in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53782:116"/>
their greatest affairs, and have a sure Guide to Happiness. It is therefore every way most consistent with his Wisdom and Goodness so to order the enditing of Scripture in matters of so great excellency and necessity, that his Mind may be known from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves, either by the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the particular Sentences, or by the dependence on, and connexion with, the Antecedents and Consequents, or Collation with the more remote parts thereof.</p>

For in stead of answering the aforesaid Exception, he says again and again, <q>That God is not, nor can properly be said to be the Interpreter of Scripture, or the Expositor of his own Mind therein. And he gives us this strange reason for it: Because to this it's necessary that by an <hi>Oracle</hi> (that is, I suppose, either by <hi>audible Voice,</hi> or <hi>secret instinct)</hi> he should
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53782:116"/>
(according to the Enthusiasts fancy) expresly pronounce to us, that this or that is the sense of such or such a Scripture. Unless he do this, he cannot be allow'd by this Dictator to be the Interpreter of the Scriptures.</q>

And is it not the usual Language of the Holy Ghost in the Bible, that the Scripture saith thus and thus? which sure can be no otherwise taken for truth or sense, but as the Scripture is the Voice of God to us.

And seeing sometimes the Text is so plain, that it speaks clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its own mind, and sometimes what is spoken in one part of Scripture, is explained by what is spoken in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (both which himself acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) why may it not with as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be said, that God is the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of his own Mind in Scripture,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53782:117"/>
though he use no other Voice than that of the Scripture in speaking to us? For how improper soever such an Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may seem to this Gentleman, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Scripture-language.

In the mean time this Author may do well to consider, whose Cause he most favours by such manner of arguing. I know none that can so heartily thank him for it as the Romanists, who use the same way of cavilling against us, when we say that the Scripture, or the Spirit of God in and by the Scripture, is the sole supreme Judge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Faith. This, say they, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, unless the Spirit of God do, by an audible Voice, decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, telling the one party they are in the right, and the other they are in an error. And because he doth not so in the Scripture, therefore they deny him to be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53782:117"/>
the supreme Judge of Controversies by the Scripture. Thus <hi>Gretser</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit in the Conference at <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>A second Argument from the Scriptures being the only Rule of Faith, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a double Proof for the Scriptures being its own Interpreter.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>MY next Argument follows: That <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> which is the only Rule of Faith, is the only Rule to interpret its own sense. But so is the Scripture. That the Written Word of God is the only Rule of Faith, is acknowledged by all that sincerely own the Protestant Cause. Now from hence I thus argue. 1. The supreme Rule of Faith is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly guides and determines us <hi>per Modum Objecti,</hi> what we are to believe. Now it is the Scripture in its true and genuine meaning that we are bound to believe. Whatsoever therefore obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively determines what we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, must accordingly determine the sense of Scripture. And if any thing else besides the Scripture be the Rule to determine this, that must <hi>eo ipso,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53782:119"/>
that very score, be acknowledged for the Rule of Faith. 2. Whatsoever is the Rule of Faith, must be the Rule of deciding all Controversies of Faith: This I think no Man will question. Now let but this be supposed, that the Scripture is the only supreme Rule of deciding all Controversies of Faith, (which no sound Protestant can deny) it will necessarily follow, That it must be the supreme Rule of clearing all Doubts and Difficulties within it self. For where the Scripture is on both sides own'd for the Rule, the knot of the Controversie lies in this, whether this or that be the sense of the Scriptures that are alledged on both sides; for were that agreed, the Controversie would cease; and whatsoever deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines that, decides the Cause. Thus <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 1. par. 1.</note> much the Exercitator acknowledges. What ever therefore it be that's made the Rule of Interpreting Scripture, and determining the sense of it, is thereby made the Rule of deciding all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Faith, and is to such as so use it, the Rule of their Faith.</p>

                        <p>AGainst this Argument some may <note place="margin">Sect. 1. <hi>Except.</hi> 1.</note> have the confidence, it may be, to make this Exception, That Scripture is not the only Rule of Faith. The Papists join unwritten Traditions with the Scripture, and will have us take both together for the compleat Rule of Faith. This I shall not deal with, there having been so much said by our Divines about it in the Controversies between us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But there is another Generation of Men that join Human Reason with the Scripture, to make up the Rule of Faith. <hi>Lambertus Velthusius,</hi> one of the Seniors of the <hi>Gallo-Belgick</hi> Church at <hi>Utrech,</hi> is charged with this by <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

firm perswasion of them. But the great Question will be, By what Act doth God write these in our Minds, or beget in us this perception and perswasion of them? Surely, they will not say, that when God creates the Soul of Man, this perception or perswasion of these Principles is concreated by him in and with the Soul: for if so, how is it that during our Infant-state we are such strangers to them, and do so continue, till we come gradually by observation and experience to be acquainted with them?

And when I know by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying Grounds of Reason, that the Scripture is indeed the Voice of God, then do I by Faith assent to what that speaks as Gods testimony. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are some Truths, which are knowable in some measure by Natural Light, and yet are revealed likewise in the Scripture; it is commonly and truly said by our Divines, that as they are

received by Natural Light, and upon Rational Grounds, so they are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Science: but as they are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture, so, and only so, they are the Objects of Faith: which (as the Apostle tells us) <hi>is the evidence</hi>

Now, says he, when we say the Scripture is the Rule of Faith, we do not mean the bare words, but the sense; and that is the thing we inquire into by the help of Philosophy; and when we have thereby obtain'd the sense
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53782:124"/>
of Scripture-Propositions, that sense we own for the Rule of our Faith, and of deciding Controversies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But (adds he) when the Reformed Doctors say, the Scripture is its own Interpreter, they can mean only the Words and Sentences of Scripture without the sense: for it is the sense that they are seeking for, and that cannot be the Rule to find out it self.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I answer: 1. The distinction <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> of the Scripture consider'd <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> or in respect of the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> is generally received: But was never, that I know of, taken in the sense of this Author, but in a far different meaning; <hi>viz.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as to the <hi>matter,</hi> is the Word of God; and <hi>formally</hi> consider'd is the same Word as written. But this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Exposition of it serves his turn very well; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Words and Phrases of Scripture are as rude matter, till the sense (as the form) be given it by Philosophy, or Humane Reason.</p>

But, 2. The distinction, as here u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <note place="margin">2.</note> is a miserable subterfuge, arguing some Wit, but no Honesty. For when we say, the Scripture is the Rule of Faith, and it is the Rule of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it self; in both we mean neither the words, nor the sense <hi>separately,</hi> but <hi>conjointly,</hi> For, 1. The Scriptures are no otherwise the Rule of our Faith, than as they are the Revelation of the Mind of God to us. Now the Words or Sentences separated from the true sense, (supposing they could be so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated) are not the Mind of God: and the sense separated from the Words and Sentences, (if it might be so sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) would be no Revelation: for we know not the Mind of God but by the Words; and his Mind as clothed with these Words, or these Words as exhibiting his Mind, so they are our Rule.</p>
                        <p>Again, 2. When we say the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a Rule of Interpretation to it self, we mean that if the place under consideration be plain, it delivers its own sense to the Reader that well minds
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53782:126"/>
the contexture and dependence; if it be dark, we have recourse to some other plain Scripture, and by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sense of that, wherein the Mind of God lies more clearly in the words, we find out his Mind in that other, where it lay more darkly.</p>
                        <p>The fallacy of this Author in charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to mean only the Words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when we say the Scripture is its own Interpreter, lies in this, he would make the World believe that we mean it of one and the same Sentence of Scripture, even where it is most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure. Now, as himself premiseth, <note place="margin">Phil. Ser. Int. <hi>c.</hi> 2. par. 7.</note> that Interpretation supposes some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity in the thing to be Interpreted; so he could not but know, that in the case of obscurity, we mean it of the Scripture according to its different parts; that the Scripture where it is plain is a Rule of Exposition to it self in those parts that are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, (which himself also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <note place="margin">Ib. c. 11. par. 1.</note> to be our meaning elsewhere in his Book.) And yet we use no such incongruity as he supposeth, in saying
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53782:127"/>
the Scripture expounds it self, each part of Scripture being Scripture; no more than in saying that the Civil or Municipal Law expounds it self, when one part of the Law explains ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                           <q>That the Divines of the Reformed Churches maintain a necessity of the Spirits Internal Illumination for our right understanding of the Scripture: therefore the Scripture is not a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Interpreter of it self.</q>

I answer; What the Spirits enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening <note place="margin">Sol.</note> is, and how far necessary, may be more seasonably discuss'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and therefore I intend to speak something to it in an Appendix to this Discourse. But at the present we are to consider, that the Spirit is said to make known to us the Mind of God two ways: 1. <hi>Objectively,</hi> as it speaks to us in the Scripture, which is of the Holy Spirits enditing. 2. <hi>Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> as it acts in us to help our weak understandings. Now these two are widely different one from the other. The former notes the <hi>Objective Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that is given us of Gods Mind, which is by the Scripture: and this is enough to render the Scripture a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule of Interpretation to it self, whether the other were necessary or no; because there is in the Scripture a sufficiency in the nature of an <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Light</hi> to discover the Will of God; the latter concerns only the <hi>Subjective Light</hi> which the Spirit affords to our dark understandings, that we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is in the Scripture; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53782:128"/>
whereof doth not at all impeach the sufficiency of the former; because that which makes this latter necessary, is not any <hi>obscurity</hi> in the <hi>Object,</hi> but an <hi>indisposition</hi> in the <hi>Subject</hi> or Faculty that is to apprehend it.</p>
                        <p>But it's further objected, <q>What <note place="margin">Sect. 2. <hi>Object. 2. Ph. Scr. Int.</hi> C. 11. <hi>par.</hi> 2.</note> correspondency hath one part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with another? or what right or power hath one Pen-man of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture over the Writings of another, that the words of the one should be Interpreted by the others? Thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the Exercitator.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which I answer: 1. May we not <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> 1.</note> with much more reason say, What cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency hath Philosophy with Scripture? Have not the several parts of Scripture, all which were endited by one and the same Infallible Spirit, more correspondency one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than any of them can have with Philosophy, which is the immediate product of fallible Reason?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Author may do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">2.</note> what good correspondency there is between the several parts of his own
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53782:129"/>
Book, and whether this Objection do not evidence him to be inconsistent with himself. For in his third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil. Ser.

That it is so, appears plainly by two other places of the same Writer, viz. 2 Kings 18. 5, 6. and C.</hi> 23. 25. Which he says, can no otherwise be truly understood but in this sense, that their Piety was eminent and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. It seems our Author was <hi>then</hi> in the mind that one part of Scripture may have correspondency with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this so far as that the one may expound the other. But now the case is alter'd. If it be replied in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, That these places by him quoted,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53782:129"/>
were penned by one and the same Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore might well have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency each with other; but this makes nothing for those who interpret one part of Scripture by some other that was not written by the same Hand: I rejoin, That the first and second Book of Kings were endited by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I grant, and shall make some use of it in my third Answer to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Objection: But that they were both written by the same Hand, or (suppose they were) that the Writer intended by the latter to explain what he had written in the former, is more than he, or any other for him, can prove.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Scriptures, though written <note place="margin">3.</note> by parts, and at several times, and by several persons, yet they all own God for their Author, by whose Spirit they were endited; and they are all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be taken for his Counsel to Sinners. And then what injury or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity is there in making use of what one hath written more plainly, to unfold what was more darkly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

When we compare the Evangelists together, to explain what one says more briefly, by what another lays down more fully; we do not in this so much inquire into the sense and meaning of the Evangelists, as into the Mind of God whose Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries they were. The like may be said of the Prophets: If the Prophets or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles spake of their own heads, or wrote only a signification of their own private Sentiments, there might be some colour for this Objection.

projecting, under that Covert, to advance.</p>
                        <p>But I return, from this Digression, to what I was about. If any thing in the Laws of a Kingdom be difficult and perplex, and there be something in some other Law of the same Kingdom, (though written or printed by other hands) that speaks more clearly of that matter; what wrong is it to the Law, or the Law-maker, or Printer, if a Learned Council, comparing one with another, expound that which is more dark in one part of the Laws, by that which is more perspicuous in another, both proceeding from the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and both obliging to the same persons? Judge alike in the present case. This Objection therefore is of no force.</p>
                        <p>But it is further urged, <q>That there <note place="margin">

                        <p>For answer, 1. Whereas it is said, <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> there are difficulties in some parts of Scripture, that are no where cleared; how does any Man know this? Doth it follow that there is no such thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot find it? Do we think our selves of so piercing or capacious understandings, that nothing in the Scripture that is intelligible, can escape our discovery? Those who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted themselves with Antient and Modern Expositors, do know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties which former Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have in vain struggled with, and some that they have wholly left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht, (either as not apprehending them to be difficulties, or conceiving them insuperable) have been made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear and plain by some later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Verily, God will have us know, that the opening of his Mind doth not depend only or chiefly upon the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of Mans Wit, but upon his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious assistance and blessing, which he affords or withholds when and where himself sees fit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="249" facs="tcp:53782:132"/>
Again, the Scriptures were penn'd not only for the past and present, but <note place="margin">2.</note> for all succeeding Ages of the Church to the end of the World: And as some parts of them, which peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd some Ages past, were perhaps better understood in those Ages than they can be by us now (as certainly many things were that belong'd to the Jewish Oeconomy) so I know not but we may rationally suppose, that some other parts of Scripture, which to us seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, may have special reference to the Church in after-Ages, and that those whom they so nearly concern, shall have more light afforded for the understanding of them in their days, than we have in ours: As without doubt some Prophetick Scriptures not yet accomplished will be made clear by the event, when they come to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                        <p>If there be any difficulties in any one <note place="margin">3.</note> part of Scripture, which cannot be clear'd from some other by the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry we can make, it will be a vain thing to attempt the finding of it out
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53782:133"/>
any other way: but we must be, in such cases, content to be ignorant of their meaning. Nor yet will those Scriptures be utterly useless or in vain to us, if from their obscurity we can learn this needful Lesson, the more reverently to adore the Majesty of the written Word, and more humbly to acknowledge our own ignorance and weakness. And to this may be referr'd what is objected about the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Yet again it is objected; <q>If the Scripture be its own sufficient Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, <note place="margin">

                        <p>To this childish Cavil (which the Author brings in by the by) I answer; Whatsoever Rules are given by Divines for the right Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (such as are sound and good) are

only to direct the Reader how with most ease and greatest certainty to fetch the sense of Scripture from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self.

Having confirm'd my Proposition, vindicated my Arguments for it, and answer'd the Objections against it, it is time for me to draw to a Conclusion. As for the Exercitator, with whom I have mostly dealt in this Controversie, when I weigh his Arguments, I cannot but wonder at his confidence. But he who hath no better Weapons, must fight with a Bull-rush. And it is now become the mode of Polemick Writers that have <hi>Prurient Wits,</hi> to sharpen their dull Arguments with high confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in themselves, and a proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Antagonists: in both which this Author excels; but it is such an excellency, for which no Wise or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man will envy him.</p>

                  <head>THE Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THE Author whom I have chiefly and designedly dealt with hitherto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving engaged himself in a Contest with the whole World of Christian Writers, especially with the Expositors of Scripture, and having, in his own apprehension, won the day, comes in his Epilogue to make preparation for his Triumph, bringing forth his Spoils, and telling us how greatly he hath bless'd the World with his Exploits; and lest we should be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of our Happiness acquir'd by his Victorious Arms, he sets it out in six considerable Points.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He tells us, <hi>This new way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation being sure and infallible, will,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53782:135"/>
if it be taken, forthwith banish all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the sense of Scriptures, and thereby restore Peace to the Christian World.</hi> But I wonder how this should be effected by Philosophy, which is it self so full of Disputes, and the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors whereof are at such variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves. Let them first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile their own Differences, before they undertake so great an Enterprise elsewhere.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It will be a great ease to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; because whatever sense he can make of any part of Scripture, if Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy allow it for a Truth, he may be sure it is the sense of that Text; this way allowing a plurality of immediate senses in the same Scripture, and where it is thus, it is easier</hi> (says he) <hi>to find the true meaning, than where (according to the Protestants opinion) the sense is but one.</hi> And yet sure, when we speak of inquiring after the sense of Scripture, we mean the whole sense, not part of it only. And if many senses may be more easily found out than one, then perhaps our Author may find it an easier thing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53782:135"/>
to gain a thousand Proselytes than one to his new way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This will save Men the labour of searching Commentators; because in this way they may, by their own industry, find out the Mind of God, without any help from others.</hi> And so they may, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Principles, without ever looking into the Bible at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>By this way we may best find out all Corruptions, Depravations, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilations of the Original Text, whether Hebrew or Greek.</hi> And is it not pity the Antient Church did not think of this happy Expedient, that they might have call'd a Council of Learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers (such as <hi>Porphyrie, Celsus,</hi> and others) to draw them up a more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Copy of the Bible?</p>
                  <p n="5&amp;6">5. &amp; 6. <hi>By this we may know how to judge of all various Lections, which are Genuine, which not; yea, by this we may discover the Errours of Translations made out of depraved Copies, or Spurious Readings, though we have no skill at all in the Original Tongues.</hi> Doubtless a singular Receipt, that will help a Man
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53782:136"/>
to distinguish of Colours in the darkest Mid-night as well as at Noon-day. We see what a rare <hi>Pampharmacon</hi> this <hi>AEs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius</hi> hath prescribed, (which he may well call his <hi>Nostrum)</hi> that can work as great Wonders as the Headsman's Ax, that infallibly cures all Diseases with one Blow. For that his grand design is utterly to cashier the Scripture as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and unprofitable, is plain enough by sundry passages in his <hi>Book;</hi> but especially that in his Epilogue, which I lightly touched at in the first part of my Discourse, Chap. 6. but deserves a more severe Castigation. The Scripture with him is of no use to instruct us in any thing we know not, nor yet to confirm us in what we know. All the use he allows it is only this, that by reading therein we may be occasion'd and excited to consider of the things there treated of, and examine the truth of them by Philosophy: And as much as this might be said of the Jews <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> or the Turks <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Was there ever any who call'd himself a Christian, since the Christian Name was heard of,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53782:136"/>
that hath manifested a more vile esteem of Gods Written Word, or a more bold contempt of the whole Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Hath God in mercy left us this only Authentick Record of his Mind to conduct us in our way to Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness? and is this all it is good for? It seems by this Mans account all the Knowledge that we have any use for, is in us already by Natures Light, and whatsoever is delivered in Scripture, must be tryed by that. What could a blind Pagan have said more to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures dishonour?</p>
                  <p>As it is past all doubt that the Lord of Heaven and Earth, in whom we live, and move, and are, ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd and served by his Rational Creatures; so me thinks it should be as unquestionable that he cannot be served rightly and acceptably, but by such a Worship as is according to the appointment of his own Will. The meanest Man living, that hath any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on him, looks they should serve him according to his Mind, and not according to their own arbitrary
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53782:137"/>
choice. And shall we think the Great Sovereign of the World will be pleased with a Worship of Mens own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>aming, without any order or direction from him? Now by which way or means could we know what that Worship is which God approves, if we were in this inpsed state, left to the meer conduct of Natural Light, and had nor Divine Revelation to inform and guide us?

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53782:137"/>
Promised Land, and their Establishment there for some years, till for their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and other sins they were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is recorded by other sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: besides many other remarkable Histories of more personal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now if we must not take these for truth from the testimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which way shall we be satisfied? Reason indeed may convince us that these things are not impossible: But whether they were really so or so done as is reported, all the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, all the Maxims of Philosophy will never resolve us. The like may be said of the many Prophesies concerning Christ, and the after-state of the Church; and about the four great Monarchies that were successively to arise, with their progress and period: If these and such like be examined by Philosophy, what can it say to them? Must these be all rejected? So it seems by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Discourse: for he hath no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for any thing in Scripture, but what may mind us of what we know naturally, and may by the Principles
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53782:138"/>
of Reason be examin'd and determin'd. And then what shall we say to the great Doctrine of Mans Salvation by Christ, which is the grand Subject and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Scope the of Scriptures? Was there ever any syllable of this made known to the World otherwise than by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? There is indeed a Natural Theologie; but I could never yet see ground to be perswaded that there is a Natural Christianity. The knowledge of God as our Creator and Preserver, is in some measure (but very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly) attainable by Natural Light: But the knowledge of Christ as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Sinners, reconciling them to God, and delivering them from the power of Satan, had never been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, had there not been something above Nature to discover it. If any think otherwise, let them tell me how it comes about that in those Countries where the Doctrine of the Scriptures was never published, there is not the least print or footstep of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to be found. But certainly he that talks of the Scriptures after the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53782:138"/>
rate of this Author, cannot be thought to apprehend himself to stand in any need of a Redeemer; or to have any better esteem of the Gospel, than that Triple-Crowned Gentleman at <hi>Rome</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Leo 10.</note> is said to have manifested long since in his discourse with Cardinal <hi>Bembus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For ought I see, this Man owns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Scripture but what may be reduced to three Heads; 1. The Being of God, and his Attributes; 2. The Immortality of the Soul, and consequently Mans future state in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; and, 3. The Rules or Laws of Moral Duty: because of these we have some notice by Natural Light. But how miserably defective is that Light even in these? So that here also we stand in need of a further Guide. Some knowledge the Heathens had of God, and of Mans future state: but, alas, what does all that they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hereabout come to, but some faint guesses, and probable conjectures? And though they have in their Ethicks ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent things, and of great use; yet they fall extream short in sundry
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53782:139"/>
particulars of very weighty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof we should have been utterly ignorant, if the Holy Scriptures had not afforded us a more clear and perfect Rule of practice. And it hath been observed by some, that those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Philosophers, who flourish'd after the general promulgation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, though they continued still in their old Gentilism, yet they wrote much more clearly and sublimely of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and of Mans Duty here, and his Eternal state hereafter, than those who were before them. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cause of this were the converse they might have with Christians and their Writings, or whether that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful effusion of the Spirit that was vouchsafed in those times might in some degree (as to common enlightenings) extend it self beyond the Churches Pale, I will not determine. But sure something there was beyond mere Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, that made them, in their Notions of God and Religion, so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53782:139"/>
I shall shut up all with this hearty and serious Wish, That all who call upon God by Jesus Christ, would highly honour and esteem the Holy Scriptures, making them their study and delight in order to the bettering of their Hearts, and manifesting the power and purity of this Word by a sober, righteous, and godly Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which would more effectually vindicate this Blessed Book from the Scorns and Reproaches of Atheists and Antiscripturists than all Disputes.</p>

IN the foregoing Papers (design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> to clear and vindicate the Protestant Doctrine concerning the Supreme Bule of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Seripture) I have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion frequently to deal with the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Exercitator, and to take notice of what he hath said that seems to be of any moment, so far as concerns that point. But whereas he is pleased in the procedure of his Discourse to step out of his way, and deridingly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches about the Spirits assistance in the Interpretation of Scripture, as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of Enthusiasm; I then waved medling with that part of his Book; thinking it more expedient to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it in an Appendix by it self, this being a Question altogether distinct from that other of the Rule of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
                     <p>In the Fourteenth Chapter of his oft-mentioned Exercitation, he quotes several of our Protestant Authors of great Name and Worth, giving in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53782:143"/>
words of some of them, and referring us for others to the cited places. The drift of their several Discourses about this point seems to be, that there needs an effectual operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to enlighten Mens understandings, and cause them rightly to apprehend, and readily to approve the Mind of God in Scripture. That their meaning may be more clearly propounded, we must distinguish of a twofold under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Scripture. There is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and merely Grammatical percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of Scripture-Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, which a Man, destitute of the Spirit of Grace, may attain by common assistance in the use of ordinary means. And there is a Spiritual apprehension of the things themselves contain'd in those Propositions, (which includes in it a hearty believing and embracing them) that is not attain'd without the sanctifying work of the Spirit, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind by enduing it with an heavenly, supernatural Light. This I find thus express'd and illustrated by the late Reverend Bishop of <hi>Norwich:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53782:144"/>
Natural Men,</hi> says he, <hi>have their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Treat. of the Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin, <hi>p.</hi> 119.</note> 
                        <hi>vitiated, their Faculties bound, that they cannot understand spiritual things, till God have as it were implanted a new understanding in them, framed the heart to attend, and set it at liberty to see the Glory of God with open face. Though the Veil do not keep out Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Construction, yet it blindeth the Heart against the spiritual Light and Beauty of the Word. We see even in common Sciences, where the Conclusions are suitable to our innate and implanted Notions, yet he that can distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue and make Grammar of a Principle in</hi> Euclide, <hi>may be ignorant of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical sense and use of it: Much more may a Man in Divine Truths be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually ignorant even where in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect he may be said to know. For the Scriptures pronounce Men ignorant of those things which they see and know. In Divine Doctrine Obedience is the Ground of Knowledge, and Holiness the best Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to understand the Scriptures.</hi> To this Spiritual Understanding there is need of the aforesaid Supernatural
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53782:144"/>
Light. And this is that which (as far as I can understand) our Divines mean, when they assert the necessity of the Spirits Illumination. Thus speaks the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Scripture.</note> 
                        <hi>The Revelation of the Holy Ghost inspireth the true meaning of the Scripture into us: In truth we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without it, attain true saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Yea, of this mind was <hi>Erasmus</hi> (no Enthusiast) who thus speaks; <note n="b" place="margin">De rat. conc. li. 1. Errat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementer, qui credit se consequi posse ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicarum Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiam, nisi afflatus eo Spiritu quo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae sunt.</note> 
                        <hi>He erreth vehemently, who believes he can ever attain to the true understanding of the Canonical Scriptures, unless he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired by the same Spirit that endited them.</hi> And again; <note n="c" place="margin">Ib. li. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>They have the Book of Scripture, but not the Scripture, that want the Spirit; without which the Scripture is not understood.</hi> And M. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Luther on <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. cited by Gerard in Exeg loc. com. de S. Script. c. 15. par. 336.</note> quoting a Speech of <hi>Aben-Ezra, Sine supra &amp; infra, (i. e.</hi> without Points and Accents) the Scripture cannot be understood; adds a third, <hi>sine intra,</hi> without somewhat <hi>within, viz.</hi> the Light of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Now let us hear the Judgment of the Exercitator, and his pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer <hi>Wolzogen</hi> about this: As for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53782:145"/>
former; <q>If, says he, the meaning of <note place="margin">Ph. Scr. Int. c. 14. par. 1.</note> these Divines were this, that no sense of Scripture, by what way or method soever found out, can be fully certain to any, unless by the Natural Light of our understanding we can clearly and distinctly perceive it, and be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded of its truth, and that this clear perception, and the sense a Man hath of it, be that inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and testimony of the Spirit which they intend; this will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: But if they mean not the Natural Light of Mans understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or what is built upon that, but a Supernatural Light, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Mans Natural Reason, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Mind, or acquired by <note place="margin">Ib. par. 3.</note> it, but infused and inspired from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; this, says he, we disclaim and condemn for Enthusiasm.</q> This is the sum of the censure that he passeth upon this Doctrine. And <hi>Lud. Wolzogen,</hi> who pretends to take up the Bucklers against him in defence of the Protestant Cause, in stead of vindicating the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Authors and their Doctrine,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53782:145"/>
joins with the Exercitator in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; as appears undeniably by his own words; for thus he speaks; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>

                        <hi>the Holy Spirit doth indeed still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert some power in the minds of Men, therefore some have believed that he opens the sense of the Scriptures, and interprets them to the Faithful. Which opinion the Exercitator doth justly decry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that it contains mere Enthusiasm.</hi> Where he expresly approves and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds what the Exercitator had said against the Doctors of the Reformed Churches, charging them with Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm for maintaining a necessity of a Supernatural Light for a saving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Mind of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And himself doth so frequently strike upon this string in several places of his Book, that he seems to design the blemishing and defaming of our most eminent Protestant Writers, and the Doctrine which they have asserted against Papists and Pelagians.</p>
                     <p>These Men cannot be ignorant, that <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> the Divines whom they thus impeach, have all along, in answer to the like
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53782:146"/>
imputation from Popish and Socinian Authors, expresly and vehemently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all compliance with Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts, and that some of them have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten learnedly and smartly against that sort of Men. They utterly disavow their expecting any such Illumination, as was given to the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; and do plainly deliver their minds, that what they assert, doth not consist in discovering any new Doctrine unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in Scripture, but in qualifying and disposing the mind for a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and receiving that which the Scripture propounds: For they suppose (what the Scripture plainly affirms, and what none ever denied but <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers) that the mind of Man by the <hi>Fall</hi> is blind in the things of God, that it cannot rightly and sufficiently, unto salvation, discern the things of the Spirit, when presented to it, unless that inward blindness be removed: That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture propounds to us the Truths we are to receive; but the Spirit disposeth us to receive them; which the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

                        <hi>The same Spirit which revealeth the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith generally to the Universal Church,</hi> (viz. by the H.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53782:147"/>
Mind of God, they acknowledge to lie in the Scripture it self. And therefore our Learned <hi>Whitaker,</hi> in his Contest with the Romish Doctors, makes this clear and candid profession in the name of all the Protestants: <hi>Internas Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Wolzogen,</hi> as he deals most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuously with our Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> in reporting their Doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting somewhat of his own that quite changes its meaning, and so rendring it more obnoxious to censure; so he is very variable and uncertain in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own mind. And yet in the winding up says as much as all that comes to, which he, together with the Exercitator, calls Enthusiasm. For he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53782:147"/>
tells us, That <hi>the Spirit corrects that</hi>

                        <hi>corruption of the mind which hinders us from discerning the sense of Scripture.</hi>—And,—<hi>That he exerts his power about</hi>

                        <hi>the constitution of our minds,</hi> (which he had acknowledged before to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> with the darkness of a natural ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) <hi>by enlightening them.</hi> But then he says, <hi>This is not by putting any new light into our minds, for all that shines in the Scripture.</hi> Where he strangely confounds the <hi>Objective</hi> and <hi>Subjective</hi> Light, as if they were all one. Sure, it is not enough for a Mans seeing of visible Objects, that there be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Light in the Air, but there must be an Internal Light in the Eye; and if this be lost, (as it is in the blind) it must be restored, or the Man will never see, though there were never so much Light about him. Yet after all, the aforesaid Author tells us elsewhere, That <hi>the Spirit of God so powerfully and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciously</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Censura censurae, 144.</note> 
                        <hi>affects our minds by enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exciting, moving, leading them, that the darkness of our natural ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dissipated, we may savingly perceive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53782:148"/>
the Divine Objects presented to us in the Scripture.</hi> And again,—he says, <note place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 266.</note> 
                        <hi>The Eye of the mind being vitiated, the Holy Spirit restores its sight.</hi> And yet more, <hi>I grant,</hi> says he, <hi>that in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness the Spirit of God imprints a new</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 280.</note> 
                        <hi>light upon our minds, if by this be meant that he gives us as it were a new faculty of receiving that Light that shines in the Scripture, not any new Light,</hi> (i. e. not any new Objective Light) <hi>distinct from the Scriptures.</hi> Now truly this (for any thing I can see) is that very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Reform'd Divines, which the Exercitator had so boldly charged with Enthusiasm, and that with this Authors approbation.</p>
                     <p>But I perceive there are some Men, <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> (whereof the Exercitator is one) who make account that all the darkness Men are in, even as to matters Spiritual, is only a want of such a Light as shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Object, without curing the Faculty. Thus <hi>Schlichtingius</hi> writing against <hi>Meisuerus</hi> in defence of <hi>Socinus,</hi> says, <hi>Homo intellectu praeditus in divinis mysteriis ita caecus est, quemadmodum is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53782:148"/>
qui oculos quidem habet, sed in tenebris sedet: amove tenebras, &amp; lumen affer, videbit. Oculi hominum sunt intellectus, lux est Christi doctrina. Man endued with understanding is no otherwise blind in Divine Mysteries, than as he who hath eyes, but sits in the dark: remove the darkness, and bring him a light, and he will see. The eyes of a man are his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the light is Christs doctrine.</hi> To this purpose speaks the Author of a late Pamphlet, that <hi>when once the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Treatise of Hum. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>p.</hi> 58.</note> 
                        <hi>of Christ Jesus was revealed, even Humane Reason was able to behold and confess it; not that Grace had alter'd the eye-sight of Reason, but that it had drawn the Object nearer to it.</hi> But that defect of the Mind of Man which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of, is evidently an internal darkness; not only a darkness about him, but a darkness within him; which the greatest external light, without something else, will never redress; no more than the bringing of a light into a dark room, can make a blind Man see. And if it were not thus, I see no reason why Man should be counted any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53782:149"/>
more blind or ignorant in reference to matters of Heaven and Eternity, than in reference to Arts and Sciences, and common Trades, which he is wholly at a loss in, till the Principles of them be clearly and distinctly propounded to him. But lamentable experience makes it abundantly manifest, that Men of quick understanding and greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in these matters, yet remain as blind as Beetles in Divine Mysteries, notwithstanding all outward means of Instruction. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was train'd up in the Doctrine of the Law at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and very strict he was in the righteousness of the Law, according to the understanding that he had of it. And yet being destitute of the Spirit of Grace, he tells us, that he was all that while <hi>without the Law;</hi> because he was destitute of the true spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> knowledge of it. That <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary</hi> knowledge that he had from his Teachers, was not sufficient, because he wanted the inward light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to cure his blindness, and remove his prejudices. This the Apostle <hi>John</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53782:149"/>
calls, <hi>Giving us an understanding that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Jo. 5. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>we may know him that is true.</hi> And this was promised of old, when the Lord says by his Prophet, <hi>I will put my Law</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33</note> 
                        <hi>into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</hi> which, besides an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Revelation, implies necessarily an internal Illumination. Most true it is, that as the light of the body is the eye, so the light of the Soul is Reason: but if (as our Saviour says) this light which is in us be darkness, <hi>how great is that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>darkness?</hi> And that it is so with this internal eye, as to matters Heavenly, till the Spirit of Grace enlighten it, is <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 8.</note> evident by Scripture and all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                     <p>But as far as I can understand, there <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> are two things in the present point that are especially quarrell'd at: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirits enlightening of our minds is affirm'd to be <hi>Supernatural,</hi> and to be <hi>Immediate.</hi> I shall say something to them both.</p>

                     <p>Two passages in the Exercitator I <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Ph. Scr. Int. c. 5. par. 6. Object. 1.</note> shall here take notice of. The one is, where he says, <q>That the opinion of our Divines concerning this Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, seems to him to have had its Original from the received Axiom of the Aristotelick Philosophers, <hi>That nothing is in the Understanding that hath not been first in the sense.</hi> Which, says he, the Divines receiving for an undoubted truth, did never call off their minds from their senses; and finding the knowledge drawn from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53782:153"/>
thence to be very lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and next to nothing, they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all rational knowledge to be no better: yet happening by chance sometimes to make use of their mere understanding in the perception of some things, and thereby attaining some true and solid knowledge, which they found to be of a far other nature than that which they used to fetch from the senses, therefore they took this latter kind of knowledge to be something Divine and Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I answer, 1. By what Power or Authority doth this confident Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> break Windows into the breasts of others, and take upon him to know the secret thoughts and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of their minds? Did they ever tell him, that this was their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of things? or that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Supernatural Light was built upon the Authority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from any of his Axioms? Or doth his <hi>New Philosophy</hi> furnish him with skill sufficient to search the hearts
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53782:153"/>
of Men touching their particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he pretends it doth to shew him the mind of God in Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations? I think it furnisheth him for both alike: But I wish it had taught him better to know himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither were <hi>Aristotle</hi> nor his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers such Dolts or Blockheads in maintaining the forementioned Axiom, as to take it in that absurd meaning, <hi>that nothing could be received into the Understanding, but what is the Object of Sense:</hi> For they clearly maintain the knowledge of those things that fall not under sense; as of God, and Angels, and of Universals that are abstracted from sense. But that all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things without us, comes in by the Senses, especially by those two that are not unfitly called the Senses of Discipline, <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> is, I think, evident enough by all Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, besides what we find in Scripture concerning the knowledge we have of God; which is either Natural, or by Revelation. Now as for the former, the Apostle sure was not deceived by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53782:154"/>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Axiom, when he tells us, That <hi>the invisible things of God from</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20</note> 
                        <hi>the Creation of the World, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> And for the knowledge of things revealed, we are taught by the same Apostle, that <hi>Faith cometh by</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>hearing.</hi> And our Saviour's most usual method of Preaching by Parables, may shew us how requisite it is for Man in this state to have his understanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd even in things Spiritual and Heavenly, by the help of sense and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Objects.</p>
                     <p>The other passage is that where he says, <q>That this Supernatural Light is <note place="margin">Object. 2. Ph. Scr. Int. c. 14. par. 3.</note> a thing unintelligible, he knows not what to make of it, nor how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it: Is it (says he) something ordinary, or is it extraordinary?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To his Demand I answer, It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved <note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> Nature, and so it is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: but it is the inseparable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of renew'd Nature, and so far it is ordinary, for it is communicated
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53782:154"/>
to all who partake in the saving Grace of Christ.</p>
                     <p>But, 2. Whereas this Author says, <note place="margin">2.</note> He knows not what this enlightening of the Spirit is, I easily believe him, considering what our Saviour says of the Spirit of Truth, which he promised to his Disciples; <hi>That the World could</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jo. 14. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>not receive him, because it seeth him not, neither receiveth him.</hi> And it is no wonder for Men to speak slightingly or contemptuously of the things they know not: Upon which very account many excellent Truths plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gospel, are, by audacious Wits, exploded and derided as unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Mysteries.</p>
                     <p>Yet, 3. Me thinks Mens Reason <note place="margin">3.</note> might tell them, (if it were not wofully blinded by pride, prejudice, or passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that the unaccountableness of the nature of a thing, or of the manner how it is, can be no sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against its existence. The most perspicacious Inquirers into the Secrets of Nature, do acknowledge themselves convinced of the certain existence of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53782:155"/>
many things, the nature whereof, and the manner of their production, they are not able to conceive, much less to discover. <hi>Thou knowest not</hi> (says So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) <hi>what is the way of the Spirit,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>nor how the Bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child.</hi> It is beyond the <hi>ken</hi> of Mans understanding infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to know, or demonstratively to prove, 1. The way of the Spirit or Soul, whether it be produced by Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or Traduction, or what other way. And, 2. How the Body is form'd in the Womb. I know some learned Men have gone far in their Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but the ablest of them have been put to a stop, meeting with some knots which they could not untie. I might ask these <hi>Curious Questionists,</hi> How they can solve the many Doubts that may be raised about the <hi>Species</hi> of sensible Objects, and about the <hi>Phantasms</hi> in the Mind; or give us a satisfying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whence they come, how they are framed, and where it is that they are first received? Or, I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them, Which way the Soul
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53782:155"/>
and Body are united to each other, and how they come to act one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a thousand more difficulties that occur, where the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> maintaining any such supernatural and immediate Operations of the Spirit; and daringly ascribes all <hi>to the heats of an exalted Imagination, or the vapours of melancholick Blood, and the unusual Joys of a recreated Temperament, or perhaps to the clearer light of some discovered Truth, and sometimes to the deceitful Dreams or wild Commotions of a distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind, falsly conceited to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Breathings of the Holy Spirit:</hi> And this he especially censures in those, <hi>who having attained to some eminent Gifts of Utterance, a tenacious Memory, a lively and ready Fancy, with a fluent Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are fervent in their Devotions; whose Performances,</hi> he says, <hi>are cryed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53782:158"/>
up for the actings of the Spirit; not that the Persons thus qualified are so weak, as to think that this comes from the Spirit of God: but that they are willing others should believe so, that they may make the better advantage of such a reputation to gain power into their hands, and as a torrent carry all before them, filling all with Schism and Sedition.</hi> This is the sum of his angry Rhetorick in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And his Friend <hi>Velthusius</hi> speaks in the same Dialect. And no doubt <note place="margin">De usu ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. in Theolog. <hi>p.</hi> 71, 72.</note> there are others in the World of like mind with them: by whom those strong impressions of joy or sorrow that are made upon the hearts of Christians from the sense of sin and wrath on the one hand, or of the saving love of God on the other; and those fervors of spirit that they sometimes feel and express in the solemn services of Religion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Devotion, are censured as proceeding from the different tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of the Body, and the suitable workings of a deluded fancy, or aseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Enthusiastick impulses, or such like imaginary causes. But let the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53782:158"/>
whole be brought under an impartial examination, and I doubt not but this will appear a groundless calumny, to all that shall give sober Reason leave to judge without the interposure of Prejudice or Passion.</p>
                     <p>First then, let us consider of those different apprehensions and impressions before-mentioned, and see what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and sound Reason teaches us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
                     <p>Man, as he is an Intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath a power connatural to him, of reflecting upon himself, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own state and ways, as he stands in relation to God and Eternity. This power of Reflection is commonly known by the name of <hi>Conscience;</hi> which, as it is appointed to be Mans Domestick Guide and Monitor to shew him his way, and mind him of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so it is a constant Inspector over him, not only as a <hi>Witness</hi> of what he is and does; but as a <hi>Judge</hi> also in the Name and place of God to pass sentence upon him, and give him some fore-taste of those future joys or sorrows that shall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53782:159"/>
be the portion of the Children of Men in another World.</p>
                     <p>Begin we with the Distresses of an <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> afflicted Conscience, arising from the sense of Sin, and Gods deserved wrath for it. This may be considered, either as the case of one newly awakened by the Terrors of God to a sad debate with himself, having hitherto been a stranger to the state and way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; or of one already regenerated and begotten again by renewing Grace; one that hath formerly experimented in some degree the sweetness of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life, but is now brought into a dark uncomfortable condition, through want of the sense of Gods saving love, not without sad impressions of his dreadful displeasure.</p>
                     <p>Though I shall not wholly exclude the former out of my present debate, yet it is the latter that I intend chiefly to treat of. Those to whom this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals, during this distress, walk discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solately, find little or no sweetness in any duty they perform, any Ordinance they attend upon, any blessing they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53782:159"/>
make use of. Sometimes they strongly suspect, if not peremptorily conclude themselves to be reprobates and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways, to have no Grace in their hearts, no part in the Redemption of Christ, but to be Enemies of God, Captives of Satan, and Vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction. And this is one part of God's Paternal Discipline, wherewith he is pleased to exercise some of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Children; whether to correct their unthankfulness under former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, or to put their Graces to greater tryal, or to fit them for some special service, or to humble them for some heinous sin, and make them more watchful for the future, or to magnifie his own Grace in upholding them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their Agonies, and reviving them after their violent Conflicts; or for what other holy ends he may have in it, which we are not now concern'd to discuss. This Spiritual Desertion, (as it hath been hitherto called by sober Divines of all Perswasions, as far as I know) admits of degrees, being not so sharp and dreadful to some as to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53782:160"/>
others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some are but for a while under it, others for several months or years: some have a taste of it in the time of their health and strength, and outward prosperity, others under bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, or outward disquiets, or upon a Death-bed.</p>
                     <p>The case of one in this distress of spirit must needs be sad. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The spirit of a man will sustain</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>his infirmity: but a wounded spirit who can bear?</hi> So long as the spirit remains whole and untoucht, it can bear up under all other pressures and troubles. But when the wound reacheth the Soul, when Conscience affrights the Sinner, when this tells him, (whether truly or mistakingly) that God hath forsaken him, and cast him off, that the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reckons him his Enemy, and sets him up as a mark whereon to spend the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of his indignation; this breaks him all in pieces, this proves a weight so heavy, that the burden'd Soul would certainly sink under it, were there not a secret support vouchsafed by God's gracious hand. This makes <hi>David</hi> cry
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53782:160"/>
out, <hi>My sin is ever before me:</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 3.</note>

                        <hi>and thy hand presseth me sore. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. For mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are gone over my head; as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden, they are too heavy for me.—</hi>Besides other instances that might be given. Nor can this be a wonder to any, were these few things consider'd.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The loving kindness of God</hi> (as the <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 3.</note> Psalmist speaks) <hi>is better than life.</hi> This is it that makes all a Christians enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments truly comfortable, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays the bitterness of the most afflicting crosses, that animates against the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most dreadful conflicts against all other evils. Let a Christian live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sense of Gods reconciling love, and he passes cheerfully and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly through whatsoever befals him. Let this therefore be withdrawn, and he is presently overwhelm'd with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <note place="margin">Psal. 88. 14</note> the sweetest blessings are tastless, the lightest afflictions are intolerable. He looks upon God as an Enemy, and

now every thing appears to him as a messenger of death.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. In this case the poor distress'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is his own Tormentor. He mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters up discouraging Arguments against himself; and catches hold of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may strengthen his fears and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his own suspicions of himself; and studiously disputes against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever comforts are offer'd him. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever threats he finds in the Word against <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Apostates,</hi> he is ready to apply to himself: Whatsoever dreadful Examples of God's fierce

wrath upon the worst of Sinners he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reads or hears of, he presently puts himself into their place, and conceits <hi>their</hi> condition to be <hi>his.</hi> The preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises of God, and the former <hi>experience</hi> he hath had of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him, all are now turn'd into matter of terror and torment. The presence of God is a trouble to him, as <note place="margin">Job 23. 15</note> 
                        <hi>Job</hi> says; and the remembrance of God terrifies him, as the Psalmist speaks; <note place="margin">Psal. 88. 3. Ib. v. 2.</note> and his Soul refuseth to be comforted.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Satan, by God's permission, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of such a gloomy sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, endeavours, by his horrid sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, to heighten the <hi>tempest</hi> that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready raised in the heart of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as violent winds increase the storms in a raging Sea. It is the main design of that devouring Adversary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy utterly. In order to which, as he labours to encourage careless Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their security and presumption, so on the contrary he endeavours with all his might to drive distressed Souls into utter desperation. And though he attain not the utmost of his aims,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53782:162"/>
yet thus much he usually accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to exasperate the present trouble, and increase the disquietment by his bold and violent injections. This is sufficiently intimated to us by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles discourse concerning the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who had been cast out of <hi>Church-Communion;</hi> whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 7.</note> them to receive and comfort, lest he should be <hi>swallow'd up with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much sorrow;</hi> adding afterward, how ready himself was to forgive him, <hi>lest</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ib. v. 10. 11</note> 
                        <hi>Satan should take advantage,</hi> &amp;c. Whence we may gather, that this is one of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans devices to tread down such as he finds already cast down with sorrow, and to lay on more load, where he sees the burden'd Soul now ready to sink.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In such a condition as this, till God himself be pleased to let in some <hi>beam</hi> of light into the disconsolate Heart, no succour from the Creature, how excellent soever, can give any relief. The wound is in the Soul and Spirit, which none can come at to bind up and heal, but the Father of Spirits, and the God of all consolation. <hi>If he <note place="margin">Job <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

hide his face,</hi> saith Elihu, <hi>who then can behold him?</hi> As it is he who had the chief hand in giving the wound, so it is he alone that can work the cure.</p>
                     <p>Now what is there in all this, that is any way inconsistent with the grounds of Religion, or principles of sober Reason? Is not the guilt of sin, and the wrath of God to be trembled at? And is not sinful Man capable of feeling the bitterness hereof? Nay, doth it not stand him greatly in hand to be affected with them? Are these nothing but the <hi>reeks and vapours of melancholy overwhelming the fancy,</hi> and filling it full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of fears and dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions? This indeed would be very grateful to the <hi>Mad Crue;</hi> who will readily gather from hence, that whensoever Conscience gives them any close stinging gripes for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (as I doubt not but it doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) it is but making themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this is nothing else but a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Qualm;</hi> and then they will soon conclude, that the best way to be rid of such an unpleasing Guest, is to run
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53782:163"/>
to a <hi>Tavern</hi> or a <hi>Play-House,</hi> to drink or sport away these <hi>Fanatick Vapours,</hi> and <hi>Superstitious Fears,</hi> that break People of their ease, and are Enemies to the peace of Mankind. And such <hi>Mountebank-Medicines</hi> may possibly for a while skin over the sore, and smother the checks of Conscience, by casting the careless Sinner into a <hi>Frolick-Fit:</hi> But whenever God comes thorowly to grapple with the guilty Soul, and set his sins in order before him, casting <hi>Fire-Balls</hi> of wrath and horror into his Conscience, the Poor Wretch will find that these <hi>Anodynes</hi> will prove but miserable Comforters, and that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31</note> the living God.</p>
                     <p>But what do we think of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-instances given before, <hi>Job, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Heman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

What, were they nothing but <hi>Melancholick Fancies,</hi> that drew from those distress'd Souls such bitter complaints, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful outcries? When the last-mention'd

cast down with the sense of sin and the wrath of God. It's only Christ that must be the Physician, and the Gospel the sole Antidote.</hi> The Physicians, says the Relator, easily believed him, having understood the whole truth of the matter, and therefore wisht him to seek some spiritual comfort.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant indeed, that Melancholy, where it is predominant, gives great advantage to the increase of sadness, and the multiplying of perplexing fears: and when Conscience is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, its fears and disquietments may be heighten'd by Imagination, and this set on work by small accidents, as the sound of a <hi>Knell,</hi> or the rattling of <hi>Thunder,</hi> or some frightful <hi>sight.</hi> But still the first and principal cause of the distress is something really formidable to a sober and sedate Mind. And if any should judge otherwise, I think, I may without any imputation of rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or uncharitableness, suspect them to doubt whether Vindictive Justice, and the Everlasting Pains of Hell, be a <hi>reality.</hi> And if any should be of that.

mind, let them, if they think good, solace themselves with such dreams, till experience resolve the question.</p>
                     <p>Come we in the next place, to speak <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> something of the joys that are begotten in a Christians heart by the discovery of God's love to him. Touching this, thus much we find;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>the love of God is shed abroad</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>in the hearts</hi> of Christians <hi>by the Spirit of God.</hi> And that the same Holy Spirit <hi>witnesseth with their spirits</hi> that they <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16, 17.</note> are the Children of God, and Heirs of Glory. Where the Apostle speaks of a twofold witness of our Adoption. 1. The Spirit of God witnesseth this, partly by begetting that Grace in the heart that is the peculiar Character of <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5. 2 Thes. 2. 13. Eph. 4. 30.</note> a Child of God, (in which respect he is said to seal Believers to the day of Redemption; <hi>viz.</hi> by stamping the holy image of God upon them) partly by enabling them to discern this work, and see this seal stamp'd upon them. <note place="margin">1 Cor 2. 12</note> 2. The regenerate Conscience, enabled and assisted by Gods Spirit to see this, doth thence infer a Christians Sonship.</p>
                     <p n="2">

2. Where this is wrought, it serves to fill the heart with exceeding joy above what the greatest earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can beget. Witness that of the Psalmist; <hi>There be many that say, Who</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 4. 6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their Corn and their Wine increased.</hi> And that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, who speaking of Christ, says; <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi> The testimony that Conscience <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> gives to a Christian of his Integrity, is (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us) matter of much joy. But there are who conceive, that besides this, there are sometimes afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some more immediate refreshments from the Holy Spirit. And of this mind is a learned Author, in a Treatise published some few years ago, where he thus speaks: <hi>The Feast of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Causes of the Decay of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Piety, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note>

deliciously. Nay, he hath yet more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural food, Manna rain'd down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Heaven, the Holy Spirit sent on purpose to refresh and support him; those Joys which differ rather in degree than kind from those which are to be his final portion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence are Christians enabled to pass cheerfully through the sharpest trials and sorest afflictions that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them in this their mournful pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. <hi>We rejoyce,</hi> saith the Apostle, <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2, 3</note>

                     <p>These comforts are not afforded to all in like measure, nor to any always at the same height. It seems good to the Wisdom of God so to dispense them,

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational conceit of resolving the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of distress'd Consciences, and the contrary Joys of serious Christians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der assurance, into the different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of their Bodies, and the suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble workings of their Fancy; till I met with a piece of new Divinity in a late <hi>Belgick</hi> Tractator, and then I began to suspect out of what Chimny came all this smoke. For this account doth that Gentleman give us of the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets mentioned in Scripture: <q>That their Revelations proceeded from the <note place="margin">Tractat.

Hence, he says, those Prophets that were of cheerful and debonair complexion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53782:168"/>
prophesied altogether of Peace and Prosperity, Victory over Enemies, and all things to Mens hearts content, these being such things as best suited with their Imaginations. On the other side, those Prophets that were sad and melancholick, or of angry and morose tempers, they altogether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of War and Blood-shed, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation and Destruction, these being such things, as their drooping and dejected Fancy did most run upon. Accordingly he tells us, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Revelations the Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they did not at all better or advance their Understandings, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in them any solid knowledge: They were good honest Men indeed, but none of the wisest: for Men of note, for Wisdom, never were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; that being a work that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Imagination, and not to the Judgment.</q> In the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he undertakes to give us a reason why <hi>Josiah,</hi> when he had heard the Book of the Law read in his ears, and was thereby made apprehensive of some
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53782:169"/>
impendent calamity; would not send to the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> (though then living) <q>because (forsooth) he was a Melancholick Man, and one, who, by his many sufferings and hard usage, <note n="*" place="margin">Let the Reader take notice of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators foul mistake: for where do we find that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> met with any such hard usage till after <hi>Josiah</hi>'s death?</note> was grown weary of his life, and therefore was not likely to prophesie any good. But he chose to send ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Prophetess <hi>Huldah,</hi> who being a Woman, and so [it seems, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the softness of that Sex] more inclined to tenderness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, was a fitter instrument for God to reveal his Mercy by.</q> This is a piece of that Authors <hi>Political Atheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi> And truly I know no kind of Divinity (if we may call any such thing by that name) from which this conceit, that we have under consideration, can more fairly be thought to derive its original. But if we must look any higher for its pedegree, I cannot tell whom to father it upon, (next to the Father of Lyes) unless it be that <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Philosopher of great note for <note place="margin">Avicenna.</note> Learning, who is said to ascribe the Miracles wrought by the Primitive

Christians to the power of an exalted Imagination; by virtue of which, he says, they had entertain'd a strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Deity of their Master: and this fancy (in his apprehension) was that which wrought such Wonders in Christs Name. Whether that which heightened this Pagans confidence to so bold and absurd an assertion, were any extraordinary skill he had in the <hi>Anatomy of the Brain,</hi> or the <hi>Laws of Mechanism,</hi> I know not. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grounds he might be supposed to have, I think none that heartily owns the Christian Name, will ascribe such a ridiculous perswasion to the depth of his Philosophy, but to the heighth of his Infidelity.</p>

I grant, that it is too pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for Zeal to have its excesses and irregularities: And among the rest, there is an indiscreet Zeal sometimes appearing in some well-meaning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that wants the conduct of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd Judgment: which as I take to be much more pardonable than a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53782:171"/>
or prophane indifferency; so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may have ministred some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to those vile reproaches that are cast upon all that are seriously and heartily Religious.</p>
                     <p>But that fervor of spirit that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for, and assert to be not only <hi>justifiable,</hi> but <hi>commendable</hi> in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, is <hi>that which is raised by a right apprehension of the Object about which it is conversant, guided by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed understanding, and attended with an humble awful Reverence becoming sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dust in its appearance before the Great and Holy God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Should not Sinners in their addresses to the Most High, have their hearts deeply touch'd with sorrow for the sins that they apprehend themselves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for whom they are concern'd, to be guilty of, or liable to? Doth it become an Offender, that is to beg his Pardon, to do it in a stupid manner, as if he had no more sense of his fault than a Stone or a Brute? And what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity is it for us in our Petitions for Mercy, to have our desires raised
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53782:171"/>
to the highest pitch that we can reach? Is the pardoning and purifying Grace of Christ of so little worth or use to us, as they need be but coldly or carelesly askt, as if our words freezed between our lips, or as if we did not greatly pass whether we were heard or no? Or can we expect that God should hear those Petitions, which we our selves scarce feel when they go from us? Did ever any Malefactor plead at the Bar for his Life, or an hunger-starv'd Begger crave an Alms at the door, after this dull and sleepy rate? And when we are blessing God for his Benefits, should we not, with the Psalmist, call upon <note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> all our powers to praise him? And should not those, whose work it is to dispense the Word of Life, deliver their Message in such a manner, as that their Hearers may discern they are in good earnest, and that the Word spoken to them is that whereon their Eternal Life or Death depends? Is it not requisite that the Servants of Christ should, in this work, be (as is recorded for the honour of <hi>Apollos) fervent in spirit?</hi>

                     <p>What the Sect of Enthusiasts was, appears sufficiently by the testimony of those Learned Men who have written against them both in former and later times. From whom we have this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; <q>That those who were censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and condemned by the Church of Christ under that Notion, were such as slighted, if not rejected, the Scriptures as a dead Letter, a lame
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53782:173"/>
and imperfect Guide, insufficient to be the Rule of Faith or Practice; in room whereof they profess'd to be acted by Immediate Revelations, which they call'd the Internal and Spiritual Word, teaching them high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Wisdom than any contain'd in the Scriptures. And whatsoever was strongly suggested to them, or made any vehement impression upon their minds, as that which they thought they should believe or do, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it as a Divine Inspiration, and Magisterially imposed it upon others, were it never so inconsistent with, or opposite to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, or the Dictates of sound and sober Reason. And being by this means laid open to Satanical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, they were easily drawn to believe the grossest absurdities, and some of them to practice the vilest wickednesses, contrary to common Honesty and the Publick Peace, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying all by their pretended Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> This is the Character we have of Enthusiasts, both Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53782:174"/>
from Authors of unquestionable credit. And if there be any where in this World any of the remainders of that Sect, (as it's probable enough there are) that entertain such wild and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Conceptions, let them bear their sin and shame. But of this I am sure, that the Persons thus charged by <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zogen</hi> and his Complices, can safely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all unprejudiced Persons that know them, and to the most Wise and Holy God, who is greater than all, that they are as clear from any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with that <hi>Infatuated Generation,</hi> as the best of their Accusers. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They heartily own and submit to the Holy Scriptures, as the only sure and sufficient Rule of Faith and Life. Accordingly whatsoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions may rise within them, or be suggested to them in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they bring them to the <hi>Bar</hi> of Scripture, to stand or fall according to its Judgment, not imposing their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents upon the Scripture, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the sense of Scripture from the

As for that ridiculous sense that some have endeavour'd to fasten upon these, or some of these Scriptures, as if they were to be understood only of the Spirit as given to the Church in common, and not to particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, it is so utterly inconsistent with

of this they live; and in the hopes of what is there promised, through the Grace of Christ, they resolve to die. And if this be the Cognisance and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Mad-men, then let us hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth look for Sober Persons no where but in Taverns, Play-Houses, and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams, and reckon all other for Mad.</p>

from hence into another World. But however, the time is hastening, when these Calumniators will be sufficiently convinced of their folly, and take their own reproaches home to themselves; when that shall be fulfill'd that the Author of the Book of Wisdom tells us; <q>That the Righteous Man shall <note place="margin">Wisd. 5. 1, to 6.</note> stand with great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours.

And they resenting and groaning for anguish of spirit, shall say within themselves, <hi>This was he whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach: We Fools counted his life madness, and his end to be without honour: How is he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the Children of God, and his lot is among the Saints!</hi>

It is one of his grand methods of deceit, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in and by his Servants, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Holy Spirit of Christ, that he may thereby cheat the World,

and bring the true workings of the Spirit of God into suspicion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: As in former times he made use of <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus,</hi> and others, to do strange wonders, the better to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the true Miracles of Christ and his Apostles.</p>
                     <p>But, 3. Without further debate, let <note place="margin">3.</note> Mens fruits evidence by what Spirit they are acted.

But if I see in any the evident fruits of the Spirit of God in humility, love, meekness, self-denial, crucifixion to the World, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conversation; I should be as loth to charge such with false preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as I would be to fall under their

                        <q>But perhaps it will be further said, That Mens fervour and fluency in <note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> exercises of Devotion, are made the <hi>heights of Godliness,</hi> and mightily cried up as if they were the <hi>whole of Religion.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer; It is past all doubt that there are, among Persons of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> some self-deceived Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who place the <hi>All</hi> of Religion in Externals. Thus many among the Papists place their Religion in saying over so many Prayers, (though in a Language that they understand not) in going on Pilgrimage to the Image of this or that Saint, in using certain Rites prescribed them by their Guides, and performing the Penances injoined them, and other such like outward Observances. And I doubt not but amongst Protestants there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (of several Perswasions) that place
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53782:182"/>
their Religion in being for this or that particular way of Worship, different from others, and in the practice of those things, which are (at the best) but subservient means, instrumentally conducing to express or excite the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Devotion of the Heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the life of Religion consists. But as they who thus do are in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mistake; so who they are that do so, falls not under the cognisance of any Mortal, unless they discover their hypocrisie by their open wickedness. Indeed whoever they be that take up with any (though the most plausible, costly, and laborious) services of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, while they indulge themselves in their sin, and walk in contrariety to Christs Gospel; <hi>By the Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>

                        <hi>we are trained up to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World,</hi> (as I fear multitudes do) such are self-condemned Hypocrites. But where there evidently appears a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care to credit the truth profess'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53782:183"/>
by a suitable Conversation, by labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to walk in all good Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards Men; to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure such (whatsoever Perswasion they be of) for making any outward Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Devotion, the All, or the Chief of their Religion, is such a piece of uncharitableness, as is enough to nullifie any Mans Religion in the World who so judgeth. Would Men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to dwell more at home, and be better acquainted with searching their own hearts, they would not be so ready to step into Gods Throne, and take upon them to censure the hearts of others, which none can have the immediate inspection of, but that Omniscient Spirit, to whom all secrets are open.</p>

The best Actions in the World <note place="margin">1.</note> are capable of being blackt and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd by a malevolent Spirit, fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vilest ends upon them. Holy <hi>Job,</hi> as upright as he was, (God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bearing witness thereto) yet was slander'd by the Devil, as aiming at base unworthy ends in all the Service he did for God. And the like hath been the lot of God's most faithful Servants in all Ages. When their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies knew not what fault to find with their known and declared Actions, they would either feign some horrid crime to accuse them of, or (more plausibly) make use of this malicious artifice of the great Accuser of the Brethren, to blemish their most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent practices, as intended for a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Engine to carry on some base de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; by which means they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to raise suspicions of them in the minds of their jealous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and enrage the Rulers of the World against them.

Our blessed Saviour and his Apostles were charged with Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Preaching the Gospel. And thus were the Primitive Christians after them, accused by their Pagan Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for their Religious Assemblies, as designed to practise Sedition, and hatch mischief. Many such instances might be given: But all experience doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly witness it, that the wisest, holiest, and most commendable Works that ever were wrought by Men, are liable to be thus perverted by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning malice of an imbittered Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The calumny that we are to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">2.</note> is so grosly sensless and irrational, that to any considerate and impartial Eye it overthrows it self. For whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that designs to insinuate himself into the minds of Men for his own advancement to rule over them,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53782:185"/>
must use such means for the attainment of his ends, as shall best comply with the humour of the multitude, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them in what they best like. But this is evident, that the greatest part of Men every where are at enmity with all seriousness and fervency in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cry it down, as not suiting with their careless worldly temper. They best relish such a dull kind of outside, heartless Devotion, as may stand with the quiet enjoyment of their lusts, and not disturb their dead and sleepy Consciences: And therefore the less life and vigour there is in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Religion, wherein they think good to bear a part, the more pleasing they are to them: they dread all other as much as a Child doth the sound of a Trumpet, or the terrible crack of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as that which amazes and affrights them, and breaks them of their beloved ease. Who is there that looks abroad in the World, and sees not this? And therefore whenever any have harden'd themselves into the confidence of cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproaches upon such as are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53782:185"/>
to be most hearty and fervent in the Worship of God, they usually have the <hi>Vogue</hi> of the profane multitude to side with them; and are by that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage embolden'd more freely to pour out their venom, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they run so far beyond all bounds of Cand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r, Modesty and Truth, that they give the deepest wounds to their own reputation in the esteem of those who are sober and ingenuous.</p>
                     <p>Did the Persons thus accused take <note place="margin">3.</note> to themselves the honour of what good they have or do; or did they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or attempt to gain or exercise any Dominion over the Faith or Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Brethren, there might be some better colour for this Imputation. But it is evident to all, that they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own all such self-admiring and self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting conceits, making themselves Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to all, in order to the furtherance of their Masters honour, to whom they desire to sacrifice all they have, not seeking their own emolument or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.</p>

But it's usual with those, whose Worldly Interest is their <hi>Summa Ratio,</hi> to measure others by themselves, and to lay that at the doors of those whom they distaste, which they are conscious of in their own hearts, and which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one can discern to be too conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their lives.
