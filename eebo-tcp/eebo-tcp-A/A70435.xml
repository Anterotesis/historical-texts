            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But ſince your departure into</hi> New England, <hi>we heare (and partly beleeve it) that divers have embraced certaine vain opinions, ſuch as you diſliked formerly, and we judge to be groundleſſe and unwarrantable. As that a ſtinted forme of prayer, and ſet Liturgie is unlawfull; That it is not lawfull to joyne in prayer, or to receive the Sacrament, where a ſtinted Liturgie is uſed. 3. That the children of godly and approved Chriſtians, are not to be Raptized, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their parents bee ſet members of ſome perticular congregation. 4. that the Parents themſelves, though of approved piety are not to be received to the Lords Supper, untill they bee admitted as ſet members. 5.

               <hi>Theſe and other ſuch like (which we omit to reckon up) are written and reported to be the common Tenents in</hi> New England, <hi>which are received with great applauſe, maintained with great confidence, and applauded, as the only Church way, wherein the Lord is to be worſhipped. And letters from</hi> New England <hi>have ſo taken with divers in many parts of this Kingdome, that they have left our Aſſemblies becauſe of a ſtinted Liturgie, and excommunicated themſelves from the Lords Supper, becauſe ſuch as are not debarred from it. And being turned aſide themſelves, they labour to enſnare others, to the griefe of the godly, the ſcandall of Religion, the wounding of their owne ſoules (if they did adviſedly conſider the matter) and great advantage of them, that are wily to eſpy, and ready to make uſe of all advantages to prejudice the truth. (Beloved brethren) if you ſtood in our places, we are well aſſured it would be no ſmall griefe unto you, to heare and ſee the people led afide to the diſgrace of the Goſpell, upon weake and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe imaginations, and in raſh and inconſiderate zeale to deale with that which is of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it were of man. And if it be to us griefe of heart to heare that you have changed
<pb facs="tcp:53955:3"/>
from that truth which you did profeſſe, and embrace that for truth which in former times upon ſound grounds you did condemne as erroneous, we hope you will not be offended. You know how oft it hath beene objected, that Non-conformiſts in practice are Separatiſts in heart but that they goe croſſe to their own poſitions, or ſmother the truth for ſiniſter ends. They of the Separation boast that they ſtand upon the Non-conformiſt's grounds. A vainglorious flouriſh and ſleight pretence. But both theſe are much countenanced by your ſudden change if you be changed, as it is reported. How ſhall your brethren bee able to ſtand up in the defence of their innocencie and the uprightneſſe of their cauſe, when your example and opinion ſhall be cast in their diſh? Muſt they leave you now, with whom they have held ſociety? Or will you plead for Separation, which you have condemned as raſh and inconſiderate? You know that thy who have run this way have fallen into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold diviſions, and may not you juſtly feare, leſt the ſame befall you? Some warnings you have had already, and have you not cauſe to feare every day more and more? Errour is very fruitfull and will ſpread apace. A cracke in the foundation may occaſion a wide breach in the building, where there will not be means, or mind to amend it. Experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day may tutour us herein. But to let paſſe all inconveniences, our requeſt in all meekneſſe and love is, that if theſe, or any of the forementioned opinions be indeed your Tenants you would be pleaſed to take a ſecond review of your grounds, and ſend us your ſtrongeſt reaſons that have ſwayed you in theſe matters: and if we ſhall find them upon due examination to be ſuch as will carry weight, we ſhall be ready to give you the right hand of fellowſhip; if otherwiſe you ſhall receive our juſt and modeſt animadverſions in what we conceive you have erred from the truth. You will not judge, if we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſtrength of your grounds, it is becauſe we love not the truth, or bee carryed with by-reſpects (though theſe conceipts prevaile too much:) Such rigid and harſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, cannot lodge in meeke and humble breaſts. Weighty reaſons promote the truth not unadviſed judging. You your ſelves have judged that to be errour, which now you take to be truth when yet you were not blinded with by-reſpects, nor hudwinked your eyes, that you might not ſee the light. And if you have juſt warrant from God to pull downe what you have builded, and to build what you have pulled downe, we deſire you would loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and maturely impart it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as yet we have ſcene none, which we are not ready to prove, and ſhew by the rule of truth to be too weake to carry any burthen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe remote Coaſts of the earth, whereunto the good hand of God hath brought us, as we doe with much comfort of heart call to mind the many gracious bleſſings, which both with you, and from you, we injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Chriſtian and holy communion, (the memory and fruit whereof we hope ſhall never be blotted out) ſo we have alſo ſeen cauſe to looke back to our former adminiſtrations there, and to ſearch and trie our wayes; that wherein ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we have formerly gone aſtray, we might judge our ſelves for it before the Lord: And that ſeeing now God hath ſet before us an open doore of libertie, wee might neither abuſe our libertie in the Goſpel, to runne out into any groundleſſe unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable courſes, nor neglect the preſent opportunitie to adminiſter (by the helpe of Chriſt) all the holy ordinances of God, according to the patterne ſet before us in the Scripture; In our native Countrey, when we were firſt called to the Miniſtery, many of us tooke ſome things to be indifferent and lawfull, which in after-times we ſaw to be ſinfull, and durſt not continue in the practiſe of them there; Afterwards ſome things that we bare as burthens, that is, as things inexpedient, though not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawfull; we have no cauſe to retain and practiſe the ſame things here, which would not have been not onely inexpedient, but unlawfull: ſuch things as a man may tollerate when he cannot remove them, hee cannot tollerate without ſinne, when he may remove them; Beſides ſome things we practiſed there (which wee ſpeak to our ſhame and griefe) which we never took into ſerious conſideration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were lawfull, and expedient or no, but took them for granted, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received; not onely by the moſt Reformed Churches, but by the moſt godly and judicious ſervants of God amongſt them; which nevertheleſſe when we came to weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuarie, we could not find ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Word to receive them, and eſtabliſh them here: of one of theſe three kinds will theſe our preſent practiſes appeare to be, which you call our new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or, Innovations here; except it be ſome few of them, which though they have been reported to you to be our Judgements and practiſes, yet are indeed farre from
<pb facs="tcp:53955:4"/>
us: The partieulars are too many, and too weightie to give you account of them, and the ground of our proceedings about them in a Letter. But to give you (if it be the will of God) the better ſatisfaction, we have ſent you a ſhort Treatiſe touching each particular, that according to your deſire you might underſtand from us how farre we do acknowledge any of theſe tenents, and upon what ground, hoping that according to your promiſe, if upon due examination you ſhall find any weight in them, you will give us the right hand of fellowſhip. But if otherwiſe, you will ſend us your juſt and faithfull animadverſions, and we doe not ſuſpect your loves to the truth, or your ſincere ſpeaking according to your conſcience in the ſight of God. Neither taxe we you as ſiding from the truth with by-reſpects, whereof you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, verily we abhorre ſuch raſh, harſh, and preſumptuous notoriouſneſſe, we ſee as much cauſe to ſuſpect the integritie of our own hearts, as yours; and ſo much the more, as being more privie to the deceitfulneſſe of our own hearts then to yours. And we cannot but with much thankfulneſſe of heart acknowledge the many rich precious treaſures of his grace, wherewith the Lord hath furniſhed ſandrie of you above your Brethren, which cauſeth us with great reverence to accept, and receive what further light God may be pleaſed to impart unto us by you. But as we have beleeved, ſo have we hitherto practiſed, and ſo have moſt of us ſpoken this our Anſwer to your particulars, moſt of us we may ſay, becauſe there wants not ſome Brethren amongſt us who proceed further, even to looke at all ſet formes of Prayer invented by men of another age or congregation, and preſcribed to their Brethren to be read out of a book for the prayers of the Church, as Images, or Imaginations of men, forbidden in the ſecond Commandement; But as we leave them to their libertie of their own judgements without prejudice, ſo do we alſo concurre with the reſt of them, ſo farre as we all goe in bearing witneſſe againſt any ſet formes, or the corruptions in them; In diſpatching whereof, we have been the more ſlow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it behoved us firſt to inquire into, and to ſettle ſome controverſies amongſt our ſelves, before we could well attend to entertaine diſcourſe about forraigne que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which do not ſo neerely concerne our preſent eſtate and practiſe. Beſides your Letters being ſent to the Miniſters of the Churches, and ſome of us dwelling farre aſunder, it was not an eaſie thing for all of us often to meet together to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe Queſtions, much leſſe to reſolve upon one juſt anſwer. But having at length (by the aſſiſtance of God) brought our Anſwers to this iſſue, we commend it to the bleſſing of the Lord, and in him to your Chriſtian, and judicious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; where if all things bee found ſafe, and duely warranted from Scripture grounds; do you alſo as ſeemeth vigilant Watchmen of the Lords flock, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes to God; If any thing ſeeme doubtfull to you, conſider and weigh it very well before you reject it: If any thing appeare to be unſound, and diſſonant from the Word (which we for our parts cannot diſcerne) we ſhall willingly attend
<pb facs="tcp:53955:5"/>
to what further light God may ſend unto us by you: In the meane while wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you in the Lord, not to ſuffer ſuch apprehenſions to lodge in your minds, which you intimate in your Letters; As if we here juſtified the wayes of riged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, which ſometimes amongſt you we have formerly borne witneſſe againſt: and ſo build againe the things we have deſtroyed; you know they ſeparate from your Congregations, as no Churches; from the Ordinances diſpenſed by you as meere. Antichriſtian, and from your ſelves as no viſible Chriſtians. But wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe unfainedly, we ſeparate from the corruptions which we conceive to be left in your Churches, and from ſuch Ordinances adminiſtred therein as we feare are not of God, but of men; And for your ſelves, we are ſo farre from ſeparating as from no viſible Chriſtians, as that you are under God in our hearts (if the Lord would ſuffer it) to live and die together; and we looke at ſundrie of you as men of that eminent growth in Chriſtianitie, that if there by any viſible Chriſtians under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, amongſt you are the men, which for theſe many yeeres have been written in your foreheads <hi>(Holineſſe to the Lord)</hi> which we ſpeake not to prejudice any truth which our ſelves are here taught and called to profeſſe, but we ſtill beleeve though perſonall Chriſtians may be eminent in their growth of Chriſtianitie: yet Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had ſtill need to grow from apparent defects to puritie; and from reformation to Reformation, age after age, till the Lord have utterly aboliſhed Antichriſt with the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſſe of his comming to the full and cleare revelation of all his holy Truth; eſpecially touching the ordering of his houſe and publick worſhip; as a pledge of this our eſtimation of you, and ſincere affection to you, we have ſent you theſe Anſwers to your demand, and ſhall be readie, by the help of Chriſt, to receive back againe from you, wiſe, and juſt, and holy Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, your Lord and ours; lead us all unto all Truths, purge out all Leaven out of his Churches, and keepe us blameleſſe and harmleſſe in his holy Faith and feare, to his heavenly kingdome, through him that hath loved us; In whom we reſt,</p>

               </note> beſet with many temptations to ſinne, knowing what we know beſt, but darkly and in part, no marvell, if in many things we offend ignorantly, of frailty for want of due conſideration, raſhly miſtaking Errour for Truth, condemning Truth for Errour, ſuſpecting evill without cauſe, and not ſuſpecting where is juſt reaſon, drawing erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious concluſions from ſound principles, and maintaining truths upon weak grounds; ſo that in examination of our wayes, and endevours of their Reformation wee had need to looke warily, that wee turn not to the right hand or to the left, for in the one we add to the Word of God, as well as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and of our ſelves are apt to ſtrike aſide to both. A looſe conſcience will be profane, a tender, ſcrupulous. It ſtands us therefore upon to have our ſelves in ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in as much as experience teacheth that many have ſwerved from the path of ſound peace and comfort on each hand.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>(Beloved Brethren)</hi> if ſince your comming into <hi>New England,</hi> upon ſerious Review of former actions you have diſcovered any truths heretofore not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, we ſhal be ſo far from rejecting them becauſe of your former judgment and practice, that we ſhall heartily deſire to know and imbrace the ſame with you, and bleſſe God for you as the happy inſtruments of his glory, our Inſtruction &amp; the advancement of the truth. But if the diſcoveries be of the like nature with the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned in the Letter; as before, ſo ſtill, we conceive them to be new opinions, and not warranted by Scripture, which is the true Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Opinions we ſay, not practices, for not changing your opinion, you might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully alter your practice; nay, what you did tolerate formerly as a burthen, in caſe
<pb facs="tcp:53955:6"/>
not free, you might well forgoe being at your liberty. Your judgement being the ſame, you might uſe your liberty in forbearance of a ſet Liturgie, and yet retaine the ſame judgement of a ſtinted Liturgie, that you had before; you might forbeare for a time upon ſpeciall Reaſon (ſuch as preſent ſtate and occaſion might ſuggeſt) to receive to the Sacrament approved Chriſtians, not ſet members of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation; as ſome Brethren do) who yet dare not think it unlawfull to communicate with ſuch in the act of worſhip, or deem it juſt and right altogether to debar them, as having no right nor title to thoſe priviledges of the Church. It is your opinions whereto we had reſpect, not ſimply your practice. It never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into us to perſwade you to a ſet Liturgy, much leſſe to complain that you had not accepted ours. But that all ſtinted Liturgies ſhould be condemned as devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed worſhip, and ſo condemned as that none may lawfully be preſent at, or pertake of the Sacraments adminiſtred in a ſtinted or deviſed forme, this wee called a new opinion.</p>
            <p>Neither do we mention it becauſe we knew it to be the private opinion of ſome Brethren among you, whom we had left to the liberty of their owne judgment, ſo far as the maintenance of the Truth, and a juſt call did not ingage us: but becauſe it was cryed up, and advanced with all diligence, and endeavour of ſome among us ſtanding affected <hi>New England-</hi>ward, as if a chief point of holineſſe conſiſted in ſeparation. You know how great a fire a little ſparkle kindles. And ſeeing this Diſtraction and Rent had its originall, growth and continuance from ſome Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in thoſe parts, or affected to that way, when in loving and friendly manner we could neither receive grounds at home for our conviction, nor procure juſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the contrary; what could wee doe leſſe then call upon you joyntly to know your judgment, and either by ſound proof to be by you convinced (if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſhould approve their ſeparation (which we eſteem groundleſſe, raſh, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and prejudiciall to outward peace) or being backed by a teſtimony of its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like from you, we might the better be both incouraged, and furniſhed to endevour the quenching of that fire which was kindled but in too many places,</p>
            <p>In other perticulars alſo, wee conceive, you goe beyond Commiſſion given of God: granting them authority to whom God hath not committed it, debarring others from the priviledge of the Sacraments, who have title thereto by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</p>
            <p>Your love in that you were pleaſed to ſignifie firſt your kinde and reſpective ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our Letter, and now alſo to ſend us an anſwer thereto, we acknowledge it with all thankfulneſſe, and ſhall endevour (through the grace of God) to return like affection in truth of heart, if in meaſure we fall ſhort. Of your reſpect to us in particular, we make no queſtion, your expreſſions are beyond that we could expect, as alſo what we dare own. But we humbly beſeech the Lord to direct, uphold, and
<pb facs="tcp:53955:6"/>
guide us, that in ſome meaſure we may walk worthy of our vocation, and approv our ſelves faithfull to your conſciences.</p>
            <p>It was one end of our writing to be ſatisfied in this point, whether you approve the ways of Separation (whereof wee complain) and their courſes who laboured with all their might, (when they conceived hope to be heard) to perſwade therunto. Againſt which (if we knew your judgment) you teſtified among us.</p>
            <p>You know they that ſeparate are not all of one ſtraine and temper. Some deny all communion with us publick and private, ſome admit of private, but deny all publick, and ſome joyne in Prayer before, and after Sermon, as alſo preaching of the Word (becauſe in their eſteeme, this may be done without communion in a Church-way) but refuſe to partake of the Sacraments. All which Separations wee judge uncharitable, contrary to the Commandement of Chriſt, and have ever thought that you (whilſt with us) and we were of one minde herein.</p>
            <p>If of late we have conceived fears of ſome of you (deere Brethren) as leaning too much to what formerly you diſliked, we beſeech you weigh what urgent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Reaſons forced us thereunto, and we ſhall moſt gladly (wee heartily deſire you to reſt aſſured) lay hold of every line and ſyllable, that may tend to diſlodge ſuch apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>For as we conceive, the diſpute to be unreaſonably moved, the Rent offenſive, the opinions themſelves prejudiciall to the cauſe of God, and the advancers thereof to have paſſed the limits preſcribed by God; ſo wee ſhall eſteem it an ineſtimable bleſſing, if (now what hinders being removed) wee might joyn with one heart and ſoule, in one way of God to promote his glory, and ſeek the good of his Church and people.</p>
            <p>We truſt in the Lord, we ſhould not draw back in any courſe wherein wee may ſee the Lord going before us, nor be an offence to any to keep the Lords way; wee ſeek the truth, and are perſwaded it is the cauſe of God which we defend: we plead for Communion with the Churches of Chriſt, no further then they hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, ſtill deſiring <hi>to keepe the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, with your ſelves and all others,</hi> who walke in the right way of truth, peace and comfort.</p>
            <p>How the Lord may be pleaſed to deale with us, or diſpoſe of us wee know not (his bleſſed will be done.) But of this we are reſolved, through his grace, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to raiſe trouble or diſſention among you, if through ignorance or infirmity we ſhall not ſo fall in, as to be of one minde with you in theſe matters. And here we deſire you to conſider that in theſe particulars you diſſent as much one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as we diſſent from you, and that wherein we diſſent from you (and perhaps from the leſſer part of you) you diſſent from the judgement and practice of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53955:7"/>

And now (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the guidance of the Spirit) with your leave, wee ſhall endeavour to deale fully and plainly, as the nature of the cauſe requireth, intreating you impartially to conſider the grounds whereupon we, go and weigh what wee ſhall ſay in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we proceed to declare our ſelves concerning this poſition: It will be needfull that ſome thing be premiſed, for the explication of the terms thereof. We ſuppoſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1 By a Liturgy and forme of Prayer, you mean not a forme of private Prayers compoſed for the helpe and direction of weaker Chriſtians: but the <hi>Syſtem</hi> or body of publike Prayers generally uſed in the Engliſh Pariſhes, compiled for the Churches uſe by other men not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly guided by God, to be ſaid or read out of a Book by their Miniſters as the Churches Prayers. And that this is your meaning, may appeare from your Letter it ſelf, wherein you complain that divers in many parts of that Kingdome have left their Aſſemblies, becauſe of a ſtinted Liturgy. Now we know not of any other ſtinted Liturgy from which the people do abſent themſelves, but onely that which is in uſe in the Engliſh Churches.</p>
               <p>For as for a forme of Prayer in generall, wee conceive your meaning cannot be of that. For it is evident that many Preachers conſtantly uſe one ſet form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their own making before their Sermons, with whom the people refuſe not to joyn.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By ſtinted and ſet, you mean ſuch Prayers, as are ſo impoſed upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Miniſters, as that they are limited to that very form of words expreſſed in the Book without addition, diminution, or alteration; for that Liturgy and forme among you, is in this ſenſe ſet and ſtinted.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By unlawfull, you mean that we looking at that form, as ſwerving from the Rule; neither dare firſt practice it our ſelves, nor ſecondly approve the uſe of it by others.</p>
               <p>This being the true ſtate of the queſtion, ſo far as it appears to us, from the letter. We anſwer, 1 For our own practice, the Churches here doe not uſe any ſtinted forme of Prayer and ſet Liturgy, for theſe and other ſuch Reaſons. 1 Becauſe we finde no neceſſity of any ſtinted Liturgy to be uſed among us, by vertue of any divine precept. And ſeeing the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles limited them, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each men to obſerve and do onely what Chriſt did command them in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20. Who are we and what are our Churches, that we ſhould preſume above this Commiſſion? And, we hope, it will not be offenſively taken by any godly Brethren, That we ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free in this, as well as in all other things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the lawfulneſſe of ſet forms and ſtinted Liturgies is queſtioned and doubted of by many faithfull ſervants of God: whereas for Church-officers to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53955:8"/>
edifie the Churches by their own gifts, as well in praying as in preaching, all ſorts without controverſie grant it to be lawfull. Now ſpirituall prudence guideth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, when two ways are ſet before them, one doubtfull though ventured on by ſome, the other certainly ſafe and good, though neglected by many, to chooſe that which is ſafe, declining the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Primitive paterns of all the Churches of God in their beſt times (when as touching this point they kept the rule in their eye) whether Jewiſh before Chriſt, or Chriſtian above a 100 yeers after Chriſt, yield not the leaſt footſtep to ſhew us another ſafe way to walk in, then this w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have choſen. As for after times towards the end of the ſecond, and beginning of the third Century, we know how far the Churches were then degenerated and declined from the firſt purity; neither do we marvell at it, ſeeing in the Apoſtles time the myſtery of iniquity began to work, and it was then foretold, that the power of godlineſſe would be in aftertimes exchanged for empty formes. In which reſpect, we look not at them as our guides neither in this, nor other particulars not warranted by the Rule, herein following the adviſe of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who himſelf ſaw the corruption of thoſe times, <hi>Non eſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendendum quid aliquis ante nos faciendum putaverit, ſed quid qui ante omnes est Christus fecerit &amp; faciendum praeceperit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, ſeeing our Chriſtian liberty freeth us from binding our ſelves to any religious obſervances, whereunto the written word doth not bind us. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirituall prudence directs us to chooſe thoſe ways, which on all hands are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe, avoiding thoſe that be doubtfull and hazardous. And ſeeing it will not be ſafe for us, needleſly to ſwerve from the conſtant practice of all Churches that are recorded in Scripture, and there held forth as a cloud of Witneſſes for us to follow in matters of this nature, wee therefore may not, doe not, dare not uſe ſet forms of Prayers and ſtinted Liturgies in theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>More particularly, in that we doe not uſe that forme of Prayer and ſtinted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, which is in uſe among your ſelves: theſe and ſuch other like Reaſons have induced us thereunto. 1 The many and juſt exceptions whereunto that Liturgy is lyable both for matter and manner; for the proofe whereof wee referre you to thoſe faithfull ſervants of God, who have gone before us in witneſſing againſt the ſame: Amongſt others to Maſter <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and the Abridgment.</p>
               <p>2 In as much as that Liturgy was never commanded of God, and hath been greatly abuſed to Idolatry and Superſtition, and is not of any neceſſary uſe, and therefore we are affraid to bring it into the Worſhip of God, as knowing the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of the Lord, in matters of this nature; <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, and how ſtrictly hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth his people, that all monuments and remnants of Idolatry and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be aboliſhed from among them, <hi>Deut. 5. 25, 26.

And therefore we do not find that the Apoſtles ever uſed that form taught by Chriſt in thoſe very words, much leſſe limited themſelvs to it, when they prayed, nor did they teach the Churches ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>2 If the Lord would not have us limit our ſelves in our own forms, whiles we are exerciſing our own gifts (which he hath ſpecially ſanctified to edify his Church <hi>Act. 6. 4.

               <p>3 The entertainment of this form hath been a manifeſt ſnare unto the Churches who upon the ſame ground on which they have received this forme into the desks have beene limited to others in the pulpit, by meanes whereof the poore Church of Chriſt hath bin wholly deprived of the publike uſe of the Miniſters gifts in prayer, and the ſpirit of prayer in the Miniſters in publike, hath beene greatly reſtrained.</p>

               <p>THis poſition cannot beare that meaning which you give it, if you take it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, o our mindes, and the plain conſtruction of the words. We never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned why you made not uſe of a ſtinted Liturgy, much leſſe why you did not wholly and in every part tye your ſelves unto, and approve of that forme in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. You might well thinke we had little to doe to put forth ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>viz.</hi> whether you thinke it lawfull to approve in others and practice your ſelves, what ſwerveth from the rule, and we thinke it ſtrange you ſhould give our words ſuch a meaning.</p>
               <p>The thing we craved reſolution in was, whether in your judgements all ſtinted and ſet formes of prayer and Liturgies be unlawfull. The reaſon hereof was becauſe in writings from <hi>New-England,</hi> we had ſeene all ſet liturgies, and ſet formes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er condemned as deviſed worſhip which God would not accept, and partaking in the Sacraments of the Supper in our aſſemblies, therefore diſallowed, becauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in a ſtinted Liturgie, which things were received with ſuch likeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome brethren with us, and by them imparted and recommended to others, that they occaſioned that rent and diſtraction whereof we complain.</p>
               <p>It is true, the people among us ſeparate from our forme of prayer or liturgy, but the reaſon hereof is becauſe it is ſtinted, not becauſe this or that or ours in particular.</p>
               <p>You confeſſe you want not ſome brethren among you who look at all ſet formes of Prayer invented by one of another age or congregation, and preſcribed to their brethren, to be read out of a booke for the prayers of the Church, as Images and Imaginations of man forbidden in the ſecond Commandement, and that the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of Liturgies, and ſet formes is queſtioned and doubted of by many faithfull ſervants of God, ſuch alſo as come over occaſionally, who withdraw themſelvs from the Sacraments in the congregation, doe it on this pretence, that a ſtinted Liturgie is a humane invention. And if we examine the reaſons brought againſt ſtinted formes and Liturgies, we ſhall finde them to ſtrike at all formes and Liturgies though deviſed by men of the ſame age and congregation, and to be uſed but now and then, or but once on ſet purpoſe, and that either in publike or in private, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where we may have occaſion to ſhew.</p>
               <p>You ſay it is evident, many Preachers conſtantly uſe a ſet forme of Prayer of their own making before their Sermons with whom the people refuſe not to joyne; And you know (we doubt not) that ſuch ſet formes are diſliked alſo. And if the grounds be examined (in our underſtanding) they make as much againſt the one as the other. View but the reaſons why you admit not a ſtinted Liturgie and forme of prayer, and ſee whether the two laſt will not in the ſame terms directly conclude
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53955:10"/>
gainſt both. But what ever is to be thought herein, or whether mens practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with their opinions we now diſpute not. This is plaine and manifeſt, that mens opinions are to be judged by their expreſſe words and reaſons, not by their practiſes. The Browniſts (as they are commonly called) can ſeparate from no ſtinted Liturgie amongſt us, but that which is in uſe, and for ought we know they may joyne with their owne Paſtors, though they oft uſe the ſame forme of prayer in whole or in part, in thankſgiving before meat, or in prayer before Sermon, or the like. And yet their opinion is that all ſtinted Liturgies and ſet Formes of prayer be unlawfull, humane inventions forbidden by the ſecond Commandement.</p>
               <p>But if any thing had beene left doubtfull in the Letter, that it might be ſtrained to another ſence, either becauſe we were ſhort in expreſſion, or many of you not informed in the paſſages which gave occaſion to the queſtion, it is well knowne what the words meane in ordinary conſtruction. And we doubt not but many brethren among you, might and could fully informe you of our meaning that there need no ſuch ſtraining to find it out.</p>
               <p>That which followeth in your anſwer to the poſition (as you interpret it) wee paſſe over, becauſe it is not to the matter intended. And wee are as unwilling to trouble you with the affaires of other Churches taking you from your owne weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie occaſions, as you are unwilling to be interrupted.

               <p>The Argument in the abridgement which is uſed againſt conformity to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies did not in their judgement who were authors of the Booke hold againſt the Lyturgie, of which opinion we are alſo.</p>

adminiſtration, it is that which (we are perſwaded you know) we never required of you. If to diſallow the uſe of the Booke amongſt us altogether in things lawfull, good and pertinent, they will not hold weight.</p>

               <p>Now if the queſtion be of joyning in prayer with, and when that whole Liturgie is uſed, or where that which is uſed, is read by an unable and ungodly Miniſter, we then ſee not how it can be lawfull to joyne in prayer in ſuch caſes; For</p>
               <p n="1">1 The prayers of the Miniſter are not his private prayers, but the publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the whole aſſembly, whoſe mouth he is to God. And when the prayers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up by the Miniſter, as a living holy, and acceptable ſervice to God, are not through humane frailty, but otherwiſe for matter and manner corrupt, wee ſee not what warrant any one hath to joyne with ſuch prayers, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. 14.</p>

               <p>SUfficient hath been ſpoken of the meaning of the poſition and the grounds thereof and if we have not miſtaken your judgment &amp; practice both, you have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt both that you call the rigid ſeperation, and this more moderate alſo; And we humbly wiſh, the moderate doe not degenerate into the rigid ere long. It is very ſtrange, if they take not great incouragement upon your grounds. The truth of our miniſtery, Churches, Ordinances, and calling is queſtioned, and where men will ſtay the Lord knoweth, and what more common then that our Liturgie is unlawfull, becauſe it is the deviſe of man; The Author (or publiſher at leaſt) of a letter againſt our Service booke beginneth with ſuch like diſtinction.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Againſt this Prayer-booke (ſaith he) divers have pleaded in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Firſt ſome arguments are proper to the Separatiſts <hi>qua tales, viz.</hi> that it is offered in a falſe Church; 2. By a falſe miniſter; 3. In the behalfe of the ſubjects of the Kingdome of Antichriſt. Theſe are properly theirs, being the grounds whereupon they make a totall ſeparation from all the Churches in this Land, as no Churches of Chriſt. Theſe I approve not, yet note them that yee may ſee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53955:11"/>
upon what different grounds, the ſame Poſition is maintained by ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that yee may be delivered from the prejudice, which hinders many from receiving thoſe truths, becauſe they feare the reproach of Browniſme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are other grounds which are common to all that plead for the the puritie of Chriſts ordinances, and which doe not neceſſarily inferre ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but only ſerve to ſhew the unlawfulneſſe of that practiſe, and our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating therein.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus the Epiſtle wherein the ſame diſtinction of ſeparation is noted: but how truly, let the indifferent judge. If none muſt be counted Separatiſts, but ſuch as have pleaded againſt the booke of Common prayer as unlawfull, becauſe offered up in a falſe Church, &amp;c. then are there none ſuch in the world, that we have knowne or heard of: for it is apparent they caſt us off as no Churches of Chriſt, becauſe our Service is a humane deviſe, will-worſhip, Idolatry; And not on the contrary, that our Service is will-worſhip, or Idolatry, becauſe our Churches are falſe Churches. Againſt all Communion with us they plead, becauſe we are a falſe Church, but againſt our ſtinted Liturgie they argue not in that manner.</p>
               <p>The grounds on which that Authour builds (which he ſaith are common to all, that plead for the purity of Gods ordinances) are one and the ſame with the grounds of the Separatiſts, ſhafts taken out of the ſame quiver and peculiar to them, ſome few brethren onely excepted, who of late have looked towards that opinion. See how affection will tranſport. Thoſe reaſons ſhall be common to all that plead for the purity of Chriſts Ordinances, which were never taken to be ſound and true, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the reformed Churches abroad, or by the godly Brethren at home, whether now at reſt with the Lord, or for the preſent living, or yet by the moſt of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren among whom they live, and with whom they hold ſocietie, or by any miniſter or Societie which did hold the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace for the ſpace of this 1400 yeares and upwards, by your owne confeſſion, unleſſe within theſe few dayes, and that by a few onely. If this be not to ſtrengthen the hands of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts, or at leaſt, to lay blocks of offence in their way, what is? As yet we thinke moſt of them that have ſeparated, are not ſo farre gone, as to condemne all our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies as no Churches of Chriſt, but we judge they have proceeded further then Chriſt the Lord and Saviour of his Church hath given them commiſſion or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the grounds whereon they build are unſound, and ſuch as make way for further danger, if the Lord prevent not. And that the reaſons mentioned in the letters are the proper grounds of Separatiſts, and not common to all them that ſeeke the purity of religion, for they are not approved by your ſelves: and if all this tend not to turne them who halt, out of the right way, wee heartily intreate you to conſider.</p>
               <p>Your judgement concerning the Poſition, you deliver in three propoſitions (for ſo many they be for ſubſtance) In reſpect of the perſons reading the Liturgie, or the

               <p>This may ſuffice that it is not to be found either in this or any other Text of Scripture, that the people joyning in the true Worſhip of God, with unworthy Miniſters, do countenance them in their place thereby. On the contrary, if you will extend this Text to all unworthy Miniſters of what ſort ſoever, whom the word of truth doth condemne as not approved Miniſters of God, the Scripture teacheth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently not onely that the people by joyning do not countenance them in their place and office, but that they muſt and ought to joyne with them in the worſhip of God, and in ſeparating from the Ordinance they ſhall <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 12, 13, 14, 17, 14.

For the worſhip is of God, and the Miniſtery is of God, the perſon unworthily executing his place, is neither ſet up by ſome few private Chriſtians, nor can by them be removed. And warrant to withdraw themſelves from the worſhip of God, becauſe ſuch as ought not, are ſuffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in the holy things of God, they have none from God. Dumbe Dogs, greedy Dogs, Idol-ſheepheards, falſe Prophets, Strangers, are unworthy Miniſters, but they that communicate with ſuch in the ordinance of worſhip, are never ſaid to ſet up Idols or means of worſhip which God never appointed. The ſheep of Chriſt will not heare ſtrangers in the Lords ſenſe, but outwardly they heard thoſe ſtrangers preach (if the Scribes and Phariſees were ſuch) and by hearing them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them to be ſtrangers, i. e. falſe Prophets; Some ſtrangers at leaſt, of whom our Saviour ſpeaks, were of the true Church, and of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but brought falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tending to kill the ſoule, ſuch ſtrangers none ſhould heare, that is, believe and follow: but as they be tolerated in the Church, ſo they may hear them, ſo long as they bring the truth. Unworthy Miniſters are no Miniſters for themſelves, but they are Miniſters for the people of God, that is, ſo long as they be in the place of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the acts of their adminiſtrations are of force to the faithfull, if they obſerve the forme of adminiſtration preſcribed by Chriſt; for Chriſts Ordinances have their efficacy from him, not from them that ſerve about them, and evill Miniſters mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not in their own name, but in Chriſts and by his Commiſſion.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition. Where the whole Liturgie is uſed, though by an able and godly Miniſter, it is not lawfull to joyne in prayer in that caſe. Herein wee cannot be of your judgement; for in the times of the Prophets, and our Saviour Chriſt, as great abuſes, no queſtion, were found in the Church of the Jews in the adminiſtration of holy things of God as can be imagined in our Liturgie or forme of prayer: but the Prophets and our Saviour who taught the people to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pure and undefiled, never taught them to ſeparate from the adminiſtration of the holy things of God. And if the preſence at our forms of prayer be not lawful by reaſon of the corruptions alleaged, there can be no viſible ſociety named throughout the world ſince 200. yeeres after Chriſt or thereabouts, wherein a Chriſtian might lawfully joyne in Prayer, reading the Scripture, hearing the word or participation of the Sacraments. For compare the doctrines, prayers, rites at thoſe times in uſe in the Churches with ours, and in all theſe, (bleſſed be the name of the Lord) wee are more pure then they. But no man will be ſo bold (we hope) as to affirme the ſtate of the Churches within 200. yeeres after Chriſt, to be ſo miſerably decayed that the faithfull could not without ſin hold communion with them in the aforesaid ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. The prayers of the Miniſter, whether conceived or ſtinted in a ſet forme, be not his private prayers, but the publike prayers of the whole aſſembly, whoſe mouth he is to God both in the one and the other. But you will not ſay, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought not to joyne with their Paſtor in the publique aſſembly, if ought bee amiſſe in his prayer for matter, or manner, or both. It is all one to the people in this caſe, whether the fault be perſonall (as ſome diſtinguiſh) or otherwiſe knowne beforehand or not knowne: For if ſimple preſence defile, whether it was knowne beforehand or not, all preſence is faulty. And if ſimple preſence defile not, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is not condemned, by reaſon of the corruptions knowne, whereof we ſtand not guilty, whether the corruption be through humane frailty or not, it is not in us to enquire, but rather whether we be called to come, and the faults ſuch as one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53955:13"/>
cannot or muſt not tolerate in another without breach of charity. For if the errour be ſuch as may be tolerated, and I am called to be preſent; by ſuch fault I am not defiled though knowne before. If the error be ſuch as in conſcience may not be tolerated, though not knowne before hand, I am bound, if preſent ſome way to profeſſe againſt it. This diſtinction of perſonall and miniſteriall faults in this caſe untill it be cleared by ſome Text of Scripture or ſound reaſon from the word, muſt goe for the deviſe of man.</p>
               <p>A Church, a Miniſter, or a Chriſtian may be ſtiffe in an error (being miſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it is a truth) after many meanes long uſed to convince them, with whom yet we muſt hold communion in the ordinances of Religion: and the error may be ſuch as we cannot without hypocriſy or denyall of the truth hold communion, though ſuch meanes of conviction have not gone before. But the corruptions alleadged againſt our forme of prayer for matter or manner, are ſuch as one Chriſtian may and muſt tolerate in another where he hath no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe them.</p>
               <p>Hath not Chriſtian wiſdome and experience of humane frailties leſſoned you (deere brethren) to beare one with another in matters of greater conſequence then any have or can be objected truly againſt the form of prayer in uſe among us? And why ſuch corruptions ſhould not be aſcribed to humane frailty; we ſee not: For if a godly Miniſter make uſe of a book in things which he judgeth lawfull for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner, the corruption in him that uſeth it according to his judgement, from what cauſe can it ſpring but humane ignorance and frailty? We reſt aſſured you queſtion not the integrity of many, who make much more uſe of the booke then onely in a few ſelect prayers. From the bottome of our hearts we deſire and pray that God would remove out of his Church and worſhip whatſoever offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for matter or manner, and that all things may be ſo done, not onely that they may be tolerated but that they might be approved in the conſcience of all men. But we are perſwaded that not onely ſome few ſelect prayers but many prayers &amp; other exhortations may lawfully be uſed, <note place="margin">We ſee no warrant why for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act, that in a larger ſence is Idolatrous, adjoyned to Gods true worſhip, we ſhould forbeare our preſence at the true worſhip it ſelf. Unreaſon. of ſeperation. anſw to 6. argument.</note> with fruit and edification to Gods people.</p>
               <p>To aggravate faults eſpecially when it tends to draw away people from the Ordinances of God, is no leſſe fault then to excuſe them, it may be greater, and therefore we dare not eſteeme the prayers read by a godly and faithfull Miniſter according to the booke in uſe among us, a corrupt ſacrifice whether in ſuch as read them, or them that be preſent. In them that join according to Chriſts command (and liberty of abſence from Chriſt hath not beene ſhewed) notwithſtanding the corruptions, we hold the prayers to be an holy and acceptable ſacrifice to God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53955:14"/>
and pleaſing to Jeſus Chriſt. The corrupt ſacrifice is that, which the deceiver bringeth voluntarily, and out of neglect, having a male in his flock: but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bringeth himſelf and his godly deſires according to the will of God, and as for corruptions, whether reſpecting matter or forme, they are none of his, they cleave not to his Sacrifice to ſtaine or pollute it. As for the Text of the Prophet <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13, 14. it is cited by many in this buſineſſe, and to many purpoſes applyed, but we cannot finde that in the Prophet for which it is here brought, <hi>The deceiver is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed that offereth a corrupt thing to the Lord.</hi> This we reade and beleeve, but that a godly man, being preſent at this forme of prayer among us, read by a godly and faithfull Miniſter, is the deceiver, who offereth a corrupt thing unto the Lord, that is not proved. No argument can be brought from this place to the purpoſe, but by analogy, which is a kinde of arguing of all other moſt ready at hand, but lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to moſt exceptions, and apt to draw aſide, if great care be not had, (which in this place we finde not) to take the proportion in every materiall point juſt and right. And we deſire ſuch as alleadge this paſſage of Scripture againſt ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at the prayers of our Liturgy, adviſedly to conſider whether God allow them to make ſuch application of his truth which wee much doubt of, to ſay no more.</p>
               <p>Your third propoſition. That as you are very tender of imputing ſinne to thoſe men that joyne in ſome ſelect prayers read by an able and godly Miniſter: ſo on the other ſide you are not without feare, leaſt ſuch joyning may be found unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, unleſſe it may appeare that the Miniſters with whom the people have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in reading thoſe Prayers, neither give any ſcandall by reading them, nor give unlawfull honour to a thing abuſed to Idolatry and Superſtition, nor doe ſuffer themſelves to be ſinfully limited in the reading of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 We cannot conceive how you ſhould imagine the practice of a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in reading ſome few ſelect prayers to be ſcandalous or offenſive in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations when the people generally, not in their aſſemblies onely, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole land, were perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of that courſe till now of late ſome have beene drawne away to ſeparate, who yet by warrant of Scripture produce nothing of weight to countenance that practice.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If the booke ſhould be as you take it an idolathite, latent offence doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige. If any man ſay unto thee, this is ſacrificed to Idols, eat it not, ſo that if it doe not manifeſtly appeare that this practice is ſcandalous; it is not lawfull for the people to withdraw themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The book (we ſpeake of the Liturgie ſo far as it is ſound and good) by your confeſſion is no Idolathite, neither was it taken out of the Maſſe-book in ſuch ſenſe as you object, but rather the maſſe &amp; other Idolatrous prayers were added to it, for popery is as a ſcab or leproſie cleaving to the Church, and many truths belonging to the Church as her proper legacie were ſtollen and heaped together in that denne.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53955:14"/>
And why the true man may not challenge his goods where ever he finds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the thiefe plead title to the true mans goods by preſcription, we know not? It is no hard taske to ſhew that our Service-booke was reformed in moſt things according to the pureſt Liturgies which were in uſe in the Church long before the maſſe was heard of in the world. And if that could not be ſhewed, yet formes of ſpeech general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken (we ſpeak not of this or that ſpeciall word or phraſe) is no more defiled by Idolatry then the light aire, or place where Idolatry is committed. It is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pray, Lord helpe, or Lord have mercy, or to give thankes, praiſed bee God, becauſe the Papiſts ſay, <hi>Lady helpe,</hi> or, <hi>praiſed be God and the Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Put caſe the Miniſter in reading ſuch prayers gives offence, or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes unlawfull honour to a thing abuſed to Idolatry and Superſtition, or ſuffer himſelfe to be ſinfully limited in the reading of them, what is that to the faithfull? This can be no juſt ground of the peoples not joyning with them in the worſhip of God, for that offence is perſonall onely, and not the ſin of them that be preſent, they joyn in prayer onely, and not in his reading or limiting himſelf. Not to ſay that every particular perſon muſt be herein both accuſer and Judge. If he give offence muſt they ſtumble at the ſtone, and ſeparate from the ordinance of grace? wee ſhould rather think it is their duty to look unto their feet, that they goe not awry. Let it be ſhewed out of the Word of God, that either the Miniſter is guilty of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unlawfull honour, or that the people may lawfully withdraw themſelves in caſe he ſhould do ſo, and we will then ſay as you do, but untill that be proved, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed and called to proffer our judgements) we believe that ſeparation is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and ſinfull, never taught of God, nor confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the approved example of the godly in any age <note place="margin">Compare what' Maſter <hi>I.

               <p>Fiftly, if this and ſuch like ſcruples make it unlawfull to joyn in the ordenance of worſhip, we muſt hold communion with no ſociety under heaven. For may not the brethren which hold all ſtinted Liturgies, and ſet forms unlawfull ſay with like ſtrength of reaſon, It is unlawfull to joyn in conceived prayer with others, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they give too little honour to it, as deeming the other lawfull, or ſinfully limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſuffering themſelves to be limited to one ſtinted forme, though conceived at firſt by them ſelves? And may not the brethren who hold a ſtinted forme lawfull in like manner object? It is unlawfull to joyn in prayer with them becauſe they attribute too much honour to conceived prayer, as making their device and method
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53955:15"/>
the worſhip of God? And may not the Brethren which hold it lawfull to uſe ſome ſelected prayers according to the forms among us, upon the ſame grounds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne communion with both ſorts? and all of them one with another, becauſe they either limit themſelves too much, or too little? You ſay in the expoſition of the firſt poſition, many Preachers conſtantly uſe a ſet form of prayer of their own making before their Sermons, muſt you not ſay upon this ground, that it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to joyn with them, becauſe they ſinfully ſtint themſelves? In probability a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may preſume, that in the publike worſhip of God, there will be through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ignorance &amp; infirmity ſomwhat amiſs for matter, or manner, or both, &amp; that upon this ground, he muſt joyn with no ſociety in any part of Gods worſhipat all.</p>
               <p>The advancing of every ſmall difference to this height, is that which will bring all to confuſion, if men walk uniforme to their own principles. It is well obſerved by Maſter <hi>I. Da.</hi> that unleſſe men will yield ſo much favour each to other in ſome difference of opinions, a diſſolving not onely of Churches, but of humane ſocieties alſo muſt neceſſarily follow, &amp; not onely not two Miniſters, but not two men ſhould live together, which were to put off even humanity it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, wee have credibly heard that you hold fellowſhip with profeſſed, rigid Separatiſts without any acknowledgment of their errour, and receive them as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or communicate with them in the priviledges of the Church, though you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe you approve not their opinion or practice. And if in godly wiſdome, you can ſee grounds to joyn with them, we marvell you ſhould be ſo timorous in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, if you judge the practice of ſuch godly Miniſters, ſcandalous to them that ſeparate from the ordinance, becauſe it is not adminiſtred in this, or that but in a ſtinted form. It is a ſcandall taken, and not given; and by forbearing, if to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme men in errour, be to ſcandalize them, they ſhould offend them the more: yea, they ſhould prejudice the truth, and it might be an occaſion to beget needleſſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in others, and draw them ignorantly from the fellowſhip of the Saints in the holy ordinances of God, and ſtrengthen them who by your owne confeſſion, are run too far into Schiſme already.</p>

               <p>THe Seals Baptiſm &amp; the Lords Supper are given to the Church, as a priviledge peculiar therto in ordinary diſpenſation. Indeed the preaching of the word is not ſo, being an ordinance given not onely for the edifying of the Church already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered but alſo for the gathering of men to the Churches that yet are without: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the diſpenſing of the Seals is Gods Ordinance, given onely for the edifying of the Church being gathered, and not for the gathering of it: And becauſe there is now, no univerſall viſible Church on earth wherein the Seals are diſpenced, there being no place, nor time, nor Officers, nor Ordinances appointed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament by Chriſt our Lord, for any ſuch Aſſemblies as the <hi>Iewes</hi> had under <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p>IF by the Church be underſtood the Society of men, profeſſing the entire faith of Chriſt, the ſeales are given unto it as a peculiar priviledge; but if by the Church you underſtand onely a congregationall aſſembly in Church order, the ſeales were never appropriated to it. But to examine every thing in order as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Seales, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, are given to the Church as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges peculiar thereunto, not onely in ordinary (as you ſay) but alſo in extraordinary diſpenſation. True baptiſme is not without the <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4, 5.</note> Church, but within it; an ordinance given to it, and they that are baptiſed, muſt needes be of a Church. The Sacraments are the ſeales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the faithfull, which is the forme of the Church, and when for ſubſtance rightly uſed, tokens and pledges of our ſpirituall admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and entertainment into the Lords family, and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolls <note place="margin">Acts. 2. 38. 41. Gen 1. 10. Math. 28. 14 20. Robinſ. <hi>againſt</hi> Bern. <hi>reaſ. diſcuſ.</hi> pa. 77.</note> or teſtimonies whereby the people of God are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all other Nations. This is moſt certain, as in the ordinary; ſo in the extraordinary diſpenſation of the Seales, as is confirmed by the Texts of Scripture alleadged in the Margine. For the Apoſtles (as you ſay) diſpenced the ſeales in an extraordinary way, but the ſeales diſpenced by the Apoſtles were Seales of the covenant, priviledges peculiar to the Church, priviledges of ſpirituall admittance and entertainment into the Lords family.</p>
               <p>And when you ſay the diſpencing of the Seals is an Ordinance given onely for the edifying of the Church being gathered, and not for the gathering of it, muſt it not be underſtood in extraordinary, diſpenſation as wel as ordinary: To what pupoſe then are thoſe words (in ordinary diſpenſation) added to the propoſition? if thereby you would intimate that the Sacraments be not the peculiar priviledges of the Church, and Seales of the Covenant in extraordinary diſpenſation, it is evidently croſſe to the Text you cite, and to your ſelves afterward. If your meaning be, that in ordinary diſpenſation the Sacraments doe of right belong to them onely, who bee ſet members of a viſible congregation, it is all one with the concluſion, that which is in queſtion and ſhould be proved, and that which this very Scripture doth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully diſprove'; for they that were baptiſed were not ſet members of a particular congregationall Church whereunto they were baptiſed, nor in a Church way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptiſme (as is evident and granted by the moſt of your ſelves) but by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53955:17"/>
ſolemnly admitted into the Church, and then it is not for your purpoſe; or they were ſet members (as ſome of the brethren ſeeme to contend in anſwer to the objection framed againſt this conſideration) and then the words are more then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. Added, they were to prevent the objection which you foreſaw might be made from the Apoſtles practice and example but ſo as they cut aſunder the ſinews of the conſideration it ſelfe, and make it of no force. For as thoſe beleivers were of the Church: ſo are approved Chriſtians and their ſeed among us: therefore the priviledges of the ſeales belong unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And as the ſeales: ſo is the word of ſalvation preached and received a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church. If by the preaching of the word you underſtand nothing but the tender of ſalvation or the publiſhing of the will of God, concerning the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, whether by private or publike perſons; it is not proper to the Church but an ordinance given for the gathering of men to the Church, and not only for the edifying of the Church. For the Apoſtles firſt preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles when Infidels, that they might be converted; And we doubt not but a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or private Chriſtian comming into a country of Infidells, may as occaſion is offered, and as they ſhall be inabled, inſtruct and perſwade them to receive the faith of Chriſt: but if by the preaching of the word be meant the giving of the word to a people, to abide and continue with them, and conſequently their receiving of it at leaſt in profeſſion then it is proper to the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The word makes diſciples to Chriſt, and the word given to a people is Gods covenanting with them, and the peoples receiving this <note place="margin">Lev 2. 13. Deut. 29. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 17. 18.</note> word and profeſſing their faith in God through Ieſus Chriſt is the taking of God to bee their God. The lawes and ſtatutes which God gave to Iſraell, was the honour and ornament to that Nation, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2 Deut. 4 6. Pſa. 247 19 20 Neb. 9. 13. Act. 7. 38. Luk. 16. 29. 2 Cor 5 19 &amp; 11. 2. Deut 33. 3. 10. 8. 30</note> and a teſtimony that God had ſeparated them from all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even the Gentiles themſelves being Iudges. The word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is ſent and given to the world reconciled in Ieſus Chriſt, and they that receive the doctrine, law, or word of God are the Diſciples, ſervants and people of God.</p>
               <p>In your ſecond conſideration you intimate that there is a two fold preaching, the one by office and authority, the other in Common charity, or how ever elſe it may be called. For thus you write. God hath joyned to preach <hi>(viz</hi> by office) and to baptize together, therefore we may not ſeparate them. Now to preach unto, that is to inſtruct or counſell in charity is a duty which may be performed to an infidell, but to preach by office is proper to them that are called to that office: and ſo to be taught and inſtructed by Officers in the <note place="margin">Robin againſt Bern P 159.</note> Church is proper to the Church.</p>
               <p>To have paſtors who ſhall feed with knowledge and underſtanding is a gift of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53955:17"/>
matrimoniall love which God vouchſafeth unto his Church. The Apoſtles firſt gathered Churches and then ordained elders <note place="margin">

               <p>Moreover the true worſhip of God is an inſeparable and infallible marke of the true Church of God, for where Chriſt is, there is his Church.

The ſignes of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Churches are theſe. The continuance in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and prayer. And if faith, true and <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14 Act 2. 42</note> lively (though mixed with many doubtings and errors) make a man a living member of Ieſus Chriſt, the entyre profeſſion of true faith joyned with holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life in ſome meaſure anſwerable thereunto, makes a man a true member of the viſible Church. And if the feales belong to the Church in right and orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, they that joyne together in the true worſhip of God, according to his will, with godly and faithfull paſtors, they have right and title to the Sacraments according to divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that there is now no viſible Catholike Church in your ſenſe will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bee granted. <hi>i. e.</hi> there is no univerſall ſociety conſiſting of all ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted or to bee eſteemed Chriſtians, ſubjected to one or many vniverſall Paſtors or guides, wherwithall ſubordinates muſt communicate in ſome ſacred things which may make them one Church and which may and can be performed by that vniverſall and head Church only. Such an vniverſall Chriſtian Church Chriſt never ordained, no not in the dayes of the Apoſtles, to whom all the care of all the Churches, was committed. The Churches planted by the Apoſtles had all the ſame ſubſtantiall lawes and cuſtomes, the ſame guides and officers for kinde, the ſame ordinances of worſhip and meanes of Salvation: But one flock or Society in the fore mentioned acceptation they were not, becauſe they were but ſubordinate to one viſible head, Chriſt, with which they were to hold union and communion

               <p>It is the priviledge of Chriſtians baptiſed themſelves, and walking in the faith, that their children ſhould have right to baptiſme in all true Churches in the world. It is the priviledge of Chriſtians lawfully and juſtly admitted to the Lords Supper in one viſible Church, and walking in covenant with God, that they have right to this priviledge in all Churches profeſſing their intire faith, and you muſt ſhew juſt and ſound reaſons from God of your judgement and practice in debarring their ſeed from baptiſme, and parents themſelves from the Supper, or elſe (to uſe the words of a reverend Elder among you, in a caſe of leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not concerning ſo many) you will be found guilty of <note place="margin">I.

For if the Miniſters be the Miniſters of Chriſt, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations the Churches of Chriſt, then knowne and approved Chriſtians are members of the Church. In your opinion the members of the Jewiſh Church might be received unto baptiſme, upon confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, before they were entred into Church fellowſhip, and it is more then ſtrange to us that you ſhould not thinke the true viſible members of the Churches of Chriſt to have as much title and intereſt to the Seales, as the members of the Jewiſh Church to the Sacrament of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The diſtinct Churches mentioned in the New Teſtament, it is not certain that they were congregationall ſocieties conſiſting onely of ſo many as might and did meete together ordinarily in one place at one time for the publike worſhip of God, and their own edification, and if this were granted it would not carry the weight that was laid upon it, But becauſe it may make way for the clearing of ſome other

points pertaining to diſcipline and Church orders, we intreat leave to ſet downe, and deſire you to examine what may be objected againſt it. We will not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this that the leaſt circuite wherein there is mention of Churches is ample enough to containe ſome dioceſſes and the leaſt City, populous enough to make many numberſome congregations. Nor upon this, that to <note place="margin">Bucer. diſſ. ep 3 pa 43 &amp; ep 48. pa. 226.</note> meete at one time and one place, as one aſſembly is a thing meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidentary to the unity of the Church and ſociety Eccleſiaſticall which is ſtill one, when they are diſperſed aſunder, and no particular man of that ſociety at firſt remaining now alive. The number of beleevers was ſo great in ſome Cities as they could not conveniently meete in one place as one aſſembly to worſhip the Lord according to his will and for their edifying. That there was a Church gathered in the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> by the miniſtery of <hi>Phillip</hi> will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, for they received the word and were baptiſed, but that the Church in that City was onely a congregationall aſſembly is more then can probably be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of Scripture. For the whole City or the greateſt part could not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſemble in one place to their edification: But the whole City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in a manner, (as it is probable) imbraced the faith. <note place="margin">Act. 8. 6. &amp; 15 4. Act 8. 12. 14. &amp; 18. 12.</note> As the whole City from the leaſt to the greateſt had given heede to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> before, ſo to <hi>Phillip</hi> now when he preached Chriſt, And the Text ſaith expreſly that <hi>Samaria</hi> received the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was one and diſtinct, but it <note place="margin">Acts 2. 41. &amp; 4. 4. &amp; 5 14. &amp; 6. 1. &amp; 6. 7</note> grew and increaſed firſt to 3000. then to 5000. afterwards multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men and women were added, and the multitude of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples increaſed; it is alſo noted that a company of the Prieſts received the faith. The Syriacke hath it of the Jews, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> inhabiting Judea, but the <hi>Greeke, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi> vulgar, <hi>Chriſoſtoms</hi> &amp; <hi>Ethiopians</hi> approve the former, and the number of the Prieſts was not ſmall: there is mention alſo of millions of beleevers. And when all the Apoſtles, or the greateſt part of them remained at <note place="margin">Ezra. 2. 36, 37, 38.

Without queſtion the number of beleevers in <hi>Antioch</hi> was not ſmall, of which it is ſaid expreſly, that a great number beleeved, turned to the Lord and that a great multitude was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lord by the preaching of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> continued there one whole yeere preaching the word of <note place="margin">Act 11. 21.</note> God, and teaching the multitude, ſo that the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians at <hi>Antiach.</hi> After that this Church was viſited by <hi>Paul</hi>

and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who continued there teaching and preaching the Word of God with many others alſo, and may wee not thinke <note place="margin">Act. 13 12 et 14. 27. et 15. 30 34, 35.</note> that this Church did quickly riſe to ſuch bigneſſe that they could not well aſſemble in one congregation as now wee call them?</p>
               <p>It will eaſily be credited that the number of believers was not ſmall at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> if we call to minde that when <hi>Paul</hi> had been there but two yeers, all they that dwelt in <hi>Aſia</hi> had heard the word of the Lord both <hi>Iews</hi> and <note place="margin">Acts 19 10. &amp; 16. 9 &amp; 29. 27.

                  <hi>Grecians,</hi> that a great doore and effectuall was opened to him at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> That the art for making Shrines, and <hi>Dianaes</hi> Temple was in danger to be ſet at nought, and that thoſe that had uſed curious arts, came and burnt their books in the ſight of all men, which could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger unto the Church, unleſſe a great part of the City had believed. Where a Church did comprehend a City with its Suburbs and the Country circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, <hi>i. e.</hi> the believers who profeſſed the faith within that circuit. It might well be that the number did ſo increaſe through the extraordinary bleſſing of God, which accompanied the preaching of the word in thoſe primitive times, and firſt planting of the heavenly Kingdome, that they could not well meet ordinarily in one place, and yet continued one Society. For when a number is gathered in ſmall Villages, or ſome added to the number already gathered, it is not meet they ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected becauſe ſmall, nor divided from the body, becauſe the number not competent to make an intire and perfect body of it ſelfe. The increaſe of the Churches doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an increaſe of Elders, and (if they grow to bigneſſe more then ordinary) an increaſe of places for their aſſembling, when the eſſence of the viſible Church is not changed, nor one multiplied or divided into many. And it is more available for the good of the Church, and further removed from all ambition, if the Society ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble occaſionally in divers places as parts and members of the body, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a diſtinct free Society conſiſting of a few Believers, not fit to make up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body contrary to the precedent examples of the Apoſtles. In times of grievous and hot perſecution the Churches of God could not aſſemble in any great number in publick places, but have been compelled to meet in Woods, Caves, Dens, and dark corners, as the Lord hath offered opportunity, one and the ſame Society in ſundry places: So that either it is not eſſentiall to the Church to meet together in one place ordinarily, or their Society is broken off by perſecution, when their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in one place is interrupted. It is ſaid by ſome where the Church grew greater, ſometimes by the ſuddain and extraordinary converſion of more then could well ſo aſſemble, then was there preſently a diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Robinſon <hi>againſt</hi> Bern p. 196.</note> of the former, and a multiplication of more particular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>THe propoſition is granted that the diſpenſation of the Sacraments in the New Teſtament both ordinary and extraordinary is limited to the Miniſtery. But in that you alleadge for confirmation, ſomethings may be noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The firſt inſtitution of Baptiſme is not contained in that paſſage <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. but confirmed; For the ſeales of the New Teſtament were inſtituted by Chriſt before his death, and his diſciples had baptized many which they could not doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inſtitution of the Sacrament. Secondly we ſee not how you can <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 2. &amp; 23 23.</note> apply that text to Preaching by office, which according to our expoſition muſt bee a diſpenſing of a fit portion of food to everie one of the houſhould. For it is plaine the Apoſtles were ſent forth to preach to everie Creature or unto the world, to convert men unto God, to make them diſciples <note place="margin">Mark. 9. 15.</note> and not to preach unto diſciples only, or members of the houſhould. <note place="margin">Act 17 22 23 32. &amp; 19. 8. 9</note> The Apoſtles certainly had authority, and preached by authority,

Thirdly if under the power of the keyes you compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend preaching by office, diſpenſing the ſeales, caſting out, and receiving againe into the boſome of the Church wee deny the power of the keyes to belong to the Church or community of the faithfull: we cannot find in Scripture that Chriſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver granted ſuch power to the faithfull, as faithfull joyned together in Covenant in thoſe paſſages which ſpeake of this power, the execution of this authority is given to them to whom the authoritie is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <note place="margin">In the Corporation (the Church) there is alwayes the whole power of Chriſt to reſiding, which you may call officers for the uſe of it ſelfe, to which it is ſufficient that it can without officers uſe this power for things ſimply neceſſary; as for receiving in of members by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith and confeſſion of ſins, for edifying of them by exhortation and comforts in the ordinance of propheſying, and ſo for excommunication. <hi>Rob.</hi> againſt <hi>B. pag.</hi> 224.</note>

               <p>If the power of the keyes be given to the whole Church the Apoſtles themſelves muſt derive their authoritie immediatly from the Church, and not from Chriſt, for the power muſt be derived from them, unto whom it was given; but their power, and authority was not from the Church, but from Chriſt immediatly. And if the diſpenſation, and exerciſe of the keyes, be concredited to the Miniſters; Doth it hold in all things or onely in the diſpenſation of the Sacraments, and preaching by office? Doe they diſpenſe the ſeales as the Stewards of Chriſt, from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their authority immediately or as the ſervants of the Church, from which they derive their authority? If in the firſt ſenſe; the power of the keys is not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the faithfull. If in the ſecond, the office of a Miniſter is not the immediate gift of Chriſt, nor the Miniſter, ſo much the ſervant of Chriſt, as of the Church, from whom he muſt receive lawes, in whoſe name he muſt doe his office, and to whom he muſt give an account. We could wiſh you had explained in what ſenſe, you hold the diſpenſation, and execution of the power of the keyes is concredited to the Miniſters, and by whom. For if the community of the faithfull have to doe in all matters concerning the body, to <note place="margin">See <hi>Rob.</hi> againſt <hi>Ber. pag.</hi> 130. 131. 132.

               <p>Fourthly That which you add, that God will not vouchſafe his preſence and bleſſing to an ordinance but when it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by thoſe, whom hee hath ordayned and appointed thereunto, muſt bee warily underſtood, or it may occaſion errors and diſtractions

not a few, You know what corruptions ſoone entred into the Church of God, both in reſpect of Doctrine, Worſhip, Offices, and entrance thereunto, and how ready and apt is the concluſion from your words, That <note place="margin">Robinſ <hi>againſt</hi> Bern. <hi>Coun. debated,</hi> p 32. ibid. p. 79.</note> Chriſt hath not vouchſafed his preſence, and bleſſing in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to his Church? But of this before.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary, ſeeing God hath vouchſafed his bleſſing in his Ordinances diſpenſed by your ſelves, when you ſtood as viſible Miniſters in the congregation, and Churches of old <hi>England,</hi> you muſt confeſſe, did approve both your ſtandings and his Ordinances diſpenſed by you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the Aſſumption, that Paſtors and Teachers are limited to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge or ſociety; but that flock is not ever one congregationall aſſembly meeting in one place, neither the band ſo ſtreight, whereby they are tied to that one ſociety, that they may not upon occaſion performe ſome Miniſteriall Act or Office in another congregation, or to them that be not ſet members of their proper aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. For firſt to diſpence the Seals of the covenant is a miniſteriall act, an act of Office, and not an exerciſe of gifts onely: But the Paſtors of one Aſſembly may diſpence the Sacrament to the ſet members of another ſociety upon occaſion, as you confeſſe in this and in your anſwer to the ninth poſition.</p>
               <p>And if the members of one Church may lawfully upon occaſion receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper in another ſociety from the Paſtor thereof, then may the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of one congregation performe a Miniſteriall act to the members of another, and if to the members of another then in another congregation with conſent, and upon occaſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Miniſters are exhorted to feed their fleek: ſo is every Chriſtian and Miniſter to try and examine himſelfe whether hee be in the faith, but you will not allow this concluſion. I muſt examine my ſelf. <hi>Ergo</hi>

               <p>CIrcumciſion and the Paſſoever were to be adminiſtred onely to the members of the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptiſme and the Lords Supper is ſo to be adminiſtred alſo.

And that Circumciſion was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Church members of the Church, may appeare in that perſons circumciſed, &amp; onely they, might eat the Paſſeover, and they onely might enter into the Temple, which were the priviledges of Church members. In our <note place="margin">Exod 1248.

Indeed, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things they differ as onely the Males were circumciſed, whereas with us Females are alſo baptized. The Reaſon is becauſe God hath limited Circumciſion to the Males, but under the Goſpel that difference is taken away. Againe, Circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the private family; but Baptiſme, onely in the publick Aſſemblies of the Church. The Reaſon of this difference is, becauſe they were bound to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Males on the eighth day, but that could not ſtand with going to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was too far off, for the purpoſe, to bring every child thither from all parts of <hi>Judaea</hi> to be Circumciſed the eighth day.

But there is no preciſe day ſet downe ſo Baptiſme, nor are opportunities of publick Aſſemblies ſo remote where Churches are kept in a congregationall frame, but that every firſt day of the week Baptiſme may be adminiſtred if it be required.

owne good pleaſure. And it is our part to learne of him, both to whom, how, and for what end the Sacraments are to be adminiſtred, how they agree, and wherein they differ. In all which we muſt affirme nothing but what God hath taught us, and as he hath taught us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the Propoſition it ſelfe; certaine it is, Circumciſion and the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over were to be adminiſtred onely to the viſible members of the Church, <hi>i e.</hi> to men in Covenant, profeſſing the true faith; But that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time none were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible members of the Church, which joyned not themſelves in Church orders to the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wee have not learned. In the firſt Inſtitution of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we find that God gave it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Seale of the Covenant formerly made with him: But of any Church covenant or order whereunto <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſhould enter before Circumciſion we read not. <hi>Melchizedeck, Lot, Iob, &amp;c.</hi> were not onely viſible Beleevers under the Covenant of grace, but viſible members of the Church, according to the order and diſpenſation of thoſe times. Wee read not (you ſay) that <hi>Melchizedeck, Lot</hi> or <hi>Iob</hi> were circumciſed, but that is no good reaſon to inferre negatively that they were not Circumciſed. We read not that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, or the Apoſtles, or the 500. brethren were Baptized, wee muſt not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">Etiam ſi daremus nullam legi ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolis excommunicationem non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſequeretur ita eſſe, quum ſatis conſtet non omnium ſingularia Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolorum geſta perſcripta fuiſſe.

Moreover, if they were not Circumciſed, it may bee the Inſtitution of that Sacrament was not knowne unto them, or the Authour of Circumciſion (upon whoſe will and pleaſure they muſt depend) did not command it unto them, or require that they ſhould joyne themſelves in Covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> family: and in that caſe if they had Circumciſed themſelves they had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed. But then the reaſon why they were not circumciſed was not this, that they were not (as you ſpeake) in Church order: but becauſe Circumciſion was appropriated to <hi>Abrahams</hi> family by divine Inſtitution in ſome ſpeciall and peculiar reſpects belonging to the manner of Adminiſtration. After the Church of the Jewes was conſtituted (when wee can no more imagine that there was a Church among the Gentiles, then that there are Chriſtians among the Barbarians at this day) we finde none muſt be admitted to the Paſſeover that was not firſt Circumciſed, but nothing was required of a ſtranger
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53955:27"/>
to circumciſion, but that he profeſſe the true faith, and a vouch the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his God, which of neceſſitie muſt be done before he could be reputed a viſible Beleever, or under the Covenant of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus a learned and reverend divine, Circumciſion was a ſeale of the covenant, that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning Chriſt that <note place="margin">1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time none were bound to be Circumciſed but thoſe that were of his family as being borne there or bought, and ſo brought thither which were not of his ſeed: So afterwards none were bound to be Circumciſed which were not borne in the family of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> or joyned to them. And after their comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> none were bound to be Circumciſed but the children of the Iewes (then the only Church of God,) and thoſe that deſired to joyne unto them. The ſumme is thus much, God gave circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a ſeale of the Covenant but whether it was given to other beleevers in his time it is (at leaſt) a thing uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. And if they were not Circumciſed it was by reaſon of the ſpeciall Inſtitution of God, and peculiar manner of adminiſtration of the Covenant of promiſe which in ſome reſpect was proper, to the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not common to all the viſible members of the Church at that time in Church fellowſhip and order. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when there were none in covenant but the ſeed of <hi>Iacob</hi> or ſtrangers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> circumciſion was not to be adminiſtred to any man who was not in Covenant nor any man to bee admitted to the Paſſeover who was not circumciſed. This is the moſt that can be ſaid with any probability: But hence it will not follow by iuſt analogie or proportion, that the ſeed of the faithfull muſt not bee admitted to Baptiſme, or viſible beleivers be received to the Lords Supper unleſſe they bee ſet members of ſome particular congregation united in Church order. Thirdly, preſuppoſing therefore that <hi>Melchizedeck, Lot</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> were not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, we ſay there is not the like reaſon of Circumciſion and Baptiſme in this particular. For, firſt if Circumciſion was ever appropriated to the family of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and might be communicated to other viſible Beleevers, it was in the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and adminiſtration; but in the firſt Inſtitution and adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it was not obſerved that beleevers ſhould be firſt gathered into a politicall body or Chriſtian church memberſhip, and then baptized. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt baptized ſuch as came to him confeſſing their ſins. The Apoſtles <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7.</note> baptized Diſciples, ſuch as gladly received their doctrine, beleeved <note place="margin">10 42. Act. 2 37, 38. 41. &amp; 8 37. &amp; 10. 47. 48.</note> in Jeſus Chriſt, and received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, before they were gathered into Chriſtian Church order, or made fit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Chriſtian congregationall Aſſembly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If Circumciſion was by ſpeciall Inſtitution given as a priviledge to the Males of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Familie, <hi>Melchizedecke, Iob, Lot,</hi> and other viſible Beleevers were not bound to joyne themſelves as members
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53955:27"/>
to <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, or deſire and ſeek to be circumciſed: But they that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the doctrine of ſalvation, beleeve Chriſt, and profeſſe the faith, are bound to ſeek, and deſire the priviledge of the ſeals in an holy manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Melchizedech, Job,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were not onely viſible beleevers, but viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, according to the manner of diſpenſing in thoſe times: but the Seals (as you confeſſe) belong to all beleevers knit together in Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If circumciſion be appropriated to the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is becauſe the Covenant ſealed by circumciſion is peculiar to <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie, <hi>(ſc.)</hi> that Chriſt ſhould come as concerning the fleſh, of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But Baptiſme is the ſeal of the Covenant of grace without any peculiar or ſpeciall tye or reſpect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You contend, that Baptiſme did belong to ſuch beleevers as were members of the then Jewiſh Church, which cannot ſtand, if <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie did anſwer to a Chriſtian ſocietie or congregationall Aſſembly; Juſt reaſon therefore may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why circumciſion was diſpenſed onely to the males of <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, when baptiſme is not to be limited onely to the ſet members of a particular ſocietie; and if this conſideration be applied to the purpoſe, inſtead of ſaying, Circumciſion and the Paſſeover were to be adminiſtred onely to the members of the Church, you muſt ſay Circumciſion was to be deſired of or adminiſtred unto all the true appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved viſible members of the Church. And if there be the ſame reaſon of both, then all viſible approved members of the Church muſt not deſire nor be admitted to the ſeals, but this concluſion you will not acknowledge.</p>

               <p>FIrſt, men are capable of Church cenſures in two reſpects, either in having the power of the keyes, and authoritie to diſpenſe them according to God, or as ſubject to the cenſures of the Church. In the firſt ſenſe, many are capable of Church priviledges that are not capable of Church cenſures, as the ſeed of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents, children and women. You ſay you admit to the ſeales the knowne
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53955:28"/>
and approved, and orderly recommended members of any true Church: but to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the cenſures, admittance of members, and choice of Officers onely, the members of that particular Church whereof they and we (any of us) ſtand mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. In the ſecond ſenſe alſo many are capable of Church priviledges who are not ſubject to Church cenſures: as the children of Chriſtian parents are capable of baptiſme, the known and approved members of any true Church are capable of the Seales in other Congregations among you who are not ſubject to the cenſures of that other Society. Spirituall communion in publick prayer is a Church priviledge, which is not denied to viſible beleevers and godly perſons, though not in Church order, and ſo not in ſubjection in your ſenſe to Church cenſures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a perſon baptiſed is not baptiſed in that particular congregation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but into all Churches, and every particular Church where he cometh he hath all the priviledges of a baptiſed perſon in reſpect of his baptiſme, and is ſo to be eſteemed by them. Now the priviledge of a baptiſed perſon who is able to examine himſelf, and walketh in the truth, is to be admitted to the Lords Supper. All cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſons had right thereby to eat the Paſſeover in any ſocietie, in the place which God ſhould chuſe to put his Name there. <hi>Exod. 12. 4. 47. Deut.</hi> 16. 1, 2. So all baptiſed perſons have true and intire right to the Lords Supper in everie true Church where God hath ſet his Name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is not the ſame reaſon of every Church priviledge, for one may have right to ſome, who is not to meddle with others. The members of one ſociety may hear the Word, joyne in Prayer, and receive the Sacraments in another, when they are not to meddle in the election and ordination of their teachers. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel may preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther congregation, and hereto he needs no other calling but that God offers an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie; there is much need of his help, and he is intreated, or hath leave from them in place or office; but he is not to admit members into the ſocietie, or caſt them out that be admitted. And if the Paſtor of one Church ſhall preach or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments in another, contrary to the liking and approbation of the Society and Governours, though the act be irregular, it was never eſteemed a nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but if he ſhall preſume to excommunicate the members of another ſocietie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Church, and approbation of Paſtors and Teachers, under whoſe charge and juriſdiction they live, it hath been judged a meer nullity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the propoſition is not ſo evident as to be taken without proofe, that they have no power to admit a beleever into communion in any Church priviledge who have no power to excommunicate.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that viſible beleevers baptiſed into a true Church profeſſing the true faith, and walking in holy obedience, and godly converſation, that they and their ſeed ſhould be judged ſuch as are without in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <note place="margin">1.

1. It hath, and may fall out many times through the ignorance, raſhneſſe, or pride of a prevailing faction in the Church, that the true members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, and the beſt members of the orthodox viſible flock, or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Chriſt may be no members of any diſtinct viſible ſocietie. And ſhall their poſteritie be eſteemed Aliens and Strangers from the Covenant, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Sacraments, becauſe their parents are unjuſtly ſeperated from the inheritance of the Lord? Surely as parents unjuſtly excommunicated do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill not onely true members of the inviſible body; but viſible members of the flock of Chriſt: ſo the right of Baptiſme doth belong to the Infants of ſuch parents, though not actuall and conſtant members of this or that preſent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in Church order.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they be without, becauſe no members of a politike bodie or ſpirituall fellowſhip: then all members which are of one ſocietie are without to another: For they that be not of the bodie are not capable of Church cenſures, or ſubject to the authoritie one of another. And ſo not being under the judgement of that particular Church to it they are without; whereas in ancient and moderne times diſtinct Societies did communicate together, admit and receive each other as brethren, to teſtifie their fellowſhip in the faith. If the reaſon whereupon the Apoſtle ſaith the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not to judge them that were without, was becauſe they were not within the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo not under their cenſure or judgement: this holds true of them that be of another ſociety admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sacrament, as well as of ſuch as be no ſet members deſiring to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Lords Supper.</p>

               <p>You aske if without reſpect to their Church eſtate men of approved pietie (as we ſay) are to be admitted into fellowſhip in the ſeals, how ſhall their pietie be approved to the Church, not by their own report of themſelves alone, &amp;c.

You profeſſe high reſpect of your brethren in old <hi>England,</hi> but it ſeemes you judge them inſufficient to give orderly teſtimonie of the ſinceritie and uprightneſſe of approved Chriſtians, well known unto them, and living among them, which two cannot well agree.

which they cannot conſent unto, if they ſhall ſit downe quietly for the time and ſerve God in private, when they cannot injoy Church priviledges, it is your fault and not theirs. And they may more juſtly challenge the Aſſemblie as injurious and tyrannicall, then you them as wilfull deſpiſers of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We accuſe not the wiſedome and diſcretion of your Chuches, but we know the zealous multitude may ſometimes be raſh; And when a reaſon is cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of your judgement, why you do debarre the moſt knowne and approved Chriſtians which come over, and their children from the ſeals of the covenant, we diſlike you ſhould put this note upon them, as if againſt light they refuſed orderly to ſubject themſelves to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: What warrant you have thus to cenſure, what uſe of this manner of diſpute we leave it to your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome to judge. In the Conſideration it ſelf there are many Propoſitions couched together, which we muſt examine ſeverally as they have reference to the concluſion intended, and then try whether it can be raiſed from them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition, That none have power to diſpence the Seales, but they that are called to the office of Miniſtery, is freely granted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, That no man can be ſo called till firſt there be a Church to call him, needeth explication. For by the Church you muſt underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the faithfull, as they are one bodie, without officers or guides. And ſuch a Church there cannot be without a Miniſtery to call and admit them into Church-fellowſhip. The Apoſtles baptiſed not themſelves, but by the help of others, &amp; thoſe not called of the people to be baptiſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. The Apoſtles appointed by electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Elders in every city or Church. And ſo there was a Church before Elders were ſet over it, but this Church was a ſocietie of beleevers by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme admitted into Church-fellowſhip. There can be no Church to call a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to feed the flock, and diſpence the ſeals, till they have received the doctrine of ſalvation intirely, and by the ſeale of initiation be ſolemnly received into the ſocietie of men profeſſing Chriſt. A company of men converted to the faith being unbaptized, may and ought to deſire baptiſme, but they have not power to elect and chuſe one among themſelves to diſpence the ſeales unto the reſt for ought is to be found in Scripture: The Churches conſtitution into which Chriſtians are to gather themſelves muſt be Apoſtolicall, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rob.</hi> againſt <hi>Bern.</hi> likely veiwed. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> not one day or houre younger in nature and forme of it, thus the firſt Church of the New Teſtament. But it can never be ſhewed in Scripture that any ſocietie of unbaptiſed perſons did firſt chuſe from among them a Paſtor or Teacher by whom they might be baptiſed: you cannot produce one example or other proofe in the Scripture, of one man teaching the Goſpel miniſterially but he was baptiſed, and a member of a true Church, or of a ſocietie who made choice of a Paſtor and teacher, but they were baptiſed perſons.</p>
               <p>The third Propoſition, That the power of calling Miniſters is given by Chriſt unto the Church, muſt alſo be rightly underſtood: For by the Church muſt be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53955:32"/>
meant the ſocietie of the faithfull, not onely ingrafted into Chriſt, ſet into the ſtate of ſalvation, and made heires apparent of everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly entred and inrolled into the ſocietie of Chriſts flock, and acknowledged members by free admiſſion into the Seales of the Covenant. Againe, by the Church if we ſpeake of ordinary calling, muſt not be underſtood of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alone, but their guides and officers together with them, who are to goe before the reſt, and to direct and governe them in their choice. Neither can we ſay, that any two or three beleevers linked together in ſocietie doe make ſuch a Church, as to whom the calling of the Miniſter doth belong: but that right was given by Chriſt to ſuch Churches as were gathered and eſtabliſhed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. The Church hath a Miniſtery of calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed, that from Chriſt he may have power of Office given him in the vacant place. But the office, gift, and power of the Miniſtery, is immediately from Chriſt and not from the Church. The Church doth neither virtually nor formally give power to her Officers but miniſterially onely, as miniſtring to him who hath power and vertue to conferre it. And this right of election is ſo given to the communitie and body of the people, that if they have conſented to give away their right, or if it be taken injuriouſly from them, the calling of the Miniſter notwithſtanding may be true, and miniſteriall acts done by him that is thruſt upon the people without their conſent may be effectuall to their ſalvation. A wrong it is altogether to debarre the godly of their conſent in the calling of ſuch as muſt watch for their ſoules; but it makes not the calling it ſelfe a meere nullitie; for then many Churches in the world within a few hundred yeares after Chriſt ſhould have wanted both miniſtery and Sacraments, and they would have been altogether deſtitute of both miniſtery and Sacraments for many hundred yeares.</p>
               <p>The fourth, That all thoſe who deſire to partake in the Seales, are bound to joyne themſelves together in Church-ſtate, that ſo they may call a Miniſter to diſpence the Seales unto them, will not follow from the former rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. We deny not but Chriſtians are bound to joyne themſelves together in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fellowſhip, if God give them opportunitie: but they muſt partake in the Seales before they can joyne themſelves together in Church-ſtate. And ſuch as for lack of meanes and opportunitie cannot joyne themſelves into ſuch an eſtate, or be diſperſed by perſecution, or be deſtitute of Paſtors and Teachers, may for a time deſire and ſeek to have the ſeales diſpenced unto them by the Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other Societies, with whom they hold communion in the faith. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo who are deprived of right and libertie to chooſe their Paſtor, may deſire and ſeek to have the Seales diſpenced unto them by him who is ſet over them. If a company of Infidells ſhould be converted to the faith, they muſt deſire to partake in the ordinances of grace before they could joyne together in a Church-way to call a Miniſter of their own, who might adminiſter the Sacraments unto
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53955:32"/>
them. To make Diſciples and baptize are joyned together. And if theſe Propoſitions be allowed for current, a nation or people <note place="margin">John 4. 2. Math. 28. 19.</note> plunged into Idolatry or Infidelitie, or otherwiſe diſchurched, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by ordinary meanes recover into a Church-eſtate, wherein they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and according to Gods appointment deſire or expect that the Seales of the Covenant ſhould be diſpenced to them.</p>
               <p>The fifth Propoſition riſeth beyond meaſure, that no Chriſtian can expect by the appointment of God to partake in the Seales till he have joyned himſelfe in Church-fellowſhip and the calling of the Miniſter. Wee conceive you will not ſay that children and women have to doe in the call of the Miniſter (for women they are debarred by their ſex as from ordinary Propheſying, ſo <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Rob. ag. Ber. pa. 206.</note> from any other dealing wherein they take authority over the man) If ſome part of the Congregation doe not conſent in the election of Paſtors or Teachers, have they not right to expect to have the Seales of the Covenant diſpenced to themſelves or their ſeede? If the people be deprived of that libertie to chooſe or call their Miniſter, muſt they ſeperate from the ordinances of worſhip there diſpenced, and from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as no true Churches? If ſome perſons by the providence of God live in ſuch places where they cannot joyne in Church-fellowſhip and call of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (as ſuppoſe the Chriſtian wife, childe, or ſervant) nor lawfully remove to any ſuch Societie muſt they and their children live as ſtrangers and aliens from the Covenant of grace, wherein they may not expect to partake of the Seales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Infidels be converted to the faith, muſt they not partake in the Seales, becauſe they cannot joyne in Church-fellowſhip and call of the Miniſter, before they be admitted to Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>Here you ſay the people muſt joyne together in the call of the Miniſter, before they can lawfully deſire to be admitted to the Seales. And another <note place="margin">Rob. ag. Bern. pa. 239.</note> hath zealouſly affirmed (It is a preſumptuous ſin in any to chooſe an Officer not trained up and tryed <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> in the debating, diſcuſſing, carrying, and contriving of Church-affaires, as alſo in admonition, exhortation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, publickly occaſioned and ſo manifeſted) Lay theſe two together, and let it be conſidered how long many a poore ſoule converted to the faith muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to want the comfort of Gods ordinances. Beſides, if a people be joyned together in Church-fellowſhip, and have called a Paſtor to feed and watch over them, wee deſire (not words but) proofe why the poore diſperſed Chriſtians wanting means or opportunitie to joyn themſelves together into ſocietie, ought not to deſire, and that others be not bound in conſcience to afford them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Gods ordinances.</p>
               <p>If the Propoſitions may ſtand for good, I feare we ſhall ſcarce finde that ever in ordinary way, the Sacraments were lawfully diſpenced or received in the Chriſtian Churches of God ſince the firſt foundation of them. Now the premiſes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53955:33"/>
being liable to ſo many exceptions, the concluſion to be laid upon them, will fall of it ſelfe. And thereunto wee oppoſe the direct contrary.

               <p>THe practiſe of the Church of ſtrangers in <hi>London,</hi> recorded by <hi>John Alaſco,</hi> is farre different from your judgement and practiſe, not in ſome by-circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but in the maine point in queſtion; for your judgement is that true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beleevers, baptized and partakers of the Lords Supper in other Churches not yet gathered into Church-eſtate or fellowſhip, have no right or intereſt in the Seales, (they nor their ſeede) But this Church of ſtrangers held no ſuch opinion as their own words (which you have omitted) doe plainly ſpeake. And <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifyeth (ſay they) that by Chriſts Ordinance the Church it ſelfe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any member of it, is to be accounted cleane or holy by the miniſtery of Baptiſme. Whence we may eaſily ſee, that Baptiſme doth neither belong to thoſe who are altogether without the Church, nor to be denyed to any member of the Church. Secondly, They held communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> as one and the ſame with theirs. For ſo they profeſſe: Yet nevertheleſſe, that we may openly ſhew that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches and ours are one and the ſame Church (though we differ ſomewhat from them both in language and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) We doe not refuſe that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may as publick witneſſes of the Church offer the Infants of our members to Baptiſme in our Churches, if they have both the uſe of our language and a certain teſtimony of their piety. As in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our members are accuſtomed to offer the Infants of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Baptiſme in the <hi>Engliſh Churches.</hi> If your judgement be this of the <hi>Engliſh Churches,</hi> your judgement in acknowledging us members of true Churches, and practiſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring viſible beleevers and their ſeede from the Seales, are oppoſite the one to the other. Thirdly, This order was obſerved by them to prevent the impoſtures of ſome, who whilſt they avoyded all Churches, pretended to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were joyned to the ſtrangers, and to the ſtrangers that they were joyned to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But you debarre knowne Chriſtians who deſire to joyne themſelves with you, not to prevent impoſtures of them who avoyde all Churches: yea, you debarre them as men having no right to the Sacraments, becauſe they be not in Church-fellowſhip: and herein you can ſhew no preſident ancient or moderne, either from Scripture or Monuments of the Church: And as your practiſe is without example, ſo without warrant from the word of God.

               <p>THat ſacred order which God hath ſet in his viſible Church for all his Saints to keep and walk by, that is religiouſly to be obſerved. But for men to ſet up that as a neceſſarie order which God never allowed, approved, or commanded, is great preſumption. Now the Lord hath not ordained that a man ſhould be a ſet member of a particular Societie, or body politique of faithfull people joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in ſpirituall Church-fellowſhip by Covenant, before he be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Lords Supper, or that the parents ſhould be actuall viſible ſet mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſome particular diſtinct body before their children be baptiſed. They that beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt have received the word of promiſe and walk therein, they and their children are within the Covenant, and have right and title to the Seales of the Covenant, but in their order, the infants to baptiſme, parents bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, to the Lords Supper. And if in that ſtate by divine grant they have intereſt to the Sacraments, the Church in debarring them becauſe they be not yet grown into one diſtinct ſeparate ſocietie of mutuall covenant, doth exceed the bounds of her commiſſion. For a miniſteriall power onely is committed to the Church to admit or refuſe them who are to be admitted or refuſed by authoritie from God: But the Church if ſhe thruſt beleeving parents from the Supper of the Lord, and their ſeed from baptiſme; ſhe denieth theſe benefits to them who by the grace and gift of God have lawfull right and title thereto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was true baptiſme, and truly adminiſtred by him: And they that were baptized by him received the ſeales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and were eſteemed members of the viſible Church: But <hi>John</hi> never deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them who came to his baptiſme whether they were entred into ſpirituall fellowſhip by mutuall covenant one with another. <note place="margin">Matth 3 6, 7.</note> This was not then knowne to be a neceſſarie and eſſentiall point in the lawfull, due, and orderly adminiſtration of the Sacrament. The diſciples of our Saviour made and baptiſed diſciples profeſſing the faith, but not combined into Church-ſtate or fellowſhip. The Apoſtles commiſſion was firſt <note place="margin">Iob. 4 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. 22. Matt. 28 19. 20.</note> to teach the Gentiles, and then to baptiſe them having received their doctrine. And this they carefully obſerved in the execution of their miniſtery upon grounds and reaſons common to them and us: for as ſoone as any man or number of men gladly received the doctrine of ſalvation, and gave their names to Jeſus Chriſt, if they deſired to be baptiſed forthwith they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, never excepting, that they were no ſet members of a diſtinct viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.

As we received the Sacraments from God by divine Inſtitution; ſo muſt we learne from him, how and to whom the ſame are to be adminiſtred, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what he hath commanded without addition or diminution. But we have learned from Chriſt the Author of Baptiſme, and the conſtant practiſe of the Apoſtles (the firſt diſpenſers of theſe holy ſeales who beſt underſtood the mind and pleaſure of the Lord herein) that ſuch as be called of God to whom the promiſe is made, who have received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, beleeved in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53955:35"/>
Lord Jeſus, profeſſed their faith in him, and repentance for ſins paſt with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendment for the time to come, that ſuch have right unto, and deſiring it ought to be received unto Baptifme, and are greatly wronged if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that unſpeakable benefit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By a lively faith a man is made a living member of Jeſus Chriſt, and hath internall communion with him by the intire profeſſion of Chriſtian faith joyned with conformity of life in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, and fellowſhip of love, he is a member of the viſible congregation or flock of Chriſt, though no ſet mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a free diſtinct independant Societie. And Baptiſme is the ſeale of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the congregation or flock of Chriſt; but not evermore of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into this or that particular ſocietie as ſet members thereof. This latter is accidentall to baptiſme, not eſſentiall. It may fall out to be ſo, but it is not ever neceſſarie; nor is the Sacrament to be denyed, nor can we ſay it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly adminiſtred where it cannot be attained. For the Catholique Church is one intire bodie, made up by the collection and agregation of all the faithfull unto the unity thereof; from which union there ariſeth unto every one of them ſuch a relation to, dependance upon that Church Catholique as parts uſe to have in reſpect of the whole. And this holds true, not onely of ſound belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in reſpect of internall fellowſhip with Chriſt their head, and ſo one with another; but of all men profeſſing the true and intire doctrine of faith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in reſpect of them that hold and profeſſe the ſame faith of Chriſt, and worſhip God according to his will; whereupon it followeth that neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, nor particular guides, nor particular Churches are to worke as ſeverall divided bodies by themſelves, but are to teach, and be taught; and to do all other duties as parts conjoyned to the whole, and members of the ſame flock or ſocietie in generall: And ſo beleevers profeſſing the faith, and walking in holineſſe, may and ought to be admitted to the Seales as actuall members of the Church of Chriſt, and ſheep of his paſture, though not ſet members of one congregationall Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not to inſiſt upon this here, that it hath and may fall out many times through ignorance, rathneſſe, or pride, of a prevailing faction in the Church, that the true members of the Catholique Church, and the beſt members of the Orthodox viſible flock, or Church of Chriſt, may be no actuall members of any diſtinct Societie, and ſhall they for this be accounted men out of Covenant, and their poſteritie be eſteemed aliens and ſtrangers: but if they be in Covenant, then are they holy in reſpect of the Covenant, and their children holy as pertaining to the Covenant, and have right to the Sacrament of initiation. Thus Mr. <hi>Rob.</hi> frameth the argument. The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme <note place="margin">

               <p>VVHere the holy Ghoſt is given and received (which was the caſe of the Centurion) and where faith is profeſſed according to Gods ordinance (which was the caſe of the reſt) there none may hinder them from being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſuch as have power to baptiſe them. In the Inſtances given baptiſme was adminiſtred either by Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, not ordinary Paſtors: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baptiſed, if they were members of Churches, had a right to baptiſme in their ſtate, and the Apoſtles being Officers of all Churches might diſpenſe the ſeales to them where ever they came, which yet will not warrant ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to do the ſame.

                  </hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with <hi>Paul</hi> as concerning giving and receiving: As he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaith, before his departure was from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Act. 4. 15.</note> was immediately upon the Gaylors converſion. In which reſpect what ſhould hinder that <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Gaylor ſhould firſt be joyned to the Church, and then to be baptiſed though it be not mentioned in that ſtory? As neither there is mention of a Chriſtian Church, which <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> At leaſt it is probable that <hi>Lydia</hi> was a member of the Jewiſh Church, becauſe ſhe is ſaid to be one that worſhipped God. But if any man think they were not members of any Church yet baptiſed, though we ſee not how it will be proved, yet if it were ſo, the object doth no whit weaken the argument, which ſpeaketh of the ordinary diſpenſation of the ſeales, and not of what was done in an extraordinary way. So that ſuppoſe that in the caſes alledged, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme diſpenſed to ſome that were not in Church-fellowſhip, yet the examples of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts in ſo doing will not warrant ordinary Paſtors to do the like. The reaſon of the difference why Apoſtles and Evangeliſts might adminiſter Baptiſme out of Church-order, whereas Paſtors and Teachers may not, is double. 1. Becauſe their calling gave them illimited power over all men, eſpecially Chriſtians whereſoever they came. But we do not find that ordinarie Paſtors and Teachers can do an act of power, but onely over their own Church, which hath called them to watch over them in the Lord. 2. Becauſe they were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53955:36"/>
aſſiſted with an immediate direction and guidance of the holy Ghoſt, in the places of their adminiſtration in the caſes alledged. But ordinary Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to walke according to ordinary rules of the Scripture in the diſpenſation of the Seales, and not to expect immediate inſpirations and extraordinary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for their helpe in ſuch caſes. This difference between Apoſtles and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Church Officers muſt needs be acknowledged, or otherwiſe a man might from their example juſtifie Baptiſme in private houſes.</p>

               <p>THis Anſwer ſtands of many parts, wherein things doubtfull are affirmed, and that which more weakeneth the force of the conſideration before alledged, and the Anſwer it ſelfe, then of the reaſon whereunto it is applyed. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, If where the holy Ghoſt is given and received, and where faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed according to Gods ordinance, there none may hinder them from being baptized, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſuch as have power to baptize them: Then either men that have received the holy Ghoſt, and profeſſe the faith, be members of the Church, or Baptiſme is not a priviledge of the Church, then it is not eſſentiall to the firſt Inſtitution of Baptiſme, that it ſhould be diſpenced to none but ſuch as were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into Church-fellowſhip, or were ſet members of a congregationall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Then the Apoſtles in diſpenſing the Seales unto ſuch, or commanding them to be diſpenced, did walk according to the rules of Scripture, and upon grounds common to them and us, <hi>viz.</hi> they admitted them unto the Sacraments who had right and intereſt to them, according to the minde and pleaſure of the Inſtitutor, not extraordinarily revealed, beſides the common rules, or by ſpeciall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prerogative excepted from the common rule, but made knowne in the Inſtitution it ſelfe. And then the difficultie remaining is onely this, whether a Paſtor or Teacher hath authority from Chriſt to diſpence the Seales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to one who hath right and title to them, and doth orderly deſire that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit becauſe he is not as yet received as a ſet member of that particular ſocietie which your practiſe in admitting of ſet members of other Congregations unto the Seales doth manifeſtly convince. For if both have equall intereſt unto the Seales, the Paſtor upon lawfull ſuite and requeſt hath equall authoritie to receive the one as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the particular Inſtances given, it is not probable that Baptiſme was evermore adminiſtred by Apoſtles or Evangeliſts; For before the death of Chriſt, the Diſciples baptized when they were properly neither Apoſtles nor Evangeliſts: After the death of Chriſt (not to inſiſt <note place="margin">Joh 4. 2, 3. &amp; 3. 27.</note> upon conjectures whether any aſſiſted the Apoſtles in the baptizing of the firſt three thouſand converted) it is not certaine, whether <hi>Peter</hi> baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family, or commanded others then preſent with <note place="margin">Act. 10. 48.</note>

It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved that <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> were both Evangeliſts, when the one baptized the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the other <hi>Paul. Paul</hi> himſelfe baptized but a few as he teſtifieth of himſelfe, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to convince that others converted by his preaching were baptized by Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, we know not any. And if <hi>Philip, Ananias,</hi> and others might baptize ſuch as had right and title to the Seales, being as yet no ſet members of any particular Congregation: and a Congregation deſtitute of their proper Paſtor, may deſire another to baptize their Infants, and diſpence the Sacrament of the Supper to them in that their neceſſitie. And if the members of one Congregation may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully communicate in another, then may the Paſtors of particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon occaſion admit to the Seales of the Covenant ſuch known and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſtians, as have right and title thereunto, and duely and orderly require the ſame; for of all theſe the reaſon is like and perpetuall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is very improbable that the perſons baptized, were in Church-ſtate or order. If they were members of the Jewiſh Church not yet diſſolved, this is not to the purpoſe; for men have not right to Baptiſme, becauſe they were members of the Jewiſh Church, but becauſe Diſciples and (as you ſay) joyned together in Covenant, and have fellowſhip and calling of their Miniſter, who is to diſpence the Seales unto them. And Baptiſme is the Sacrament of initiation, not into the Jewiſh but the Chriſtian Churches. Secondly, when you ſay, <hi>the Seales in ordinary diſpenſation are the priviledges of the Churches. There are no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters but of particular Churches. Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred onely to the members of the Church. No ſocietie may lawfully deſire the Seales, unleſſe they have joyned in the choice and calling of their Minister. Beleevers not yet joyned in Church-order are without.</hi> Doe yee not in all theſe underſtand a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſocietie, united in a Church-way, &amp;c. which cannot agree to the members of the Jewiſh Church, not yet diſſolved. Thirdly, <note place="margin">Againſt <hi>B. pa.</hi> 88.</note> The conſtitution of the Church (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robin.)</hi> is the orderly collection and conjunction of the Saints into and in the Covenant of the New Teſtament; but the members of Jewiſh Churches not yet diſſolved, were not in ſuch conſtitution. If the Eunuch and Centurion were proſelytes and members of the Church of the Jewes; The Samaritanes whom <hi>Philip</hi> baptized were not ſo. And that any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, or the Gailor whom <hi>Paul</hi> baptized in the Apoſtles times, were ſet members of a Chriſtian Aſſembly before baptized, is very ſtrange If there was a Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> yet the Gailor who was baptized and converted the ſame night, could not be a ſet member by ſolemne admiſſion before Baptiſme. It is ſaid the Apoſtles baptized theſe perſons in an extraordinary way. But in this practiſe of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53955:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apoſtles two things are to be conſidered. 1. The circumſtance of the action. 2. The qualitie or ſubſtance of the act. In ſome circumſtances the baptizing of ſome of theſe perſons might be extraordinary, but the ſubſtance and qualitie of the action was grounded upon rules perpetuall and common to us with them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That is done in an extraordinary way, which by peculiar priviledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is made lawfull to ſome one or few men, which is unlawfull to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not having the ſame diſpenſation, but where the ground and reaſon of the action is common: we muſt not conceive the thing to be done in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way by ſpeciall diſpenſation. What was done by the Apoſtles upon ſpeciall revelation and immediate direction, beſides the ordinary and common rule, in that wee are not to immitate or follow them, becauſe we have not their warrant. But what they did upon reaſons and grounds reaching unto us no leſſe then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, in that we have the ſame libertie, allowance, or commandement that they did walk by. In one and the ſame action there may be and oft is ſomething ordinary, ſomething extraordinary or peculiar to ſpeciall times or perſons. So it was in the Apoſtles adminiſtration of the Seales: but in every place where they came by illimited power (as you ſpeake) they did baptize Diſciples, if they did baptize; this was proper to them, and could not be communicated to any others by them; For there is no paſſage of Scripture which teacheth this, that one Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer may communicate his power to another, or doe that which particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to his office by a Deputie: But that they baptized beleevers profeſſing their faith in the Lord Jeſus, and repentance towards God, ſuch as had gladly imbraced the Word, and received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt: this was common to them with all Paſtors and Teachers, becauſe they did it, not by power illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſpeciall diſpenſation, but upon this ſtanding perpetuall reaſon, that <hi>the promiſe was made to them and to their ſeede, and to as many as the Lord ſhall call, that they had received the holy Ghost, and the kingdome of heaven belonged to them.</hi> And if the grounds and reaſons of their practiſe be common reaching to us, no leſſe then unto them, the practiſe it ſelfe was not extraordinary. To ſay nothing that this Anſwer will not ſtand with the former; for if the parties baptized were ſet members of particular Societies, the Apoſtles did not baptize them in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, they did it by the guidance and direction of the Spirit, that is true, but not by guidance of diſpenſation, or prerogative, whereby that was made lawfull without ſuch inſpiration had been unlawfull. But they were infallibly guided to doe that which was according to the word of God, and might ſtand for our direction: that in caſe it be orderly deſired a Paſtor hath authoritie in his owne Congregation, to receive knowne and approved Chriſtians to the ſeales of the Covenant, hath been proved before. If the Apoſtles diſpenced the ſeales onely to the Church, Diſciples, faithfull, who received the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with gladneſſe of heart, and were partakers of the holy Ghoſt, then they diſpenced the ſeales in an ordinary way, for ſuch have title and intereſt to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53955:37"/>
ſeales by the Inſtitution and appointment of God. And every Paſtor by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may and ought to diſpence the ſeales unto ſuch, within the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of his calling: But the Apoſtles diſpenced the ſeales onely to the Church, Diſciples, faithfull, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Argument followeth neceſſarily from particular example to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; when one particular is proved by another particular, by force of the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude common to the whole kinde, under which thoſe particulars are contained: But the practiſe of the Apoſtles in baptizing Diſciples and faithfull, by force of ſimilitude common to the whole kinde, agreeth with the practiſe of Miniſters receiving to Baptiſme the ſeed of the faithfull, though as yet not ſet members of any particular ſocietie, In ſome circumſtances there may be difference when yet the reaſon is ſtrong, if the difference be not in the very likeneſſe it ſelfe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the reaſon is grounded. One circumſtance that is materiall to the point may overthrow the likeneſſe pretended, and twenty different circumſtances, if they be not to the point in hand make no diſſimilitude. Now in this matter wee ſpeake of, no circumſtance is or can be named why we ſhould thinke it lawfull for the Apoſtles to baptize Diſciples as yet being no ſet members of particular ſocieties, and the ſame ſhould be unlawfull in all caſes for ordinary Paſtors in their particular Congregations, though it be deſired.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is done by extraordinary diſpenſation, that is lawfull for them onely who have received ſuch diſpenſation, and by them cannot be communicated to others. But the Apoſtles baptized by others ſeldome by themſelves, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We might urge the rule which a reverend Elder among you, giveth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> Thoſe examples which are backed with ſome <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> J. D. Ap. Sect. 12. pa. 152, 153, 154.</note> divine precept, or which are held forth in the firſt Inſtitution of an ordinance, being part of the inſtitution, or which were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant lawfull actions of holy men in Scripture, not civill but ſacred ſo binde us to imitation, as that not to conforme thereunto is ſinne. For the Aſſumption to this Propoſition, it is plaine and naturall: But the practiſe of the Apoſtles in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the faithfull, Diſciples, &amp;c. is backed with divine precept, held forth in the firſt Inſtitution, and was their conſtant lawfull practiſe, agreeable to the practiſe of all others who were imployed in that ſervice; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the firſt conſideration, you prove the Seales to be the priviledge of the Church in ordinary diſpenſation, by this paſſage of Scripture, <hi>Then they that gladly received the Word were baptized:</hi> but if Apoſtles baptize by extraordinary diſpenſation in your ſenſe this teſtimony is inſufficient for that purpoſe.</p>

               <p>OUr ſecond reaſon. In due order, the Seales belong to them to whom the grant is given, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme to the ſeed of the faithfull, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to beleevers, able to try and examine themſelves: But the grant is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed

to the faithfull and their ſeed, forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, ſanctification, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what other good things are promiſed in the covenant of grace are the grant or good things ſealed in the Sacrament. But thoſe are granted to beleevers according to the covenant; and they are ſo linked together, that under one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all are underſtood; and if one be vouchſafed, none is denied. When God promiſeth to circumciſe the heart, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is implyed. And when Circumciſion is ſaid to be the Seale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, the circumciſion of the heart by ſpirituall regeneration is <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 6. Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8, 9. Rom. 4. 11. Gen. 17. 11, 12 and 26. 4.</note> included. To whomſoever then the ſpirituall gift, or inward grace of the covenant is given and granted, to them the Seales of that gift and grant doth belong in their due order. But the ſpirituall gift or grace which is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, is freely granted to true beleevers, who have received the doctrine of ſalvation, and walk in the wayes of truth and righteouſneſſe, therefore the priviledges of the Seales belong unto them. To this you anſwer.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle in the place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. is not to define a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor to ſhew what is the proper and adequate ſubject of the Sacrament; but to prove by the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> that a ſinner is juſtified before God, not by works but by faith. Thus as <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull was juſtified before God, ſo muſt his ſeed be (that is, all beleevers whether Jews or Gentiles, circumciſed or uncircumciſed) for therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> received circumciſion which belonged to the Jews to confirm the righteouſneſſe which he had before, while he was uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of both: but leſt any one ſhould think his circumciſion was needleſſe if he was juſtified by faith before circumciſion; he addeth that his circumciſion was of no uſe as a ſeale to confirme to him his faith, and the righteouſneſſe which is by faith: yet as Juſtification is not the onely thing that Circumciſion ſealed, but the whole Covenant alſo made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed was ſealed thereby; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered in uſing circumciſion not ſimply, or onely as a beleever without Church relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as a confederate beleever, and ſo in the ſtate and order of a viſible Church. Though the Apoſtle maketh mention of the righteouſneſſe of faith as ſealed thereby, which was not that which ſerved for his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now that Circumciſion alſo ſealed the Church-Covenant, may appear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9. 10, 11. where you may find that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, were not circumciſed till God called them into Church-Covenant; and there is the ſame reaſon &amp; uſe of Baptiſme to us which ſerveth to ſeal our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as circumciſion did, yet not that alone, but alſo the whole covenant with all the priviledges of it, as Adoption, Sanctification, <note place="margin">Act. 2. 38. Gal. 3. 26. 27. Tit. 3. 5. Mat. 20. 23. 1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> and fellowſhip with Chriſt in affections, and the ſalvation of our ſouls, and the reſurrection of our bodies. And not onely the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace which is common to all beleevers: but Church-Covenant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53955:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1 Cor. 15. 19. Covenant alſo which is peculiar to confederates. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>By one Spirit we are baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And by one bodie he meaneth that particular Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> whereunto he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ſaith, <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular,</hi> ver. 27. And <hi>ergo</hi> Church-memberſhip is required as well to the orderly partaking of Baptiſme as it was of Circumciſion. Nor do we find that circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to all that were in the Covenant of grace (as all beleevers were) but onely to ſuch of them as were joyned to the people of the God of <hi>Abraham. Melchizedech</hi> was under the covenant of grace, ſo was <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo was <hi>Job</hi> and his foure friends; yet we no where read that they were circumciſed, nor do beleeve they were. So that if Circumciſion was adminiſtred to none but thoſe that were joyned together in <hi>Abrahams</hi> familie, and to the Church of God in his ſeed, then may not baptiſme in ordinarie courſe be adminiſtred to any beleevers now, unleſſe they be joyned to the Church of Chriſt, for <hi>parum par eſt ratio.</hi> But the firſt is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſecond alſo.</p>

               <p>THe particulars in this Anſwer hath been examined alreadie, and might have well been paſſed over, becauſe it is tedious to repeat the ſame things againe and againe. Two things are affirmed by you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the ſcope of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. was not to define a Sacrament, nor to ſhew what was the proper and adequate ſubject of a Sacrament. But this weakneth no part of the argument, for if the Apoſtle do not fully define a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor mention every particular benefit or prerogative ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet he ſheweth ſufficiently to whom the Sacraments in due order do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, even to the heires of ſalvation, to them that are juſtified by faith, and walk in the ſteps of our Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> And thus we argue from the text of the Apoſtle. They that are partakers of the good things ſealed in the Sacrament, to them belong the Seales of the Covenant, according to Gods Inſtitution. But they that are juſtified by faith are partakers of the good things ſealed in the Sacrament, to them belong the Seales of the Covenant according to Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. If Juſtification be not the onely thing that Circumciſion ſealed, this is nothing to the point in hand. For the gifts of the holy Ghoſt is not the onely thing that is ſealed in Baptiſme: But you confeſſe in your Anſwer immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going before, that they have right to baptiſme who have received the holy Ghoſt; and the reaſon is the ſame of Juſtification. Beſides if Juſtification be not the onely thing that is ſealed in the Sacrament, it is one principall thing which doth inferre the reſt. For the bleſſings of the covenant of grace in Chriſt are inſeparable; where one is named, others are implyed: and where one is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no one is abſolutely wanting. <hi>Chriſt is made of God wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> whom God doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53955:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them he doth ſanctifie, and them he will glorifie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing you affirme is, that not onely the covenant of grace which is common to all beleevers; but Church-Covenant alſo which is peculiar to confederates is neceſſarie to the participation of the Seales. This ſenſe your words muſt beare, or elſe they reach not the point in hand: but this is that which ſhould be proved ſubſtantially, and not barely affirmed; and which (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) is contrary to the firſt inſtitution of the Sacrament, and the lawfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, our Saviour Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and all others who are recorded lawfully to adminiſter the Seales. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. we find the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of circumciſion recorded, and that it was the ſeale of the Covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, to them that were borne in his houſe, or bought with his money: but we find no mention of any Church Covenant beſides the covenant of promiſe which God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> There is no mention of any Church-order into which <hi>Abrahams</hi> family was now gathered more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. God gave circumciſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed as a ſeale of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith; but that this family was firſt gathered into Church-order as you ſpeak we cannot beleeve, becauſe the Scripture ſaith it not whether <hi>Lot, Job, Melchizedech</hi> were circumciſed or not, we will not diſpute; but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the ſeale, we cannot think the reaſon to be becauſe they were not in Church-order as thoſe times required, if any ſuch thing had been required, we cannot think that either they were ignorant of it, or that they walked againſt their light: But accordiug to the diſpenſing of thoſe times we judge as they were viſible beleevers, ſo they walked in that Church fellowſhip which God preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and therefore if circumciſion had been the ſeale of ſuch Church-Covenant as you conceive, it ſhould have been given to them no leſſe then to <hi>Abrahams</hi> family. But of this ſufficient is ſaid before. As for Baptiſme it is the ſeal of the whole Covenant, which the paſſages quoted prove it to be. Whether it be the ſeale of our fellowſhip which Chriſt in affliction, and the reſurrection of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we leave it to your conſideration: but that it ſhould be a Seal of a Church-Covenant which is peculiar to confederates, that to us is very ſtrange. That it is a ſolemne admiſſion into the Church of Chriſt, and that of neceſſitie it muſt be adminiſtred in a particular ſocietie (though in the paſſage to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the myſticall bodie of Chriſt be underſtood) will eaſily be granted. But that it is the ſeale of any other covenant but the covenant of grace we cannot digeſt.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments are of God, and we muſt learne of God for what end and uſe they were ordained. But by the Inſtitution of Baptiſme recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we have learned it belongeth to the faithfull, to diſciples, to them that are called of God: and as for any other covenant neceſſarie to the right participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Seales, there is deep ſilence of it in the Inſtitution, in the lawfull and approved practiſe of the firſt diſpenſers of theſe ſacred myſteries. Enough hath been ſaid to this matter alreadie, but we will conclude it with the words of that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53955:39"/>
reverend Author whom we have cited many times before upon occaſion. <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>John the Baptiſt walked in the ſame ſteps, and by the ſame rule ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred baptiſme in the Church whereof he was a member, required of all that came to his baptiſme a profeſſion of repentance, and amendment</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 6. 7. Mark 1. 4. 5. Luk. 13. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>of life for remiſſion of ſinnes whereof baptiſme was a ſeale, and preached Chriſt to them.</hi> This order our Lord Jeſus Chriſt after his reſurrection eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to continue in the Chriſtian Churches, giving a commiſſion to <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19, 20. Mar. 16. 15, 16.</note> his Diſciples to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles, and to gather all ſuch as ſhould beleeve through the world, as a teſtimonie to them, that the righteouſneſſe of faith did belong to them alſo, and not to the Church of the Jews onely. Accordingly the Apoſtles and ſervants of Chriſt were carefull to obſerve this rule in their adminiſtring baptiſme. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſaw thoſe three thouſand ſouls pricked in their hearts, preached unto them concerning repentance, remiſſion of ſin, Chriſt, the promiſe, baptiſme, faith, amendment of life, baptiſed thoſe that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <note place="margin">Act. 2. 37. 47.</note> his word, and teſtified the ſame by joyning together in the proſeſſion thereof. The ſame courſe <hi>Philip</hi> took with the Church that was gathered in Samaria, where many were baptized, but none till they <note place="margin">Act. 8. 12. 14.</note> profeſſed their beliefe of the Goſpel, and their receiving of the Word of God. And therefore it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>When they beleeved Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdome of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptiſed both men and women.</hi> When <hi>Ananias</hi> was commanded to go and baptiſe <hi>Paul,</hi> he objected againſt it at firſt, till the Lord aſſured <note place="margin">Act 9. 11-17.</note> him that he was one to whom the Seale of the Covenant belonged, and then he went and did it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> and thoſe that came with him ſaw that the holy Ghoſt fell on <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe that were aſſembled at that time in his houſe, <note place="margin">Act. 10. 43-48.</note> whileſt he ſpake theſe words, <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through the Name of Jeſus whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes. Peter</hi> demanded, <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptiſed, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> In this catalogue we ſee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith and repentance required in them that were admitted to partake in the ſeals; but there is not a word of Church-Covenant, either in the Inſtitution or adminiſtration of the Seales before they were admitted to them. That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſolemnly ingrafted into the body of Chriſt, and into particular Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the Seales, is a truth acknowledged on all ſides: but that ever it was dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med neceſſarie, that a Chriſtian ſhould be a ſet member of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall Church before he were admitted to the Seales, or that by divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution any ſuch thing is ordained as neceſſarie thereunto, that upon the grounds before mentioned we denie, and cannot account it leſſe then an addition to the inſtitution. For if the Sacraments be ſeales of the Covenant of grace, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53955:40"/>
baptiſme by divine Inſtitution belong to Diſciples, faithfull, Saints, who have gladly received the Word of grace, are juſtified by faith, ſanctified by the Spirit, adopted to be the children of God by grace, and heires apparent to the kingdom of heaven; then to debarre ſuch from the Seales, and their ſeed from Baptiſme, becauſe they be not in Church-Covenant (as you ſpeake) is an addition to the ordinance of grace, and many wayes injurious to the people of God.</p>

Not the firſt, for then the Apoſtles themſelves ſhould derive their power from the communitie and ſocietie of the faithfull, which they did not, but from Chriſt immediately, both in reſpect of gifts <note place="margin">

               <p>It is ſaid the power of the keyes given to the Apoſtles was given to the Church, <hi>In tuitu ejuſdem tanquam finis &amp; totius.</hi> And it is true the Apoſtles were given to the Church, and the power they received was for the good of the whole; but this is not enough. That power may be ſaid to be received immediately by the Church, as the firſt receptacle of it, and from it derived to others. But this power muſt be in the communitie as the firſt ſubject, from whom it commeth to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. As the power of ſeeing is not onely given <hi>in tuitu hominis,</hi> as the end of it, and the <hi>totum</hi> to whom it agreeth, but is <hi>in homine</hi> as the firſt ſubject from which it commeth to the eyes.

The authoritie of Governors is given of Chriſt for a gift to the Church, but not for a gift ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, that it may reſide in the power of the whole Church, to whom it is given, but for a conditionall gift communicated to the Governors themſelves for the good of the whole. It is one thing then to aske for what end or uſe the keyes are given, another to whom. To every one is given the declaration of the Spirit for profit, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the good of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7. 1 Cor. 3. 12. 1. Tim. 3. 15. 1 Cor. 4. 1.</note> the Church.

After the Churches were eſtabliſhed it tooke not effect; for then it muſt be ſhewed where Chriſt committed the power of God, firſt to the Apoſtles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the communitie of the faithfull. But that is no where to be found in holy ſcripture. The Miniſters and guides of the Church were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.

Yea, Paſtorſhip is the gift of Chriſt no leſſe then Apoſtleſhip, and that the more becauſe it is perpetuall in the Church; every Paſtor is not immediately called, but the Office and order of Paſtors, the calling, authoritie and juriſdiction is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt, and not from the Church: <note place="margin">Succeſſor habet juriſdictione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ab eo a quo praedeceſſor, alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui non verè ſuccedit. <hi>But Paſtors and Teachers are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles.</hi> Whit. de pont. q. 8. c. 3.</note> The Steward is appointed of the Maſter of the family alone, and hath all his authoritie and juriſdiction from him: Every Ambaſſador in the cauſe of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage doth immediately depend upon him from whom he is ſent. But if the function, order and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Paſtors and Teachers, be immediately from Chriſt, then it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Church as the immediate receptacle.

And if Presbyters receive their order juriſdiction and power of execution from Chriſt by his mandate and Commiſſion, then they receive it not from the Biſhop. And by the ſame reaſon, if the power of the keyes be the immediate gift of Chriſt to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, then they derive not their power and authoritie from the people. It is uſually objected that the Church cannot convey what ſhe never had, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may Elect their Paſtor. Whereunto the anſwer is direct and plaine. Nothing can give that which it had not formally or virtually, unleſſe it give it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument miniſtring to one who hath it, but ſo it may give what it never had, nor is capable of. A Steward may give all the offices in his Maſters houſe, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially executing his Maſters pleaſure. Electors have not evermore authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie over him whom they elect: but power and authoritie onely to apply that power to him whom they chooſe. The power and authoritie whereunto a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is elected, is not in the people that elect him, but from Chriſt the King and head of his Church, who out of power doth conferre that office upon him. If we conſider what men give, or give not univerſally, it muſt be deemed that any men can make Miniſters, becauſe they give not the office, gifts, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">Cham. panſtr. tom. 2. lib. 11. c. 18. ſect. 11.</note> which are from Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall power be in the multitude and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53955:42"/>
community of the faithfull, the Church doth not onely call, but make Officers out of power and vertue received into her ſelfe, and then ſhould the Church have a true lordlike power in regard of her Miniſters. <note place="margin">In the Church the Officers are the Miniſters of the people, whoſe ſervice the people is to uſe for adminiſtration and executing their judgements, that is, pronouncing the judgement of the Church (and of God firſt) againſt the obſtinate. <hi>Rob.</hi> againſt <hi>Ber. p.</hi> 136.

               </p>
               <p>For as he that will derive authority to the Church maketh himſelfe Lord of the Church: ſo if the Church derive authoritie to the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſhe maketh herſelf Lady and Miſtris over them in the exerciſe of that authoritie over them. For all men know it is the property of the Lord and Maſter to impart au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Did the Church give power and authoritie to the Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhe might make the Sacraments and preaching which one doth in order no Sacraments, no preaching. For it is the order inſtituted of God that gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and efficacie to theſe ordinances. And if the power of ruling, feeding, and diſpenſing the holy things of God, do reſide in the faithfull, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in reſpect of diſpenſation and efficacie ſhall depend upon the order and inſtitution of the Societie. If the power of the keyes be derived from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the faithfull, then are Officers immediately and formally ſervants to the Church, and muſt do every thing in the name of the Church, Rule, feed, bind, looſe, remit and retaine ſinnes, preach and adminiſter the Sacraments, then they muſt performe their Office according to the direction of the Church more or leſſe, ſeldome or frequent, remiſſe or diligent.

If their power and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be of God immediately, they muſt do the duties of their place according to his deſignement, and to be accountable unto God: But if their power and function be from the Church, the Church muſt give account unto God, and the Officers unto the Church whom ſhe doth take to be her helpers.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that God will have the Church to chuſe Officers to execute the power committed unto her. The anſwer is, either God will have her elect offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his deſignement to do his work according to that power which he ſhall give them, and by his direction, and then they are God ſervants, and not the Churches, and receive their charge and function immediately from God, and not from the people: or he leaveth it to the arbitriment of the Church, to chuſe according to their pleaſure ſuch as muſt receive charge and authoritie from her. And then they muſt execute their office in her name ſo as ſhall ſeeme good unto the Church, and neither longer nor otherwiſe. For if the Miniſters of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53955:42"/>
Church be ſubject to God and Chriſt by the intervention of the people onely, they have it from them, and not from God: but they preach or adminiſter the Sacraments, rule, or feed, and if they depend immediately upon the faithfull, <hi>viz.</hi> two or three gathered together in covenant, they muſt draw what in order they are to preach unto them in the name of the Lord; For from him muſt the Ambaſſadour learne his arrand from <note place="margin">Omnis legatus in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ legationis ſuae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatè pendet ab eo à quo mittitur, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumento mandato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in corrupto eſt indelebili.</note> whom he receiveth his Commiſſion.

               <p n="4">4. Moreover if the power of the keyes be given firſt and immediately to the community of the faithfull, what reaſon can be alledged why in defect of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers the Church might not rule, governe, feed, bind, looſe, preach and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments, or if any faile in any office, why ſhe might not ſupply that want by her power. For the power of the keyes doth containe, both authority and exerciſe, power being given to this end, that it might be exerciſed as it is vouchſafed. But the Church when ſhe is deſtitute of Officers, cannot exerciſe thoſe acts of rule, nor by her power ſupply the want of any Officer. Onely ſhe hath a miniſtery of calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed, that from Chriſt he may have power of office given him in the vacant place. For theſe reaſons (not to inſiſt on any more) we judge the multitude or community of the faithfull not to be the immediate receptacle of Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, and ſo the power of excommunication not to belong to them. If conſent of the Churches of God be asked in this point (to omit others) the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſpeake fully and expreſly for us, in the ſecond book of <hi>Diſci. cap. 1. The Church as it is taken for them that exerciſe ſpirituall functions in the congregation of them that profeſſe the truth, hath a certain power granted by God according to which, it uſeth a proper Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and government exerciſed to the comfort of the whole flocke. Power is an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall authority granted by God the Father through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt unto his Kirke, gathered, and having its ground in the word of God, and to be put in execution by them unto whom the ſpirituall government of the Church by lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is committed. The policie of the Kirke flowing from this power is an order or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall forme of government which is exerciſed by the members appointed thereto by the Word of God, and therefore is given immediately to the office-bearers by whom it is exerciſed to the weale of the whole body.</hi>

               <p>OUr Anſwer hereto is briefly this. We judge it expedient and moſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rule, that ſuch brethren as are in covenant with the Church, and ours as fellow-members, and have committed their ſoules to our charge as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſhould not forſake our fellowſhip, nor obruptly breake away from us when and whither they pleaſe; but firſt approve themſelves therein to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns conſciences, and take their counſell in ſo weightie a matter. For which we propound to confider theſe two reaſons following. The former is drawne from the nature of the Church-Covenant, which conſiſts in theſe foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every member at his admiſſion doth openly profeſſe, and ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that by Chriſts helpe aſſiſting, he will not onely in generall give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (as to the Lord to be guided by him, ſo) to the Church according to God to be directed by it, which is no more then the members of the Church of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> did in a parallel caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. but alſo in particular, that he will performe all duties of brotherly love and faithfulneſſe to all the members of the body, as of diligent watchfulneſſe over all his brethren, thereby to prevent ſin, ſo of faithfull admonition after their falls to regaine them to the Lord, from their ſinne, the former being injoyned, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 13. And the want thereof deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned in <hi>Cain,</hi> that would not acknowledge that duty of being his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keeper, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 9. the latter given in charge to the Church-members of Iſrael by the hand of <hi>Moſes, Levit.</hi> 19. 17. and ſo by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. And by <hi>Paul</hi> alſo to the <hi>Galat. c.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ingagements are not made onely by the members admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, but by the Church back again to the member. So that thereby the whole Church in generall, and every member thereof in particular, ſtand as well in conſcience bound to performe all duties of love and watchfulneſſe to him, as he doth to them; And this we do according to the golden rule of love and equitie injoyned by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. fearing that contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Scribes and Phariſees ſo much condemned by Chriſt, of laying greater
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53955:43"/>
burthens upon others, then we our ſelves are willing to undergo. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe promiſes thus lawfully and mutually made, that member, as alſo the whole Church, are bound not onely every one for himſelfe, actively to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, but paſſively alſo to ſuffer his brethren to do thoſe offices upon and towards himſelf: If he neglect the former, he ſhall falſifie his covenant ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God, Angels, and men made, and ſo not onely breake promiſe to his brother, contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. but alſo in ſome ſort commit the ſinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> in lying againſt the holy Ghoſt, condemned and puniſhed ſeverely by Gods own hand, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. 5. 10. If he faile in the latter, he ſhall not onely be guiltie of the ſame ſinne of breach of Covenant with God and man as in the former; but ſhall alſo be guilty of this folly of deſpiſing counſell ſo much condemned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 15. and 1. 7. and ſhall alſo proclaime this his folly and pride by ſhewing to all the Church that he is wiſe in his own eyes, and leanes to his own wiſedome both reproved, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 7. and 23. 4. Seeing need of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light to be held forth by his brethren, then what he apprehends himſelfe, which is one of the greateſt properties of folly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From all theſe things premiſed, it appears that we can do no leſſe (and yet we do no more) then require a member before he depart according to our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thus lawfully, deliberately, and mutually made, to expreſſe to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren his deſire of departing, and the place and ſocietie to which he tends, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a godly Church where he may be edified; or to ſome corrupt Aſſembly where he may be deſtroyed. And 2. his grounds and reaſons which move him ſo to do, which if they hold good being ſcanned by the Word, he may be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed in his way by the conſent and adviſe of many, but counſelled alſo how to manage his departure for his beſt comfort. And ſo after all, ſolemnly with the whole Churches prayers, and bleſſings in the name of Chriſt diſmiſſed: But if his grounds either be none at all, or weake and ſinfull, and that his deſire of departing ſavours of ſelf-will, inordinate love of gaine, raſh precipitancie, or a ſpirit of ſchiſme, more ſtrongly then of ſound reaſon, then what can we do leſſe without breach of Covenant, then in love and tenderneſſe ſhew him his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſſwade him from his purpoſe, and refuſe to conſent. Yet if after all this we ſee his ſpirit ſtedfaſtly and ſtiffely bent for a departure, then though we dare not act againſt our light by conſenting or counſelling, yet if his finne be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and danger eminent, we uſe rather (through indulgence in caſes of like nature) to ſuſpend our vote againſt him, as not willing againſt his will to detain him, abhorring to make our Churches places of reſtraint and impriſonment. But if any ſhould object that this argument holds firme where this Church-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is allowed to be lawfull, but with ſome it is queſtioned, and with them it avails not. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some indeed have queſtioned the neceſſitie of our Church-Covenant, but none (we hope) of theſe our reverend brethren that we write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to do queſtion the lawfulneſſe of ſuch a Covenant being nothing elſe for the

matter of it, but a promiſe of doing ſuch Chriſtian duties as the Goſpel of Chriſt requires of all Saints in Church-eſtate; for we doe not herein promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any new dutie to our brethren which was not before commanded us of the Lord, but onely revive and renew our purpoſes afreſh of performing ſuch duties unto that particular body into which we are then incorporated as were before injoyned in the Word, as to love each other, and to watch over each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of love for their good, to be ready to give counſell to, and to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from each other, to prevent ſinne in them, or to gaine them from <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 1. Pro. 12. 19. &amp; 1 7. 23. Gen 4. 4. 9. Levit. 19. 17. Mat. 18. 15. Gal. 6. 1.</note> ſinne. All which are plentifully and frequently held forth in the Scriptures; for the defect of which care and watchfulneſſe, all the body ſhall be wrapt in the ſame guilt &amp; puniſhment with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that commits the ſinne, as the whole Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Its a thing very reaſonable, and a knowne fundamentall rule in all ſocieties, that he that is incorporate thereto, and ſo participates of the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof, ſhould ingage himſelfe to conforme to all ſuch lawfull rites and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as are expedient for the well being of that ſocietie, the contrary whereto will be a thing injurious in him to offer, and confuſion to themſelves to accept.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is drawne from the neceſſitie that may fall upon the body if every particular member ſhould depart at his owne pleaſure. For as every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, ſo much more a Church of Saints, both from principles of nature and Chriſtianitie alſo, not onely lawfully may, but in dutie are bound to endeavour the preſervation of it ſelfe, and <hi>Ergo</hi> timely to foreſee and wiſely to prevent all ſuch things as would bring deſtruction to it ſelfe. Now if any member might, when, whither, and wherefore he pleaſe without conſent of the Church depart away from it, this may by unavoydable conſequence diſſipate the whole; for if one man may ſo depart, why may not another alſo, though never ſo uſefull in that body, and whoſe abſence might much ſhake the well-being of it: and if one why not two, ſix, ten, twent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Seeing they are tyed to him by the ſame relation that he is to them, and ſo the principalls falling, the whole building muſt downe: and if this may be ſo in one Church, why not in all, and ſo Chriſt ſhould have no ſetled Church on earth.</p>

               <p>IT is one thing abruptly to breake away when and whither they pleaſe, and forſake fellow-ſhip, another thing not to depart or remove habitation, unleſſe the Congregation will give leave. Alſo it is one thing mutually to compound and agree not to depart from each other without conſent and approbation, another to require a promiſe of all that be admitted into ſocietie, that they ſhall not depart without the Churches allowance. If ſuch a promiſe be required of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53955:44"/>
all members to be admitted, we cannot diſcerne upon what grounds your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is warranted. Firſt, you exclude all ſuch as be not ſet members from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, and their children from Baptiſme, and yet hinder them from entrance into Church ſocietie, becauſe they cannot promiſe continuance in the place where they are reſident for the preſent. Here we deſire to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the word of God by what you require it. Did the Apoſtles ever ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with ſuch as deſired to be baptized, that they muſt abide in particular ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not remove thence without approbation from the Church? or did they deny the ſeales unto them, becauſe they could not make any ſuch promiſe? Was it ever heard of in the Church of God from the beginning thereof unto this day, that any ſuch thing was propounded unto, or required of, members to be admitted into Church-fellowſhip? That Church Covenant which is neceſſary was not in uſe in the Apoſtles times, but the Covenant they entred into bound no man to this condition for ought we reade. They did not preſcribe it, no Church ever yet covenanted it as neceſſary to the preſervation of the body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It pertaines not to the whole Congregation to take notice of, be acquainted with, or judge of the cauſe of every particular members removall. May not a ſervant remove from his Maſter to another Congregation? or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſtow his ſonne or daughter in marriage to one of another Congregation, but the whole Church muſt be called to councell in this matter? If the Aſſembly once grow to be populous, of neceſſitie they muſt be negligent in, or weary of ſuch an heavy taske; and for the preſent, for every one to challenge ſo much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie over other is uſurpation. Let it be ſhewed that ever by divine right this power was committed to the Church, and then we will confeſſe it to be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and neceſſary. But till then we thinke the Church is over ridged in exacting ſuch a condition of the members, and the members themſelves goe beyond their meaſure as buſi-bodies in other mens matters, and things whereof they are not well able to judge many times, if they arrogate ſuch power unto themſelves wee allow not raſhneſſe, or precipitancy, pride or ſelf-conceitedneſſe, we know it is meete that weightie matters ſhould be mannaged by Councell, but it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bring every particular thing to the whole Church. <hi>In the multitude of Councellors there is peace,</hi> but over many Councellors oft cauſeth diſtraction, and different apprehenſions breed delayes. The nature of your Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as you deſcribe it, inferreth not a neceſſitle of bringing every ſuch buſineſſe unto the Church; for you binde your ſelves mutually to watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in love to admoniſh one another in the Lord, to prevent ſinne and to encourage in well-doing, as it concerneth every man within the limits of his place and calling. But this eſſentially tyeth not any man to a perpetuall reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in one place, for then even occaſionall abſence ſhould be a breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unleſſe it be by conſent and approbation of the Church.</p>
               <p>You ſay in your Covenant you promiſe to performe no new dutie to your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53955:45"/>
brethren which was not before commanded of the Lord, but onely revive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your purpoſes afreſh of performing ſuch duties to that particular body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which you are then to be incorporated, as were before injoyned in the Word. But in the word of truth, it is not commanded either expreſly or by conſequent, that no member of a Congregation ſhould remove, or occaſionally be abſent from the place of his habitation, before he have acquainted the Church whither he goeth, and upon what occaſions, and whether the place be dangerous, where he is likely to be infected; or ſafe, where he may be edified. Theſe things are matters of weight and to be undertaken with advice, but the knowledge thereof belongeth not to every particular member of the ſocietie. And the Church ſhall burden her ſelfe above meaſure if ſhe take upon her to intermeddle in all ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Neither is it ſafe to commit the determination of ſuch matters ever to the vote of the multitude, or weight of reaſons, as they ſhall apprehend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And if ſuch buſineſſe muſt be determined on the Lords day, and to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the adminiſtration of the Word, Sacraments, and almes, leaſt the holy things be polluted by notorious obſtinate offenders, wee <note place="margin">Rob. <hi>ag.</hi> Bern. pa. 230.</note> feare the time appointed for the exerciſe of Religion ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned with unſeaſonable diſputes. Inſtances might be alledged, if it were a matter to be inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>As for the Covenant it ſelfe which you mutually enter into, if therein you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act nothing but what God requires both for tryall and ſtipulation, far be it that we ſhould diſallow it, but if yee conſtraine men to meddle with things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to them, and winde them up higher then God would, and ſtraine every thing to the pitch that you ſeeme here to doe in this branch a godly and ſober minde may well pauſe before he make ſuch promiſe. All members of the Church are not equally neceſſary to the preſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole body; &amp; if to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of ſome, it were expedient to have the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, not only of the whole ſociety, but of neighbouring ſocieties, Miniſters eſpecially, it is very much to draw this to the removall or abode of every particular member. And if any man ſhall not intermeddle with every buſineſſe of this kinde, as queſtioning whether it doth belong to him or no, or not aske the advice of the whole ſocietie, as knowing the moſt to be unfit to counſell in ſuch a caſe, doth he break his Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo commit a ſinne in a ſort like the ſinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira?</hi> Judge your ſelves if in other caſes you would not cenſure this to be an high incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Chriſtian libertie, and a ſtrict binding of mens conſciences by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſtitutions. May you not expect to heare from your own grounds that herein you have deviſed an expedient, or neceſſary rite or cuſtome to preſerve the unitie, and prevent the diſſolution of the body, which never came into the minde of the Lord Jeſus, the Saviour of the Church, and that in ſo doing (if your expoſition will hold good) you breake the ſecond Commandement. Rites and cuſtomes expedient to prevent confuſion for the time, let them be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53955:45"/>
as cuſtomes expedient, and what God requires in the examination or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of members, let that take place according to the preſidents given in the Scriptures, and the conſtant practiſe of the univerſall Church in the pureſt times. But to preſſe cuſtomes onely expedient for the time, as ſtanding rules neceſſary at all times, and for all perſons, to put that authoritie into the hands of men which God never put upon them, to oblige men to intermeddle further in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of men, then the Word doth warrant, to binde the conſcience, and that under ſo heavy a penalty as the ſinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> where God hath not bound it, and to debarre known and approved Chriſtians from the Seales of the Covenant, becauſe they cannot promiſe as ſetled members to abide and ſtay in the ſocietie, unleſſe they ſhall obtaine leave of the Congregation to depart, and to charge them in the meane ſeaſon to be men, who againſt light refuſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Goſpel; this is that which we cannot approve, which yet wee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect will follow from your judgement, and deſire to be reſolved of in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. And here we intreat leave to put you in minde of that which you have conſidered already, <hi>ſchil.</hi> That the Church and every member thereof hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Covenant, either expreſly or implicitely to take God for their God, and to keepe the words of the Covenant and doe them, to ſeeke the <note place="margin">Exod. 24. 37. Deut. 2. 14. &amp; 4. 3. 4. &amp; 9. 7.</note> Lord with all their hearts, and to walke before him in truth and uprightneſſe: but we never finde that they were called to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the worke of grace wrought in their ſoules, or that the whole Congregation were appointed to be Judge thereof. <hi>You ſtand</hi>

But the confeſſion and profeſſion of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was taken. When <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> began to preach the Goſpel, and gather a new people for Chriſt, he admitted none to Baptiſme but upon confeſſion of their ſinnes; but we reade of no queſtion that he put forth unto them to diſcover the worke of grace in their ſoules, or repelled any that voluntarily ſubmitted themſelves upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. It appeareth many wayes that when the Apoſtles planted <note place="margin">Act. 2. 38. &amp; 8. 37. &amp; 19. 17, 18, 19.</note> Churches, they made a Covenant between God and the people whom they received. But they received men upon the profeſſion of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53955:46"/>
faith, and promiſe of amendment of life, without ſtrict in quirie what ſound work of grace was wrought in the ſoul. In after ages, ſtrangers from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were firſt inſtructed in the faith, and then baptiſed upon the profeſſion of faith, and promiſe to walk according to the covenant of grace. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at firſt required of all that were received to baptiſme was that they beleeved in the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. This was the <note place="margin">Act. 8. 37.</note> confeſſion of the Eunuch when he was baptiſed, <hi>I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God.</hi> The Creed is honoured of the ancients with glorious titles, as the rule of faith, the ſumme of faith, the body of faith, the perſwaſions of faith: but by the Creed they underſtand that rule of faith, and law of faith, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt which was then given when he was about to aſcend into heaven, and commanded his diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Go teach all Nations, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, that in after times as occaſion required ſome other Articles were added as explanations of the former, to meet with the hereſies of the times which began to trouble the Church. But for ſubſtance of matter in things to be beleeved, the Church never required other acknowledgement of them that were to be received into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Chriſts flock, and admitted into her communion. And for things to be done, or the practicall part, ſhe requireth of them that were to be received to baptiſme an abrenuntiation of the devill, the world, and the fleſh, with all their ſinfull works and luſts.</p>
               <p>The firſt principles then of the doctrine of Chriſt being received, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid profeſſion being made, the Apoſtles, and the Church following the example of the Apoſtles, never denied baptiſme unto ſuch as ſought or deſired it. If this be the Covenant that members admitted into Church-fellowſhip do enter into, and this be all you require of them whom you receive, you have the practiſe of the Apoſtles, and the whole Church in after ages for your preſident. But if you proceed further then thus, and put men to declare what worke of grace God hath wrought in their ſoul, in this or that way, which perhaps is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word of grace, at leaſt not agreed upon among your ſelves, we beſeech you conſider by what authority you do it, and upon what grounds you ſtand.

               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>OUr Anſwer to this conſiſts in two branches. 1. In caſe a Miniſter be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by the Church meerly through his own default. 2. By the Churches
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53955:46"/>
default without any deſert of his. In the former caſe it is evident he ceaſeth to be a Miniſter to them any longer, as appears in foure concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is cleare from the Word, that a Paſtor or Teacher in theſe dayes hath no Apoſtolicall power over all Churches, but onely limited to that one Church where God hath ſet him. <hi>Paul</hi> gives not the Elders at <hi>Epheſus</hi> a generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go teach all Churches, but to go feed that one flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them over-ſeers. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. So <hi>Peter</hi> gives direction to Elders to feed that flock of God onely which was among them, and take the over-ſight thereof. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is as cleare that all this power of feeding which the Miniſter hath in that Church is nextly derived to him from Chriſt by the Church, who hath ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called him to the work, and promiſed to obey him therein: for if he have it elſewhere, it muſt be either from Chriſt immediately, or from ſome other men deputed by Chriſt to conferre it on him, or he muſt take it up of himſelfe. Not the firſt, for that was proper to the Apoſtles or Apoſtolicall men, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> proving his Apoſtleſhip, ſaith he was called <hi>not of men, nor by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Gal.</hi> 1. 1. Not the ſecond, for we never read in Gods Word that any ordinary Officers, or other beſides the Church, that had any Commiſſion given them from Chriſt to call Miniſters unto Churches. Not the third, for no man taketh this honour, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Prieſt under the Law, or of a Miniſter under the Goſpel, but he that is called of God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 4. Therefore it muſt needs be from Chriſt by the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the Church in the name of Chriſt gave this power to a Miniſter to be what he is, and do what he doth amongſt them: when ſuch a Miniſter ſhall make and manifeſt himſelf apparently, unworthy, and unfit to diſcharge the place, which they thus called him unto, ſo that they may diſcerne that Chriſt the head of the Church hath refuſed him, from being a Miniſter unto him, they may then upon as good grounds depoſe him from it, as they called him to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When a Church hath thus in Chriſts name put forth this power of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as before it did of opening to a Miniſter, then he muſt ceaſe to be a Miniſter unto them any more, for we know no ſuch indelible character imprinted upon a Miniſter, that the Miniſtery ceaſing, the Miniſter ceaſeth alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe the Church ſhall without cauſe, or ſufficient weightie cauſe, raſhly or wilfully ſet him aſide whom Chriſt hath ſet over them, and whom they ſo ſolemnly called, and promiſed before the Lord to ſubmit unto, and ſo abuſe their power given them by Chriſt; it is doubtleſſe a very great wrong unto the Miniſter, and ſinne againſt Chriſt himſelfe before whom it was done; and not onely Chriſt himſelf will take it ill at their hands, for ſuch contempt done to him in his Miniſters according to Chriſts ſpeech, <hi>Luke 10. 16. He that rejecteth you, rejecteth me.</hi> And Gods ſpeech, 1 Sam. 8. 7. <hi>They have not caſt off thee but me.</hi> But even other Churches alſo may admoniſh them. And if they prove obſtinate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53955:47"/>
therein, withdraw the right hand of fellowſhip from them; and concerning the Miniſter himſelf thus depoſed, ſeeing it is done not by Chriſt, but by the Church without Chriſt, yea againſt the mind of Chriſt, we conceive though he be by them deprived of the execution of his miniſtery among them, yet untill he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of a call to another people, he doth yet ſtill remain a Miniſter of Chriſt, in whoſe account (notwithſtanding ſuch depoſition) he hath true right of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration among that people.</p>

               <p>THe queſtion is of Miniſters unjuſtly forſaken, or driven from the Church or congregation: and your anſwer is for the moſt part of Miniſters ſet aſide or deprived through their own default. We never purpoſed to ſpeak one word for any unworthy Miniſter whom Chriſt hath put out of office, and therefore your labour to prove that ſuch juſtly rejected by the Church are no longer Miniſters might well have been ſaved. But ſitting them aſide, we will in few words examine your concluſions upon which you bind the certainty of that ſentence you paſſe againſt them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is certain and clear from the Word, that a Paſtor or Teacher neither in theſe dayes hath, nor in any other age of the Church, ought to have Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall power over all Churches. The Apoſtles had onely power to ſerve the Church with the perſonall ſervice of their Apoſtleſhip. But paſtorall power of ordinarie Miniſters or Teachers they never had: and if the Apoſtles had not the power of ordinarie Miniſters, much leſſe can Paſtors receive the power of Apoſtles, for Chriſt gave both the one and the other order. But as the Apoſtles were not Paſtors of that Church to which they preached, and among whom they continued for ſome ſpace; no more do Paſtors become Apoſtles if they preach the Word, or diſpence the Sacraments to another flock or people beſide their own, whereof they have the ſpeciall overſight. But of this matter we have ſpoken before, and of the texts of Scripture here alledged, therefore we will not repeat what hath been ſaid alreadie: onely it ſeemeth ſomewhat ſtrange, that you ſhould cite thoſe texts of Scripture, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, feed one flock, or feed that flock of God onely. For we find the word (one) or (onely) neither in the text expreſly, nor in the ſenſe for which it is here alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> as if he might not perform any miniſteriall act in another Congregation upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the power of feeding which the Miniſter hath is neither confined to one ſocietie onely, nor nextly derived to him from Chriſt by the Church. The office and authoritie of a Paſtor is immediately from Chriſt. The deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon which Chriſt hath deſigned is from the Church miniſterially, but neither virtually nor formally. The conſent of the people is requiſite in the election of Paſtors and Teachers we grant, the direction of the Elders going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53955:47"/>
or along with them; but the authoritie, office, and gift of a Paſtor is not from the people or Elders, but from Chriſt alone. <note place="margin">Whit. de pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q. 1 ca. 1. p. 14.</note> When an Apoſtle was to be choſen in the place of <hi>Judas, Act.</hi> 1. 22, 23. no one had the handling of that buſineſſe, but <hi>Peter</hi> declared unto the brethren preſent, what an one ought to be taken, and they preſent two, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one was elected by lot. In this example ſomethings are extraordinarie, for one onely was to be choſen, and that immediately by God himſelfe: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things ordinarie for our imitation. For if <hi>Peter</hi> would do nothing without conſent of the diſciples, thenmay not ordinarie elections be paſſed without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and approbation of the Church, but it is not a popular election, not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fore-direction of Elders, which is concluded from this paſſage of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: but a Church election by the free conſent, and judgement of the faithfull with the fore-leading of the Presbyterie. When Deacons were to be choſen, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1. 6. in the Church of Jeruſalem, it was done by the conſent of the Church. The mutinie of the <hi>Helleniſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> occaſioned that election, but was no cauſe why it was made by free conſent. The Apoſtles ſhew what perſons muſt be choſen, and who ever thought the Church was left at libertie to chuſe as ſhe pleaſe without direction. But in this election the people did firſt chuſe, the Apoſtles onely directing whom the people ought to make choice of: when moſt commonly the Apoſtles inſtructed the people, and went before them in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and they conſented. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. The Apoſtles by conſent choſe Elders, and ſo in every matter of great importance belonging directly to the whole bodie of the Church, whether ſeverally in one congregation, or joyntly in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the conſent of the faithfull by obſervation of the Apoſtles was required. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 22. and 15. 22. and 16. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. But in the primitive times after the Apoſtles, one Church might elect and chuſe a Paſtor for another. As <hi>Ignatius</hi> exhorts the Phyladelphians, that they would elect a Paſtor for the Church of Antioch. And ſo when the Eaſt Church was infected with Arrianiſme, <hi>Baſil. epiſt.</hi> 69. 70. 74. thought it a fit meanes to remove the hereſie, if the Biſhops of Italie being ſent thither did condemne the hereſie, and he imploreth the aid of the Biſhops of Italy, France, and all the Eaſt. <hi>Cyprian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ep. 13. li. 3.</note> ſaith, all Biſhops <hi>ſunt mutuae concordiae glutine copulati:</hi> that if any hold hereſie the reſt ſhould help. It would be too long to reckon up examples which in this caſe might be produced. If here it be queſtioned whether your election of the people be eſſentiall to the calling of a Miniſter: We anſwer. 1. A thing is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall two wayes. Firſt, as abſolutely neceſſarie, ſo that the thing can have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence without it. Secondly, as neceſſarie to the integritie of the thing, ſo that it is maimed without it.</p>
               <p>Againe, either the people be few in number, and ſimple apt to be led aſide, unable to judge of the ſufficiencie of their Miniſter, or they be more in number, increaſed in wiſdome, ſound in faith, and able to diſcern betwixt things that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53955:48"/>
differ. In the firſt ſenſe the election of the people is not neceſſary or eſſentiall; But in the ſecond we cannot ſay he is no Miniſter that is not choſen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but his calling in that reſpect is maimed. If the people be few and ſimple, apt to be deceived, they ſtand in more need of guidance and direction, both from their own Elders, and other Churches. If the people be many in number, full of wiſdome and underſtanding, their libertie to chooſe is the greater; and it is the greater wrong to be deprived of it. The practiſe of the Apoſtles and the primitive Churches for many ages will confirme this; for ſometimes men were propounded to the Church to be choſen: Sometimes the choice was wholly left to them: and was not that for our direction, that more libertie is given where the danger is leſſe, and more reſtraint and caution uſed where the danger is more apparent, that if they be left to themſelves, either an ill or unfit choice will be made? In reaſon this is evident, for the childs conſent is required in marriage, but the more able he is to chooſe for himſelfe, the more libertie may parents grant, the leſſe able, the more watchfull muſt they be; and ſo in this buſineſſe. Brotherly ſocietie requires that we mutually exhort, admoniſh, reprove and comfort each other as occaſion requires, and as need requires. It is a dutie of Neighbour-Churches to lend their helpe to their brethren in the choice and election of their Miniſter. When the Scripture willeth that one <note place="margin">Rom 15. 14. Heb. 3. 13.</note> ſhould admoniſh another, it is not onely a command to every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man towards his fellow, but alſo to any whole company too: another ſocietie <hi>Bellarmine</hi> asketh, <hi>quo jure unus populus Epiſcopum alterius populi elegere poteſt?

               <p>It is a blemiſh in the calling of a Miniſter, if either the people be not fit to chooſe, or being fit they be ſhut forth from the choice, but this maime doth not make a nullitie in his calling; for in every true Church where the word is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and received, and the Sacraments for ſubſtance rightly adminiſtred, there is a true and lawfull Miniſtery, and a true and lawfull calling of that Miniſtery, though in ſome things defective. In the Church of God all ſound and ſaving truth is to be found, for it is the pillar and ground of truth, and where the true profeſſion of all ſaving truth, with the right uſe of the Sacraments for ſubſtance is to be found, there is the Church, which ordinarily cannot be had, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and continued without a lawfull Miniſtery, nor that without a calling. The ſaving truth of God &amp; a lawfull Miniſtery, are both eſſentiall to a true Church. Something of this remaines in every compleat ſocietie that hath any thing of the Church; and for eſſence and ſubſtance they are true in every true, lawfull, compleat ſocietie.

and fundamentall points, though mixed with diverſe errors, and the Miniſtery for truth and ſubſtance lawfull, though many wayes deficient. In the true Church there is a true Miniſtery, but the true Church hath continued there by the bleſſing of God, where the election of Miniſters hath been given away by the people, or taken from them. In the primitive Church, when the people had a voyce in the choice of their Paſtor, oftentimes there were factions in the Church, the people ſtood againſt their guides and challenged the whole power of election to themſelves. Sometimes they were divided <note place="margin">Theod. hiſt. l. 4. c. 6. Aug E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 110. &amp; 225. Socrat. hiſt. l 7. c. 34, 35. 39. Zozom. hiſt. l. 2. c. 18, 19.

Sometimes they gave away their power, at leaſt in part, and ſometimes Miniſters were ſet over them without their councell and advice, whoſe Miniſtery notwithſtanding was not reputed voyde and of none effect. If it be objected that many things were amiſſe in thoſe primitive elections, what will follow thence, but that the Miniſtery may be lawfull and good, where there be many wants in the manner of calling? If this be not granted, what ſhall be done when the people and their Elders be divided in the choice of a fit Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. If the people prevaile againſt their Elders, he whom they chooſe is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to them, becauſe not choſen by their ſuffrages: if the Elders againſt the people, he whom they approve is no Miniſter unto theirs, becauſe not choſen by their ſuffrage; And ſo if there be diſſention they muſt ſeperate from, or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate one another, becauſe he is no Miniſter to the one whom the others approve. The Orthodox Paſtors did profeſſe, ſo that the <hi>Donatists</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the true and Apoſtolicall doctrine, they would not diſallow their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that they might underſtand that Catholiques did not deteſt Chriſtian conſecration (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeakes) by humane error.

that the firſt ſeekers of reformation derived authoritie from Chriſt to preach the Word and adminiſter the Sacraments by them, as Stewards uſed of God to ſet them in that office: for the ſeekers of reformation derived their authoritie from God, and that which is inſtituted by Chriſt, is not made voyde by the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</p>
               <p>The third and fourth conſideration we will paſſe over, becauſe from what hath been ſpoken, it is eaſie to underſtand in what ſenſe they may be admitted, and in what denyed, and we have no deſire to trouble you with the examination of that which falleth not into queſtion.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond branch of your Anſwer, that in caſe the Church ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, or without ſufficient weightie cauſe, raſhly or wilfully ſet him aſide whom Chriſt hath ſet over them, yet he ſtill remaines a Miniſter of Chriſt (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he accepts of a call from another people) in whoſe account, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Depoſitions, he hath true right of adminiſtring among that people: We know not well your meaning; if this be your minde that a Miniſter lawfully called and ſet over one Congregation, is to be eſteemed a Miniſter in the uſuall Church, as the particular Church hath unitie with, and is part of the univerſall or Catholique: and as a partie baptized is not baptized into that particular Congregation onely, but into all Churches; and that the Miniſtery is one, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus à ſingulis in ſolidum pars tenetur,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes; and therefore though the Miniſter be unjuſtly caſt off by one Congregation, yet he is not to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as no Miniſter, we freely conſent. But if your meaning be that he is onely by right a Miniſter of that particular Congregation, becauſe unjuſtly depoſed, as formerly in the execution of his office he was a Miniſter to them onely, and to none other ſocietie whatſoever, or in what reſpect ſoever; your opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the judgement and practiſe of the univerſall Church, and tendeth to deſtroy the unitie of the Church, and that communion which the Churches of God may and ought to have one with another; for if he be not a Miniſter in other Churches, then are not the Churches of God one, nor the Miniſters one, nor the flocke which they feed one, nor the Communion one which they have each with other. And if the Paſtor derive all his authoritie to feede from the Church, when the Church hath ſet him aſide, what right hath he to adminiſter among that people. If they erre in their depoſition, it is true they ſinne againſt Chriſt. But as they give right to an unworthy man to adminiſter among them, if they call him unjuſtly, ſo they take right from the worthy if wrongſully they depoſe him. The Miniſter is for his Miniſtery the office for the execution, and ſo the Paſtor and the flocke are relatives: And therefore if their Election gave him authoritie among them to ſeed, their caſting him off hath ſtripped him of the ſame power which formerly they gave him. And his miniſtery ceaſing, he ſhould ceaſe to be their Miniſter, if he ſtood as Miniſter onely to that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every reſpect.</p>
