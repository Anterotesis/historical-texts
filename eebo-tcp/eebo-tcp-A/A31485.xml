            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CERTAIN Conſiderations propoſ'd by the CITY to the SOULDIERY in and about LONDON, touching the Peace and Welfare of the NATION.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E conceive you to be perſons no leſs reaſonable and conſcientions then ſtout and couragious; and therefore propoſe theſe weighty particulars to your prudent and pious conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that your poor native Countrey is now brought into a languiſhing and expiring condition, by the almoſt-monthly Mutation of arbitrary and Tyrannicall forms of Government, contrived and ſet up by a ſort of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Mechanical Maſhromes, Sons of earth and yeſterday, to promote and accompliſh their own ambitious and coveteous deſignes.</p>
            <p>Second, That theſe uſurping Tyrannes obtained not ſupremacy by their own perſonall power and policy: but it was the hands that lifted them up, and your ſhoulders that ſupported them.</p>
            <p>Third, That it was with expence of your bloud, hazard of your lives, and the ſolary due to your ſervice, that ſeverall Grandees of the Army, Rump, and City, have purchaſed ſuch goodly parcels of the Crowns, the Churches, and Delinquents Lands.</p>
            <p>Fourth, That if you deſert theſe Cormorants and leave them to the juſtice of a free <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they may be conſtrained to diſgorge thoſe ſweet Morſels (which have made them ſwell with fatneſs, and render them up for diſcharge of the Arrears of the Land and Sea-ſouldiery, and other publick uſes and benefits.</p>
            <p>Fifth, That it is by your ſtrength that Tyrans are enabled to prophane our Religion, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our Laws, infringe our Liberties, invade our proprieties. It is with their feet that they tread on our necks, and with the ſword that they wound and kill us.</p>
            <p>Sixth, That as your ill-placed (and not Well rewarded) valour, hath been inſtrumentall in plunging your afflicted Conntrey in a Gulph of Miſeries and calamities; ſo it hath now pleaſed Providence to put into your hands the power of putting her up, and reſtoring her to her former flouriſhing condition.</p>
            <p>Seventh, That the bleſſed work may be effected without any the leaſt effuſion of bloud; if you but pleaſe to draw out, and unanimouſly declare for a free <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighth, That if you ſhall thus declare, the Nation in generall, and the City more particularly will ſtand by you with their lives and fortunes; and bleſs, praiſe, and reward you, as the principall Authors, under Heaven, of all the content and happineſs they ſhall reap thereby.</p>
            <p>Ninth, That if you perſiſt in adherence to the Excrement of a Rump, which now Rules, you will enable them to raiſe and Modall a new Army, and then you cannot but expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of your former deſertion, which, at leaſt, will amount to an unrewarded and ignominious Caſhiering, which will expoſe you to the ſcorn and hate of the whole Nation, which now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires cauſe to love and honour you.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen,<lb/>
WE the propoſers of theſe conſiderations are a very conſiderable number of Citizens of no mean quality and fortunes who know it to be according to the Temper of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the City, and indeed of the Nation; and we wiſh a Judgement upon our perſons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, if we do not at your firſt declaring immediately appear with you, and faithfully adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you with the hazard of all that is dear unto us, and ſee all your Arrears forthwith diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and you received with hearty reſpect and thanks into future employment, with aſſurance of enlargement and continuance of your Pay.</p>
            <p>Conſider, we beſeech you, theſe things, and the Lord give you a right underſtanding.</p>
