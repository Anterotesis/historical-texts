            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whereof are become so by a perpetual Infirmity, as <hi>Idiots,</hi> or <hi>Fools Natural:</hi> Some, who were once of good and sound Memory, but by the Visitation of God, are deprived of it, as Persons, in a high Degree, Distracted: Some, that have their lucid Intervals, (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their Wits, sometimes out,) as Lunatick Persons: And some, who are made so by their own Default; as Persons overcome with Drink, who during the time of their Drunkenness, are compared to Mad-Folks.

                     <q>At <hi>Paris,</hi> one Morning, a hungry poor Man, begging his Alms from Door to Door, did at the last espy very good Cheer, at a Cook's House; whereat, by and by, his Teeth began to water, and the Spur of his empty and eager Stomach pricking him forwards, he made as much haste towards the place, as his feeble Feet would give him leave; where he was no sooner come, but the pleasant Smell, partly of the Meat, and partly of the Sauce, did catch such sure hold of the poor Man's Nose, that (as if he had been fast holden with a Pair of Pincers) he had no power to pass from thence, until he had (to stay the Fury of his raging Appetite) eaten a piece of Bread, which he had of Charity gotten in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: In the eating whereof his Sense was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the fresh Smell of the Cook's Cates, that albeit he did not lay his Lips to any Morsel thereof; yet in the end, his Stomach was so well satisfied with only the Smell thereof, that he plainly acknowledged himself thereby to have gotten as good a Breakfast, as if he had indeed eaten his Belly-full of the best Cheer: Which when the Cook had heard, being an egregious Wrangler, and an impudent Companion, what doth he, but all hastily steps forth to the poor Fellow, lays fast Hand upon him, and in a hot Cholerick Mood, bids him pay for his Breakfast. The honest poor Man, half amazed at this strange Demand, wist not well what to say: But the Cook was so much the more fierce and earnest, by how much he perceived the good Man to be abashed at his Boldness, and did so cunningly cloak
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57708:32"/>
the Matter, that in the end the poor Man was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to refer the deciding of the Controversie, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Person should next pass by that way, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado to abide his Judgment; which thing was no sooner concluded, but by and by cometh unto the place, a very Natural Fool, and such a notorious Idiot, as in all <hi>Paris</hi> his like was not to be found. All the better for me, thought the Cook; for more he doubted the Sentence of a wise Man, than of a Fool. Well, Sir, to this foresaid Judge they rehearsed the whole Fact, the Cook cruelly complaining, and the other patiently confessing as before: A great multitude of People were gathered about them, no less desirous to know what would follow, than wondering at that which had gone before. To conclude, this Natural perceiving, what Money the Cook exacted, caused the poor Man to put so much Money betwixt two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to shake it up and down in the Cook's hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Which done, he did arbitrate, and award, <hi>That as the poor Man was satisfied with only the Smell of the Cook's Meat, so the Cook should be recompensed only with the Noise of the poor Man's Money.</hi> Which Judgment was so commended, that who so heard the same, thought, if <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> had been there to decide the Controversie, they could not have given a more indifferent, or just Sentence.</q>
                     <p>The like Case is reported to have hapned at <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>

Another honest Man having found such a Purse, moved with Compassion, came and delivered the same to this covetous Person; who never
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57708:32"/>
thanking the Bringer, fell forthwith to telling of the Money; and finding but 20 Ducats therein, with great Greediness he exacted the odd Ducat; which because the Finder denied, he is brought before the Magistrate, a Man of very great Wealth, but of very little Wit, (but such Magistrates are many times elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where the Matter lieth in the Mouths of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:) The one Party sweareth, That there were 21 Ducats in the Purse which he lost. The other Party sweareth, That there were but 20 Ducats in the Purse which he found. The Magistrate, altho' a Fool, gives no foolish Sentence; for he pronounced, 'That the Purse which was found, was not that Purse which was lost; and therefore condemned the covetous Person to restore the 20 Ducats to the other Party.</q>

                           <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> who had taken to Wife <hi>Alix,</hi> Daughter to Duke <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and Aunt to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> conspired with <hi>Nicellus,</hi> President of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine, Ranulph</hi> Viscount of <hi>Bayon, Raimond,</hi> and divers others, suddenly to surprize the Duke, and slay him in the Night. A certain Fool (nothing regarded for his want of Wit) observing their Preparations, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly got away, and in the Dead of the Night came to <hi>Valogne,</hi> where the Duke then lay; no less slenderly guarded with Men, than the Place it self was slight for Defence: Here he continued rapping at the Gate, and crying out until it was opened, and he brought to the Presence of the Duke; to whom he declared the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, with Circumstances of such Moment, that the Duke forthwith took his Horse, and posted alone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Falais,</hi> an especial Place of Strength for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57708:33"/>
Presently after his Departure, the Conspirators came to <hi>Valogne;</hi> they beset the House, they enter by force, they search every Corner for the Duke; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Game was start, and on foot, in hot haste they pursued the Chase.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By these Reasons and Examples, therefore it may be reasonably inferred, that if a Fool do make a wise and reasonable Testament, the same ought to be allowed as lawful.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless this is the truer Opinion, that such a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament is not good; the Reason is, because a Testament is an Act to be performed with Discretion and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">

Edit. 1590.</note> But a Natural Fool, by the general Presumption of Law, doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he speaketh, tho' he seem to speak reasonably, no more than did <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass, when he reasoned with his Master, or doth a Parrot speaking to the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

                     <p>Indeed, if it may appear by sufficient Conjectures, that they had the Use of Reason, or Understanding, at such time as they did make their Testaments, then doth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Opinion take place. <hi>Decius in L.

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> In the Court of Wards, the Case was this: That <hi>Henry Bushley</hi> seized in Fee of certain<note place="margin">Mich. 12 Iac. Regis Mansfield's Case, <hi>Co. Lib.</hi> 12. f. 123, 124.</note> Lands in <hi>North-Mins,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford,</hi> by his Will, in Writing, demised the said Lands to <hi>Henry Bushley,</hi> his Son, in Tail; the Remainder to one <hi>William Bushley.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for this, that his Son was within Age, he demised the Education of him to <hi>Thomas Harrison,</hi> whom he made his Executor. And afterwards it hapned, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Son became a monstrous and deformed Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and proved an <hi>Idiot, a Nativitate:</hi> The which Idiot, by the Practice of one <hi>Nichols,</hi> and others, was ravished and taken out of the Custody of his Guardian, and was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57708:34"/>
carried upon Mens Shoulders to a Place unknown, and there kept in secret, until he had acknowledged a Fine of his Lands to one <hi>Botham,</hi> before Justice <hi>Southcot, Anno</hi> 9 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And by Indenture between them, the use of the said Fine was declared to the use of the Cognizee, and his Heirs; which <hi>Botham</hi> conveyed, <hi>Anno</hi> 12 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the said Land to one <hi>Henry Mansfield.</hi> And <hi>Anno</hi> 12 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the said <hi>Henry Bushley,</hi> the Son, by Inquisition, was found an <hi>Idiot a Nativitate;</hi> and upon this in <hi>Anno</hi> 33. the Court of Wards took Order for the Possession of the said Lands.</p>
                     <p>And it was moved, as a Doubt in the said Court of Wards, Whether the said Fine should be to the Use of the said Idiot, and his Heirs? For notwithstanding that the Fine, which is of Record, binds the Idiot for the Causes aforesaid, yet the Indentures are not sufficient to direct the Uses. But it was resolved, that forasmuch as he was enabled by the Fine,<note place="margin">Vide Co. Lib. 2. f 58. Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with's Case, &amp; Co. lib. 10. Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington's Case.</note> as to the Principal, he shall not be disabled to limit the Uses, which are but as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory.</p>
                     <p>And the same is the Law of an Infant, and Feme Covert. And the said <hi>Mansfield</hi> brought an Action of Trespass in the Common Pleas, against one <hi>Trot,</hi> the Farmer of the said Lands, and the Issue was to be tried at the Bar: And the said deformed Idiot was sent out of the Court of Wards, to be shewn to the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas, and to the Jurors there tried and sworn; and being brought upon a Man's Shoulders, the Judges hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Title of <hi>Mansfield</hi> was under the said Fine levied by that Idiot, the Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> and the Court, by Consent of Parties, caused a Juror to be withdrawn; and the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> said, That the Judge who took the Fine, was never worthy to take another: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, and altho' the monstrous Deformity, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57708:35"/>
Idiocy, of <hi>Bushley,</hi> was apparent and visible, yet the Fine stood good.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Reading, Printed Anno 1681. p. 17, 18.</note> says thus:</p>
                     <q>All Ages are within this Law, as in Folks which have Knowledge, or Men of <hi>Non Sanae Memoriae,</hi> and a Mad-man is also within this Law, as to that part of the Statute, which concerns more immediately the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King: For if any of them aforementioned in this Division, shall compass his Death, it is Treason within the first Clause; but not in the Clause of levying War: But a Man that is <hi>Surdus, coecus, &amp; mutus,</hi> is not within this Law; for it is impossible for him to have Understanding. And afterward he tells us, That <hi>I. S.</hi> after he became mad, kills the Queen; this is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">P. 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> within this Law: First, Because a Man may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit himself to be mad; and he may do it so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it cannot be discerned, whether he be mad or no. The Second is, in respect of the great Esteem that the Law gives to the Person of the King; for he is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Justice: And for the Proof of this Point, that it may be understood, we ought to see what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law was, before the making of this Statute, as to this Point; and then ought to enquire, and see how the Law is altered, since the making of the Statute; and by this means we shall find out the Law, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof: It is true, that the Law without special words, will not bind an Infant, or a Mad-man, as to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57708:54"/>
the Punishment of their Bodies; but yet it will extend to their Lands and Estates: But this our Law is no new Law, but only a declarative Law; and in that Case general words will bind an Infant, or a Mad-man, without any special words. That it was Treason at the Common Law, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent<note place="margin">Britton, f. 16. a. c. 8. &amp;c 22. f. 39. a. b. Mirror, c 2. § 11. &amp;c. 1. § 4.

                        </gap>r Felony. And so it is also in <hi>Dalton's Iustice of Peace,</hi> 206. That if a Man that is <hi>Non compos mentis,</hi> shall kill the King, this is High-Treason. Nay, <hi>Beverley</hi>'s Case goes farther, and says, That if he shall offer only to kill the King, this is High-Treason.</q>

                     <p>If a Man commit Treason, or Felony, and confesseth the same, or be thereof Convict; if afterward he<note place="margin">Co. 3 Inst. f. 4.</note> become <hi>De non sane Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, (qui patitur exilium mentis</hi>) he shall not be called to answer: Or if after Judgment he become <hi>De non sane Memorie,</hi> he shall not be executed; for it cannot be an Example to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Add to what he said before, this which follows:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Mad-man had killed, or offered to kill the King, it was holden for Treason; and so it appeareth by King<note place="margin">Co. 3 Inst. f. 6.</note>

of Treason became mad, that notwithstanding he should be executed; which cruel and inhuman Law (says he) lived not long, but was repealed: For in that Point also it was against the Common Law; because by Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law, the Execution of the Offender is for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; but so it is not, when a Mad-man is executed; but should be a miserable Spectacle, both against Law, and of extreme Inhumanity, and Cruelty, and can be no Example to others.</p>

                     <p>The Bill did suggest, that by Inquisition taken before the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> by Virtue of a Writ to him direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the said <hi>Ierome Smith</hi> was the 23d of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1664, found a <hi>Lunatick,</hi> and had <hi>Lucid Intervals,</hi> and had not sufficient Government of Himself, his Lands, and Goods; and that he was Lunatick the last of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1647; and during his Lunacy he had several Sums of Money due to him, which he had wasted, and alienated divers Goods;

but to whom, the Jurors were ignorant. And did charge, that one <hi>Archibald</hi> owed the Lunatick, during his Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 1300 <hi>l.</hi> by good Security; and that in 1656, the Defendant caused the Lunatick to assign <hi>Archibald's</hi> Debt to him, and had received the same, upon Colour of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given to the Lunatick for the same; whereas that pretended Satisfaction was not valuable, and was done in prejudice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Lunatick: And to have an Account of 1300 <hi>l.</hi> and to be relieved, was the Scope of the Bill.</p>
                     <p>The Defendant sets forth by Answer, That he sold the said <hi>Ierome Smith,</hi> in 1656, a Mannor, which he much desired to buy, at 1200 <hi>l.</hi> it being the Place of his Birth; <hi>Ierome Smith</hi> assigned <hi>Archibald's</hi> Debt for to satisfie himself the Purchase-Mony, and pay the Over-plus to <hi>Smith;</hi> which he did; and did convey the said Mannor to <hi>Smith,</hi> and insisted, that <hi>Smith</hi> was not a Lunatick at that time, and did usually buy, and sell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And tho' it was stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the Hearing, that in Case of a Lunatick, (where the King hath no Interest in his Estate, but as <hi>Pater Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi> commits him to another to manage it for him, the Lunatick, in case he recover his Senses, and Wits, shall have his Estate again; and if not, it will go to his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) the Lunatick himself (as in the Case of an Infant) ought to have been a Party: Yet that Opinion was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Judges, and by the Lord-Keeper, on a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing: But the Lord-Keeper did stay the passing that

The latter is, when a Man is delighted with it, and knowingly, and willingly, makes himself Drunk. That of Actual Drunkenness does, they say, somewhat excuse and extenuate the Fault; and consequently, there is allowed some mitigation of the Punishment: But that which is termed <hi>Habitual Drunkenness,</hi> does not at all excuse the Fault committed, nor mitigate the Punishment. And this is that which <hi>Pittacus</hi> intended, when he enacted a Law, That such a Person as should commit a Fault in a drunken Fit, should be liable to a double Punishment; one for his Drunkenness, and the other for his Ignorance: For as in the Wine there is Poyson, so in a voluntary Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance there is a heinous Offence.</p>

                     <p>1. If the Cause of such Words be Rancour, or Malice, then are they altogether to be punish'd, for that there can be no just Excuse made for them.</p>
                     <p>2. If they be spoken in a jesting manner, to make the Company merry, if it be in a fine sort delivered, it is by <hi>Aristotle</hi> held to be a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue*; but if it be in home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">In Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> and gross sort delivered, then is it accounted to be a kind of Rudeness, or Rusticity; but whether way so ever they be uttered, there is for the most part no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage taken against them; unless thereby there follow any

D. 47. 2. 50. 4.</note> that be called a Jest, or Sport, whereby a Man's good Name is hurt, or any Crime imposed upon him.</p>
                     <p>3. The like may be pronounced of such as speak hardly of any, by the Lubricity of their Tongue, or Weakness of their Brain, through Frenzy, or Drink, who for that they are not thought to speak such Words mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, pass for the most part unpunished<note n="*" place="margin">Nam &amp; personam spectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum esse, an potuerit facere, &amp; an ante quid fecerit, &amp; an cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taverit &amp; an sanae mentis fuerit, <hi>nec lubricum linguae ad poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam facile trahendum est.</hi> Quamquam ii temerarii digni poena fint, tamen ut insanis par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum est.
