            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have deſired to know of me the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why I make it a ſcruple of Conſcience
to do as others on all ſides have done, and
ſtill continue to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to intermeddle with
matters of State in my Sermons and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
I ſhall briefly let you know the grounds of my
Scruple concerning this matter, and leaving them to your
ſerious conſideration, ſuggeſt ſome impartial thoughts,
which perhaps may eaſe you of the ſcruples which you
have on the other hand; for which you think it either
unlawful for you, or unexpedient for your Auditory, to
leave intermedling in thoſe matters.</p>
            <p>Let us firſt agree what we mean by matters of State.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf, I conceive State-matters to be all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Councels, Deſignes, Endeavours and Actings which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97645:3"/>
are undertaken or proſecuted by thoſe that manage with
Power and Authority, publick Affairs, relating to the
outward Poſſeſſions, Rights, Freedoms, Priviledges, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
and Perſons of Men, as they are Members of
an outward Commonwealth or worldly Kingdom. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which matters, I think it not at all lawful for me
to interpoſe my Iudgment in the Pulpit, or to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
towards the People, farther than the Apoſtle hath
commanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to the 8, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.
and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. And the Reaſons why I conceive it not
lawful ſo to do, are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I know no Law either of God or Man, obliging
me to meddle with ſuch matters, by interpoſing my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning them in the Pulpit: and if no Law ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expreſly commanding, or by a good inference war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting
this intermedling can be ſhewed, I underſtand not
how it can be counted lawful for us ſo to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I find a Law both of God and Man forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me to judge of matters which belong not unto me,
or which particularly concern other men.</p>
            <p>The Law of God is this: <hi>Be not buſie in other mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi>
1 Pet. 4. 15. <hi>And what have I to do to judge them
that are without?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. <hi>And who art thou that
judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own Maſter he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or falleth,</hi> Rom. 14. 4. <hi>And judge not, that ye be not
judged,</hi> Mat. 7. 1. Now when I reflect upon my ſelf in
reference unto theſe Laws, my Conſcience doth tell me,
that I am not called to manage the Affairs of State, but
that they belong to other men; and therefore that I
ought not to be buſie in them, and trouble my ſelf about
them. And if I judge the Magiſtrates Employment (as
a Civil Magiſtrate) to be without the Church, I have
ſcarce ſo much, (ſure I am) no more right than St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had to judge of them, now he tells us, that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97645:3"/>
to do to judge them, but that the judgment of
thoſe that are without the Church, God hath reſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. therefore it doth not appertain
to me to meddle with them. But if as a Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
I take him to be within the Church, yet his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<hi>quatenus</hi> a Magiſtrate, is not mine, nor is he
therein my ſervant, but Chriſt's; and then the other
Rule doth take place, <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another
mans ſervant?</hi> Now the Magiſtrate is undoubtedly Gods
ſervant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. therefore I muſt let him ſtand or
fall to his own Maſter, in matters of outward govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which God hath intruſted him, and not me withal.
And in caſe I do look upon him as a Brother, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
or Deſigns as the Affairs of a private man, then
ſtill the former Rules do hold; and Chriſt doth forbid
me to judge him in publick, or to lay his faults open to
any, till I have dealt with him in private, and by degrees
brought him to the Judicature of thoſe who are his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not lawful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for me, in my private way to condemn him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I look upon him as a Brother, or not; and far leſs is
it lawful to judge him in publick, and make my ſelf an
Informer againſt him towards the Multitude, who are not
his competent Judges.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Law of God in the fifth Commandment
is, <hi>Honour thy father and mother, that thy days may be long
in the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> All
Divines have underſtood this, as well of the Reſpect due
unto the Civil Magiſtrate, as to natural Parents. Now
to take upon us to judge and cenſure their actions, or to
blaſt and blame their proceedings in publick before the
Multitude, directly or indirectly, is manifeſtly to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them; and if this is unlawful in a Son to deal ſo
with his Parents, it is alſo unlawful in a Subject to deal ſo
with his Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97645:4"/>
As for the Laws of men in this matter, I ſhall not need
to mention any, for it is evident in all Nations, that to
controul the actions of the Civil Magiſtrate, and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him in his proceedings, is a Crime puniſhable in
Subjects by thoſe that have power and are in Authority
over them, with death, impriſonment, fines or baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to the nature of the Fact, and as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Authority doth judge fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The nature of the Goſpel whereunto I am
appointed a Miniſter by Chriſt, is inconſiſtent with the
care of thoſe things wherewith I muſt intermeddle, if I
ſhould take upon me to judge of them. For the Goſpel
is the Teſtimony of Jeſus, to reveal him to the World,
and to invite all men from the Cares and Luſts of the
World, to enter into his Kingdom and Reſt; which is a
Kingdom of Truth, and not of this World, whereof the
Kingdoms are but lyes and reſtleſs vanities. If then I
account my ſelf appointed to this Employment by
Chriſt, to mind the Myſteries of his Truth; <hi>and that
wiſdom which is of God, which none of the Princes of this
World know, or as Princes of this World care for;</hi> I ought
not to apply my ſelf to intermeddle in their Affairs: and
if I ought not to do this, I conceive it is not lawful for me
to judge of their Affairs in publick, either to commend
or condemn them in the Pulpit. For Chriſt being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to employ his Authority, <hi>to cauſe one Brother to
divide the inheritance with the other,</hi> did refuſe to do it,
upon this ground, becauſe God had not appointed him a
Judge, or a Divider over men in temporal matters: the
Diſciple is not above the Maſter; and if the Maſter had
no right to meddle in ſmall matters between man and
man, what right have I to meddle in the greateſt between
State and State, or Rulers and Subjects? When Chriſt
called one of his Diſciples to follow him, and he deſired
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97645:4"/>
leave, <hi>first to go and bury his Father,</hi> Chriſt bid him, <hi>let
the dead bury their dead; but go thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and
preach the Kingdom of God.</hi> If then thoſe that are called to
preach the Kingdom of God, ought to free their minds
from the cares which through natural Affection, and a
kind of Civil Duty, ſo neerly concern themſelves and
their Kindred; how much more ought they to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed
in matters of State, which at all do not concern
them?</p>
            <p>The Cares of a quite contrary nature cannot be at once
rightly entertained in the ſame mind, they are like two
oppoſite Maſters whom none can ſerve at the ſame time
acceptably, nor at different times faithfully; therefore
he that will be Chriſt's Servant, and a faithful Soldier in
his Warfare, muſt not be intangled in the Affairs of this
Life; otherwiſe he will not be able to pleaſe him, who
hath choſen him to be a Soldier, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. Now all
the Affairs of State concern only this Life, and nothing
elſe directly and principally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The intermedling with State-matters in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
is contrary to the Rule of Preaching, and to the
true aim which ought to be maintained in the performance
of that Duty.</p>
            <p>The Rule of Preaching is, <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak
as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 11. We are warranted
to ſpeak nothing, (if we ſpeak in God's Name) but
that which is undeniably his Word; nothing can beget
Faith, and build up the Soul unto godlineſs, but the Truth
of God: if we ſpeak other matters which the Wiſdom of
earthly men, or our own Imagination or Paſſions dictate,
we profane the Ordinance of God, and deſtroy the Faith
of the Hearers. <hi>What is the chaff to the wheat, ſaith the
Lord?</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> Our own words and
dreams about temporal concernments, are leſs worth than
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97645:5"/>
Chaff; and the Faith of Profeſſors cannot ſtand in the
Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Jeſus Chriſt is the Wiſdom of God, and the Power
of God, therefore in our preaching, we ſhould <hi>determine
to know nothing amongst our hearers, but Jeſus Christ and
him crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The aim to be maintained in preaching, is to perſwade
God only and not men; and not to pleaſe men, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their ſervants, but God's alone, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. for <hi>he that
intendeth to pleaſe men, is no more the ſervant of Christ.</hi>
Now when men ſet themſelves to ſpeak of State-matters
in the Pulpit, their aim is either to pleaſe the Magiſtrates
by commending them to the people, or to ſhew their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
againſt their proceedings by reproving the ſame,
which doth tend to make the People diſpleaſed with their
Magiſtrates: Now whether the deſign be the one or the
other, it is altogether unworthy of the Miniſter of the
Goſpel; and a man cannot poſſibly mention the Affairs
of State in publick, but it muſt be either way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ought neither way to do it.</p>
            <p>And whatſoever a mans aim may be in medling thus
with State matters, as he doth no ſervice to God in it, ſo
he perverts the minds of the Hearers from the integrety
and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, to reflect upon and affect
(with reference to worldly Wiſdom) the ways of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for all State-matters are continually carried by ſome
Plots in the hands of one Party or other; and whoſoever
doth meddle with them, either to commend or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the proceedings, muſt be the ſervant of a Party,
and ſo forſakes the ſpiritual liberty and unpartiality
wherein he ought to ſtand, and whereunto he ought to
bring the minds of his Hearers, that they may be willing
to ſerve all men in love, for their ſpiritual edification,
without prejudice for Chriſt's ſake. The intereſt of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97645:5"/>
States-Men and matters, change according to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by which thoſe that manage publick Affairs find their
advantages; if the Miniſter of the Goſpel will oblige
himſelf to meddle with theſe matters, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
either to ſay and un-ſay the ſame things, if he
follow State Principles (which is to diſcredit the truth of
the Goſpel, for when men are ſway'd with carnal Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
they muſt needs make the ſame thing in their
Preaching, yea, yea, and nay, nay, (as we have found
many do of late) or if he will be inflexible and not
change his note with the times, he will be engaged into
occaſions of ſtrife and controverſies with others for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matters as oft as they change, which how inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
it is for a Miniſter of the Goſpel to do, and how
prejudicial it is unto his Profeſſion, I leave you to
judge.</p>
            <p>The ſcandals which are given againſt the Goſpel to
thoſe that are diſcerning, and perceive mens drifts in
Preaching for Intereſts, are very hanious and hurful to
the Truth, and to the Miniſtry thereof to diſcredit it:
for by this means natural men become Atheiſts, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they count all Religion nothing elſe but a cloke of
Hypocriſie: theſe practiſes ſtagger the weak alſo who are
led with blind zeal to be engaged into Faction againſt
their Brethren, and to maintain diviſions, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Churches Peace and Unity, and thereby ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
States-Men take advantages to lay ſnares before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Miniſters who have more zeale then prudence, to
entrap them, and make uſe of them for their own ends,
and then when they have made them their hackneys,
and ſerv'd their turns with them, they turn them away
with neglect and contempt at the journeys end, becauſe
they deſerve no better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97645:6"/>
Now I knowing theſe things to be the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of Miniſters intermedling with State-matters, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think it lawful for me to come within the reach of
theſe ſnares, and therefore muſt avoid the occaſions
thereof, and am willing to warn you of the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we ſee many examples before our eyes.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chief heads of Reaſons which have made
me abſtain from that way of Preaching which ſome have
followed, and, as I conceive, theſe grounds which juſtifie
my way to be unanſwerable, ſo I never could find any
ſolidity in thoſe pretences which are alledged for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
practice.</p>
            <p>For that which is pretended from <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 17 <hi>to the</hi>
22, <hi>and</hi> 33. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. That Miniſters are made Watchmen,
to give warning to the wicked, to warn them from their
wicked way; and to the Righteous alſo, that they turn
not from their Righteouſneſs, is not otherwiſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
but in cleer caſes, wherein Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is manifeſtly tranſgreſſed, and to be directed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
towards the perſons themſelves, who are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
to make them ſenſible of the guilt and danger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they ſtand. But in doubtful caſes, wherein there
is no clear word from Gods Mouth, wherein the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
actions may be miſ-interpreted; wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to walk by a juſt Rule; wherein his ſecret aim
and intenſion, by a jealouſie of State, is rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
than his Fact, and wherein he is not expreſly
dealt withal himſelf to convict his Conſcience concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Iniquity of his Proceedings to rectifie it, but is
cryed out upon before others, and cenſured before the
multitude, who are not his competent Judges, (which
is the practice of thoſe that in the Pulpits have medled
and do meddle with State-matters): I ſay in ſuch caſes,
and in ſuch a way of proceeding, no colour can be taken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97645:6"/>
from the Watch-Office of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> to warrant it: for
look upon the Charge which he doth receive, and the
way how he is to diſcharge it, and you will ſee that your
practice is nothing like it. The Charge is, That the
<hi>Watch-man ſhould hear the word at Gods mouth, and give
the houſe of Iſrael warning from God,</hi> ver. 17. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
an expreſs Commandment, and a clear tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Commandment, in thoſe that are to be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and a peculiar Miſſion from God to give the warning:
The way how this warning is to be given to the Wicked
and to the Righteous, is by a particular Addreſs, which
the Watch-man was to make as from God unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
immediately. If the Miniſters that meddle with
State-matters will obſerve theſe Rules, far be it from me
to condemn them; but if their arguing againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of thoſe that are in places of Authority, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it approaching unto this way, then I muſt be
diſpenſed from following it; and I think it my duty to
diſcover the irregularity of it, by teſtifying againſt it. If
men will make themſelves, through State-jealouſies and
evil Surmiſes againſt thoſe that manage publick Affairs,
Watchmen over their Rulers, when they are divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves for State-intereſts, for the advantage of
one Party, to blaſt and diſcredit another, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that they diſcharge the Watch-Office which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them, I ſhall leave them to anſwer it to the
chief Shepherd of the Flock; for it becometh not me to
judge another mans Servants, farther than by putting
them in mind of the Commands of their Maſter, which
are undeniably his known Will.</p>
            <p>But from the Contemplation of the Watch-mans Office
over the Souls of the Flock, and their obligation to give
an account thereof unto God, there is an Objection and
Doubt which may be raiſed, thus: But what if I ſee my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97645:7"/>
Flock like to be led away (by the example of thoſe that
are in Authority, or the inſtigation of thoſe that have
Power) unto wicked and unjuſt courſes, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to the true Religion, and the ſafety of the State;
ſhall I not warn them of the danger in this caſe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
Yes, you are bound to forewarn them of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which you think they are like to fall into, if the thing
be evident and clearly a tranſgreſſion of God's will; I ſay,
you are bound to forewarn as well thoſe that by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and power led others out of the way, as thoſe
that are led by them. Thus in caſes of Idolatry and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
the Prophets did addreſs themſelves directly to
the Rulers of the people? they ſhewed them the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Commandment of God, and their undeniable Practice
oppoſite unto it, and in a caſe which evidently doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the truth of Religion, and endanger the ſafety of the
State; the Fact it ſelf, and the unrighteouſneſs thereof,
is to be laid open before all, from the Word of God, and
all are to be warned of the dangerous conſequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which may be done in <hi>Theſi,</hi> leaving the <hi>Hpotheſis</hi>
and particular application to every mans judgment, to
diſcharge his Conſcience towards God therein; but now
we have ſeen men that accuſe thoſe whom they would
diſcredit before the Multitude, not to meddle with the
matter in <hi>Theſi,</hi> but with the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of their own
coyning, upon conjectural appearances, charging Faults
ſuſpiciouſly, and by way of inſinuation, whereupon a
ſtrict examination none were to be found. He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
upon the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of a matter, to charge ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with the guilt thereof, doth evidently ſhew that his
aim is is not ſo much to rectifie the fault, as to make him
odious, whom he chargeth with it; but he that handleth
the <hi>Theſis</hi> of a matter, doth it to inſtruct and warn all
Men of their Duty, that they may look to their ways.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97645:7"/>
They that were uſed to Preach of late at Court, for
the generality calculate their Sermons for the Humour
of the Prince, and lie digging for Texts in Holy Writ, on
purpoſe to uphold ſome State-Intereſt; which, it may be
certainly alledged, the <hi>Sacred Author</hi> never had ſo much
as in his thoughts: and all this meerly for Church-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.
And ſuch a one was that Parſon, who to pleaſe
the Humour of the Times, undertaking to prove the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Monarchy, took his Text out of <hi>Judges</hi> 17.
<hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in Iſrael.</hi> And
by this means they make themſelves ridiculous: For there
is always ſuch an unlucky Fate attends that ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which are called <hi>Buſie-bodies,</hi> and Medlers with other
Concerns than their own, that they are deſpicable even in
common Converſation, much more in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p>There is another pretence taken to colour this practice,
from the Commandments which the Apoſtle doth give
to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus: Them that ſin, rebuke before all,</hi>
1 Tim. 5. 20. <hi>Be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove,
rebuke, exhort,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 4. 2. And, <hi>Rebuke them
ſharply,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 13. and ſuch-like.</p>
            <p>But, I conceive, that all theſe Directions are given to
Paſtors, only in reference to thoſe that are immediately
under the Paſtoral Charge in clear Caſes, wherein they
are to deal with the Parties themſelves immediately: it is
therefore a great miſtake, to apply them unto other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are not under their Paſtoral charge, and in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which are Myſteries of State, and not obvious to the
cognizance of every one, and which are handled, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the parties themſelves, but before others who are
not capable to judge thereof, as the common people
are. If we look to that which Chriſt did in this way of
reproof towards the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. we
ſhall ſee how theſe reproofs ought to be managed. Firſt,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97645:8"/>
it may be obſerved, that Chriſt came not to this ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with them till towards the latter end of his Miniſtry,
after that he had in all probability dealt many times
with them in a milder way, to make them ſenſible of their
Duty: For it is ſaid of him, that he did not break
the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax, that he
did not ſtrive, nor cauſed his voice to be heard in the
ſtreets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 19, 20. whence we muſt conclude, that
he never at firſt dealt with any man ſharply, but gently
always, but when he found theſe Scribes and Phariſees
incorrigible, then leſt the people might be ſeduced by
their practiees, he doth give them a neceſſary warning
to preſerve them from being perverted by the example
of their Leaders, and reproves the open faults of their
Leaders, in clear Caſes convincingly before them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he doth it in ſuch a way which is without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
For he doth not intend to diſcredit them in
their places, or blaſt their Authority towards the people,
but eſtabliſheth it, commanding the People to hearken
to them as they ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them not behind their back to the People, but
to their faces in the preſence of the People. And laſtly,
he inſiſts upon particular matters of Fact, which were
undeniable, wherein he not only diſcovers their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
to convince them of it, but ſhews them the Duty
which ought to be done; and warns them of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is to come upon them if they neglect it.
Now if the Miniſters that meddle with State-affairs in
the Pulpit would obſerve this way and method; their
practice would be free from all exceptions; for if they
can deal with thoſe that manage publick Affairs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
that which they find oppoſite to Chriſtianity,
and amiſs in them, firſt, by way of Counſel in private;
and if afterward finding that private Admonitions profit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97645:8"/>
not, but that they perſevere in a courſe of State-hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
to endanger the ſalvation of others, whom they
may ſeduce by their example from the ſincerity of the
Holy Profeſſion: if (I ſay) in ſuch a caſe without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to their juſt Authority, they can deal roundly and
openly with them, to convince of the perverſneſs of
their way, and to reclaim them from the errours thereof,
this would not only be warrantable, but commendable:
but how far this is intended by any, I leave to you to
judge; and to the conſcience of thoſe that handle State-matters
in their Sermons to determine between God and
themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for that which ſome ſay, that Men muſt not be
luke-warm Neutraliſts, but zealous in the Cauſe of God
and for the Publick good. I anſwer it is ſo; but we muſt
alſo take heed, that we miſtake not the Cauſe of God,
and that we make not our own partial Aims and private
Intereſts, that which we call God's Cauſe: let God's
Cauſe be ſtated as it relates to the Goſpel of Chriſt, let
it be handled in <hi>Theſi &amp; Antitheſi,</hi> as it reflects upon the
Conſcience of all Men by the manifeſtation of the Truth;
and let no perſonal Reproches, Inſinuations, Reflexions,
and particular Worldly matters, to aſperſe any body, be
mixed with it; and let it be held forth with all Spiritual
Fervency from the Word; and ſo let it be recommended
to Gods Bleſſing upon the hearts of the Hearers; but let
us not call our own contrivements Gods Cauſe, nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Paſſions raiſed upon Jealouſies or Diſcontents, Zeal.
Do we not ſee evidently that no party doth count any
thing a publick good, but that which is for its own way:
and that all its Zeal and Strength is ſpent, nor ſo much to
advance the Intereſt, as to ſet up it ſelf over the adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and to caſt down every thing which is not for its own
Intereſt: This is evidently all the Zeal of theſe times,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97645:9"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtrive for power over others; and then to act by
meer will according to power, againſt all that are found
or ſuſpected to be oppoſites. And if not to be active in
this way of partiality, or puft up for the Intereſt of one
againſt another, to have the Rule, be counted to be a
luke-warm Neutraliſt, I ſhall confeſs my ſelf to be one
of theſe, and yet I hope I ſhall never be found a Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
before God in his Cauſe, nor luke-warm toward the
way of Truth and Peace, which is without Partiality and
without Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>And as it ill becomes the Miniſtry to talk like Polititians
and States-men in their Pulpits, ſo is it a thing altogether
as undecent, to ſee ſo many Preachers of the Goſpel haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and crowding the Parliament-Lobbies, and Anti-Chambers
of publick Lay-Aſſemblies, whiſpering here,
and buzzing there, and as buſie as Bees. As if the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs of the Nation could not be managed, without
their having an Oar in the Boat. And yet no Rational
Man can give any good Reaſon, why thoſe <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi>
ſhould be ſo buſie and active in ſuch places as thoſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be to ſide with, or make Parties, and to beſpeak
Friends for the carrying on ſuch or ſuch an Intereſt:
which how ill it becomes them, they themſelves well
know, only they follow the Deteriora. It would be a
piece of Ill Manners, for them to believe that the Lords
and Gentlemen now convened together, will not be as
careful of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as they can be: Nor
can they be thought to want their Directions. But if
they hover and brood over their own worldly Intereſts
and Advantages, 'tis an unſeaſonable Piece of double Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
as if they could not confide in the Wiſdom of
thoſe Perſons whom the Nation has made choice of in this
Exigence of Affairs, without their Intermedling and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
their Debates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97645:9"/>
The Clergy of <hi>England</hi> cannot but be deeply ſenſible,
how wide a Gaſh the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> lately received
in this Kingdom, and how that both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are now met to ſoader up the Wound; what will
the World then think, when they ſhall be the firſt that
give the Interruption to ſo good a Work? The Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men
had moſt reaſon of all others, to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Invaſions made upon their Priviledges and
Properties, by their being turn'd out of their Colledges,
while Popery began to ſit triumphant in the very
UNIVERSITIES of the Nation; and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
commanded to read a <hi>Declaration,</hi> to the Violation
of their Conſciences. And is it fair for them to be the
firſt that Quarrel, who are the firſt who receive the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Application? Or are they willing to undergo
the ſame Severities again, till at length they are Outed
out of All?</p>
            <p>The Clergy have the greateſt Advantage in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that if they happen to be diſguſted at any thing,
they preſently get up into their Pulpits, and in a State-Sermon
ring the Bells backward, and then their Party
come in. But at ſuch an unſeaſonable time as this, when
<hi>Ireland</hi> lies a bleeding, when there was never more need
of Union, when the laſt Efforts of a ſtrugling Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
our utmoſt Oppoſition, it looks as if they had no
ſence of the Danger; that they from whom it was leaſt
expected, ſhould be the firſt Obſtructors of all that is
offered to ſecure both them and us: or at leaſt, that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Slavery are no ſuch formidable things to ſome,
who are now under another Profeſſion, as it is and ever
will be to ſuch <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as are endued with a perfect
love of Truth. Certain it is, that the Gentlemen of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> are not ſo bigotted to their <hi>Paſſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi>
but that they can lay it aſide, in a Concern
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97645:10"/>
that touches their own Copyhold, as they did by their
Refuſal to read the <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience;</hi>
which makes it the leſs conſiſtent with any Reaſon, why
they ſhould be ſo ſqueamiſh in the <hi>Grand Affair</hi> of the
Kingdom. For where the Religion of a Nation lies at
ſtake, it will be tranſmitted to Poſterity as a very unkind
Contention, to trouble the Progreſs of National Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Diſputes about the ſignifications of Words.
Good Authority has laid this down for a Maxim, <hi>That
Princes, from the time that they begin to break the Laws,
and thoſe ancient Manners and Cuſtoms, under which the
People have been long govern'd, begin to loſe their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strada <hi>ſpeaking of the Revolt of the</hi> Low Countries
<hi>from the King of</hi> Spain, It is not to be queſtioned, <hi>ſays he,</hi>
but that ſame Liberty to which the People has been for a
long time accuſtomed, if there be any Attempt to alter or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
it, occaſions fatal Commotions. <hi>And Sir</hi> Thomas
Smith <hi>tells us,</hi> That it is the Parliament which gives Form
of Succeſſion to the Crown. <hi>Beſides, that the words of</hi>
Henry <hi>the Forth, King of</hi> France, <hi>in</hi> Thuanus, <hi>were theſe:</hi>
Legis non Regis eſſe de regni Succeſſione decernere.</p>
            <p>Theſe therefore being the Maxims of Secular Politicks,
conformable to the Laws and Statutes of the Land, and
the Conceſſions of great Princes themſelves, and ſuch
things wherein the Clergy have nothing to do to meddle,
it is ſo much the more to be wondered at, that any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
among them ſhould be ſet on foot to interrupt the
intended Proviſions for the future Security of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>True it is, that it was a general Refreſhment, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
revived the drooping Spirits of the Nation, to
ſee the conſtant Firmneſs of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
in their Refuſal to read the King's Declaration,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97645:10"/>
and their ſtedfaſt adhering to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and the reſt of thoſe worthy Suffragans, who led
them the way, and confirmed them by their noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Never were perſons in their eminent ſtation, ſo
generally bewayl'd upon their Commitment, nor ever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
with louder Acclamations, or a more univerſal Joy
for their Acquittal. Story will immortalize the Glory
of that Action to all Poſterity. For indeed they may be
ſaid to have given the firſt Check to the Inſulting Power
of Popery at <hi>White-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe Honours it cannot be ſaid, but that the reſt of
the Miniſtry that mov'd in a lower Orb, had gain'd a great
ſhare; and it was hoped that they would have continu'd
under the ſame Conduct that inſpir'd them with their firſt
Reſolutions. But it was not without the ſorrow and
perplexity of many, to obſerve that Harmony of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and Agreement of Reſolution, tending ſo much to
the Good of the Nation, diſturb'd by the moody diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of ſome men that ſeem'd to ſtudy more the Intereſt
of the Common Enemy, than the Publick Welfare.
There is no queſtion to be made, but that the Enemies of
our Religion and Liberties, would be the moſt joyful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the World, to ſee that there were among our ſelves
any People ſo much their kind Friends, as to kindle Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
among thoſe Worthy Patriots who are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
the Settlement of the Nation upon the laſting
Foundations of Peace and Safety. But it would ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thoſe who have acted hitherto ſo much to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Kingdom, to be the firſt that ſhould ſave
our Enemies the labour, and blow up thoſe Flames that
ſhould put us into new Conflagrations, and diſturb that
Great Work which is now carrying on to Reſtore this
Nation to its ancient Luſter and Grandeur. All men
know that Relapſes are worſe than the Diſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97645:11"/>
But for thoſe that ſhould be the <hi>Samaritans</hi> that
ſhould pour Balſam into our Wounds, to feſter the mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scars with new Corroſives, is ſo far from ſavouring of
Chriſtianity, that Morality would be aſhamed of it.
Beſides, that it would be a Preſumption in acting as it
were againſt Heaven, by going about to diſturb what
Providence has hitherto ſo fairly brought about; which
certainly could never happen from the Miniſtry, if they
were kept within the bounds of their Function, and not
deviate from the Precepts of their Lord and Maſter.</p>
