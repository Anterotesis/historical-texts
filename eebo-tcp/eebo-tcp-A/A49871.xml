            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BLessed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is not without the greatest Reason prefix'd in the Front of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrine, which
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:39067:3"/>
in the Greatness of the Majesty of Love, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to us by our Blessed Master, from the Mountain of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Wherefore the Opposite hereof is most True: and there must certainly be a Wo unto those who are Rich in Spirit, because theirs cannot be the Kingdom of Heaven. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that a <hi>Poor Spirit</hi> is at this day so
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:39067:3"/>
much Ridicul'd, and is even Proverbially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who call themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> and Profess themselves the Disciples of <hi>IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS,</hi> who was so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently Poor in his Spirit, above all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>; yet the Wisdom of God which runs counter to that of Man, and Charges his Prudence with Folly,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:39067:4"/>
will have that to be Honour'd, which he has Dishonour'd: and will have that to be Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd which he has most of all Honour'd, and Prided himself in. For that Poverty of Spirit which is the Scorn, the Contempt, and Offscouring of the World, in the Day when God will bind up his Jewels, will be made the Glory, the Crown
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:39067:4"/>
and the Kingdom, to as many as shall have followed the Steps of their Master in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
            <p>We find that at this time the many Bodies and Societies of the, so nominated, Religions, do all fall in with the Laodiceans, saying, We are Rich; but the True and Faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may shortly let them see that they are
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:39067:5"/>
Poor, and will cause their Spiritual Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to cry out, <hi>Alas! alas! in one hour so great Riches are come to nought.</hi> And then shall the Poor Spirited <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphians,</hi> that are now a despised Handful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the rest, who have indeed but <hi>a little Strength,</hi> and confess it, be known to be the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having stood out
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:39067:5"/>
the <hi>Hour of Temptation,</hi> and <hi>kept</hi> the Living <hi>Word</hi> of God; not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> his Name, Power and Spirit, nor taking or bearing it in Vain.</p>
            <p>The true Poverty of <hi>spirit</hi> is the <hi>primary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi> for <hi>reading,</hi> as of the most Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so also of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Treatise, now given to the <hi>World</hi> from the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi>; and is the very

to have arrived to Perfection, and so visibly distinguishing themselves from all the rest, and said; Now surely the Anointed of the Lord is before him. But a Voice said, Neither are these they; for the Lord seeth not as Man seeth: No Formal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall henceforth be in the everlasting Church of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">§. 6. And it was farther shewn me, that as <hi>David</hi> was one of the Seven, yet least of all set by, or accounted of, so it will be also in the matter of the Anointed Church. For the Spirit of <hi>David,</hi> who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Abraham</hi> the Spirit of

Faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Love, and Meekness, as the Type of Heart-Perfection; (which though it be of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but lieth obscure and hid, yet the Holy One will find out such to be the Blossoming Root to precede <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Day) will bring forth a blessed Offspring, whose Train shall be lifted up to the Throne; where no more Types, or Shadows, or Forms shall be. For all of this kind shall flee away, and dye: no corrupt Figure can stand with the Lamb upon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> For to such a Celestial Degree will the Seventh be Anointed, for the Tabernacle-Church, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form but God and the Lamb shall be therein seen, or understood.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. And it was evidently Revealed to me, that this great Mystery is upon the Agitation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39067:17"/>
now in this very time: And it was thus cleared to me. That as <hi>David</hi> in his Minority was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and Anointed in a secret hidden way by the Prophet of the Lord, yet as to the outward possession of the Kingdom for a considerable time, was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; <hi>Saul</hi> keeping up his Reign, and <hi>David</hi> not regarded, or the least looked upon in that Capacity; but the Counsel of the Lord must not by Man be overthrown. For the Election upon the Holy Seed shall for ever stand, and God will bring it forth as a Rising-Sun; upon which shall be no Cloud of the Fall.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. And it was given me to see, how this Church would be gathered, which should proceed as Stars in the Right hand of the Head-Shepherd. And as it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39067:18"/>
was thus typified out by a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Woman that brought forth <hi>CHRIST</hi> after the figure of an Humane Body, as the Rock which the Apostolical Church was built upon. So likewise, according to <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Prophecy, a Virgin Woman is designed of a pure Spirit, and of a bright Sun-like Body, all impregnated with the Holy Ghost, that shall travail to bring forth the First-born, that will multiply and propagate into such a Body, as shall be filled with the Spirit, Power, and Temple-Glory of the Lamb of God. This is the Church that shall be call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39067:18"/>
Nations shall be brought in, so that the Increase of his Priestly Kingdom will be very great. And then shall all these Churches afore-mentioned, give up, out of them, those precious lively Stones, which have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from excluded under the covert of a Form. No Bonds, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Powers there will be, no partition Walls: all these shall fall flat by <hi>Sion</hi>'s everlasting Trumpets; For the Holy U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Objection.</hi> It may be objected that true it is, such a Glorious Church will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but for the present we do see no such thing; therefore we

may hold in with those Formal Ministrations that are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent, among the highest of those Degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> As to this receive what the Most Holy One hath made known unto me: That though this Real Mount <hi>Sion</hi> Church, made up of <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is not known in Visibility, yet at present it may lie hid at this present time in the Womb of the Morning Sun. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Spirit that is overshadowed with the Holy Ghost in order hereunto, is in the Wilderness, where for a time she must be in Concealment. The last Half Time is now upon expiring. Then, O ye who shall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, worthy to be called out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of that state which is in Confusion, Darkness and Formality, upon whom the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39067:19"/>
of the Lamb will be poured forth, Arise, come ye forth, and return to <hi>Sion,</hi> being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from this long Captivity and Bondage under which ye have groaned. Even also amongst those that judge themselves near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est come up to the Apostolical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, there will be a shaking, and great Frustration. Their Sun of Righteousness will be clouded as in a Mist, and they will see their Light was too short by many Degrees, of what the Virgin Daughter is upon the travel for, and which will be brought forth in this present Age.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. As therefore I received this Caution from him, who saith, Behold I come quickly; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and clarified into the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Then was it cast up in my Mind how little Appearance there was of such a State at this Time. And Liberty of Speech being granted me, I Queried with my Lord, how frequently from the beginning of the Creation Sin had reign'd even unto this time, and that though the Promise of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was given immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fall, yet Sin had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from the First <hi>Adam</hi> unto the Second, albeit there were Holy Men, Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who were rais'd up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, who had a Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of all the good things of this Thorough Redemption in Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Then did I plead, that when he came, and was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Flesh, it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

that there should have been then a perfect Renovation and Restauration, such as had been so long Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it troubled me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much, as a most marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing, that after all these Prophesies and Promises, and long Expectations, he should be rejected even by that Church and People which God had most peculiarly chosen and set a part for himself, and even by those of them who were the strictest, and most Religious.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. All this with much more I did propose to the Father of my Spirit, and to the Eternal Virgin Mother. Where upon it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me, That it was of great acceptation that I had made search into this Matter, which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39067:59"/>
few or none had deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd of, and which was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be understood; for that in it lay a great Mystery, which was to be open'd in its season and time. Then was it further said, That God did well know that so many Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were thus to pass away, before the Perfect Redemption should be finish'd, as to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality. Yet it was given me to understand that Christ in all Ages was still gathering to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self some who were perfected, as the Foundation and Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Blessed Church; whom he took care of both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Death for their Compleatment, to be joined to him. Then was I bid not to sorrow as without hope, but that there would be even in this present Time a New Springing Generation, that should be as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:39067:59"/>
the First-Born from the Dead, and carry the Marks of Christ's Resurrection, being redeem'd from the Earth, and from Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, into the Number of the Hundred and Forty Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.

to the Dead, that were to be Born again. Their Message was Peace, Love and Good Will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that will into this New Born Church come in.

At the same time as I was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Seven Angel Messengers sent forth, many did furiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, and make War against this City, but were repell'd by the Strength of the said Circle.

               <p n="10">§. 10. Then it was moved in me to make a Query to the Virgin Wisdom, that had open'd in me all this great Mystery of the Church, <hi>Whether it were necessary for this Body to be gather'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally into one Place, for cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation together</hi>?

For till such a time as this Earth shall be chang'd into a Paradisical Nature and Property, the course of things mustrun after the manner of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity, both as to Feeding and Cloathing. Then was it further given me to understand, that though we cannot be at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in one Family or Place,

yet we are to be of one Principle, one Light, one Love, and one Faith, and one in all the excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of Wisdom, Humility, Meekness, Fortitude, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Temperance, and other Fruits of the Spirit, which are the Golden Chain by which we are link'd together; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to be out of the Unity and Harmony of this blessed Church.</p>
