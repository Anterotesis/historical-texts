            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Have we not an equal intereſt with the men of this Nation, in thoſe liberties and ſecurities contained in the Petition of Right, and other the good Lawes of the Land? are any of our lives, limbs, liberties, or goods to be taken from us more then from Men, but by due proceſſe of Law, and conviction of twelve ſworn men of the Neighbourhood?</p>
            <p>And can you imagine us to be ſottiſh or ſtupid, as not to perceive, or not to be ſencible when daily thoſe ſtrong defences of our Peace and wellfare are broken down, and trod under-foot by force and arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>Would you have us keep at home in our houſes, when men of ſuch faithfulnes and integrity as the FOUR PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONERS our freinds in the <hi>Tower,</hi> are ſetcht out of their beds, and forced out of their houſes by Souldiers, to the affrighting and undoing of themſelves, their wives, children, and families? Are not our husbands, or ſelves, our children and families by the ſame rule, as lyable to the like unjuſt cruelties as they?</p>
            <p>Shall ſuch men as Capt. <hi>Bray</hi> be made cloſe priſoners, and ſuch as Mr. <hi>Sawyer</hi> ſnatcht up and carryed away, beaten and buffected at the pleaſure of ſome Officers of the Army; and ſuch as Mr. <hi>Blanck</hi> kept cloſe Priſoner, and after moſt barbarous uſage be forced to run the Gantlop, and be moſt ſlave-like and cruelly whipt; and muſt we keep at home in our houſes, as if we, our lives and liberties and all, were not concerned.</p>
            <p>Nay ſhall ſuch valiant religious men as Mr. <hi>Robert Lockeyer</hi> be lyable to Law Martiall, and be judged by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and moſt unhumanly ſhot to death? <hi>Shall the blood of War</hi> be ſhed in time of Peace? Doth not the word of God expreſly condemn it? Doth not <hi>the Petition of Right</hi> declare, <hi>That no-perſon ought to be judged by Law Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (except in time of War) and that all Commiſſions given to execute Martiall Law in time of Peace, are contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of the Land?</hi> Doth not Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke</hi> in his chapter of Murder, in the third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> hold it for good Law (and ſince acknowledged by this Parliament) <hi>That for a Generall, or other Officers of an Army in time of Peace, to put any man (although a Souldier) to death by colour of Martial Law, it is abſolute murther in that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall?</hi> And hath it not by this Houſe in the caſe of the late Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> been adjudged high Treaſon? And are we Chriſtians, and ſhall we ſit ſtill and keep at home, while ſuch men as have born continuall teſtimony againſt the unjuſtice of all times, and unrighteouſnes of men be pickt out and be delivered up to the ſlaughter, and yet muſt we ſhew no ſence of their ſufferings, no tendernes or affections, no bowels or companion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> bear any teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo abominable cruelty and injuſtice?</p>
            <p>Have ſuch men at theſe continually hazarded their lives, ſpent their eſtates and time, loſt their liberties, been as a Guard by day, and as a Watch by night; and when for this they are in trouble and greateſt danger, perſecuted and hated even to the death; and ſhould we be ſo baſely ungratefull, as to neglect them in the day of their affiction? No, far be it from us: Let it be accounted folly, preſumption, madnes, or whatſoever in us, whilſt we have life and breath, we will never leave them, nor forſake them, nor ever ceaſe to importune you (having yet ſo much hopes of you, as of the unjuſt Judge mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 18. to obtain Juſtice, if not for Juſtice ſake, yet for Importunity,) or to uſe any other means for the enlargment and reparation of thoſe of them that are leſt alive; and for juſtice againſt ſuch as have been the cauſe of Mr. <hi>Lockiers</hi> death: Nor will we ever reſt until we have prevailed, that We, our huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Friends, and Servants, may not be liable to be abuſed, violated, and butchered at mens Wills and pleaſures. But if nothing will ſatisfy but the bloud of thoſe juſt men, thoſe conſtant undanted Aſſerters of the Peoples free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms will ſatisfy your thirſt, drink alſo, and be glutted with our bloud, and let us all fall together: Take the blood of one more, and take all: ſlay one, ſtay all.</p>
            <p>And therefore again, we entreate you to review our laſt Petition in behalf of our friends above mentioned, and not to ſlight the things therein contained, becauſe they are preſented unto you by the weake hand of Weomen, it being an uſuall thing with God, by weak meanes to work mighty effects: For we are no whit ſatisfied with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you gave unto our Husbands and Friends, but do equally remaine lyable to thoſe ſnares laid in your Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which maketh the Abetters, of the Book laid to our Freinds charge, no leſſe then Traytors, when as hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcourſe can be touching the affairs of the preſent times, but falls within the compaſſe of that Book: So that all liberty of Diſcourſe is thereby utterly taken away, then which there can be no greater ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we be ſatisfied; how ever you deal with our Friends, except you free them from under their preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudicall impriſonment and force upon them, and give them full Reparations for their forceable Attachment, &amp;c. And leave them from firſt to laſt, to be proceeded againſt by due Proceſſe of Law, and give them reſpect from you, anſwerable to their good and faithfull Service to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Our houſes being made worſe then Priſons to us, and our Lives worſe then death; the fight of our Husbands and Children, matter of grief, ſorrow, and affliction to us, until you grant our deſires, and therefore, if ever you intend any good to this miſerable Nation, harden not your hearts againſt Petitioners, nor deny us in things ſo evidently juſt and reaſonable, as you would not be diſ-honourable to all Poſterity.</p>
