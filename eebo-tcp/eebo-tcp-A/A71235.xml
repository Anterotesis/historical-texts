         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PAMPHLET
ENTITULED,
SPECULUM ECCLESIASTICUM:
OR, AN
Eccleſiaſtical Proſpective-Glaſs, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere can be no greater Argument of a baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
and erroneous Cauſe, than when the
Aſſertors of it are forced to maintain it
with manifeſt Impoſtures. The Religion
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
owing to Legends and Forged Writings: With the
firſt they deluded the vulgar; and with the ſecond, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented
the wiſer part of mankind. The Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was never ſubmitted to, nor its
Primacy believed in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> till the ſpurious Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of <hi>Iſidore Mercator</hi> were univerſally received by a
blind and ignorant Age, and believed to be the genuine
Decrees of Ancient Popes. No ſooner did Learning
begin to flouriſh in the laſt Age, but theſe Phantaſms
diſappeared, were decried, and diſowned by all learned
and ingenuous men. To produce them anew upon the
ſtage, and urge the Authority of them in this learned
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39357:3"/>
age, can be no other than the laſt efforts of a deſpairing
and dying Cauſe, which wanteth both Reaſon and Truth
to uphold it. To recur to theſe Forgeries, after the
falſeneſs and folly of them hath been detected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
by learned men of both Communions; is
an invincible Argument, that the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was at firſt founded on them, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now be maintain'd without them.</p>
            <p>It may juſtly be wondred, that men whoſe office and
deſign it is to uphold the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and perſwade others of the truth of it, ſhould make uſe
of ſuch artifices, as will infallibly, when diſcovered,
make all ſober men ſuſpect her Cauſe of falſeneſs, and
accuſe her Agents of diſhoneſty. Yet this hath been
lately done by ſome Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
in a little Pamphlet, called <hi>Speculum Eccleſiaſticum,</hi> or an
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Proſpective-Glaſs;</hi> wherein all the Ancient
Forgeries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are reproduced, and
alledged as undoubted Teſtimonies of Antiquity. An
Impoſture ſo groſs and palpable, that if unadviſedly
committed, the Ignorance of this Author muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable;
if voluntarily, his Fraud muſt be deteſtable.
Such miſerable deluſions are unfitly calculated for our
Age, and can ſerve for no other end, than for what
they were at firſt invented, to amuſe Children, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
weak people.</p>
            <p>The Author divideth his <hi>Proſpective-Glaſs</hi> into eight
Parts or Columes; and in them undertaketh to prove
the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from Scripture,
and the Teſtimonies of the Fathers of the Church for
the firſt 500 years. The proofs of Scripture I ſhall not
conſider, becauſe they are either wholly impertinent, or
have been often anſwered by the Writers of our Church;
and upon the Teſtimonies of Antiquity, I will only make
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:39357:3"/>
ſome few Obſervations: For ſo idle a Paper deſerves not
a ſtrict and ſevere Anſwer.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Column</hi> of our Adverſary treateth of the
Churches continued Succeſſion, and the tradition of all
Chriſtian Doctrines through all Ages of the Church.
This might well have been ſpared, and concerns no more
the Church of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me,</hi> than it doth any other particular
Church. In the Church of <hi>England</hi> we have a Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Biſhops continued down from the Apoſtolick times
to this day. The nomination or particular enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, is neither neceſſary nor uſeful. None will
deny the Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi>
to have enjoyed a continued Series of Biſhops from the
Apoſtles times; yet are the names of the far greater
part of them unknown. Neither is the Succeſſion of
the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> certain and undoubted. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are at this day unknown.
<hi>Linus</hi> moſt probably died before him. <hi>Cletus</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus</hi>
were moſt certainly the ſame perſon. In ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages many great and long Schiſms happened, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two, and ſometimes three Popes together pretended
to the Papal Chair, whoſe right was ſo dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
that <hi>Wernerus Rolluinck</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Faſcic. Temp.</note> profeſſeth, moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſcientious men could not diſcern to which
party they ought to adhere. And at this day, the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Writers agree not in compoſing a
Catalogue of Popes; the firſt placing divers among the
Popes, which the ſecond reject as Antipopes. No other
eminent See of the Catholick Church hath ſuffered theſe
diviſions: So that the Succeſſion of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>
is more doubtful and uncertain than any other Succeſſion
of Biſhops in the World. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> indeed, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi>
and <hi>Optatus,</hi> alledged by this Writer, diſputing
againſt the Hereticks, object to th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m that they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:39357:4"/>
men of yeſterday, who could not deduce their
Succeſſion from the Apoſtles; whereas their Catholicks
had a viſible Succeſſion of Biſhops preſiding in their
Churches from the Apoſtles times: and to prove this,
produce the Succeſſion of <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, not as of ſo
many Heads of the Univerſal Church, but as of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of the moſt eminent See of the Weſtern Church.
For the force of their Argument lay not in the particular
Succeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, but in the ſeveral Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
of all the Catholick Biſhops of the Univerſal
Church; of which they produced that of <hi>Rome</hi> as an
example. This appears plainly from the words of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
who prefixeth this Preface to his Catalogue of
<hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops: <hi>Seeing it is too much to reckon up the
Succeſſion of all Churches, I will instante only in that
of</hi> Rome: As for Succeſſion of Doctrine, we may with
far greater juſtice claim that, than do our Adverſaries.
For the Church of <hi>England</hi> admitteth, receiveth, and
believeth all Doctrines which have been univerſally
taught and delivered down by all Churches in all Ages;
and propoſeth none to her Children as neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
which have not that univerſal teſtimony: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> commandeth ſeveral Doctrines to
be believed upon pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> which were unknown
to Antiquity, and are at this day denied by the greater
part of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <hi>Column</hi> of the Unity of the Church, is
of the ſame ſtamp. We, no leſs firmly, than our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
believe the <hi>Catholick Church to be one:</hi> We
willingly allow that there is no hope of Salvation out of
the Pale of that Church, and have always aſſerted Schiſm
to be a damnable ſin. But that the particular Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in Communion with the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> is
that Univerſal Church; that a ſmall and corrupt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39357:4"/>
of it is the whole; and that all Churches not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> are Schiſmatical;
this we neither believe, nor can our Adverſaries prove:
Certainly all the teſtimonies here alledged inſinuate no
ſuch thing. But if Schiſm be ſo great a ſin, if wilful
and unneceſſary Separation from any part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church be damnable; What ſhall we ſay of thoſe
perſons, whoſe office and employment it is to promote
and foment this Schiſm, and draw the Members of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> into an unlawful ſeparation from her?
To accuſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> of Schiſm or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is to go contrary to ſenſe and
reaſon: For 'tis notorious to the whole World, that all
the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> communicated with our Church
till the 10th year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> when upon the
Pope's prohibition, a ſmall party flew off into ſeparate
Aſſemblies, who have ſince continued their ſeparate
Meetings under the name of <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> And
ſhall the Church of <hi>England</hi> be ſaid to have ſeparated
from thoſe men? This cannot be ſaid with any colour
of Truth. That Papal prohibition began the Schiſm,
which till then had no exiſtence. For the Church of
<hi>England</hi> never did by any judicial act forbid her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Communicate with the Catholick Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea; nor require of her Communicants the belief
of any point denied by them, or disbelief of any point
maintained by them.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Column,</hi> of the Churches Infallibility, is
of the ſame nature, and equal impertinence. We believe
there ever was ſince the time of Chriſt, and ſhall be to
the end of the World, a Church, or collection of men,
believing all things neceſſary to Salvation. But that this
Church is no other than the particular Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and that to the belief of all neceſſary Articles, ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39357:5"/>
falſe and erroneous Opinions never was, nor ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed;
we do not believe, and it never can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Now all the Teſtimonies alledged by our Author
amounts to no more than this, That the Church of Chriſt
is indefectible, ever did and always ſhall exiſt. That
the whole Faith of Chriſt is always taught and preſerved
in it; and that in her Boſom Salvation may ever be
found and obtained: But all this doth no more concern
The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than it doth the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Our Author indeed alledgeth Three paſſages,
wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is particularly mentioned:
The firſt is a Complement of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s to Pope <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
That to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair Infidelity cannot have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.<note place="margin">Perfidia.</note>
This hath been oftentimes anſwered by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
and is indeed a meer Compliment, or at moſt, a
declaration of his expectations grounded upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of a Learned and Orthodox Clergy, which then
preſided in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides infinite places of
the Ancients might be produced, wherein they beſtow
no leſs Encomiums upon particular Churches, which by
the confeſſion of our Adverſaries not only may, but
have actually fallen from the Faith. Thus St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi>
               </note> the Church of <hi>Epheſus was predeſtinated before all
Ages, to continue for ever in a permanent and unchangeable
glory.</hi> An expreſſion which infinitely ſurpaſſeth St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi>
Compliment. The Second paſſage is taken from
<hi>Victor Vitenſis,</hi> whom our Author ignorantly calls <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis,</hi>
where <hi>Eugenius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> being urged
by the <hi>Arian</hi> Tyrant <hi>Hunnericus</hi> to give an account of
his Faith, deſired leave to ſend to all his Fellow Biſhops
in the whole Catholick Church that they might meet in
a General Council, particularly to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who was the moſt eminent Biſhop of the Weſtern Church
and firſt Patriarch of the World. For no General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:39357:5"/>
could be held without the preſence of all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
either by themſelves, or by their Legates. That
<hi>Eugenius</hi> deſired not the preſence or advice of the Pope

<hi>Victor</hi>

The third is a paſſage of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in his
Apology againſt <hi>Ruſinus,</hi> that <hi>the Roman Faith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Apoſtles, cannot be changed.</hi> Of this
Apology I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat hereafter: To the
words alledged, I need only ſay, our Adverſaries can
never prove that unchangeable Faith, which the Apoſtle
commended, to be the Faith of the preſent Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have we proved three of our Authors <hi>eight
Columns</hi> to be wholly trifling and impertinent; I will next
obſerve his ignorance and miſtakes of Chronology. St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> is by him placed before <hi>Origen;</hi> when as the
latter was a famous Writer of the Church long before
the firſt was converted to the Faith. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> and
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> are ranked before <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> who was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
before either of the other were born. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
before <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus,</hi> who was a Biſhop near
Twenty five years before the other was made Prieſt.
<hi>Victor Vitenſis</hi> placed in the beginning of the 4th Age,
who lived in the end of the 5th. But our honeſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
becauſe he writ of a Perſecution, thought he muſt
neceſſarily mean an Heathen Perſecution, and therefore
ſet him before <hi>Lactantius.</hi> In the ſame manner he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> before St. <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> and St.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39357:6"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> before St. <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> But Chronology is not
the buſineſs of our Author. Let us next view his Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm:
where we ſhall find all the Fables and Forgeries
of Ancient and latter times adapted and produced by
him.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Decretals of the Ancient Popes; out
of which he cites the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Clemens, Anacletus,</hi>
and <hi>Pius.</hi> It were ſuperfluous to reſume an Argument
ſo often cleared, and to prove theſe Epiſtles to be ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
if we had not to deal with a generation of men,
whoſe either ignorance or effrontery requireth it. This
hath been often confeſſed, and at large demonſtrated by
Learned Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but more fully
by the Reformed Divines: Inſomuch that it is long
ſince become a received and undoubted opinion among
all the learned men of both Communions. And indeed
the thing is manifeſt beyond all contradiction; For no
Pope, Father, or Writer, before the 9th Age ever made
mention of them. The Vulgar Verſion of the Bible is
conſtantly uſed in them, which was not compoſed till
the beginning of the fifth Age. They are almoſt wholly
made up of an infinite number of paſſages ſtoln from
the Writings, Canons and Conſtitutions of Authors,
Councils, Popes and Emperors, who lived between the
Third and the Ninth Age. They are neither adapted to
the genius, nor neceſſities of thoſe times: Frequently they
oppoſe Hereſies, which began not till the 4th Age. Are
full of ridiculous Anachroniſms, barbarous Phraſes, and
fooliſh Soleciſms, which thoſe firſt and purer Ages could
not be guilty of. Laſtly, they mention many points of
Diſcipline and Eccleſiaſtical Terms, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the three firſt Ages, and not introduced till
ſome Ages after. Not only the falſity of theſe <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
is apparent and confeſſed; but their Author and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39357:6"/>
age can be aſſigned. They were firſt publiſhed to the
World by <hi>Riculphus Biſhop of Mentz,</hi> who received them
from <hi>Iſidore Mercator</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Ninth Age.
Bellarmin, Baronius, Perron,</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> acknowledg
them to be dubious, and dare not defend them. But
latter Criticks of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> openly confeſs
them to be ſpurious. Thus <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Coſſart</hi> in their
Collection of Councils, affix a note of falſity to every
one of them: And particularly give this Cenſure of moſt
of them: That <hi>they are eſteemed ſuppoſititious by learned
Catholicks. Baluzius</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">A prefat. ad Reginon.</note> gives an account of their Original,
progreſs and reception in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church: And
<hi>Du Pin</hi> affirmeth, <hi>They are rejected with a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſpurious Writings of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi>
come next to be conſidered: Which forgery our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſo fully believeth, that he ever placeth them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the Holy Scriptures. That they belong
not to the <hi>Areopagite</hi> is manifeſt from the univerſal ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the ancients, till the Sixth Age: The ſubtile
argumentation and elaborate ſtile of them far different
from the ſimplicity of the Apoſtolick times. They
were writ in the flouriſhing eſtate of the Church; and
therefore make no mention of Martyrs or Perſecutions;
but rather frequently oppoſe the Hereſie of <hi>Arius.</hi> The
Author of them cites the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and
<hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles, particularly that to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
written juſt before his Martyrdom in the year 107. long
after the <hi>Areopagites</hi> death. I might add, that he
mentions many Ceremonies not introduced into the
Church till the <hi>Fourth Age;</hi> ſpeaks of the Order of
<hi>Monks,</hi> and cites St. <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But I need
not inſiſt any longer upon a thing ſo evident. The
falſity of theſe Writings is confeſſed, and demonſtrated
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:39357:7"/>
by <hi>Petavius, Morinus, Launoy, Oudin, Du Pin,</hi> and many
other learned Authors of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commentaries of <hi>Theophilus Biſhop of Antioch</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Goſpels, are moſt certainly the product of a
<hi>Latin</hi> Writer, and therefore ſpurious. Such Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
were indeed anciently extant under <hi>Theophilus</hi> his
name; but were rejected by St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">De Script. Eccl. cap. 25.</note> as ſuppoſititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
As for thoſe we now have, they were forged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. For the Author tranſcribes a
paſſage out of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s ſixth, Epiſtle to <hi>Magnus.</hi> Upon
which account, <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Du Pin</hi> do eſteem this Work
to be ſpurious. The Oration of St. <hi>Hippolitus</hi> the
<hi>Conſummation of the World,</hi> is of the ſame ſtamp, as
appears from the barbarous ſtile, childiſh expreſſions,
and fooliſh Fables, which may be found in it. For which
reaſons <hi>Du Pin</hi> ſaith, It is very uncertain, and may be
juſtly call'd in queſtion.</p>
            <p>But to what miſerable ſhifts is our Author reduced,
when he citeth the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Athanaſius to Pope Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix;</hi>
an Epiſtle forged by <hi>Iſidore Mercator,</hi> together with
the <hi>Decretals,</hi> and almoſt wholly patch't up out of the
Acts of the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> under Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> in the year
649: And wherein <hi>Athanaſius</hi> tells <hi>Faelix;</hi> that he had
been ordained Biſhop at <hi>Rome</hi> by his ſacred hands;
whereas the true <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was ordained at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
more than Forty years before <hi>Faelix</hi> was made
Pope. <hi>Binius</hi> acknowledgeth it to be ſpurious, and <hi>Labbe</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Concil. Tom. II. p. 844.</note> gives this ſcornful cenſure of it 
<q>Ad malas Mercatoris
merces has ineptae farraginis quiſquilias. <hi>Baronius,</hi>
aliique eruditi viri ablegant;</q> 
which I will not tranſlate,
leſt I ſhould be thought to rail, inſtead of confuting.</p>
            <p>However, to alledge a ſpurious Writing, may be only
a matter of artifice to impoſe upon an unwary Reader:
But to cite the undoubted Work of one Author, under
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39357:7"/>
the name of another, to whom it was never before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,
can be no other than groſs ignorance. Our
Author citeth St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Third Apology againſt <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi>
under the name of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who
was dead many years before the name of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was
known, or this Apology written. Whether this was a
matter of deſign, that the Reader might never be able
to conſult the place, our Author can beſt tell. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the paſſage is infinitely trifling and impertinent.
For St. <hi>Hierom</hi> accuſing <hi>Ruffinus</hi> of a forgery in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Rome</hi> an Apology for <hi>Origen,</hi> under the name of
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> tells him he had miſt of his deſign;
For the <hi>Romans</hi> did not believe it to be the Work of that
Martyr: And then adds, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, commended
by the Apoſtle, could not be impoſed upon by ſuch tricks.
This is a piece of flattery, which even no ſober <hi>Papiſt</hi> will
allow to be ſtrictly true. For all grant that the whole
Church may be deceived in judging a matter of fact;
ſuch is, whether this or that Author writ ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by many Impoſtures of this nature, as the Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Decretals of Iſidore Mercator,</hi> which ſhe received
and uſed as genuine for many Ages. But not to depart
from this very inſtance, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
his own words by impoſing upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> in
perſwading them that this Apology, tranſlated and
publiſhed by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> was not the work of <hi>Pamphilus,</hi>
but of <hi>Euſebius.</hi> For it truly belonged to the former.
<hi>Euſebius</hi> indeed added Five Books to it. But thoſe were
not tranſlated by <hi>Ruffinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Book <hi>de Caena Domini</hi> ſhould in this Age be
cited under the name of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> may be juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired;
when it is not only confeſſed by all to be ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
but the true Author of it is known, <hi>Arnoldus</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:39357:8"/>
of <hi>Bonvalle</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the Twelth Age. To him
do <hi>Raynaudus, Labbe, Oudin, Du Pin,</hi> and almoſt all
Manuſcript Copies aſcribe it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Work of <hi>the Sacraments</hi> hath been call'd
in queſtion by many great and learned men of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches. If it ſhould be allowed in the main to
belong to St. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> they muſt, however, grant that
it hath been miſerably interpolated and corrupted by
latter hands. For <hi>Bertram</hi> citeth ſeveral places out of
it, which cannot now be found in it. But if this be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious,
it is moſt certain that the Sermons of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
are ſpurious: Being no other than a Collection of the
Sermons of ſeveral Authors, ſome more, others leſs
ancient. This <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Labbe</hi> acknowledg. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them may be found among the Sermons of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Taurinenſis,</hi> and particularly that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> cited by our Author. The books <hi>de Paenitentia,
Petrus Soto</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Inſtitut. Sacerd. tit. de neceſſ. Confeſ. Lect. 2.</note> maintains to be ſpurious; and ſome
learned men have ſubſcribed to his Opinion. In
like manner <hi>Eraſmus</hi> contends that the Homilies of
<hi>Origen</hi> upon the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are ſpurious, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
placeth them among the dubious Writings. But in
theſe Two laſt Caſes, nothing certain can be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>The books <hi>de Viſitatione Infirmorum,</hi> cited by our
Author, under the name of St. <hi>Auguſtin, Bellarmin</hi> and
<hi>Labbe</hi> confeſs to be ſpurious. That they are ſo, need
no other argument than the fooliſh arguments and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
ſtile of them, unworthy of the judgment and
learning of St. <hi>Auguſtin. Eraſmus</hi> giveth this Cenſure
of them, <hi>The work of a prating Fellow, who had neither
Wit nor Learning. What ſhame or reaſon have thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
left, who obtrude ſuch Writings to us under the name
of</hi> Auguſtin? Our Author refers us to the Second book
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:39357:8"/>
of this Treatiſe for a proof of Sacerdotal confeſſion.
There indeed we may find this Confeſſion commended,
adviſed and enjoyned (which is alſo done by the Church
of <hi>England)</hi> but in the mean while the neceſſity of it
diſowned, and the ſufficiency of a private confeſſion to
God acknowledged. For the Author blaming ſome
perſons who dehorted men from Sacerdotal confeſſion,
ſaith, Let not the ſuperſtition of theſe Dreamers ſeduce
you, which confirmeth ſinners in their reſolutions of not
confeſſing to a Prieſt, <hi>Quia ſalvat Sacerdote inconſulto
ad Deum peccatorum confeſſio: Becauſe confeſſion of ſins to
God without conſulting any Prieſt, is ſufficient to Salvation:</hi>
Where he plainly allows the truth of this propoſition,
but blames the ill application of it. But becauſe our
Author refers us to this ſpurious Treatiſe;<note place="margin">O extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanda cordis caecatio. O perditionis animarum oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio. l. 2. c. 8.</note> I would deſire
him to turn one Page farther, where he will find the
Doctrine of doing any Penance after Death, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of Purgatory, called <hi>a deteſtable blindneſs of
heart, and occaſion of the deſtruction of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Quaeſtiones ad Graecos,</hi> cited by our Author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> are on all ſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to be ſuppoſititious, particularly by <hi>Bellarmin,
Labbe,</hi> and <hi>Du Pin.</hi> The juſtice of this Cenſure is
evidently evinced from the frequent mention therein,
made of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who were not heard of till
more than a Hundred years after <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s death. The
Lamentation of <hi>Origen</hi> is the trifling product of ſome
fooliſh <hi>Latin</hi> Writer; and therefore juſtly rejected as
ſpurious by <hi>Bellarmin, Baronius,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ad an. 252.</note> 
               <hi>Labbe, Huetius,</hi>
and <hi>Du Pin.</hi> I might add, that it was formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> if his Decretal were not equally
ſpurious. However, that excuſeth not our Author;
ſince that Decretal is univerſally received by all the
Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:39357:9"/>
Our Author citeth, <hi>Two Fragments of</hi> Euſebius <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi>
out of <hi>Jodocus Coccius.</hi> But we have great
reaſon to believe, that they are not genuine. For <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Caeſarienſis</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. l. 7. c. 2.</note> in mentioning <hi>Euſebius Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
ſpeaks not one word of his Writings; which that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate.
Hiſtorian would by no means have omitted,
if there had heen any known in his time. No one
of the Ancients make the leaſt mention of ſuch a
Writer: Nor was he ever heard of till <hi>Coccius</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
produced ſome fragments out of his Homilies. As
for <hi>Coccius,</hi> he had not skill enough in this kind to paſs
a critical judgment upon the Writings of the ancients:
and <hi>Turrain</hi> cannot be ſecurely truſted. For all the
World knows with how great violence he maintained the
Apoſtolick Canons and Conſtitutions to be genuine: A
poſition which none but fools and mad men can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arabick Canons</hi> of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> are a
no leſs fooliſh than evident forgery of latter times. All
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copies give us no more than
XX. Canons of that Council. <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus</hi> ſaith
<note n="b" place="margin">Hiſt. Con. Nic. l. 2. c. 30.</note> no more were made. The <hi>African</hi> Biſhops ſending
into the Eaſt for true and correct Copies of them, receive
from <hi>Atticus</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> no
more than XX. and theſe LXXX. <hi>Arabick</hi> Canons were
never heard of till brought out of the Eaſt in the laſt
Age by the Legates ſent by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. to the Patriarch of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> to invite him to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But
I need not uſe many arguments. They ſufficiently
betray themſelves by the frequent mention of Names,
Rites, and Cuſtoms which obtained not in the Church
till after the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> I will inſtance only in
their ſeveral Conſtitutions, about Monaſteries, Monks
and Nuns, as that they be ſhaved, and uſe a diſtinct ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39357:9"/>
from the reſt of mankind; cuſtoms which were not
known till ſome Ages after. And that we may not ſeem
ſingular in making this Cenſure, the Learned <hi>Abraham Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellenſis</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Prefat. ad Verſion.</note> confeſſeth, That many of them were forged,
others changed, and all accommodated by the ſeveral
Sects of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to their ſeveral Ages and Perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>The ſincerity of our Author deſerveth next to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
which I fear would be found very ſmall if I had
time and leiſure to compare all his Citations with the
Originals. Thoſe few which I have compared, give me
a juſt ſuſpicion of his fraudulent dealing in the reſt, and
may reaſonably create the ſame prejudice in all his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
I will produce a few Inſtances. In the Fifth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
he citeth theſe words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (a), <hi>How can
they be aſſured the Bread is made the Body of our Lord?</hi>
In the Original it is <hi>eſſe Corpus ſuum,</hi> where he hath
Tranſlated <hi>eſſe</hi> to be <hi>made.</hi> A few lines after he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
a paſſage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which no man in his right
wits could ever have alledged for Tranſubſtantiation:
For the intire ſentence is one of the moſt pregnant Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of all Antiquity, againſt that monſtrous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the words are theſe <hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">L. 4. c. 57.</note>, The Bread taken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
to his Diſciples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">(<hi>e</hi>) Adv. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. l. 4. c. 40.</note> 
               <hi>he made his Body, by ſaying, This
is my Body, that is, the Figure of my Body.</hi> Our Author
hath cut off the latter part, and given us only the firſt
words of this Paſſage. What name ought juſtly to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this Artifice, let others judg; but certainly none
can call it ſincerity. The corruption of <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr in
the 7th Column is no leſs groſs and evident; where our
Author citeth theſe words out of his Second Apology:
<hi>We worſhip them</hi> (the good Angels) <hi>both by words and
deeds, even as we our ſelves have been taught and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
The <hi>Greek</hi> words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
<hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them both in word and deed; and freely teaching every
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39357:10"/>
one who deſireth to learn thoſe things wherein we been
inſtructed.</hi> A little before, he had cited <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the
<hi>Areopagite,</hi> for Prayers to the departed Saints, where he
wilfully miſtakes that Writers meaning; and what the
Counterfeit <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſpeaks of the Prayers of our pious
Fellow-Chriſtians here on Earth, applieth to Prayers
made to departed Saints; and not only ſo, but falſifieth
his words in more than one place; the paſſage is this<note n="*" place="margin">De Eccleſiaſt. Hierarch. c. 7.</note>;

               </gap>.
<hi>This I affirm conſonantly to the Scripture;
That the prayers of holy men are very uſeful in this life, this
way. If any one deſiring the Divine Graces, and be well
diſpoſed for the reception of them, ſhall (as being conſcious
of his own unworthineſs) come to ſome holy man, and deſire
him to aſſiſt him, and pray together with him, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
hence the greateſt benefit.</hi> The words thus juſtly
Tranſlated, do neither favour nor relate to Prayers to
the Dead. In the ſame Column he hath produced ſome
words of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Orat. de <hi>SS.</hi> Bernic. &amp; Proſdoce.</note>, with no more ingenuity; for

               </gap> follows, <hi>Let us deſire them,</hi> (which yet
our Author after his wonted manner exaggerates, <hi>Let us
heartily beſeech them):</hi> But that this was a meer rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Flight, may be demonſtrated beyond all doubt; for
in the immediately foregoing ſentence he ſpeaks much
greater things of their dead Reliques, and Repoſitories;
to which yet even our Author will grant that Prayers
are not in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe to be addreſſed:
<hi>In this Fire of Devotion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let us fall down to their
Reliques; let us embrace their Repoſitories; for even the
Repoſitories of Martyrs have great Virtue, as the Bones
of Martyrs have great Force.</hi> Theſe Rhetorical Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophes

            <p>I return now to conſider our Authors <hi>Columns</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.
The Second is about the Primacy of the Pope,
and conſiſts of ſome Teſtimonies of the Fathers, which
abating the ſpurious ones, inſinuate no more than that
St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Prince or Firſt of the Apoſtles, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon which the Church was built, and the Keeper of
the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; all this we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
acknowledg: None ever denied a Primacy of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> the Scripture aſſures us that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were all Foundations of the Church; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
committed the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to
them all: If any of theſe Teſtimonies ſeem to attribute
ſomewhat greater and more eminent to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we
are to conſider that Orators ſeldom contain themſelves
within the ſevere bounds of truth, when they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to make an Encomium of any. The Ancients
ſpeak no leſs things of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and attribute to him no
leſs ſwelling Titles, as might eaſily be proved, if our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

of one Author in favour of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The moſt expreſs
paſſage which our Author alledgeth, is that of <hi>Tertullian</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. de Pudic.</note>,
where he is ſuppoſed to call the Pope <hi>Chief Pastor, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

Teſtimonies which remain, are only the firſt and the laſt
of this Column: The firſt our Author thought ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
that he choſe againſt his uſual cuſtom to give

Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein he calls them <hi>the
ſanctified and illuminated Church, which preſides in the
Country of the Romans.</hi> Theſe inſcriptions of Epiſtles
were according to the Cuſtom of the Eaſtern Nations,
filled with great and ſwelling Titles, of which unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this to the <hi>Romans</hi> was one of the moſt modeſt; for
he beſtows far greater Titles upon other Churches in
ſome of his Epiſtles, and particularly calls the Church of

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:39357:11"/>
Rome. The laſt Teſtimony is taken from <hi>Socrates</hi>
and <hi>Sizomen</hi> atteſting that the Eaſtern Synods were not
valid, unleſs confirmed by the Pope; that he had a
peculiar Priviledge of reſtoring Biſhops unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and that to him belonged the care of all the
Churches. But firſt, neither of the Hiſtorians affirm,
That the Pope had any ſuch priviledge which was not
common to the other Patriarch. For it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
cuſtom of the Ancient Church, that in all emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occaſions of the Church, the Patriarchs ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
their judgments, as being more peculiarly
obliged to it, by that eminent ſtation which they
held among other Biſhops: Not that the judgment of
every one was authoritative, or immediately put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
(for their judgments were oft-times contrary) but
they thereby only declared what they thought juſt and
Canonical, which if it was not performed, they with
the Biſhops ſubject to them, uſed to deny communion
to the other party. Beſides, there was a particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the caſe mentioned by theſe Hiſtorians. For
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> being depoſed by the <hi>Arians,</hi> both Catholicks
and <hi>Arians</hi> had ſubmitted the Arbitration of the whole
cauſe to Pope <hi>Julius.</hi> As for the confirmation of Councils;
no Council could be General, till approved by all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs;
&amp; therefore if a Synod were held in the Eaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchs was preſent, neither by himſelf,
nor by his Legates; no wonder if the Decrees of it obliged
not the Weſtern Patriarchate, till confirmed by the Pope.
For no more did the Weſtern Synods oblige the Eaſtern
Churches, till confirmed by the Eaſtern Patriarchs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth <hi>Column</hi>
               </hi> treateth of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
moſt of the Teſtimonies produced by our Author, ſay no
more than that the Euchariſtical elements after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are the Body and Blood of our Lord. This we alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
and believe; but then the queſtion remaineth ſtill, in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39357:12"/>
what ſenſe they are the body and blood of Chriſt; of the
remaining citations the moſt expreſs are thoſe of <hi>Juſt in
Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> The firſt even
in the words cited by our Author affirms, That our
Fleſh and Blood are nouriſhed by the Euchariſtical ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and therefore could not believe Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Second indeed ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">De initan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, cap. 9.</note> that a preternatural
change is made in the elements after Conſecration, and
the Bread then becomes the Body of Chriſt, which was
born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was crucified and buried. But
that he means his typical not natural body, is manifeſt
from the beginning of this Chapter, where he compares
this heavenly food to <hi>Manna,</hi> or the Bread of Angels;
and prefers it becauſe that is ſubject to corruption, if
it be kept from day to day; but this is free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which whoſoever religiouſly taſts, cannot ſuffer
corruption. From which words, Three ſeveral Arguments
of a typical ſenſe may be formed. For firſt, as Manna was
not truly, but typically the Bread of Angels: So neither is
the conſecrated Bread truly, but typically the Body of
Chriſt. Secondly, The conſecrated elements are as to the
matter of them ſubject to corruption: And therefore St.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> believed not the matter of them, but only what
they repreſented, to be the body of Chriſt. Thirdly, He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
this incorruptible Body of Chriſt to be received on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Religious communicant: Whereas if <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
be true, it is equally received by the moſt Irreligious
perſon. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in the place<note n="a" place="margin">Comm. in Pſal. 33.</note> cited by our Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
denieth all natural preſence. His words are theſe,
<hi>When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpoke of his Body, He ſaid, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eateth not my fleſh, and drinketh not my blood, ſhall not
have eternal Life: For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my
blood is drink indeed. His Diſciples, who followed him,
were afraid, and ſcandalized at that ſpeech, and not truly
underſtanding it, thought that our Lord ſpoke ſomewhat
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39357:12"/>
harſh, as if they were to eat that fleſh, and drink that
blood, which they ſaw. They could not bear this; as if they
had ſaid, How can this be? Error, ignorance and folly
had poſſeſſed them:</hi> Where he goes on to ſhew that this
averſion of the Apoſtles proceeded from a miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Lord's meaning; as if he intended to give them
his natural fleſh and blood to eat:<note place="margin">Sacramenta praedicabat.</note> 
               <hi>Whereas our Lord knew
what he meant; he ſpoke of Sacraments,</hi> or a ſacramental pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
This paſſage ſufficiently explains the following
Clauſe cited by our Author, unleſs we can ſuppoſe St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
in this obſcure ſentence to have contradicted the
Doctrine by him plainly delivered in the precedent Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sixth <hi>Column</hi>
               </hi> corncerns <hi>Sacramental Confeſſion,</hi>
Prieſtly Abſolution and Penance; and in all reſpects is
wholly impertinent; as may appear by theſe few conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.
Firſt, Then the Church of <hi>England</hi> retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and adviſeth to her Children Confeſſion, Abſolution
and Penance; But then ſhe maketh not the firſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to Salvation; nor the Second a judicial,
but only declaratory act; nor the Third properly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
for ſins: Nor do any of the Teſtimonies produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by our Author, prove theſe poſitions. Secondly,
The Confeſſion uſed in the ancient Church was not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular,
but publick; not lodged in the breaſt of the
Prieſt, but made before the whole Congregation. And
when afterwards about the time of the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution
theſe confeſſions became ſo numerous, that the Church
could not hear them all, a <hi>Paenitentiarius</hi> was choſen
out of the Presbyters to receive them, he did not
keep them ſecret to himſelf, but only paſs judgment
which were fit to be made known to the whole Church,
and to be performed in the publick Congregation, and
which not. 3. Abſolution of the Prieſt was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be judicial or authoritative, and immediately
to abſolve before God, but only declaratory of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39357:13"/>
promiſes of pardon made by God to all penitent ſinners,
and to have no other neceſſary effect, than the reſtoring
of the penitents to the peace of the Church. This may
be proved by that very paſſage of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> which our
Author citeth, where he compareth the Prieſtly abſolution,
to the cleanſing of Lepers by the Prieſts under the old
Law; a compariſon very frequent with the Fathers. For as
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts made not the Lepers clean, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them ſo to be, and ſuppoſed them to be clean before
their declaration; otherwiſe the declaration would not in
the leaſt have contributed to their cleanſing: So a ſacerdotal
Abſolution remits not the guilt of ſins, but ſuppoſeth them
to have been before remitted by God, and declareth ſo to
be; otherwiſe the abſolution of a Prieſt will avail the ſinner
nothing, nor ſet him right in the Court of Heaven. 4. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in the ancient Church was chiefly intended, not as
a ſatisfaction to God for the violation of his Laws, but
as a ſatisfaction to the Church, for the ſcandal given to
others, and reproach drawn upon the whole Church
by the former crimes or irregular practice of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents:
And therefore was ever augmented or relaxed
according to the various exigencies or neceſſities of
times. 5. In the ancient Church, Penance ever preceded
Abſolution, and was the means of obtaining it: Whereas
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Penitent is firſt abſolv'd,
and then ſome ſubſequent Penance is impoſed on him:
Which takes away the very nature of Penance, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Abſolution, as they were uſed and deſigned
the ancient Chriſtians; and tends only to the intereſts of
the Prieſt, and deluſion of private ſouls.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh <hi>Column</hi>
               </hi> undertaketh to prove the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of <hi>Invocation or Prayer to Saints,</hi> and that they
pray for us: the latter we need not deny; but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that that will not warrant the former. So that
when all the ſpurious Teſtimonies, thoſe which we have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39357:13"/>
already anſwered, and thoſe which prove only that the
departed Saints pray for us, be expunged; there remain
no more than one of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (for that of St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
is a plain hiſtorical Apoſtrophe) and one of <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
As for the firſt, I might juſtly oppoſe the authority
of ſome learned men, who maintain this Book <hi>de Viduis,</hi>
whence the paſſage is taken, to be ſuppoſititious. But
I will content my ſelf to ſay, That our Author hath
falſely tranſlated the place, by rendring <hi>Obſecrandi ſunt
Angeli pro nobis, ut,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obſecrandi ſunt Martyres, We are to
deſire the aſſiſtance of the Angels; we are to pray to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs:</hi>
Whereas the words do not in the leaſt inſinuate an
Exhortation of Prayer to be made to them by us; but
only a wiſh, that they would pray for us, and that we
ſhould gratefully accept their charitable kindneſs in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Paſſage<note n="‖" place="margin">De curand. affect. Graec. Orat. 8.</note> of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as cited by our Author,
is a plain forgery. For <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaks not one Syllable
of praying to the Martys; and what our Author tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates,
<hi>beſeech them as Holy men to intercede to God for
them,</hi> is no more in the <hi>Greek</hi> than this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>We honour, or reverence them as holy men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The laſt <hi>Column</hi>
               </hi> treateth of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and Prayer for
the dead. The firſt we believe to be a Fable, and to have no
ground, either in Scripture or Antiquity. The ſecond our
Church doth not condemn, only hath prudently omitted
it in the publick Service, becauſe it is a thing dubious in it
ſelf, and not approved by Scripture. The uſe of it in the
Ancient Church, doth not in the leaſt prove the belief of
Purgatory. For they anciently prayed for all Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
whatſoever, even for the bleſſed Virgin, Apoſtles,
Martyrs and Confeſſors; and their Prayers reſpected not
alleviation of freedom from any internal Puniſhment,
but only the day of Judgment, that God would haſten it;
and when that comes, receive all departed Souls into the
beatifical Viſion, which they generally believed was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39357:14"/>
not beſtowed to the departed Saints till the day of
Judgment. That Purgatory was anciently believed,
our Author's Teſtimonies do in no wiſe prove. Some
of them indeed mention a purging Fire; But that Fire
was not to exiſt till the Day of Judgment, when all
Souls were to paſs through it, and to continue a ſhorter
or longer time in it, according to their greater or leſſer
Purity. No intermediate puniſhment between Death
and Judgment was believed, beſides the delay of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
if that can properly be called a puniſhment.</p>
            <p>There remains only to conſider our Author's Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of general Councils: Wherein he hath committed
many groſs, and, as I fear, wilful miſtakes. He makes
Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> preſide over the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> but <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
and <hi>Socrates,</hi> whom he citeth, ſay no ſuch thing. <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
indeed ſaith it: but all the World knows the contrary.
For <hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba</hi> preſided, and ſubſcribed in
his own name before the Legates of Pope <hi>Sylveſter.</hi> That
<hi>Damaſus</hi> preſided over the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
is ſo egregiouſly falſe; that that Council was both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
and ended without ſo much as the knowledg of the
Pope, or any other Weſtern Biſhops. That <hi>Cyril</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> not Pope <hi>Celeſtin,</hi> preſided over
the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is manifeſt from the Acts of
that Council, from the Commiſſion given to him by
the Emperor for that purpoſe, and from all the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of thoſe times. <hi>Cyril</hi> indeed acted for Pope <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtin,</hi>
but not as preſident, but as one Fellow-Biſhop
manageth the Proxy of another here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in the Houſe of Lords. In the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Legates were ſo far from preſiding,
that all the Canons of the Council were made in their
abſence, and not only without, but againſt their conſent.
For when the Legates in the next Seſſion proteſted againſt
the Canons, they were over-ruled by the Council and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39357:14"/>
forced to ſubmit. That Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> preſided over the
Fifth General Gouucil, or Second of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is ſo
impudent a Falſhood, that it might with equal reaſon be
pretended that <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> preſided over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent:</hi> For <hi>Vigilius</hi> who was then at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
gathered an oppoſite Convention of <hi>Western</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
wherein publiſhing a long Conſtitution or Decree
in favour of the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> he concludes with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Cenſure and Condemnation of all who ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
Write, Teach, or Propoſe any thing contrary to
his Decree, which he knew was then in doing in the
General Council. The Popes Conſtitution was read in
the Council, and notwithſtanding it was Decreed, <hi>Can.</hi>
12, 13, 14. That whoſoever defended the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi>
or even did not Anathematize them, ſhould be himſelf
Anathematiz'd. After the Concluſion of the Council, and
not till then, <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſubmitted, and writing an Epiſtle to
<hi>Eutychius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who had preſided
over the Council, profeſſeth he was now very ſorry that by
the inſtigation of the Devil he had diſſented from the
Council, and in contempt of brotherly Charity had openly
diſagreed from them, and contended with them; that
now he was convinced of his Errors, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
his former actions, ratified and ſubmitted to the
Decrees of the Council. In the Seventh General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
our Author reckoning up the Hereticks condemned
by it, as <hi>Paulus, Sergius, Cyrus, Theodoſius,</hi> comes off with
an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the meaning of which may eaſily be diſcovered;
for this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was invented to ſave the reputation of Pope
<hi>Honorius,</hi> who together with the reſt was Anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the Council as a notorious and peſtilent Heretick.
The Second <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> was formerly denied to be
General by <hi>Theodorus Studites,</hi> altho a great Patron
of Image-Worſhip; and was condemned in the ſame age
by the great Council of <hi>Francfort.</hi> The Fourth Council of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39357:15"/>
               <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the Year 869 was ever accounted a
Schiſmatical Conventicle by the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. All the
following Councils were confined to the <hi>West,</hi> and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both the Preſence and Suffrage of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
and conſequently were not Oecumenical: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them are not at this day univerſally received in the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and others are rejected and condemned
by the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, as the Firſt Second, Third, and
Fourth of <hi>Lateran,</hi> Firſt, and Second of <hi>Lyons,</hi> as to the
Conſtitutions and Canons injurious to the Civil Right of
Princes: The Councils of <hi>Florence,</hi> and Fifth of <hi>Lateran,</hi>
are wholly rejected by her, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> but
in part received: Our Author pretendeth, that in the
Council of <hi>Florence</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> were united to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſubſcribed the Union. If a forced
compliance of a few Biſhops compelled by the threats
and force of their Emperor can be call'd an union, this
was indeed one: But many of them ſubſcribed for fear
of Death, and moſt for fear of ſtarving, as <hi>Sylvester Sgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropulus</hi>
an Eye-witneſs aſſureth us; and all of them when
returning home, were ſo deteſted and hated by their
Country-men, that they were eſteemed worſe than Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
and not permitted to be buried in holy Ground.</p>
            <p>I might make ſome farther Obſervations upou our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Paper, as why he left that of <hi>Constance</hi> out of the
number of <hi>General Councils,</hi> and yet afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
its Authority; how diſagreeing the forms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,
preſcribed to <hi>Berengarius,</hi> are to the preſent
Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and how little the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
produced by him in favour of Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
