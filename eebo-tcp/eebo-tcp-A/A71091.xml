            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The occasion of this mine undertaking against him herein was this.</p>
            <p>About <hi>Easter</hi> last, <hi>1644.</hi> I did visit in the Prison at <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> some Prisoners, that had been taken at the Castle of <hi>Brampton Bryan,</hi> belonging to <hi>Sir Robert Harly</hi> in <hi>Hereford-shire:</hi> and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning them about their taking up of Armes against their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,</hi> they answered me, that they took up Armes against <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> for (said they) <hi>'tis prophesied in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Whore of Babylon shall be destroyed with fire and sword, and what doe you know, but this is the time of her ruine, and that we are the men that must help to pull her downe.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that the <hi>Revelation</hi> tells us, that 'tis the <hi>worke of Kings</hi> (signified by those <hi>ten Hornes, Rev. 17.12.16)</hi> to pull downe the whore of Babylon, <hi>to hate her, to make her naked, and to burne her with fire.</hi> But as for them, they (in my apprehension) laboured to keep up the <hi>whore of Babilon,</hi> that shee might not fall, by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>pull downe Kings,</hi> who were appoynted of God <hi>to pull downe her:</hi> they replyed, that <hi>'tis said in the Revelation, that the People, the Multitude and Nations should also pull her downe</hi>: but I reading the verse out of one of their Bibles, shewed them their mistake, <hi>that the People, Multitude and Nations,</hi> (which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Waters, Rev. 17.15.)</hi> were those whom the <hi>Whore</hi> did sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as it were did <hi>brood</hi> under her, that is, shee did rule over

            <p>
               <hi>But what</hi> (said they) <hi>do you think, that Kings alone, without the help of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then I inform'd them further, of their mistake in another particular, namely in thinking Popery (which they fancied they fought against,) to be <hi>that whore of Babylon,</hi> which in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is threatened to be destroyed with <hi>fire and sword;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> Antichrist and whore of Babilon, which was to be destroyed with such weapons, dwelt at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not here in <hi>England</hi>: and it was the very <hi>Roman feat</hi> or City which was to be so abolished; and not the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish faith,</hi> or Popish Religion; <hi>the sword of Christs mouth,</hi> (which is the word of God) is the only weapons ordained to destroy that; nor should that be quite abolished from the earth (as Learned Divines did hold) till the comming of Christ himselfe: they told me that <hi>all the true godly Divines in England</hi> (amongst whom they named in speciall M.

Then I endeavoured to shew them, that those Scriptures which they alleadged were misapplyed by them, and did rather make against them; but they took me off, from that discourse, with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Marshalls</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them: <hi>M. Marshall</hi> (said they) <hi>doth apply them as we doe, in a Sermon</hi> (Preach'd before the Parliament) <hi>which we had at Brampton</hi>: I told them that (surely) they were mistaken in <hi>M. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though some Weavers and Taylers, and Tinkers and Pedlers, and such like, who were suffered to preach, did abuse and pervert Gods word to their own purposes, yet M. <hi>Marshall</hi> (who was one whom my selfe knew better then they did, I was perswaded had more wisedome, learning, and honesty then so to doe: and much other discourse to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we had togeather, insomuch that at last they desired me, that I would come againe unto them, and pray with them: but my occasions car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed me out of the Towne on the morrow, that I could see them no more.</p>
            <p>Now behold, about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> or beginning of <hi>August</hi> after, I fortuned to be in a Booksellers shop in <hi>Ludlow,</hi> where I chanced to see a Sermon of <hi>M. Marshalls</hi> upon that Text, <hi>Iud. 5.23. Curse ye Meroz, &amp;c.</hi> which I had either not seen before, or not sufficiently observed; wherefore reading the same, that discourse which I had with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Prisoners,</hi> came into my mind; and I did conclude, that this was the <hi>very Sermon,</hi> which they had alleadged unto me, in their owne defence: wherefore having by experience seen in part, what dammage thereby was already done, to simple people; and beleeving that others of the like ranke and quality, in other places, might be by the same as much misled; I did apprehend my selfe (in the accidentall meeting with this Sermon, after such my forementioned discourse) to be called by a speciall Providence to set pen to paper, to vindicate the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of God; and did thinke it my <hi>duty,</hi> and that I was <hi>bound</hi> in Conscience, (being a Minister of God) to warne all men of the danger, and to discover the <hi>snare,</hi> which is layd to catch and draw them into wayes of <hi>Bloud and

And I know M. <hi>Marshall</hi> is an able man, and my selfe weake in compare with him, yet in the cause of God, I am not affraid to take up the <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> against him. I have been bold once already, even to provoke him into the publique lists, for to justifie his <hi>new</hi> and most <hi>ungospellike</hi> way; but his <hi>Conscience</hi> or his <hi>Courage</hi> would not serve him to answer my letter; and therefore I hope that grace is not quite extinguished in him: perhaps (through Gods blessing) if this ensuing discourse come to his hand, he may see more of his errour, and of the hurt he hath done thereby to others; and so maybe awakened to glorifie God, and his truth by a <hi>self denying recantation</hi>: my humble prayers, are and shall be to God for him, that he may so doe; And I desire of you all (Christian Readers) that you would joyn with me in the same prayer for him: and also that God would molli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I shall be bold to shew how M. <hi>Marshall</hi> is mistaken in all these particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is seasonable</hi> (saies he) <hi>to the times wherein we live, when abundance of mighty Enemies rise up against the Lord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Church.</hi> Now in this I suppose M. <hi>Marshall</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat himselfe, for these times wherein we live, are times of the Gospell, and therefore are, or should be times of blessing, whereas the Text, is a Text of the old time, a Text of cursing. And indeed although <hi>abundance of mighty enemies doe rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, and against his Church,</hi> yet Christ in the Gospell, did not leave his Church either precept or example, to curse her enemies; no nor the enemies of the Lord himselfe: but he hath left both precept and example directly to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Precept. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.43, 44, 45. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He speakes not only to them there present, but to his whole Church; and what he then spake was to endure for ever, and to be a rule to her throughout
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51457:6"/>
all ages, in cases of this nature: His command is, that she should <hi>blesse</hi> and not <hi>curse,</hi> yea that she should blesse them that curse her: the words are these, <hi>you have heard that it hath been said</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in old time) <hi>thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy; but I say unto you</hi> (saies Christ) <hi>love your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, pray for them that despightfully use you, and persecute you, that you may be,</hi> (or may approve your selves to be) <hi>the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he deales thus with those that be his enemies, he makes the Sun to shine, and his raine to fall, both upon the evill and upon the good, if you love them only that love you, or salute your brethren only</hi> (those of your own opinion, of your own side or faction) <hi>what doe you more then the Publicans or Heathens doe,</hi> who have no acquaintance with God, with Christ, or with his Gospell) <hi>be you therefore perfect as your heavenly father is perfect:</hi> as if he had said, it becomes you, that professe your selves to be mine, to endeavour after more then an Heathenish perfection, it is an Heavenly perfection, which you must strive for; and to obtaine this, you must leave the practices of old time, which were to hate and curse your Enemies, and you must practice the cleane contrary.</p>
               <p>And for the better understanding of this, let me here by the way, minde the World again, of what I have already informed her in my Treatise of <hi>The right nature and temper of the spirit of the Gospell: viz.</hi> that there is a great difference between the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, those before Christ, and those since his coming, not in respect of time, it selfe; (for that is alwaies the same) but in respect of the coming of Christ; who brought with him a new spirit, which both must and doth manifest it selfe in all his true servants.</p>
               <p>The former times, might haply be times for cursing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; times of death and terrour; Gods name then by which he was known and called, was <hi>Deus ultionum</hi> the God of Revenge,<note place="margin">Psal. 94.1.</note> for as such a one, he was pleased then oft-times to discover himselfe: <hi>Adam</hi> having sinned, was presently cast out of Paradise. <hi>Corah,</hi> and his companions having Rebelled, vengeance speedily laid hold upon them, <hi>Meroz</hi> having faulted was presently Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but by the coming of Christ, the times were changed to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51457:7"/>
times of mercy and favour, times of grace and pitty, of patience and forbearance, of life and Salvation; and God from thence forth was called by a new name:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>scil. Pater misericordiarum,</hi> and <hi>Deus consolationum,</hi> the Father of mercies and God of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and as such a one he declares himselfe, he dealt more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearingly with <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> then formerly he had done with <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> then <hi>Saul,</hi> went breathing out threatnings against Gods Saints, yet mercy reached him; <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the Theefe were great sinners, yet vengeance did not overwhelme them; yea many of those that crucified Christ, were not taken away as they deserved; (but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.) tasted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Had <hi>Meroz</hi> been standing in the daies of the Gospell (in Christs time,) and had failed in her duty, as she here did, she should not presently have been loaden with a Curse; but rather reprooved and admonished of her Errour, and had time granted her to repent in: and therefore though this Text of M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> might haply have been seasonable, for the old times, to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Captaines and Leaders of the Lords Hosts</hi> (as he calls those that he preached it unto;) yet it doth not follow that 'tis a like seasonable now. For by the comming of Christ (I say) there was a change made in the times, and so ought there to be in men, in their thoughts, words and carriages; yea and in their preaching too, in which there must Consideration be had to times and seasons.</p>
               <p>But I returne, and will second that Precept of our Saviour, with the Testimony of his two great Apostles S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> both Preachers in the time of the Gospell; and both indued with the Spirit and minde of Christ: first S. <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>render not evill for evill, or railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the blessing,</hi> whence we learne, that men by the Gospell are called to Christianity, for this very purpose, that they may shew themselves to differ from all the world beside, in blessing their Enemies, when they deserve it not; and by so doing they doe fit themselves to be Heires of the blessing of God.</p>
               <p>And then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also, doth urge this truth in such a way of enforcement, with such a phrase, as may challenge our speciall

And let not any object that these Evangelicall precepts, doe onely concerne our carriages towards our owne personall Enemies, and not towards those that are the Enemies of Christ, and his Church; for I conceive that Persecutors of Christians, raylers, and those that offer wrong, or render evill to others, are no friends of Christ; and besides as our Saviour told us (in the place before quoted) 'tis the condition of <hi>God our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (whom we must endeavour to be like, <hi>to doe good to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull, and to the Evill</hi>; and such sure are his Enemies, whom he doth not looke, we should use worse then himselfe doth: we must not thinke to be more righteous, or zealous then he; nor must we begin our vomit, or Execrations, before God begins his: for indeed the Church her selfe (as M. <hi>Perkins</hi> inferreth) hath onely power to pronounce him accursed, whom God first accurseth: and the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. tells us twise over, for our better observance, and remembrance, what kind of man that is, who is under the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Lord: even <hi>he that preacheth another Gospell,</hi> or any other Doctrine for Gospell contrary to that, of Peace, and Love, and Patience and Obedience, which himselfe had Preached: <hi>If any man</hi> (saies he) <hi>Preach unto you; any other Gospell,</hi> (or any thing else for Gospell) <hi>then what we have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, let him be accursed:</hi> it concernes M. <hi>Marshall</hi> therefore to consider of himselfe and of his Doctrine: But this for Precept.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The example of our Saviour speakes as home, to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Marshalls</hi> judgement; as his Precepts have done: when himselfe was here upon the Earth, and had <hi>abundance</hi> of Enemies, and those <hi>mighty</hi> ones too, who did rise against him: the Text saies: <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat, with the Gentiles,</hi>

                  <hi>and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israell were all gathered together,</hi> (and did rise like one man) <hi>against the Lord Christ</hi>: yet we doe not read of one Curse that he bestowed upon them; much lesse did he throw out any Curses against <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, that forswore him, and fled away from him, and <hi>did not helpe him</hi> (their Lord and Master) <hi>against the mighty</hi>: no, but he prayed both for the one, and for the other: yea for his most deadly Enemies, he powred forth

That <hi>all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Doctrines, which doe not sute with the end of Christs comming, are sinfull motions, and sinfull Doctrines</hi>; and such are all those that doe not tend to Peace and mercy, to the blessing, and salvation of men. And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. we may learne too: that <hi>all we who live under the Gospell, must mind and speake, Preach and doe, onely that which suites with the spirit of the Gospell</hi>: and therefore looke how farre M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> Text doth dissent from the end of Christs comming, and from the gentlenesse of the Spirit of the Gospell; so farre is it from being seasonable in these times: so that the ground of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> mistake in this particular was, he did not consider the <hi>Change of the Times</hi>; but no marvaile of it, for we see two great Apostles were once in the same Error.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Marshall</hi> saies, his Text is seasonable, in respect <hi>of the temper of most people, who generally mind their owne things,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51457:8"/>
and not the things of Christ.</hi> But is it seasonable therefore to curse them? Will that make them mind their owne things lesse and Christs more? I apprehend otherwise, and that from a three fold Argument: one from Scripture, another from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason, and a third from sensible experience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Scripture teacheth the contrary.</hi> The Apostle in that very Chapter (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.) whence that phrase is borrowed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi> gives no such warrant; but rather if we marke him doth teach men, to <hi>mind their owne things lesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 3, 4 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and the things of Christ more,</hi> by laying downe before them the example of Christs great love to mankind; his Humility and sufferings in their behalfe; by shewing how he denyed himselfe and his owne glory, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their advancement; and from hence he provokes men to be like him, in discovering the same mind, and affection to be in themselves towards him, and <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. he exhorts them, to <hi>doe all things without murmurings and disputings,</hi> surely then without Cursings, and he gives this reason, <hi>that you may be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and harmelesse, the Sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a froward and perverse Generation</hi>; for the gaining and winning of them, inferring that if they should doe otherwise, if they should curse those that were not of their owne side, and temper; they being of a perverse and crooked disposition, would returne like for like, yea and speake evill of God whose Children they professed themselves to be, and so there would be nothing but disputings and quarrellings, fightings and shedding of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bloud, even as there is now in this Land amongst us.</p>
               <p>So in another place 'tis said that <hi>the Servant of God,</hi> (who would win others to mind the things of God) <hi>must not strive,</hi> (much lesse curse) <hi>but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach patient,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.24.25.</note> 
                  <hi>in meeknesse instructing them that be contrary minded,</hi> (and that oppose themselves,) <hi>trying if God will</hi> (as peradventure that way he will) <hi>give them repentance to acknowledge the truth, and so be recovered out of the Devills snare,</hi> (wherein doublesse all they are intangled that mind their owne things, more then the things of Christ.) In those purer times, this was the onely way which Gods Ministers tooke, to alter mens mindes and tempers: <hi>we beseech you</hi> (saies the Apostle) <hi>to be reconciled to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19, 20.</note> nay <hi>God by us beseecheth you:</hi> God himselfe the person offended, seeketh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51457:9"/>
and prayeth to be reconciled with his Enemies; even as our gratious King hath done to be at peace with them, that have so highly abused him. The Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> forespeaking of these times,<note place="margin">Hos. 11.4.2.14.</note> tells us, that God would draw people to himselfe with the <hi>Chaines of Love,</hi> he would take them aside and <hi>speake friendly</hi> to them, pardon their iniquity, cover their sinnes, and so <hi>allure them</hi> in a gentle way, to mind him more, and themselves lesse. And shall any pretender for God or Christ, thinke harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and cursing a better way, or meane to effect the same thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Naturall Reason perswades the contrary.</hi> He that knowes whereof man is made, and what is in man, and is the searcher of his Heart, yea and the changer of it too, Reason saies, can best of all direct in the way to alter the same. Besides if it be true (which the Apostle saies) that the <hi>preaching of the Law</hi> doth put us out of frame and temper,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> by meanes of <hi>sinne that dwelleth in us,</hi> which becomes thereby more <hi>outragious:</hi> then Reason sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests that much more will the <hi>preaching of Curses,</hi> doe the same thing. Againe that course which is not availeable, to draw one man to another, betweene whom there is a lesser distance; can never be Effectuall to draw men to God, betweene whom the distance is farre greater. That which cannot provoke us to love our Neighbours as our selves, or to mind his things as our owne, can never prevaile, to stirre us up to love God better then our selves, and to mind the <hi>things of Christ</hi> above our owne: Reason teacheth all this. I confesse these harsh Themes or Texts, may be suteable enough (as they may be handled,) to drive people out of themselves, and to make them mind their owne affaires but little, but how they should drive any nearer unto God (unlesse by accident,) or cause them to <hi>set their affections on things above,</hi> my Reason cannot apprehend; our blessed Saviour would not goe in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Marshalls</hi> way, when he dealt with <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traitor; for when that Apostate desciple, (for his worldly advantage sake) went (as a Chaplaine) with the Souldiers to apprehend his Lord and Soveraigne: Christ did not at that time, fall to curse him, for minding his mony more, then his Master, his gaine, more then his Conscience; but with a mild Compellation, doth insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate unto him, how he covered a most foule Treason under a faire pretence: <hi>friend</hi> (saies he) <hi>betrayest thou the Son of Man
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51457:9"/>
with a kisse:</hi> which very manner of speech, without all question, did so worke upon the Spirit of the Traitor afterward, that he never joyed in his mony more; but ere long, brings it back to the <hi>Close Committee,</hi> and there he leaves it; confessing that <hi>he had betrayed Innocent Bloud:</hi> now surely by the consent even of Reason, this course which Christ tooke, is most seasonable to the temper of <hi>those people that mind their owne things most,</hi> if we would worke in them a sight of their Errour, and not that which M. <hi>Marshall</hi> seemes to fancy. Which also</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Experience it selfe contradicteth:</hi> M. <hi>Marshall</hi> teacheth us in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Page</hi> of his Sermon, that to Curse is, <hi>maledicere verbo malefacere re, to speake evill, to revile, to reproach, to wish mischiefe unto, to doe any evill against a man, to execute indeed (to the utmost of power) what one would wish in word:</hi> (in briefe, 'tis to deale with a man as M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> Faction have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ince dealt with the <hi>King</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with the <hi>Queene.</hi>) But did ever any one read, or heare, or by experience see, any man that was yet a stranger to God, or to Religion, converted by these meanes? How this Generation of <hi>New Reformers,</hi> are like to prevaile for Christ, in this their way, let all men judge according to observation.</p>
               <p>It is most true, they have not failed in any one of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> particulars, in their endeavours with the <hi>Queene,</hi> they have <hi>spoken evill of her, reviled her, reproached her, slandered her, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her, spoyled her, shot at her, persecuted and hunted her out of the Kingdome, done her all the mischiefe both in word and deed, which was in their power to doe</hi>; and sorry they were, that their power was not answerable to their will, to have proceeded far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their evills against her: and all this was to bring her into love with the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which they (most scandalously and falsely) say, themselves are of: though indeed of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world the true <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> doth most of all, oppose and contradict such wayes and courses: and they are the greatest Enemies that ever the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> had; thus to slander and disgrace the same: yea they have occasioned hereby, many unhallowed men and women, to blaspheme our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and to commend of that of the Adversaries of <hi>Rome:</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> had never such an Harvest in <hi>England</hi> this foureskore yeares put altogether, as he hath had in these foure yeares last past, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51457:10"/>
since these men have managed the <hi>Militia.</hi> This experience doth teach us; and on the other side the same Mistrisse doth assure us, that the onely way to worke an Evangelicall temper, in those that differ from us; is to make unto them a presentation of Christs Example, in our teaching, to discover his Conditions in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours, to manifest his meeknesse, and affability in our speeches; which course indeed doth mightily calme the rage of sinne, and extinguish the heat of it: yea it tames the heart of a sinner, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivates his spirit, and after a manner inforceth him to <hi>mind his owne things lesse, and the things of Christ more.</hi> O had our <hi>New Reformers</hi> but gone this way to worke, I dare boldly say they might have done God much service, but their pleading for the <hi>Militia,</hi> was a plaine disclaiming of this way of Christ. And thus we see from <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> that M. <hi>Marshall</hi> is as much mistaken in the seasonablenesse of his Text in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond respect, as in the former: and I suppose the ground of his mistake is this, he did not sufficiently consider of <hi>peoples tempers and dispositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Marshall</hi> saies: His Text is <hi>seasonable to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this dayes meeting, which is purposely for the helpe of the Lord, and his cause and people now distressed in Ireland</hi>: So that he conceives it seasonable (as I apprehend him) in respect of the <hi>day,</hi> or the <hi>duty</hi> thereon to be performed: yet the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded occasion of that dayes meeting, (as I take it) was to <hi>pray</hi> and not to <hi>curse.</hi> I did never read, that bitter cursing was ever injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as any part, of the duty of a fast day; and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile if the fruits of such fasting dayes, have proved so bitter to the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>I have heard both M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> and other Ministers of that Faction at some fifty or sixty miles distance, inveigh most bitterly against the <hi>Cavaleers</hi> for their Cursing and Swearing: the report whereof (doubtlesse) they did receive from some good hand; for to my griefe and sorrow I find, that notwithstanding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Military Articles, and frequent Proclamations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, many that have Relation to his Armies, are most extreamly given over to that hellish sinne; for in that particular they rather chuse to follow M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> doctrine, then that of their owne Ministers, who dislike the same: they thinke they may <hi>practice</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51457:10"/>
Cursing, as lawfully as he <hi>preach</hi> it: though I beleeve, they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake him therein; for he would have onely those of his <hi>owne</hi> side, to whom he preacheth, to practice the same; and not the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers,</hi> to whom it doth not belong; (nor indeed in respect of their cause so well become): But such is mans nature, <hi>Nittimur in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titum:</hi> in wayes of sinne, one will strive to out goe another: And let M. <hi>Marshall</hi> say what he can, the <hi>Cavaleers</hi> will account those in Rebellion against the King, as worthy of <hi>Curses,</hi> as they on the other side can account them.</p>
               <p>But this I must say of the <hi>Cavaleers,</hi> I could never observe any of them so transcendently bold, as to fancy, they did <hi>helpe God,</hi> or <hi>his cause</hi> by their <hi>Cursing</hi>; nor yet to professe publiquely, that the <hi>Fast day</hi> was a day <hi>seasonable</hi> for the practice thereof; nor dare we who are Ministers among them, teach any such doctrine, for <hi>we have not so learned Christ:</hi> no but let M. <hi>Marshall</hi> and all his side know; that we thinke, we are bound in Conscience upon the <hi>Fast dayes,</hi> to discover the horrid nature of the sinne of <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and of <hi>Cursing</hi> others, even to the faces of those we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive guilty of it; endeavouring thereby to humble their soules for it: And we pray our selves and teach others, that 'tis the duty of Christians to <hi>pray</hi> for all, and to <hi>curse</hi> none: no not those that are for the present <hi>Enemies</hi> to God, or to themselves; who thirst for the ruine of <hi>Christs Gospell,</hi> and of the <hi>defender</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of it; we hope and pray, for their Conversions, for we know not, but God may call them at the eleventh houre: onely we pray that <hi>their mischievous imaginations</hi> against the Lord, and against his Annoynted, and servants, <hi>may never prosper</hi>; that their Hypocrisie may be discovered; that so the simple well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning People may no longer be deluded by them, we pray, <hi>Fill their faces with shame of their owne doings, that they may seeke thy Name O Lord.</hi> We conceive that <hi>cursing</hi> of others, on the <hi>Fast day,</hi> would rather appeare to be an act of <hi>Pride</hi> in us, and of <hi>selfe justification</hi>: then of <hi>selfe condemnation,</hi> which is the proper act of a <hi>Fast day:</hi> we hope that those <hi>Prayers</hi> which we put up for our bloud-thirsty Enemies, as they are most <hi>selfe denying,</hi> so are they most <hi>suteable</hi> to the worke of Humiliation; and if they prove not effectuall in their behalfe, for whom they are made, yet in the end they will (through Gods gratious acceptance by Christs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51457:11"/>
meanes) prove most beneficiall and comfortable to our selves: And we thinke <hi>we helpe the Lord and his cause</hi> best; when we walke onely in that way, which himselfe doth lead us in, and wherein <hi>his cause</hi> alwayes at the last, hath best thrived and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered: and that hath been not the <hi>high way</hi> of <hi>Cursing</hi> and <hi>selfe advancing,</hi> but the <hi>low way</hi> of <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>selfe denying</hi>; yea we apprehend that 'tis the strength of God alone, that must pull downe his Enemies, and maintaine his <hi>owne cause,</hi> which he will undoubtedly doe, by some meanes, or other, when his wronged and afflicted people are <hi>fit</hi> for mercy and deliverance, and are brought to <hi>kisse the rod</hi> which beats them; and this we tell them they shall doe, when they leave <hi>cursing</hi> their Enemies, and with appeasednesse of Spirit can <hi>pray</hi> for them: this is the doctrine which we Preach unto them, to be practised on the <hi>Fast day,</hi> and on every day, and <hi>I beseech God give to every one of the Kings Subjects, and People, grace to follow it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. That in a time of generall Calamity, God sayes, that <hi>he sought for a man, to make up the Hedge, and stand in the gap before him, that he might not destroy the Land, but he found none.</hi> Had God looked for <hi>Cursers,</hi> or if <hi>they</hi> could have done the deed; doubtlesse he might in those dayes, as well as now, have found many; (for 'tis an easier thing to nature, and more common to <hi>curse</hi> Enemies, then to <hi>pray</hi> for them,) but he looked for a man that should act <hi>Moses</hi> part, who stood in the breach, and <hi>prayed</hi> for them, and so was a meanes to preserve them.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.10.— 14. &amp;c.</note> The Story it selfe is worth our observance; God offered to make <hi>Moses</hi> a <hi>great man,</hi> yea a <hi>mighty Nation</hi>: if he would but give him leave, to destroy those rebellious <hi>Israelites</hi> (who sure were Gods Enemies, for He doth not use to destroy his friends:) But <hi>Moses</hi> would not yeeld, though he might have come to great preferment by it. Had he been of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> mind, he would have thought it his duty, not onely to have left <hi>praying</hi> for them, (whereby he held Gods hands)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also to have fell a <hi>revileing, reproaching,</hi> and <hi>doing them all the mischiefe</hi> that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he could, and so have <hi>helped the Lord,</hi> more quickly to have destroyed them: But surely that <hi>selfe denying</hi> course of <hi>Moses,</hi> was more acceptable and pleasing to God, then this other of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Marshall</hi> would have been. And I beleeve (for my part) that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51457:11"/>
God on the <hi>Fast dayes,</hi> (when we meet togeather, to <hi>helpe him</hi> and his cause,) doth expect from us even such like prayers as <hi>Moses</hi> offered; and doth look that we his Ministers should call upon people, in <hi>that</hi> way and manner to afford their assistance: and I verily believe; had M. <hi>Marshall</hi> and all the Ministers on his side so done, the distressed people in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which he seems so specially to commiserate,) had been better <hi>helped,</hi> then they have been: for let us but consider, a little by the way, (more fully to evidence M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> mistake,) what great benefit this <hi>Cursing</hi> doctrine hath reached out to the <hi>afflicted Protestants</hi> in that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Preaching of this Sermon (which was <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 1641.) The <hi>predominant part</hi> of his Auditory, (their hearts being thereby fitted and prepared to <hi>Cruelty,</hi>) fell to put the same in practice: for hereupon the <hi>lands</hi> of that Nation were exposed to sale, by an <hi>Ordinance of the House,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of the <hi>Members</hi> (who it seems had drank downe a larger draught of his doctrine then the rest) would have had it also decreed, <hi>that the Irish should be rooted out from being a Nation,</hi> they should all be put to the sword, that so their very name <hi>might be had no more in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> for this indeed according to M. <hi>Marshall's</hi> phrase and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction (pag. 5.) was <hi>fully to curse them, vehemently to curse them, and never to leave cursing them,</hi> even to annihilate them by <hi>cursing</hi> them, whereupon the Popish <hi>Irish</hi> fearing to be quite outgone in cruelty by these <hi>new Reformers,</hi> grew desperate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and most outragiously mischievous against the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and against all that professed the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion. And verily I doe beleeve, that God was so highly displeased with those <hi>bloody purposes,</hi> those over-harsh <hi>decrees,</hi> those <hi>cursing do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> so contrary to the Gospell, from men professing the same; that he did for these things sake, suffer those wild and savage <hi>Irish,</hi> to be more prevalent in that Kingdom: and should I be in the case of those, that either <hi>Preached</hi> such doctrines; or had <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> such cruell purposes; or had <hi>layed out,</hi> any mony for <hi>Irish</hi> lands; or had been a <hi>means</hi> any way to provoke that people to be so <hi>outragiously</hi> desperate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and destructive as they have been; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve my Conscience would tell me, that God <hi>would lay to my charge, the guilt of that Protestant English blood there shed,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51457:12"/>
the King might <hi>justly</hi> lay unto me, the losse of those his Subjects; and I should alwaies think, <hi>that blood would pursue me, because I had not hated blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereby the way also, let me suggest two things: a Caveat and an observation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Caveat</hi> to all my countrymen of <hi>England</hi> of what side or faction soever, who begin now to be as bold with the lands and Estates, of some in their own Nation; as three years agoe they were with those of the <hi>Irish,</hi> both in buying and selling; the <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> I would have but remember, <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thinke that by their good Bargains there, God did foreadmonish them, to beware how they venture here. And the sellers I would have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Felton</hi> (that killed the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,)</hi> and withall, that their own Orders and doings, have taught men to make no scruple of shedding blood: <hi>'Tis no wisdome to put great spirits upon desperate courses,</hi> the Beare will more willingly <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life,</hi> then <hi>part with his skinne</hi> to make good the word of the Hunter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>observation</hi>: from the progresse of men in wayes of blood, <hi>quam tument gustato sanguine fauces,</hi> how dangerous the tast of blood is, it makes even a sheep grow wolfeish: <hi>si torrida parvus venit in ora cruor, itur in omne nefas,</hi> they that were lately accounted the persecuted flock of Christ, having lapt a little of the blood of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> how extreamly on the suddaine doe they thirst for the blood of their <hi>friends</hi>? they who at first devoured in their expectations, the lands of <hi>Strangers,</hi> and panted after the destruction of the Popish <hi>Irish</hi>; how greedy are they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, of the estates of their own <hi>Country-men,</hi> and thirsty after the ruine of the <hi>Protestant English.</hi>

And yet I know 'tis the opinion of some; that this Effusion of <hi>English</hi> Bloud was <hi>primum intentione,</hi> the first thing in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these unnaturall men; and the <hi>Irish</hi> Combustions were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51457:12"/>
onely raised as a mist, to <hi>cloud</hi> their purpose at home, that honest Eyes might not discerne it; for (notwithstanding M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> phrase, <hi>to help the distressed people in Ireland</hi>) 'tis too well known, that the present <hi>prevailing Faction</hi> amongst those whom in the next words he calls, <hi>the Captaines and Leaders of the Lords Host:</hi> were not onely <hi>neglective</hi> themselves, in affording ayde, but also <hi>obstructive</hi> to his sacred Majesty, who (in pitty to those <hi>poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed</hi>) would have ventured his <hi>Royall</hi> Person, to have carried comfort to them: so irkesome was it to his Pious Soule, to heare, that any of his Subjects, should want that protection, which throughout the time of his sole Government, they so happily had enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sod latebat Anguis in Herba,</hi> there was a pad in the Straw, which every one did not then see; the maine designe or worke to be done, was, <hi>to destroy the Government of Gods Church, and to overthrow Monarchy in this Kingdome</hi>; and to effect this, the <hi>Shipping</hi> and <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, must be <hi>griped</hi> into their hands; to which purpose, there was to be <hi>aliquid apparens,</hi> above board, to gaine some beliefe to <hi>Iealousies</hi> and <hi>Feares:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing the discontentments, and disposition of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, they cut of their Governours Head; and did providently forbeare to send any other to succeed him; that so they might render to them, an advantage to <hi>rebell,</hi> and to themselves a faire pretence to be <hi>possessed</hi> of the Men, Monyes, and Ammunition of this Kingdome. Which when they had got, <hi>Ireland</hi> is <hi>neglected,</hi> the poore <hi>distressed people</hi> there are <hi>massacred,</hi> the <hi>Subsidies</hi> given for their ayde, and the <hi>Contribution</hi> gathered for their reliefe, is <hi>imployed</hi> another way; many of our gallant men who at first went thither to their helpe, for want of timely supplies are <hi>slaine,</hi> (for had they lived a while longer, 'twas feared they might have done their King too much good service at their owne home,) and the rest of the Armies there abiding, were well nigh <hi>famished</hi> for want of maintenance; which they could not obtaine at last, but upon condition, they would first subscribe, to a kind of <hi>new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi> upon these new <hi>State men</hi>; and two of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> are sent over to require it of them.</p>
               <p>And here for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of this Opinion, let me declare by the way two things, which I shall desire the judicious Reader
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51457:13"/>
seriously to thinke upon; and let him conclude from the same, what his owne Reason and Conscience shall suggest.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What I have understood</hi> of His Majesties Princely care and wisdome to prevent those <hi>Irish</hi> miseries; had that Kingdom been so happy as to have tasted the fruits thereof. When they had cut off <hi>Strafford's Head,</hi> the King providently foreseeing, that those forces raised there, by the said <hi>Earle,</hi> (for his assistance in the Northern expedition,) if they continued together, (being <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Papists)</hi> might be mischievous in that Kingdome, after their Governours death, (who had he lived, was both able and ready enough to have kept them under from Rebelling:) therefore his Majesty ordered, they should be sent out from thence, and had granted their service to the Ambassadors of <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> soliciting the same at that time, in the behalfe of their severall Princes: in which particular, had not His Majesty been crossed; it had been impossible in human reason, there should have been any such suddain Combustions raised in <hi>Ireland:</hi> whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, they remaining there in a body; it was most likely (in all probability) they would act those evills, which now wofull experience can best declare. But the <hi>prevailing</hi> party at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> (who must be called the <hi>Saviours</hi> and <hi>Conservators</hi> of Kingdomes) would by no meanes, suffer the King to enjoy the freedome of his <hi>personall will</hi>; (for indeed, so they might have missed of their maine designe in <hi>England</hi>:) and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <hi>Iealousies</hi> and <hi>Feares,</hi> kept them still at home to make (as appeares by the effect,) a <hi>distressed Church and People in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to doe greater mischiefe then at that time could be feared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What my selfe received</hi> from the lips of a dying man; who was a Commander, and present in <hi>Dublin,</hi> when those two <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries</hi> (forementioned,) came thither to seduce the Armies from their Loyalty: who when they had by their cunning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, got the <hi>subscription</hi> of so many, as (in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits) the <hi>worke was even done</hi>; they began somewhat perkely, to discover themselves, and their cankred intentions in their prate one night at supper: one of them saying, that <hi>now all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, began to be weary of Monarchy: and did groane under the yoake thereof.</hi> Which expression that very Gentleman (from

               <p>Now I have given an hint how <hi>seasonable</hi> indeed his Text was to the <hi>purposes</hi> of some of his Auditors, and how <hi>usefull</hi> his doctrine hath since been in their <hi>practice</hi> of it, not to <hi>helpe,</hi> but to <hi>mischiefe the Lord, and his cause, and his distressed people in Ireland:</hi> but that it should be <hi>seasonable</hi> in that respect (which he affirmes) <hi>viz. to the occasion of that dayes meeting,</hi> which was to fast and pray, (as was pretended) I cannot yet perceive; surely therefore M. <hi>Marshall</hi> was mistaken in that <hi>apprehension</hi> also, and the ground of his mistake might be, he did not sufficiently remember, what was <hi>the duty of the day</hi>; I come now to the fourth respect.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> description, which he makes of his present Honourable Assembly, is a matter that requires our speciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: <hi>they should all be as the Lord, their Horses as his Horses, their Chariots as his Chariots, they being all called to be Captaines and Leaders of the Lords Host.</hi> The things that he would inferre from these words are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>That all men should looke upon the <hi>House of Commons</hi> (his present Auditory), or rather upon the most <hi>active</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing</hi> part thereof: as upon the <hi>strong, wise,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> God himselfe; and apprehend their <hi>requests</hi> as <hi>Commands,</hi> for ever to be obeyed, without dispute, even so long as they shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to propound them.</q>

               </p>
               <p>That this is M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> true meaning; I shall first evidence in part from his owne words; and then ile appeale to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whose judgement in these dayes (specially in a thing of this nature) is the best evidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>all men should take them as the Lord, their word as his, their requests as Commands, and alwayes to be obeyed</hi>: His owne expression to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle Dedicatory,</hi> before his Sermon doth prove it. <hi>It is fit</hi> (saies he) <hi>my obedience should last as long as your Commands,</hi> (which therefore are supposed to be never errant) <hi>for so I have alwayes interpreted your requests and desires to be</hi>: we can say no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to God himselfe, and no question but M. <hi>Marshall</hi> would have all men, of his mind: <hi>ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>all men should beleeve and take their cause to be Gods, &amp;c.</hi> is evident in that he saies, <hi>they are all called to be Leaders and Captaines of the Lords Host: called,</hi> that is, <hi>immediately</hi> by the Lord himselfe, as <hi>Deborah, Barack,</hi> and the <hi>Iudges</hi> of old were; by some speciall <hi>instinct</hi> and <hi>inspiration</hi>: no other kind of <hi>call</hi> can he challenge for them: for the King by whom God <hi>ordinarily</hi> calls, and makes <hi>Captaines and Leaders of his Host,</hi> I am sure M. <hi>Marshall</hi> himselfe will not say, did call them together, to doe as they doe, to set his Kingdomes in a Combustion, but rather to confirme, and establish them in a further Peace; not to <hi>raise</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against his owne Person, and expresse Commands; but to <hi>consult</hi> together for the tranquillity, and safety of his people. Now if they be such as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> intitles them, and so called, as he (without any proofe) supposeth them, then it must needs follow that they, who helpe them, <hi>helpe the Lord,</hi> and their cause, must be the cause of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>all who doe not helpe them and their cause, are to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51457:15"/>
accursed, accounted of, and dealt withall as was expressed,</hi> the tenour of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> discourse upon his Text, in the proofe of his doctrine, doth suffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntly declare, as I shall shew when I come to note his <hi>Misapplications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, that M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> meaning is the same, as was expressed, I doe <hi>appeale to the people</hi>; whose Evidence is as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in this case as M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> owne. They will witnesse with me, that they doe thus interpret and understand him: as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, not onely by the Prisoners that were taken at <hi>Brampton-Bryan</hi> Castle, (of whom is mention in the Preface to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,) but also by that <hi>extract of</hi> them, those miserable wretches, that were slaine at <hi>Hopton</hi> Castle: for they, while they maintained the same against the Kings Souldiers, amongst other revileing and blasphemous expressions, some of them would cry out: <hi>O you Rogues, you doggs, will you fight against the Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your redeemer:</hi> (which plainly infers, that 'tis a generall position, infused into them all, by their teachers, that their cause is the <hi>cause of God,</hi> and they that oppose them, <hi>oppose the Lord)</hi> which <hi>blasphemous</hi> expression, occasioned others as vile, from some of the prophaner sort of our men; (which indeed I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expresse;) and afterward when that Castle was taken, that blasphemy of theirs, together with other opprobrious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling speeches, did stir up that rage in the mercilesse Souldiers, which occasioned that barbarous, and inhumane slaughter of those miserable men; for which my heart hath often bled in secret (as God knowes); it being an Act, however <hi>deserved</hi> on the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers part, yet too too cruelly <hi>inflicted</hi> by the Kings men: most contradicting His Majesties meeke and gratious Spirit; of much disparage among vulgar people to His righteous Cause; and most unbeseeming Christian Souldiers; insomuch, that my prayer is, and shall ever be: <hi>good Lord smite the hearts of the Actors in, and Consenters unto, that bloody Tragoedy with true remorse for that their barbarous cruelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here by the way, I would have all men note, the originall cause of that and such like deeds of barbarousnesse, and inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the Preachers of that side infuse by their doctrines such <hi>blasphemous</hi> and <hi>bloody</hi> Principles, into their men; who being of the common sort doe think it part of their zeale; to discover the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51457:15"/>
same in <hi>words,</hi> as well as when they have power to performe it in <hi>deeds</hi>; and thereby doe exasperate the opposite party, to pay them home in their own Coyne; for they think they have as good grounds to reckon themselves to be for the Lord, as the others have: and if to be <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>cruell</hi> be the way to shew it, they can be as <hi>bloody</hi> as they; though I am sure, our men have not so learned Christ from their teachers: but alas! the <hi>examples</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though deadly Enemies, will prevaile more in matters of evill, then the <hi>precepts</hi> of any (though of neerest friends) in matters of good.</p>
               <p>And thus have we seen M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> mistakes, in the <hi>seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse</hi> of his Text, insomuch, that I suppose it may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, contrary to what he fancyeth, that his <hi>Text</hi> was most <hi>unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of the times,</hi> being <hi>times</hi> of the Gospell, and so <hi>times of Blessing</hi> and not of <hi>Cursing</hi>; of returning good for evill, and not on the contrary; of overcoming both ours and Gods Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with our benefits and Prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In respect of the temper of most People,</hi> who (in these last and worst dayes,) do generally <hi>mind their own things,</hi> and <hi>not the things of Iesus Christ,</hi> to please their own humours, their own corruptions, (which are rather to <hi>curse</hi> and wish hurt to others, then to <hi>dislike</hi> of such curses,) <hi>the things of Christ,</hi> (his precepts his commands) are contrary to our selfish inclinations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In respect to the occasion of the dayes meeting</hi>; which was (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Fast day</hi>) to humble themselves, for their former <hi>unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenesse</hi> towards their Brethren; to get their spirits meekned by Gods word, and so fitted to serve the Lord in their callings; and to be assistant to his cause and people, by their Prayers; which must proceed from hearts and mouths seasoned with <hi>Charity</hi> and not with <hi>Cursing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>But specially it seems to be a Text most unseasonable to the Honourable Assembly of Parliament</hi>; who all should be <hi>as the Lord,</hi> dealing out <hi>blessings</hi> to this Nation, as the Lord doth; and the rather because they were <hi>call'd</hi> together for that purpose; and not to be a <hi>Curse</hi> unto us: <hi>they are called</hi> (saies M. <hi>Marshall) to be Captains and Leaders of the Lords Host</hi>; I suppose he means (or should meane) under the <hi>Captain Generall</hi> Christ Iesus; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51457:16"/>
therefore 'tis fit they should be conformable to his <hi>Orders</hi>; and to his <hi>Example,</hi> in all their wayes and Carriages; He was merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, peaceable, and indulgent to his inferiors, and so should these have been provoked by him to be: whereas to Preach of <hi>Cursing</hi> to them, and so to <hi>imbittor</hi> their spirits, must needs be most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and <hi>unseasonable,</hi> and the only way to make them unlike the Lord, whose <hi>Leaders and Captains</hi> over us, they ought to be; I am sure, it hath been a meane to breed extreame disorders and confusions. And thus I have discovered M. <hi>Marshalls Misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> in the Choice of his Text, and so I end the first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is that which M. <hi>Marshall</hi> would insinuate to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods spirit in this his Text; and thus doe the vulgar sort of his Faction understand the same; as appeares by their calling themselves <hi>Gods owne people</hi>; and their cause <hi>Gods cause,</hi> and the opposers of themselves and it, <hi>fighters against the Lord and his Church.</hi> Their Armies they call <hi>Gods Host.</hi> And (as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> doth) the House of Commons, <hi>the Captaines and Leaders of it</hi>; and all that side not with them, they account and call <hi>Malignants:</hi> and thinke they doe but their duty (according to M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> doctrine) to <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>revile</hi> them, to <hi>rob</hi> them, and to <hi>shed their bloud.</hi>

               <p>And indeed for M. <hi>Marshall</hi> since his whole endeavours are to promote that cause; I wonder (knowing his ancient ingenuity) that he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that it needs no proving? or that all men looke with his Eyes, and have captivated their faith and judgements to the <hi>censure of the Parliament,</hi> as himselfe hath done? must a thing of necessity be true or false as the <hi>Parliament judgeth?</hi> because they say their owne cause is good, and the Kings bad, themselves are in the right, and he in the wrong, must it therefore by all men, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Haesitation) be so taken? must all men build upon M. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalls</hi> foundation, and walke by that unwarrantable rule, which he hath chosen to walke by? there is no reason he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it.</p>
               <p>And now least any should thinke, that I mistake M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> I will Evidence that he doth fancy his <hi>Parliament</hi> to be <hi>infallible,</hi> and that he hath submitted his owne faith and judgement to its <hi>determination.</hi> I will to this purpose, give you his owne words, in a certaine Letter of his, to a namelesse Friend; (it was written in vindication of himselfe, from the imputation of madnesse, and published to the world in <hi>Midsommer moone</hi> last yeare, 1643.) In which after he had handled his <hi>case of Divinity,</hi> (as he calls it) and proved (as himselfe fancieth) the <hi>lawfulnesse of resisting the Supreame Magistrate,</hi> though most poorly indeed, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like his former selfe, (as all who knew him may easily judge,) He comes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. to a second case: which he calls <hi>matter of fact</hi>: and therein (forgetfull of himselfe and of that Scripture: <hi>Thou shalt not speake evill of the Ruler of the People</hi>) he falls foule upon the King: and (like a mad man indeed) layes load upon his Soveraigne: saying, <hi>that His Majesty being seduced by wicked Councell, did levy Warre against his Parliament.</hi> He meanes at <hi>that</hi> time, (for of <hi>then</hi> he speaketh) when the Parliament raised their first Army; which, he sayes, was <hi>onely in their owne defence:</hi> and it was at that present, when the King had neither Men, nor Armes, nor Ships left him, nor scarce mony to buy himselfe and Children bread; for they had robbed and cheated him of all. And therefore well may the question be asked M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there was of the Kings leavying Warre; and I beleeve his Conscience expected the same, and thereupon provided his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer ready, in the same place; which sure himselfe thinkes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly full, and able to give all men satisfaction, <hi>my great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> sayes he, <hi>is, the Parliament judgeth so.</hi> 'Tis worth our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation;

no evidence he had of any <hi>word</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of Hostility on the Kings part: for this, he sayes, was his <hi>great Evidence,</hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then which he could not shew; nor needs he, as himselfe supposeth: for he proceeds further, and sayes, <hi>the Iudgement of a Parliament of England, was never till now, questioned by a people of England.</hi> And yet we read of a Parliament in <hi>England</hi> called the <hi>mad Parliament</hi>; and of another called the <hi>wicked Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and Posterity will find mention of a <hi>Bloudy and deceitfull Parliament</hi>: the <hi>Iudgement</hi> of the first of these, was surely questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by some people of <hi>England</hi>; when they intitled it an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Rebells</hi>: and so was the <hi>wisedome</hi> of the second, when all the Lawes made therein were afterward annihilated: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may much more truly affirme; that a <hi>King of England,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received so much prejudice, and unchristian usage as now, by any <hi>Parliament in England.</hi> But the man goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But here by the way, we may conjecture, that M. <hi>Marshall</hi> will never hence forth finde fault with the <hi>Popish</hi> Collyer for blindly beleeving as the <hi>Church beleeves</hi>; who thinkes it his owne duty, to beleeve as the <hi>Parliament Iudgeth.</hi> And here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so let's note the reason, which too few observe, why he and others of that side, doe conceive, as appeares by their practice, that telling of <hi>untruths,</hi> breaking of <hi>Oathes,</hi> resisting and defaming <hi>the King,</hi> shedding of <hi>innocent bloud,</hi> and such like things are in these dayes (if some men commit them) no sinnes: this doubtlesse is their <hi>great Evidence. The Parliament judgeth so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But seeing we have heard M. <hi>Marshall</hi> thus farre; let's listen to him a little further. The <hi>Iudgement</hi> of his Parliament, is not onely a sufficient ground for his <hi>Faith,</hi> but for his <hi>practice</hi> also. For he proceeds in his discourse; and from the supposed <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Supremacy</hi> of his Parliament, makes this Collary: <hi>And therefore if I should give none other account of mine entring upon

               </p>
               <p>But that passage of M. <hi>Marshall</hi> is worthy our further obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that he sayes, <hi>His entring upon his Office in the Army was not to fight or to meddle in the Councell of Warre, &amp;c.</hi> They that knew M. <hi>Marshall</hi> in former times; how <hi>sensible</hi> he was wont to be in his discourses; how <hi>true</hi> in his words; and how carefull, that his actions shall not interfere with his sayings; may be ready to thinke that (notwithstanding, his endeavours to free himselfe from the imputation of madnesse) either he had some straine of distraction, when he wrote this; or that the sinne of Rebellion like the witchcraft of <hi>Circe,</hi> had transformed him into another Creature.</p>
               <p>For <hi>was it not to fight?</hi> why then did he (who was wont like a Minister of Christ, to thinke himselfe sufficiently armed with Gods word and spirit) Souldier like, get him a <hi>Buffe Coat,</hi> and ride from his home with his <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Pistolls,</hi> to the admiration of many his former peaceable acquaintance; who tooke him till then, for a man of <hi>another spirit?</hi> it should seeme by this, that when he entred his Office in the Army, he had a purpose to fight. Nay, I have heard some of his friends, (<hi>Clergy men</hi> of that Faction) whether truly or falsely, I cannot tell, glory much in his activity and valour that way; How like a <hi>Couragious Captaine,</hi> he went before the Souldiers into the Field; incouraged them by his owne example to the Battell; yea brought up the <hi>Rere,</hi> Charged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at <hi>Edgehill</hi>: some say, he gathered up the <hi>Bullets</hi> in his Hat, in the time of the fight, and brought them to the Souldiers to shoot
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51457:19"/>
againe: though I confesse I have heard others say, that when he and the rest of the Ministers of that side, had set their Christian Countrymen togeather by the eares, themselves got up upon an Hill a mile or two off, whence with their <hi>Prospective glasses,</hi> they beheld them fighting; till being discovered by a Party of the Kings that made towards them, they made use of their Horse heeles, and deviding themselves, rid severall wayes, but met all at <hi>Warwicke</hi> Castle before the next morning.</p>
               <p>But why <hi>not to fight</hi>? was it because <hi>fighting</hi> is unlawfull for a Minister of the Gospell to practise? why then, is not <hi>exasperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and provoking others to fight unlawfull too? doth not the Scripture inhibit Ministers to be <hi>stirrers</hi> up of others to strife and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>their requests, Commands, and hold it fit his obedience should last as long as their proposalls:</hi> be they never so large or so unlawfull.</p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Marshall</hi> tells us also, that <hi>his entring upon his office in the Army was onely to teach them, how to behave themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word,</hi> that is to say: of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> according to their Ordinances and Declarations; which Commanded <hi>to kill, slay and destroy</hi> all that should oppose them. I see not how he can meane according to the <hi>word of God</hi>: for then he should have taught them to <hi>put up their swords,</hi> and told them (as Christ <hi>Peter)</hi> that <hi>he who smiteth with the sword</hi> (viz: without or against authority) <hi>shall perish by the sword.</hi> He should with S. <hi>Paul</hi> have taught, <hi>avenge not your selves</hi> but <hi>blesse them that persecute you, blesse and curse not.</hi> He should with the wise Preacher have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled them, <hi>to keep the Kings Commandement,</hi> and that in regard of <hi>their Oath of Allegeance,</hi> which they have taken in the name and presence of God. He should with S. <hi>Peter</hi> have urged <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Lords sake, to the King the supream</hi> Magistrate under God, and with <hi>David</hi> he should have proclaimed, that <hi>he who lifteth up his hand against Gods Annoynted, cannot be guiltlesse.</hi> He should have said to his Country-men as <hi>Moses</hi> did to the two stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Israelites, why do you contend? you are brethren</hi>: he should have cryed with that great Apostle, <hi>study to be quiet,</hi> and <hi>as much as in you lyeth (if it be possible) live peaceably with all men.</hi> Had M. <hi>Marshall</hi> taught them behaviour according to <hi>Gods Word</hi>; he should have taught them such doctrines as these, or at least he should have preachd such duties to them as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did to the Souldiers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. <hi>do violence to no man, &amp;c.</hi> but hath he and the rest of his Brethren done so? whence then is this complaining in our streets, of Houses, Horses, and Men <hi>Plundered</hi> by the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament side</hi>? whence that lamentable crying of desolate women and children, exposed to nakednesse, hunger and all misery? whence that <hi>captivity</hi> of peaceable men, because supposed rich or Loyall? whence these high abuses by Souldiers of that party to Ministers and Churches?

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51457:20"/>
yet have the rest persisted in their way: if M. <hi>Marshall entred his Office in the Army,</hi> to teach the Souldiers to <hi>behave themselves according to the word of God,</hi> why hath he not taught them better? why hath he not at least stopped them in the Commission of these things? why hath he not taken the hint from some of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the actors, to apply their sinne upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of others, as formerly he was wont to doe upon smaller evidence? is he so taken up in his thoughts with the misbehavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>Cavileeres,</hi> that he can see none of these miscarriages in his owne party; or are they no miscarriages, because <hi>they</hi> do them? surely M. <hi>Marshall</hi> hath not discharged himselfe in that particular, for which he entred his Office, if by the <hi>word</hi> he meanes <hi>Gods word</hi>; or else, he is lesse perswasive and powerfull in his teaching, then he was wont to be; indeed (being so farre out of Christs way, no marvaile if God refuse to smile upon his labours with a blessing as heretofore. But how <hi>mildely,</hi> and <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully</hi> M. <hi>Marshall</hi> doth teach those of his Faction, and how <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word</hi> to behave themselves, we shall see hereafter in this his Sermon; and perhaps shall thinke from what we shall therein finde, that <hi>to behave themselves according to the word,</hi> in his sense, <hi>is to justifie themselves in their wicked waies, by pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abusing the word</hi>; for that is the thing which by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he teacheth in the same: and herein I confesse he hath been too unhappily successefull upon the weake spirits of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people.

praise, that some of eminent ranke in all Ages, have been friends and defenders of the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Indeed to that observation M. <hi>Marshall</hi> in some following words addeth, and that most truly, (for I will not omit the notice of any his truths, I had rather passe by his errors, if not too palpable and detrimentall to the glory and Church of God.) I say he addeth there, that <hi>the Lambs followers and servants, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the poore and ofscouring of the world, i. e.</hi> so accounted, and so content to be esteemed; they mind not great things to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the dammage of others right, as to get the <hi>Militia</hi> of Kingdomes into their hands; to <hi>domineere</hi> over their superiors; to <hi>dethrone</hi> Kings, that themselves may raigne; or to <hi>persecute</hi> the Annoynted of the Lord, they accounting themselves, the <hi>ofscour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things,</hi> (according to others esteem of them,) do know that their time of <hi>reigning</hi> is not yet, nor to be, in this world, for Christs Kingdome whereof they are heires, lies not here below (as himselfe hath said,) therefore they look after no greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, then are sutable to themselves in their particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and stations; the <hi>Lambs followers and servants</hi> are Lambs too, 'tis against their natures to play the Wolves; to thirst for the blood and ruine of others; <hi>maledicere verbo, malefacere re,</hi> to <hi>curse, revile, reproach, to wish or doe any kind of mischiefe,</hi> were not the conditions of him, that was led <hi>like a sheep to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and therefore none of their conditions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This observation also of M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> would have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a cleerer understanding, if it had been a little fuller thus: <hi>when it is manifestly evidenced by the word of God, that the mighty of the World doe oppose the Lord, Gods meanest servants having a lawfull call from the supreame Magistrate, or being Authorized and Commanded by him, unto whom they have sworn Allegiance, must not be affraid or unwilling to oppose the mighty.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here M. <hi>Marshall</hi> is defective also, both in his explication, and expression, for he should have unfolded who are <hi>Gods people,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51457:22"/>
by some such evident markes, and notes, as that ignorant and well meaning men, might not be mistaken in affording their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance: we read in the Gospell of some that should come in these last daies <hi>in sheeps cloathing, who within would be ravening wolves</hi>; and that should be so cunning in their Hypocriticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions; that they <hi>should deceive many,</hi> yea <hi>if possible the very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>: now if men should give their assistance to these as to <hi>God's People,</hi> they should doe much amisse.</p>
               <p>Againe, he should have added <hi>in Gods way,</hi> and said: <hi>who ever comes to give assistance to the Lords people, in the Lords way, the Lord doth interpret them to give it to himselfe</hi>: for as when a Souldier yeelds his bodily assistance to a Captaine, but will not be ordered by him, to imploy it in that way, which he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s.</hi> Now <hi>Gods way</hi> wherein he expects assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from men, is the same that Christ himselfe went in, (who was the greatest <hi>helper</hi> and <hi>Honourer</hi> of God the Father, that ever was:) and it was the <hi>Humble low way,</hi> the <hi>selfe-denying way,</hi> the patient <hi>submissive way:</hi> not the high lofty, insulting <hi>way,</hi> not the domineering <hi>way,</hi> which the flesh affecteth, not the <hi>way</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, of lying or of blood: but of obedience, truth and Peace.</p>
               <p>And thus I have been bold a little to cleare M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, that the vulgar may more rightly understand them; not but that I know he was able to have done it himselfe: only, when he Preached this Sermon, he begun to be engaged in this <hi>new cause</hi>; and haply his misguided zeale, and desire was so eager to get abettors thereunto; that he was lesse faithfull at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the worke of God, then indeed was fitting; or then I hope he will hereafter be, when God in mercy, shall set him free againe, from this <hi>bloudy,</hi> and unlucky engagement.</p>
               <p>And now I come to consider of his main doctrine, which (with confidence) he doth propound, after the uttering his unperfect notes, and it is in these words.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And that I take to be the true sense of the words: So that briefly I may say, the Text is either a <hi>charge of Christ,</hi> the great <hi>Angell of the Lord</hi> to Supreame Magistrates; (such as <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barack</hi> at that present were;) that they should strictly <hi>punish,</hi> such their unfaithfull Subjects, as doe not assist them or adhere unto them, (being called) in times of danger. Or 'tis a divine <hi>Authorization</hi> of themselves to lay their <hi>curse</hi> upon such on such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Or else 'tis the <hi>charge of Deborah and Barack,</hi> or of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magistrate under God (who in Scripture is entitled, the <hi>Angell of God,</hi>) unto his Officers, authorizing them, to inflict pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon such offenders; and the true Doctrine or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Text, truly expounded is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subjects may expect a blessing, or a curse, according as they doe, or doe not, joyne their strength and best assistance, to help the King or Supreame Magistrate against his Rebellious Subiects, when they grow mighty in strength or in oppression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or because <hi>Gods people</hi> (if they be truly his) will alway help Gods Vicegerent, and M. <hi>Marshall</hi> best affects that expression,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51457:24"/>
I will come as neare him, even in words as I can, and lay downe the poynt thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>People have cause to iudge themselves under a curse, or under a blessing, accordingly as they doe, or doe not, ioyne their strength and best assistance to the Lords people, against their Enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully called thereunto by the Supreame Magistrate, to whom they have sworne and owe Allegiance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the rectifying of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Text, and doctrine from the same. I now come to note his Misapplications of other Scriptures, for the confirmation (as he takes it) of his doctrine.</p>

               <p>MAster <hi>Marshall</hi> (if we observe him) doth prove his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, after the same fashion as he raised it: for as he drew his <hi>generall</hi> from a <hi>particular,</hi> so he proves his <hi>Generall</hi> by <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</hi> out of the same Chapter.

               </p>
               <p>In this relation of M. <hi>Marshall</hi> we may note three things. 1. The <hi>sinne</hi> of <hi>Moab.</hi> 2. The <hi>Iudgement</hi> to be inflicted upon <hi>Moab.</hi> 3. The <hi>charge</hi> of God to the Executioners thereof, all which if we a little look into; we shall perceive, whether the example runs Parallell with M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> pretended purpose, as he would have it supposed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The sin of Moab</hi>: was their ill-neighbourhood, they did not shelter <hi>Israell</hi> in the day of their Calamity: for we must know; that the destruction of <hi>Iudea</hi> by the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> was some three yeare before that of <hi>Moab,</hi> and bordering upon that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many of the <hi>Iewes</hi> fled thither for safety, (as many Loyall <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> being plundered and persecuted by M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> Faction, have lately done, into some Counties of this Nation, where they have been strangers:) and doubtlesse this was by Gods Councell and Providence, to try their neighbourly affections; and that the <hi>Moabites</hi> might have an advantage o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:51457:25"/>
them of that little they carried away with them, <hi>derided</hi> at their miseries, and even <hi>skipt</hi> for joy at the mention of their calamity, is may be noted from <hi>Ier.</hi> 48.27. and without question this was one of the sinnes, for which God sent judgement upon <hi>Moab</hi> (as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> observes well;) and surely <hi>her pride</hi> was another, for <hi>Esay.</hi> 16.6. she <hi>was very proud, and haughty, full of malice,</hi> and a great dissembler, a <hi>truster in lyes Ier.</hi> 48.30. and in <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. of that Chapter 'tis intimated from whence it was, they were so proud, <hi>viz.</hi> from their <hi>mightinesse and strength for the Warre,</hi> their strong workes and Fortifications; and their plenty of treasures, which by right or wrong they had gotten to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; many holds, store of <hi>Militia,</hi> much treasure, and much people, many populous Townes and Cities were in the <hi>Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with them, and under their commands, which are named in the same Chapter from <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>ad</hi> 25. and according to their strength and mightinesse, was their <hi>height</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> their <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> these were <hi>Moabs</hi> sinnes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Iudgement to be inflicted upon Moab,</hi> was (as M. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> will have it) to be <hi>utterly spoyled, men women and Children, to have their bloud powred out in every street,</hi> to be dealt withall not as <hi>Saul dealt with the Amal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>2. The <hi>Charge</hi> it selfe here layed upon them.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Executioners</hi> of this punishment, were the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> an Heathen Nation whom God used in that age, to punish the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world for their sins against him; but they (as I apprehend them) had no respect to God in any thing they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can M. <hi>Marshall</hi> prove, that their aymes were <hi>to help the Lord against the mighty,</hi> or against his Enemies; as he must doe, if his Allegation of their example in this place, be any thing to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose: But as God said of the <hi>Assyrian, Esay.</hi> 10.5.6. (who was then the rod of his anger,) I <hi>sent him against the people of my wrath and gave him a charge to take the spoyle, and to take the prey, and to tread them downe like mire in the streets, howbeit he thinkes not so, that is,</hi> he hath another intention, ends of his owne, <hi>even to cut downe Nations not a few</hi>; to advance his owne name and greatnesse; even so, may it be said hereof the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; God made them the rod of his anger against <hi>Moab</hi>; and sent them to punish him for his sinne against God, and unneighbourlinesse towards his people; but they had no Eye to Gods glory in the matter, they onely looked upon themselves, and at their owne ends; perhaps, indeed they might be of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> mind, to <hi>goe through with the worke; to spare none,</hi> for saies the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>they devised evill against Moab, and said, come let us cut it off from being a Nation</hi>: but sure it was not because God so commanded, but for their owne security and advancement, and from a delight which they might have in shedding bloud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their Charge</hi> (for so M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

which they shall feele from God; who shall either <hi>not at all,</hi> or <hi>in a carelesse, and unfaithfull manner,</hi> performe that worke, or businesse which God shall imploy them about. Or if it must be applyed in particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> I should take it to be a <hi>prediction</hi> of that punishment, which they should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tast, for their ayming at themselves, in their dealings with the <hi>Moabites</hi>; as they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e like the forementioned <hi>Assyrians,</hi> in pursuing their owne purposes; so should they be like them, in reaping the fruit of their selfeish endeavours, in the conclusion; though unawares to themselves, they had done the worke of the Lord too, against the people of <hi>Moab</hi> in the meane while; the words are in the present tense. <hi>Cursed is He,</hi> to note the <hi>certainty</hi> of it, a forme of speaking most usuall in Scripture <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because M. <hi>Marshall</hi> will have it a <hi>charge,</hi> let it so be: but then we must suppose this <hi>charge</hi> was sent from the Lord, by some Prophet to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who thereby were made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterstand, (as <hi>Saul</hi> was by <hi>Samuell</hi> in the businesse against <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi>) that the worke to punish <hi>Moab</hi> was <hi>Gods worke</hi>; and that they (the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) were inabled and sent of God as his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to performe the same; and to revenge his quarrell, for their <hi>churlishnesse</hi> in not relieving <hi>Gods people</hi> in distress: and that if they shall either, not doe the worke at all; or whereas Gods will is that execution shall be done upon the <hi>Moabites</hi>; if they shall onely make <hi>slaves</hi> of them, as they had done of some other Nations; or shall doe the worke <hi>carelesly,</hi> without respect to God or his Church and cause, or shall doe it <hi>deceitfully,</hi> to by ends and purposes: why they themselves shall come under the same condition, and beare that <hi>curse,</hi> or punishment, which they were charged to inflict on others. Thus it must be supposed, if it be as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> will have it, a <hi>charge,</hi> and what then can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it but onely this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That they who know themselves to be particularly appoynted of God to put offenders to death, if they shall neglect to performe their office in that way or manner as they are Commanded, shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the like punishment themselves.</hi>

               <p>And now let us consider, how this Scripture doth make for M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> turne: His aimes are not (as you may observe) to shew that <hi>Moab</hi> was under this <hi>Curse,</hi> for not helping and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the people of God, in the day of their Calamity: (which indeed had been nearer to his purpose) but to shew that the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> were liable to the <hi>Curse,</hi> if they did not doe the work of the Lord against <hi>Moab,</hi> for so himselfe saies, <hi>He is a cursed man that with-holds his hands from powring out the blood of Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, like water in the streets, when this is to done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Moab the Enemy of Gods Church</hi>: this being fore observed.

               <p>If M. <hi>Marshall</hi> (I say) can evidence these particulars, then may this Scripture, from <hi>Ier.</hi> 48.10. alleadged by him, be in some sort suteable for his purpose. But if he cannot prove <hi>all</hi> these, nor perhaps any <hi>one</hi> of these particulars; I wish my friend, would take notice of this his impertinency and <hi>Misapplication</hi> of this Scripture. And like a <hi>good Minister</hi> of Iesus Christ, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the seduced vulgar, by way of a selfe-denying recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that though the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were charged under the penalty of a <hi>Curse,</hi> to shed the blood of the <hi>Moabites</hi>; yet 'tis no good consequent to say, that <hi>Gods people</hi> also, have a like charge under a like penalty, to shed the blood of their <hi>Christian Brethren,</hi> and Countrey-men, because they are not altogether of their <hi>opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the rather to induce M. <hi>Marshall</hi> to this, let him by the way consider; that if (as the common people understand him) the King and those that take part with him, must needs be the <hi>Moabites</hi>; and every of themselves liable to Gods curse, if they forbeare to do the <hi>work of God</hi> upon them; that is, if they be not zealous to <hi>shed their blood</hi>: why then, those who think and call themselves <hi>Gods People,</hi> must of necessity, yeeld themselves to be <hi>Babilonians,</hi> at least while they are in execution of this bloody businesse, or else the Paralell neither is, nor can be perfect: I would have this particular remembred against we come to the next Scripture.</p>

God gives to the Executioners of his wrath against</hi> Babilon; Blessed is the man that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us, <hi>Blessed is the man that makes</hi> Babilon <hi>drinke the same cup which</hi> Babilon <hi>hath made Gods people drinke; now he that reads the booke of the</hi> Lamentations, <hi>may find how</hi> Babilon <hi>had used the Church of God, they had broken their bones as a Lion breakes the bones of a Lambe; brought their necks under persecution; made their skin</hi> black like an oven; <hi>hang'd up their</hi> Princes by the hand; <hi>and which is most of all cruell, had dash't their Children against the stones: now saith the Spirit of God,</hi> Blessed is the man that thus rewardeth Babilon, yea blessed is the man that takes their little ones, and dashes them against the stones: <hi>what Souldiers heart would not start at this, not only when he is in hot blood, to cut downe armed Enemies in the field; but afterward</hi> deliberately, <hi>to come into a</hi> subdued <hi>City, and take the little ones, upon the</hi> speares poynt; <hi>or take them by the</hi> heeles, <hi>and beat out their</hi> braines <hi>against the Walls: what inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Barbarousnesse, would this be thought: yet if the work be to revenge God's Church against</hi> Babilon, <hi>He is a blessed man that takes and dashes the little ones against the stones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> own words, concerning his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: in which is offered to our considerations these particulars.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>People</hi> to be destroyed: 2. The <hi>Executioners</hi> of this destruction: 3. The <hi>Epethite</hi> given unto them: 4. The <hi>manner</hi> how the same is to be done. Of all these briefly; and then we will search out that <hi>Anguem in Herbâ,</hi> that <hi>quoddam latens,</hi> or misticall doctrine, which is found in this example, by those only of that faction; and so we shall see how suteable this Scripture is, thought not to the <hi>text,</hi> yet to the <hi>purpose</hi>; though not to the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> in hand, yet to the <hi>cause</hi> in hand; to that great designe which at this time shakes the whole Kingdome; unto which Scripture it selfe, must be forced to contribute, and to afford (at least) some colourable assistance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The people to be destroyed,</hi> was the <hi>daughter of Babilon:</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> (of whom we had mention before) that ere while were the <hi>rod of God's Anger</hi> to punish others; are now become the <hi>objects of his indignation,</hi> and must themselves be cast into the fire (and therefore in their right order M. <hi>Marshall</hi> did all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as well as of day, in this World: one after another, the Sun did not alway shine upon the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; it went downe at last, and rose no more: and such will be the condition of those, that have now got the strength and <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdome, into their Hands and use it only to the undoing, and destruction of their Brethren; they will have their <hi>turne</hi> too, when they have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Gods will upon us, who have been, and are great sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the most High: even as <hi>Israell</hi> of old were; and have (we confesse) deserved more misery at his hand, then we can feel from theirs; but our deserts in this kind, they doe no more, ayme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will not deny, but some of the seduced, ignorant vulgar may haply think, they doe God service in killing us; for so M <hi>Marshall</hi> and other their Ministers teach them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; by whose black mouths we also are made more black to their apprehensions, then sin or Satan, hath yet made us: But as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The executioners of this destruction,</hi> were not oppressed <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> who hath been thus dealt withall, by the <hi>Babilonians</hi>; no, their work whereto they were appoynted by the Lord, was to <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>Babilonians: Ier.</hi> 29.7. and to <hi>seek their prosperity,</hi> not to <hi>dash their Childrens brains against the stones,</hi> in requitall of the wrongs received by them; nor indeed were they any people, that had the denomination, or took to themselves the name of Gods People; (as those do whom M. <hi>Marshall</hi> would have to be stirred up by this example, to act the part of bloudy executioners:) in a word, they were the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that were designed by the Almighty, to be the executioners of his wrath upon <hi>Babilon</hi>; raised up for that purpose to punish <hi>Babilon,</hi> as <hi>Babilon</hi> had been before to punish others. And indeed, you shall seldome finde in Scripture, God imploying his own people, to be instruments of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51457:29"/>
his wrath, against the Heathen Nations, (unlesse only against such as were bound to live in obedience under them, when they broke out into Rebellion:) for indeed those whom God intends, to make <hi>vessells of mercye</hi> hereafter; he imployes to be <hi>instruments of mercy</hi> before hand: giving them hearts and spirits to delight only in the <hi>workes of mercy:</hi> and so doth fit them for their future glory, and these are call'd the <hi>men of Gods Heart,</hi> for they lye there, they are the <hi>men of his love,</hi> of his bowels, and being loved of him, they come to be loving like him, even to their Enemies, <hi>mercifull as he is mercifull, and kind to the unthankefull and to the Evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other side, God doth imploy the wicked, to be the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of his wrath,</hi> who are for this cause call'd <hi>Gods sword, Psal.</hi> 17.13. (as those <hi>Babilonians</hi> were, while they were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of his judgements) <hi>&amp; the men of his hand,</hi> indeed he suffers them, by this imployment, to fit themselves to be <hi>vessells</hi> of wrath hereafter; the Divell is Gods great Instrument in this kind, and the wicked are his Members, who delight to doe the work of their Father; even as the Godly being Members of Christ (that great Instrument, and indeed fountain of mercy,) do delight to approve themselves like him. And besides the work of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is calld in Scripture Gods <hi>strange worke,</hi> not only because, he and his true Children are not so naturally inclined to it, as they are to Mercy; but also, because he imployes those in it, who are strangers to him: or rather suffers them to take the imployment for a season upon themselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Epethite here given unto them,</hi> which (as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> observes) is the Title <hi>Blessed: Blessed is the man that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us:</hi> Blessed is the man that makes <hi>Babilon</hi> drink the same Cup, which <hi>Babilon</hi> hath made Gods people to drinke. But in that they are pronounced <hi>blessed,</hi> tis not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that by this fact they did declare themselves to be in the state of <hi>Blessednesse,</hi> much lesse that thereby they should merit divine grace, or life everlasting, (as those that kill us are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe, by some of the Ministers of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> faction,) or that they should by this their doing the will of God, in a speciall or peculiar manner please God: for 'tis well knowne that the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But because they did execute the punishment decreed of God, they are promised a good successe, and an happy event in their undertakings; and many temporall blessings for the same; which for a season they did enjoy: Even as <hi>Iehu</hi> who by vocation extraordinary, was imployed to punish the house of <hi>Ahab</hi>; though he walked in the wayes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> which were so abhominable in Gods eyes; yet he enjoyed the Kingdom of <hi>Israell</hi> for a season: and I doe not doubt but they, who by <hi>an ordinary Providence</hi>; (for extraordinary vocations are out of date in these daies) are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to fulfill the will of God, in this kind upon sinners, may for a while, enjoy the pleasures of sin, and worldly greatnesse; which in such undertakings is the only thing, which they usually look after. I call that an <hi>ordinary providence,</hi> which doth not crosse a <hi>Morall precept,</hi> as when a Nation or People, by call and direction of their supreame Governour, are stirred up to punish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Nation, unto whom they are in no sort tied in subjection; thus the <hi>Normans</hi> were stirred up to punish the sinnes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inhabitants of this land, and had the Isle at their disposing for it: so the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> had the Empire of <hi>Babilon.</hi> But 'tis no <hi>lawfull Providence</hi> for Subjects, without the command and expresse warrant of their Soveraign; to take upon them to punish, either their superiors or their fellow Subjects; nor doe I know of any blessing so much as temporall, that they have any warrant to promise to themselves for so doing: yet I do not doubt but the Heads of this present bloudy faction <hi>inter nos,</hi> do promise to themselves this kind of <hi>blessednesse</hi> by their undertaking; if they can but <hi>kill, slay,</hi> and <hi>destroy,</hi> the King with His Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I could give instances of some who have stollen into the Chamber, where some, whom they have taken to be <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> have been asleep, and shot them dead; and then gloryed in it, as <hi>in a work most acceptable to God:</hi> as also I could instance in some of that party, who (being poysoned with such like doctrines as this of M. <hi>Marshall,</hi>) have held, that they ought not in Conscience, to give Quarter to any of the Kings side, nor to take any Quarter from them. Yea farther yet, I could name the partyes, some of whom, have been men of note too, and trust among them: who I am sure do know M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> and are known of him; and have well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used this his Sermon, and have his full sence thereof: who have said and protested, that in this their cause <hi>(viz.</hi> to promote the same) <hi>they would cut the throate of their own Father and Mother.</hi> These three particulars, of <hi>time, persons,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> being thought upon, will sufficiently evidence to any mans heart, M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> meaning to be as was expressed.</p>
               <p>But perhaps some will say, what bloudy actions have yet been done, by any of that side, which have not been out done by the <hi>Cavaliers?</hi> and where can it be shewn, that they have exercised that cruelty upon little Children?</p>
               <p>I answere to the first: that my particular undertakeing is not to enumerate their particular bloudy Actions, 'tis too big a task for one man; yet <hi>Mercurius Rusticus,</hi> hath spoken somewhat to that purpose, with particular intimation of persons, times, and

But this I dare say, they are not by their Ministers so taught, as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> and his fellowes teach their Auditors: and the truth is, the <hi>Cavaleers</hi> learne much of their cruelty from them; for they heare and read how M. <hi>Marshall</hi> and the rest doe stirre up those on their side, to esteeme of them, and to deale with them: And they thinke, they have as good authority to account in like sort o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But further I say the cruelty of the <hi>Cavaleers,</hi> is not in all res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects so high as that of their Enemies, for I beleeve no reasonable man, but will confesse, that 'tis better to be killd out right, then to be hackt and hewne about the head and face, and to have their <hi>hands cut off,</hi> or at least the <hi>sinewes of their right armes,</hi> all cut in peices <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately</hi> after Quarter promised: to the end they may never be able to fight for their King and Country more; nor get their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And whereas 'tis said, <hi>where hath there been such cruelty acted yet upon Women and Children?</hi> I answer that I could name where in a most savage manner, they have trampled both <hi>Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to death under their Horses feet. Perhaps they have not dealt so barborously yet, in places neare to their owne <hi>associate</hi> Counties; for feare the spirits of those amongst them, who have not yet quite put of all bowells, should rise against them, and fall off from them. And M. <hi>Marshall</hi> doth well inferre unto us, that the <hi>determinate</hi> time of the <hi>slaughter of Infants,</hi> is not till the Cities and Counties
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51457:34"/>
be quite <hi>subdued</hi>; but when they shall afterwards come, and <hi>with deliberation,</hi> look into the places themselves have conquered: then, O then, must the <hi>massacre</hi> of our tender Infants be, then must they <hi>be pricked upon the swords poynt</hi> (to speake in M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> phrase) or else, <hi>have their braines dashed out against the walls.</hi> Indeed should this extreame barbarousnesse be acted sooner, it might be greatly to the weakning of their cause, and therefore M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> I beleeve is in the right, in setting downe the appoynted time; which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse did fall from his pen unawares to himselfe: God did suffer him (a knowing man in secrets of that nature,) to hint unto the <hi>Kings friends, and Loyall Subjects,</hi> what they must expect shall be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them and their posterity, if these men prevaile; that so they might timely beware of them, and prepare to defend themselves against them. <hi>God give us hearts to take a right notice.</hi> Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>But I returne. This being evidently M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> meaning, that all we who are not of their Faction, must be understood to be <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and therefore to be destroyed, <hi>root and branch,</hi> our selves and Children. Then also on the other side, (if the Paralell be perfect,) M. <hi>Marshall</hi> yeelds his side, who must <hi>doe Execution upon us and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Infants,</hi> to be the <hi>Heathenish Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> (who shed bloud onely to inrich themselves to enlarge their Territories, and to domineere over others:) they are not the <hi>Church or people of God</hi>; for the Church which had been so evilly handled in <hi>Babilon,</hi> did not undertake to punish her, the Psalme tells us, that her part, was onely to <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>mourne</hi> under her burden: nor indeed (as was noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) did God ever imploy her to revenge her selfe, <hi>Israell</hi> was to live in subjection quietly in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and <hi>to pray for the Peace of the Country.</hi> This (I say) is in speciall to be noted, from M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> Paralell; whom he yeelds his <hi>Faction</hi> to be, if we be <hi>Babilon.</hi> And then also let us heare call to mind, what we were bid before to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. Namely, that ere while, when <hi>Babilon</hi> was on the rising hand; and to <hi>shed the bloud of Moab</hi>; then these men must be <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> themselves; and they thought they should be <hi>under the Curse,</hi> if they did not act her part; but now <hi>Babilons</hi> time is come, that her bloud must be let out; we must be <hi>Babilon</hi> another while, for they will be in her Coat no longer; they must still <hi>act the part</hi> of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; <hi>Good God what Tigers bloud did these men suck?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but since we must be <hi>Babilon,</hi> and <hi>drinke of her cup,</hi> yet
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51457:34"/>
according to the Scripture alleadged, our punishment ought to be but answerable to our sinne: <hi>we should be rewarded, but as we have served Gods people.</hi> Now therefore let M. <hi>Marshall</hi> shew, when and where our <hi>gratious King.</hi> His Nobles, Gentry, His Reverend Bishops and Learned Clergy, have acted any such bloudy cruelties, against the <hi>people &amp; Church of God,</hi> that should merit such a retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> hath proportioned out for them? whose bones have they broken? whose Children have they murdered? what barbarousnesse or inhumanity in this kind, have they at any time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated? nay which of them, (as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> himselfe hath here done) did ever stirre up to the acting of such things? Hath not this Kingdome been the <hi>Asylum,</hi> to the persecuted <hi>flock of Christ,</hi> when they have fled out of all the neighbour Nations? hath not the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of our Religious Soveraigne,</hi> been alwayes open to receive them? hath not the <hi>wing</hi> of his Protection been spread to shelter them? And hath not our <hi>envied</hi> Nobility and Gentry; our <hi>hated</hi> Bishops and now <hi>despised</hi> Clergy, manifested the tendernesse of their Bowells, in affording reliefe to Forreigners and Strangers, whom they saw in misery? hath not the blessing of those that were ready to perish, came frequently upon them? I referr these things, to the testimonies of those thankefull, and humble people, whose spirits have been refreshed with our English Bounty; <q>And O thou God of Heaven, who knowest the secrets of all hearts and wayes: though thy servants (who are now persecuted, under the Notion of <hi>Babilonians,</hi> and turned out of those their possessions, wherein thy hand did place them) have done nothing for thine afflicted Church and people, but what thine owne mercifull, and loving spirit did provoke them unto; nor did they give them any other reliefe, then what thy selfe didst first give them to bestow; so that of thine owne hand they did receive, what they have distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to thy people; yet be thou witnesse for them, against their Enemies, remember them concerning these things, and wipe not out, the good deeds which they have done, for the House of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps I shall be answered, (as I have often heard some of that side say) that the bloud which was shed by the <hi>Popish</hi> Bishops in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> dayes, with the approbation of them that sate in the Throne, and of the Nobility and Gentry, is not yet expiated; and the guilt thereof still runs in the veines of their Posterity; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

               <p>Our <hi>New state-men,</hi> for want of matter to quarrell at, neare at hand can fetch it a great way off.

               <p>I know well that this impious and unreasonable conceit, that the bloud shed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, is yet to be expiated; and that all the sins of the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy in former ages, is Chargeable upon the heads of the Bishops in these times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know I say that this conceit is deeply grounded in the Hearts of many of our factious people: D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

But then comes <hi>William Pryn</hi> with his two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes, and speaks over the same thing the third time, with many more words, though with as little Conscience and Honesty as the rest; and he strikes the matter dead; for by the mouth of three such witnesses the thing is so established, that people should be worse then <hi>Infidells</hi> if they believe it not. Now therefore it being so; the Bishops must be pluckt up <hi>root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> and all that approve of them, be they who they will, must (like welwillers to <hi>Babilon</hi> as they be) be cast downe, and rooted out with them, what effusion of bloud soever it cost, for 'tis <hi>the Lords work against Babilon.</hi> And therefore most zealously did a <hi>Neighbour</hi> of mine (an <hi>Essex tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> too,) arguing with my self speake, when he said at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Parliament,) that <hi>it was better, that all the streets in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land should run downe with bloud, then that one Bishop or one Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should still remaine.</hi> But how impious and unreasonable these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits be, I hope I need not to men unblinded, use means to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. How sencelesse is it that men should commit sin, foure or five hundred years before they were borne; or be guilty of the sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by others, of another Religion so long agoe, and deserve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for them, though they have disclaimed them, writ against them, and every way opposed them: How absurd is it, that a <hi>call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> should be sinfull or infectious, save only in respect of sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to come closer yet to the matter: if the bloud shed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, must be expiated now with our bloud, and because those that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te in the Throne, and the Nobles in those times, did consent unto it, therefore their successors now must partake in the suffering. Yet let me start a Question. How if the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> in those daies were consenting to it, as well as others; what will become of those that succeed them in these times? I confesse I have heard an Answer to this Objection, out of certain notes taken from a Sermon Preached by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>I.D.</hi> (an <hi>Essex Minister</hi> too,) and it was this: That the <hi>Body of the Kingdome (which is the House of Commons) did never consent to what was then done, therefore they are free, and are to require this blood at the hands of others,</hi> (perhaps he means they did not of themselves, make an Ordinance, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or for the approving of it: though peradventure they passed the Act or Bill as well as the King or House of Lords, when first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, else how could it have had the force of a Law?) But then let me aske farther, how shall those on their side scape, who are the Posterity of some <hi>notorious</hi> great persecutors, (of Gods Saints in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time?) I hope they will not deny them, to be their <hi>law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And then farther yet; how if some of the forefathers of us, who must be <hi>Butchered,</hi> were <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time: and some of them that must murder us, be the Children of those that murdered them, (as may well be suspected from their similitude of Spirit?) is it Iustice, because their Fathers joyned with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> Bishops in those daies, to destroy our Fathers, therefore <hi>they</hi> may joyne with the <hi>House of Commons</hi> now, to destroy us? to say <hi>the Parliament judgeth so,</hi> will not give sufficient satisfaction. But in a word, I returne my reply to that impious and unreasonable conceit, in the words of the Lord written by <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> Chap. 18.20. <hi>The soule that sinneth it shall dye: the Son shall not beare the iniquity of the Father, neither shall the Father beare the iniquity of the Sonne: the righteousnesse of the righteous shall be upon him; and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the wicked shall be upon him.</hi>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:51457:36"/>But perhaps M. <hi>Marshall</hi> and his faction will say; that those whom they have destin'd to destruction, are great sinners also in themselves against God (without consideration of the iniquity of their Fathers,) and therefore they deserve as much punishment, as can be inflicted on them.</p>

               <p>In way of Answer to this, I will tell you, what I have a long time observed in some Ministers, of M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> faction, and neer acquaintance; (though for himselfe I must confesse I never (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse now,) saw any cause to suspect him guilty thereof; but before this Rebellion began, I have alwaies and in all things observed and found him, for my part, and thereupon judged him, to be a most Honest, faithfull sincere hearted, plain dealing man,) but I say I have observed it in some others, that it was their Custome, to Preach most often such <hi>doctrines,</hi> and to quote such <hi>Scriptures,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> themselves were farthest from, in their own practice: for example, the most <hi>proud</hi> of them, would beat most against <hi>pride,</hi> and presse oftnest the duty of selfe deniall; the most <hi>malitious</hi> would preach most against malice, and perswade to the practice of love and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the most <hi>covetous</hi> would inveigh most bitterly against worldly mindednesse; and the most <hi>Rebellious</hi> (as hath since appeared) would be most fervent and zealous in Preaching for Passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51457:39"/>
of being farthest from those vices, which indeed they were most guilty of; and most addicted unto those vertues, whereto they exhorted others; or whether they did it, to any better ends or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, I leave it at this present, to the Iudge of all secret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. So whether M. <hi>Marshall</hi> by his quoting this Scripture, doth think to hide the conditions of his faction, from the ignorant vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; who are more apt to judge of the tree by the <hi>leaves,</hi> then by the <hi>fruit:</hi> and to think that if men speake and quote Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Hardheartednesse, Cruelty, Injustice,</hi> and <hi>wrong doing</hi> to Gods Church, though themselves practice the same things; yet they shall not be accounted transgressors of Gods word, because it will rather be thought, that they to whom these abuses are offered, (by these Scripture speaking men;) are none of Gods Church and people, but of that race or ranke rather, that the <hi>Cananites</hi> and <hi>Amorites</hi> were of, whom God commanded his people to root out of their Habitations: I say, whether this was M. <hi>Marshalls</hi> intention or no, when he alleadged that Scripture, I leave to <hi>God</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To resolve this question, I shall note some passages, wherein the conditions of Gods people are hinted to us from this Sermon of M. <hi>Marshall,</hi> (from whom I shall never willingly dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. That all particulars on both sides are not of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>people of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath been wont to make use of <hi>wicked men,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and assist his Church, and people: the <hi>earth helped the woman, Rev.</hi> 12. they may have their ends, and God hath his.</p>

               </p>

               <p n="6">6. That Christs <hi>true Church</hi> and People, are indued with his <hi>true spirit,</hi> are conditioned like him, and do walke in those wayes wherein himselfe did go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. That the way which Christ walked, and which his <hi>true Church</hi> must and doe follow him in; is set downe plainly in holy Scripture, and not to be taken up from the <hi>Traditions</hi> or <hi>Opinions</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>I hope no man can or will deny the truth of these particulars. Now I shall give three or foure notes of the Church, and people of God, which M. <hi>Marshall</hi> himselfe doth seem at least to him unto us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church and <hi>people of God</hi> have most commonly been, a <hi>distressed</hi> and <hi>an injured people,</hi> a people that have needed help, even of <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>drinke,</hi> and <hi>cloathing,</hi> a people, that have been like <hi>Strangers</hi> excluded, and thrust out of their owne possessions, (as the <hi>Lords Annoynted,</hi> and many of His faithfull Nobles and Subjects at this time are,) a people that have been wont to be <hi>banished,</hi> from their owne homes, or cast into <hi>Prisons,</hi> (as the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and other Christians at this time be, by the Rebellious Faction) they are a people so <hi>darkned</hi> with Afflictions, and so <hi>obscured</hi> with slanders and reproaches; <hi>that the very righteous themselves,</hi> (their owne Brethren) <hi>whose study it is to doe all the good they can to the Saints; shall not know when they have helped them,</hi> as M. <hi>Marshall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us in the 14 <hi>Page</hi> of his Sermon: <hi>when</hi> (saies he) <hi>Christ shall say to them come ye blessed you fed me, you cloathed me, you visited me; they shall Answer: Lord when saw we thee, hungry, or thirsty, or a

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51457:42"/>
                  <hi>that the King might fly from place to place for a little while, but there is no remedy, he must yeeld, and come in at last; he cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly withstand our great forces.</hi> And I doubt not (through the the mercy of our stong, our just, and holy God,) but in the end Master <hi>Marshalls</hi> quotation in his 17 pag. from <hi>Esa.</hi> 44.17. will be evidenced to be true, <hi>no weapon can prosper that is formed against it</hi> (the Kings cause) <hi>and every tongue that rises up in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, shall be condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, we gather from Master <hi>Marshall</hi> pag. 18. <hi>that those who be of the Dragons Army, of the Church malignant that have</hi> (as in pag. 20.) <hi>their names in the Dragons muster booke,</hi> are none of the Church or people of God: And herein he speaks most truly also. But how shall we know who they are? Master <hi>Marshall</hi> (like a freind) helps us in this too, in the same place, <hi>viz.</hi> the later end of the 18 pag. by his quotation of a Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The first is <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. <hi>the eye that mocketh at his father,</hi> (and the King is <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> a common or publique father) <hi>or despiseth to obey his Mother,</hi> (the <hi>Church of England</hi> is our <hi>mother,</hi> that hath brought us forth to God) <hi>the Ravens of the valley shall picke it out</hi>; that is, (as if he had said,) such a one is heire of the curse, as being one of the <hi>Church malignant,</hi> and none of Gods people.</p>
               <p>The second Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2, 3. <hi>Paul</hi> (saies Master <hi>Marshall) thought it no more then his duty, when he had great heavinesse and continuall sorrow in his heart, and could wish himselfe accursed from Christ, for the good of his brethren, his Kinsmen, who were Israelites</hi>: whence we gather that they who are so farre from thinking i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:51457:42"/>But againe, Master <hi>Marshall</hi> be freinds us farther, by hinting to us another marke, of one that belongs to the <hi>Dragons Army, pag.</hi> 19. towards the end thereof, where he saies, <hi>that Gods spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all his Saints, (i.e.</hi> in all that belong to Christs Army) <hi>works the same spirituall disposition in them: namely, as was in Christ their Captaine</hi>; and that was a meeke, milde, mercifull, an obedient, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and peaceable disposition: from which speech of Master <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi> it may be inferred by the rule of Contraries, that the <hi>Dragons spirit,</hi> dwelling in all that belong to his Army, doth worke them to be of his disposition; and that is, to be <hi>bloudy, cruell, barbarous, contentious, rebellious, hating peace,</hi> delighting in <hi>killing, slaying,</hi> and <hi>destroying,</hi> yea of <hi>infants,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>And indeed beside these helpes, which Master <hi>Marshall</hi> hath afforded to us; for the discovery of the members of the <hi>Church malignant,</hi> the <hi>Dragons</hi> souldiers, himselfe in his first use, <hi>pap.</hi> 21. very honestly, out of Scripture deciphers them unto us: I'le give you his very words: He saies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They are such as set themselves, and take councell against the Lord</hi> (his Church) <hi>and against his Anointed</hi> (his King,) <hi>digging as deepe as Hell for Counsell to doe all the mischeife they can.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They are such as with</hi> Edom <hi>looke upon the Affliction of</hi> Israel, <hi>rejoycing over them in the day of their destruction, speaking proudly in the day of their distresse, crying out against</hi> Jerusalem (or the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods worship) <hi>downe with it, downe with it, even to the Ground.</hi>
               </p>

I'le note onely his Method, tell you summarily what he saies, and here and there put in a word, for explication or rectification, and so conclude with Master <hi>Marshall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, He reproves <hi>Newters, pag.</hi> 22. whom he likens unto the <hi>Samaritanes that feared the Lord and served their Idols,</hi> (as indeed is the fashion of too many amongst us) <hi>feare the King,</hi> (at least say they doe) <hi>and serve the Parliament,</hi> (as they call it:) But (as he

saies, <hi>God will one day say of these, they love not the Lord,</hi> so may the King say one day of such, <hi>they loved not him</hi>: Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> notes well, that his text doth <hi>Curse all them who came not out to helpe him, as well as those who came to fight against him. And our Saviour at the last day, will as well denounce; Goe ye Cursed, against them who gave them not bread, when they were hungry, as against them who plucked their bread away from them, for in this case 'tis a certaine rule, He that is not with me, is against me</hi>: These <hi>Newters, pag.</hi> 23. he devides into two sorts: and sayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are <hi>Newters out of policy,</hi> whom he compares to <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah</hi> and <hi>Zalmanah, that would first see what would be the event of the warre, before they discovered themselves</hi>; and to these he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that if his side prevaile, (<hi>which God forbid,)</hi> they <hi>shall be rent with Bryers and Thornes, have their houses beaten downe, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves slaine as</hi> Zebah <hi>and</hi> Zalmanah <hi>were:</hi> (let such Newters marke that, and give their timely assistance to their Soveraigne.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some are Newters out of sloathfulnesse, and carelessenesse; who are indifferent</hi> (as he saies) <hi>whether the Beare bite the Dogge, or the Dogge bite the Beare,</hi> and these he resembles to the men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead, who (when all the Tribes had bound themselves by oath against Benjamin</hi>) would not enter into the <hi>Association</hi> with the rest: <hi>for which</hi> (as he notes) <hi>it cost them deare, even their owne Heart bloud in the Conclusion.</hi> But here it must be remembred by the way, that that <hi>Association</hi> was not against any Soveraigne King, to whom they had sworne <hi>Allegiance</hi>; nor against the minde or without the Consent of any such a one; for indeed (as yet) they had none set over them; but their prime Governours whom they were to obey, did call them unto it: and therefore the case and condition of any amongst us, cannot hold Paralell with theirs, (as haply Master <hi>Marshall</hi> would insinuate,) nor can they justly be terrified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with that example.</p>
               <p>Then Master <hi>Marshall</hi> comes to his second use, which is for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi>; to give up our selves to the service of the Church, his motives thereunto are three, from <hi>Gods Honour,</hi> from our <hi>relation unto the Church, and the Churches gaine,</hi> and from <hi>our owne good, both inward and outward</hi>: all which motives may well serve to stirre us to give up our selves to the service of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> and cause, now managed and maintained by the <hi>King</hi> our Soveraigne.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:51457:44"/>1. <hi>The Honour of God</hi> commands us, for hereby we shall ingage our selves, to maintaine the Act of <hi>Gods wisedome,</hi> who hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the King (of all other men in the world) to be his Anointed, and Vicegerent over us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Our relation to the Church</hi> requires it, for as we are members of the body, our care must be to defend the Head, and uphold the Body it selfe, which the Enemies endeavour also to dissolve. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Marshall</hi> tells us, (from the observation of <hi>Politicians)</hi> that <hi>Common-wealths usually thrive when private Subjects are Common-wealths men</hi>: He saies indeed but <hi>usually,</hi> not alwaies: for I am sure our Common-wealth was never so weakened and broken, as it hath beene of late, since <hi>private wealths men,</hi> have taken upon them to be <hi>Common-wealths men.</hi> But I dare say, that the Church hath alwaies best thrived, when <hi>private</hi> men in their <hi>proper spheare</hi> have proved themselves good <hi>Church men</hi>; and had those amongst us done so, they had doubtlesse prooved better Common-wealths men too, then they are, however they doe conceit of themselves; both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common Wealth</hi> had fared better, had they in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique matters beene lesse busie.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Inward peace, which alwaies is then greatest, when we have done any thing for the benefit of the publique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Honour before God and man, for to have an influence,</hi> (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Marshall</hi> saies well) <hi>into the welfare of many, is not onely noble, but also Angelicall, yea divine: 'tis to imitate God hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After these Master <hi>Marshall</hi> laies downe directions, how we may be able to doe this service for the Church: and first he shews, what is <hi>requisite</hi> to <hi>fit</hi> and prepare us to doe the Church service, and the meanes he laies downe are three: <hi>Godlinesse, selfe-deniall,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Men must be Godly</hi>: And O that we Ministers on the Kings side, could be meanes to worke this Condition in the hearts and lives of all His Majesties Souldiers: I dare say the service would be better done, and their endeavours would in many places be more speeded with a blessing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Men must deny themselves,</hi> not seeke their owne ends, nor proceed in their owne wayes, when once they appeare sinfull in themselves, or to others detrimentall; I wish Master <hi>Marshall</hi> (if he had beene in earnest) had beene so happy, as to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded all and every of his Honourable Auditory, to the practise of this point, which (as himselfe affirmeth rightly) is the A. B. C. in Christs Schoole: But alas the whole nation feeleth to its smart; that he hath beene as unsuccessefull in teaching this first Lesson, as my selfe and others have beene in pressing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which is a doctrine of an higher forme, and of farther profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Men must love the Church,</hi> indeed love will make men labour, and the labour of love is the best labour, and most pleasing unto God. But though our speciall love must be unto the Church, yet we must love others too, even those that yet are enemies to us; and of a differing opinion from us, yea though yet out of the state of grace it selfe; and so love them as we may allure them, we must not be bloudy or Cruell to them, Master <hi>Marshall</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve speaks 2 or 3 times of love in his Sermon, but it is only of love to <hi>the brethren,</hi> that is (as may without breach of Charity be supposed) to those of his owne side and faction; as for other men
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51457:45"/>
though of the same <hi>Nation,</hi> perhaps <hi>Nature,</hi> brethern of the same Parents, they may be set at odds, and tempted to hate or kill each other, (for such hath beene the practise of some of them, that talke much of love to the brethren, But I affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this Master <hi>Marshall</hi> proceeds in his method to shew what the freinds of the Church thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared must do, He saies</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They must first informe themselves, what the wants of the Church are, and sympathize with them, inquiring wherein they may be helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and then he shews well, that <hi>somewhat must be done to God for it, and somewhat must be done from God for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Somewhat must be done to God for the Church, and that it</hi> saies he <hi>we must pray for it; for God hath not promised to do any thing without prayer, but he will do all things by it:</hi> and herein (to the shame of many that pretend themselves for the King, I must needs say, they are most extremely, and most Atheistically defective. His Sacred Majesty, in the piety of his spirit and confidence in God, hath strictly commanded <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> yet what is there practiced in many places by many people on that very day, but drinking, and swearing, yea (and by some that should give better example) <hi>playing at Cards</hi>? How empty are Gods houses, and how full are Alehouses? But <hi>good Lord lay not this sinne to the charge of thine Annoynted, or of those that are truly and conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously for him.</hi> But hence, hence, it is, that the righteous cause lyeth so long in the Sudds, for did we pray better, <hi>our enemies would soone be turned backe, this will I do for you, howbeit I will be sought unto for it by the house of Israel,</hi>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51457:45"/>
but 'tis a powring out the soule to God, with purity, faithfullnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> servency, humility and constancy,</hi> and those that can thus pray, are (as he well) the very <hi>Chariots</hi> and <hi>Horsemen of Israel.</hi> But alas, I say, how extremely are such men slighted, and scorned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongst us, insomuch that if injuries, or abuses would drive them all, (as they do too many) from the Kings side, and from their Allegiance, His Majesty should scarce have one praying man in some of his quarters; The Rebells by their wicked pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, have brought Religion into such extreme suspicion, as that many amongst us, who know not themselves what true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> meaneth, do thinke it impossible (as I suppose,) that any man should be both <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>loyall,</hi>: but let A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, and prophane men know, that our <hi>Loyalty</hi> is of a better kind then theirs is, for it is so strengthend by <hi>Religion</hi>; that all the injuries and reproaches, which the <hi>Rebells,</hi> the <hi>Divell,</hi> and <hi>themselves</hi> together can heape upon us, or dart against us, shall never be able to enervate, or weaken it in us: but I returne to Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> who sayes.</p>

               <p>But once againe to Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> who now drawes toward the end of his Sermon, which he concludes with an exhortation (so the margent calls it) to his Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honourable and beloved Auditors: and wisheth that <hi>they could heare the Lord himselfe speaking to them in the same language, as once he spake to Cyrus,</hi> and truly I wish the same thing with him, for then I hope, they might have beene drawne from that bloudy and sinfull way, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since some of them have walked in.

But alas, how hath this Rebellion (like Witch-craft indeed,) conjured him out of himselfe, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him into another man, both in his <hi>conversing,</hi> and in his <hi>teaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1, <hi>For his conversing</hi>; my selfe had a little experience of it, the last time I had discourse with him, (at his owne house,) about the Subject matter, which I writt unto him of afterward, in my booke called <hi>the Loyall Subjects Beleife</hi>: when as (indeed) I found in him so great an alteration, from that wonted mildenesse, and sweetnesse, which I had formerly knowne in him, that I should not have beleeved the same upon the bare report of another man, so tetricke, and waspish, and froward, was he in his arguings, that unlesse I would yeeld to his sayings, and fancies without reasons; he would dispute no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2, <hi>For his teaching</hi>; others even of the common sort of people have observed, that a little before I was driven out of <hi>Essex,</hi> his fortune was to preach at <hi>Brainetree</hi> (a neighbour Towne to me,) upon a Lecture day: (where my selfe had lately before preacht obedience to the King, and thereby made divers of my factious Auditors run out of the Church:) But (I say Master <hi>Marshall</hi> coming to repaire the breach, made there such a Sermon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto the warre, and to <hi>assist the Parliament</hi> (as he called it) that some Godly Christians, (for there be some such even in <hi>Essex</hi> that love the King, and are resolved to part with their lives; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to start from that doctrine of obedience unto him, which heretofore they have learned from Master <hi>Marshall</hi> and others:) some such I say who had all their dayes highly Honoured Master <hi>Marshall,</hi> heareing that Sermon of his, were most extremely asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at it, and came to me with sadded hearts, and weeping eyes, for to bewaile him. <hi>Never</hi> (cryed they) <hi>did we expect to heare this from</hi> Master Marshall, <hi>so contrary to himselfe, his former doctrine and way of Preaching.</hi>

               <p>Well, we have each of us but one life to loose, and we cannot part with it in a more Honourable cause; wherein we may gaine more glory to God, and credit to our selves. Indeed we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon this, and looke for it; to be <hi>murdered</hi> and <hi>martyred</hi> by these sanguinarious and <hi>bloudy men,</hi> (if they can catch us,) as our Saviour was by the Pharisees and Saduces of his time, if we do but (as he did) stirre against them, in detecting their wickednesse and Hypocrisy; and the more Holy we be in our lives, and the more <hi>faithfull</hi> to Christ our Master, and to the King our Soveraigne; the more extreamely strong will their hatred burne against us, and the more <hi>cruelly</hi> will they torture and use us: because by our knowne Honesty and sincerity, we doe more detriment to their ungodly way in the eyes of people, then others doe. But we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that we are <hi>appointed to suffer,</hi> as well as to preach;<note place="margin">1 Thes. 3.3.

                  <hi>I will shew him what great things he must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for my sake</hi>: And if God by our sufferings, shall please to reduce the seduced from the pathes of errour, we may rejoyce therein: if by any meanes we may be instruments to recover soules to Christ, it shall be to our eternall gaine and glory, at the day of reckoning; <hi>We are not our owne, we are bought with a price</hi>; Christ bought us of his Fathers Iustice, (out of the Devills hands,) with the price of his bloud; and to the end, that we by our bloud (if occasion be,) might be meanes to redeeme others, out <hi>of the hands of his strong ones.
