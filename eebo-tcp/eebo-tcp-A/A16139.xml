            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>His Sonne being now ſo recomforted (as it were) in his heart, with the great reioyſing and loyaltie ſhewed him of all the people, he cauſed to be caſt out, whole great handfulles of money, and he himſelfe caſt it out, in great

aboundaunce: and afterward, with all haſte and ſpéede, he came to finde out his Father: but as for his Mother, ſhe cauſed the verie ſame day a Feaſt to be made ready, at the commaundement of her Huſband, vnto the which there were bydden all the women, and the daughters of the Lordes, Seigniors, and Gentlemen of the Court: it were, and would be too tedious to ſet downe, and deſcribe the preparation, and great royaltie which was priuilie made at that Feaſt, where there was not one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all: yea, and one may preſume, that it was verie ſumptuous and coſtlie, when daye by daye they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a thouſand diſhes of daintie meates, and as many fine ſugred Marchpanes into the Hal, where all theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were.

               <p>I wyll now in order ſhew you the Feaſt of <hi>Amurathe,</hi> the place, the gueſts, and the time, how long it laſted: but you muſt vnderſtand, this was not made in one onely place, nor that the gueſts dyd banquet together in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one with another, as Chriſtian people vſe, &amp; accuſteme to doo: for, as for <hi>Amurathe</hi> himſelfe, he dined alone in his braue banquetting houſe, as in a Cage, accompanied onely with his Eunuches, and ſuch as were inſtruments, and miniſters to his ordinary pleaſures: the company of women had theyr banquet apart from him, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde: The Lordes and Seigniors of the Cittie, were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated in theyr braue banquetting houſe, and the Kings, and Princes, Ambaſſadors in them.

The meates being taken away, <hi>Amurathe</hi> caſt downe from his Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, of golde &amp; ſyluer by handfuls, with Goblets of gold and ſiluer, very cunningly wrought and made with pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of golde, and diuers ſorts of money: behold now what a ſolemne feaſt this was.</p>
               <p>Now followeth it, to ſpeake of the playes, ſports, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, the which I wil declare vnto you in thrée articles, how they were repreſented, &amp; ſhewed at thrée ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry times. The one ſort thereof were called forenoone ſports: another were called afternoone ſports: and then the laſt of all mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſportes. The inhabitants, and Artificers of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> thoſe forenoone ſportes with all theyr royall and braue attyre. The ſouldiors and men of warre, the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, the minſtrels, the leapers, and dauncers, the inglers, and ſuch lyke, did employ, and buſie themſelues about the afternoone ſports. The midnight ſports were paſſed away with burning of Fortreſſes, Holdes, Horſſes, Elephantes, and other creatures made by arte. But let vs now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forenoone ſportes, the beginning whereof, were meruailous and pleaſaunt: for preſently after the dinner which they had giuen to <hi>Amurathe,</hi> and to all his gueſts, ſoone after the Sun was vp, behold a great troupe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, of more then a thouſand of the chéefe and principall Merchants of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> walking in braue apparell, with Enſignes &amp; Tabors: the <hi>Turks</hi> martched firſt along, &amp; then the Chriſtians: the Iewes were more ſumptuouſly apparelled then all the reſt, made theyr back warde: And before all this goodly company, went all the honourable, graue Syres, cloathed according to the dignity, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of theyr ages, bearing with them, ritch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentes, and gyftes of golde, and ſyluer: then followed
<pb facs="tcp:9533:13"/>
them, men of luſtie age, carrying alſo in theyr handes, other ſuch lyke preſents, and they marched on all armed. After them came all the young youthes decked, and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vp in wenches apparell, with gownes, iewelles, and bracelets, and all other precious ornaments, and tyrings, the quiuer vpon theyr ſhoulder, the bowe in the left hand, and a crooked Foarde in the right: Theſe were followed of a company of pretie fayre lyttle chyldren, bearing of ſmall réedes, or Canes lyke vnto Dartes, and braunches of Palme trées, of Noſegayes, or Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders, of Saffron in golden cloaues, all in high Hattes of the <hi>Turkes</hi> faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cloathed in cloath of golde, with garmentes of embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derie: and long large gownes, as ritch, and fayre as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible might be. After all thoſe, there came thyrtie men, drawing vpon a Chariot of eight whéeles, a ſhop of eight cubites long, and ſix broade, beſet all within, with ſtarres of golde full of Tapiſtry, and precious coſtly cloathes: all this company hauing made thrée towres by the afore ſayd Parke, at the length areſted, and ſtayd in good order, euen in the middeſt thereof, ouer againſt <hi>Amurathe:</hi> and then you would haue ſayd, that the ritches, not only of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> but alſo of all the whole world, had béene brought into that Parke, for there ſhould you haue ſéene ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, ſuch pearle, ſuch golde, ſuch purple, and ſuch thinges of value, that one would pryſe, and prayſe them farre aboue both gold and pearle.</p>
               <p>Now as all this great company of Merchauntes were there reſting themſelues: one old man began, &amp; ſo all the reſt folowed with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon voice, to crie as loud as they could: God graunt the Emperor lyfe, with all proſperitie &amp; felicitie. And after this ſalutation, ſome of the old aged ſort, dyd guide and conduct the Chariot, wherein the ſhop was, and brought theyr gifts and preſents, vnto the houſe of <hi>Amurathe,</hi> which on his owne behalfe, had alſo beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed giftes, &amp; preſents vpon them: but becauſe I ſaw but

a lyttle, it maye be thought that the one gaue not againe, ſo much vnto a great many, as the great many dyd: and now it is come into my remembraunce, what the Poet ſayth: That ſuch is the myſerie of this life, that thoſe as haue but little, muſt yet beare and carie that themſelues, vnto the huge high heape of ritches. Euen ſo, <hi>Amurathe</hi> making a ſhewe to be lyberall towards the people, payed with a fewe ſmall trifling gyftes, the great ritches, which were offered him at this ſolemne Feaſt: Marke nowe I pray you, how one thing followes after another: for he then hauing both taken and giuen, the Merchaunts retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, as if they had béene parted, and gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way quite.</p>

Well, let vs leaue off, and pretermitte this a thing ſo much to be laughed at, and let vs conſider of other thinges and ſightes, then, and there ſéene: and firſt of thoſe of the Admirall, who brought into the Parke, or Tiltyarde, a Fortreſſe made of boordes, and planted within an Iland of paper, encompaſſed with ſixe Galleies and Foyſtes, the which was called Cypreſſe. He beginneth ſtraight waye to beate downe this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe with the Cannon ſhotte, which were within the

               <p>Then after that, all the handy craftes men, and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being prepared for the nance, and ſtryuing who among them all ſhould offer and giue vnto the <hi>Turke,</hi> the beſt and ritcheſt preſent and gifte, came to make a ſhowe in the Parke, without kéeping any order at all, but all in one daye, and as it beſt lyked euerie one of them.</p>
               <p>The fyrſt bande and company, was the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall</hi> Prieſtes, bearing Bookes in theyr handes, but chéefelie and aboue all, the Lawe of <hi>Mahomette,</hi> written in fayre great Letters: theyr <hi>Muſti,</hi> (which is in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,</hi> as the Pope is in all Europe,) was ſet in a high Chayre, and carried vppon a Camell: at euerie ſteppe, he turned, and looked ouer the leaues of his Booke, fayning as though he had ſearched, and ſought for ſome great ſecrete matter: then hauing giuen his bleſſing vnto <hi>Amurathe,</hi> he was ledde into the Princelie houſe, to offer vppe his preſentes? which doone, he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with his Prieſtes and Preachers. You ſhould haue then ſéene (which I cannot tell you but with great gréefe, and wéeping eyes) that great Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> followed of his Cleargie, hauing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall Robe (which is in manner of a Ceape) tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vppon the grounde, and all of blacke, the which hee offered vnto the enimie of the Chriſtians, with a great ſumme of Golde, within a veſſell of Syluer: and then of all his, and of his ſorte, he was ſaluted with a loude voice: To ſaye the trueth, it was a ſyght moſt lamentable, at the beholding whereof, a man might

well alledge the auncient crie, and complaine of <hi>Hellas,</hi> Alas: At the which extremitie, the diſcorde thereof, hath raunged ouer, and deſtroyed a number of meſte myſerable Cittizens: he which hytherto, and héeretofore hath looked to haue all at commaunde, and himſelfe to be ſubiect, nor vnderling vnto none, beholde, into what pouertie, beaſtlie thraldome, and myſerie he is now fallen and come.</p>
               <p>After him, dyd martche along the Patriarche of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> dooing euen as the other dyd.

               <p>Fyrſt of all, then came the Goldſmythes, carrying diuerſe peeces of workemanſhippe of Golde, and of Syluer gylded, verie ritchlie, and artificially wrought, as Cuppes, Goblettes, Platters, Kniues, Penkniues, and ſuch lyke other thing: they were in number about an hundreth, bothe olde, myddle age, young men, and chyldren, all moſt ſumptuouſlie apparrelled. After them was drawne vpon a Chariotte with ſixe whéeles, theyr ſhoppe, glyſtering, and ſhyning round about on all ſides, by reaſon of the veſſelles of Golde and Siluer that were therein.</p>
               <p>After them you ſhould haue ſéen a great number of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,

Laſt of all, marched on the Scholers, which of a truth you would not haue iudged to haue béen ſuch: but rather you would haue taken them for, Pilgrimes, and begging Friers: for a man could not haue preſumed any otherwiſe of them, ſéeing them wrapped in ſuch couerings, with white hattes tyed about the myddle with ſtringes: bare footed, with fowle dyrtie handes, and a moſt filthy and yrkſome countenaunce to beholde: they preſented vnto <hi>Amurathe</hi> certaine bookes, and painted papers of theyr owne inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Now theſe proper youthes, and naughtie packes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once come into the Parke, they beganne to crie out, to ſnort, and to laye on loade vppon the pales, and vppon the kettelles, pottes, and pannes, platters, and baſons, ſtryking vppon lyttle belles, chyldrens rattles, and cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balles, with a moſte ſtraunge and confuſed noyſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixte with daunces, and theyr moſt horrible and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute behauiours, for they made mockes and mowes, and gyrned at as many as laughed at theyr follies, and they neuer ceaſed to turne and tumble vppon both hand and foote.

This ſight aboue all the reſt, terrified me verie ſore, and then for the tyme, my ſpéeche was quite taken from me, and my tongue was, as if it had béene faſt tyed to the roofe of my mouth. Nowe ſome of that company made paſtime all daye long; with Apes, Catles, and Dogges, with young Goates, and lyttle Mules, with Hartes, and ſmall byrds: vppon which theyr ſportes and paſtimes, <hi>Amurathe</hi> him ſelfe, being giuen altogether to vanities, was more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, then vnto any other, yea, then all the reſt: for there was nothing with them, but gamboldes, friſkes, and daunces, moriſques, ſinging, cryinges out, and ſuch lyke vaine exerciſes: ſome of them in this theyr ſporting and playing, were bytten of Serpents, and venemous beaſts, and preſentlie then againe they were healed, and made whole of the ſame byting: and then loe, they made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt ſhamefull countenaunces and faces, moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthy to be ſet downe in writing.</p>

But I will firſt beginne with the Combat of the wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, an exerciſe very much ſette by among the Auncients, and ſuch a one, as did verye much delight as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the ſame: For the Herauld had no ſooner ended his proclamation, and crye, but ſtraight wayes came foorth in to the ſame place, xv. couple of wraſtlers, all naked and oyled after the olde faſhion, to catch holde the one by the other, euery one by his companion: one amongſt the reſt, pricked and praunced on, and ſette out himſelfe in the middeſt of the place, ſhowing his broade ſhoulders, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his armes, and as <hi>Dares</hi> did, whereof <hi>Virgil</hi> maketh mention, challenge and prouoking the reſte to wraſtle: and ſuddainly a young man came in before him, which was to ſight, no leſſe ſtronge, nor ſtoute then the other, and he beganne luſte lie to caſt vppe his legges, and his fiſtes into the ayre, then hauing made a prayer with a lowde vayce, and marching a little vp and downe, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſomewhat nimble and plyant, hee layes me faſt holde vpon him, as had ſo defyed him, by and by they came vnto handy gripes, and to graple themſelues together, laying eache other vpon the grounde, flatt vpon their noſes, then ryſing vppe againe, they fell to it luſtily, ſometime thruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and puſhing, and ſometime clypping, and colling eache other very ſtraightlie: ſometime ſhifting of places, and lifting one another vp aloft into the ayre. The one of them went about to catch the other faſt by the legge, wherby he ſhould leeſe his offered blowes and breath and all together, but he there with vnfolded and vntwined his legges, and ſette vpon the other as earneſtlie, for to make him looſe all that laboure: nowe they hauing béene at their priſes for the ſpace of three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb facs="tcp:9533:18"/>
they were well faine to giue ouer and reſt themſelues, and then <hi>Amurath</hi> commaunded them to depart. Then came the other alſo in their order, but they wreſtled not ſo ſtoutly, nor yet ſo long as the firſt did. And this is al that the wraſtlers did.</p>
               <p>Behold now came a company of 50. men, all on Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, well armed, and furniſhed throughout, both for theyr handes, and for all the reſt of their bodies, for all ſortes of Combats, theyr crooked ſwordes by theyr ſides, their bucklers about their neckes, their howes in theyr left handes, and ſtaues in their right handes, like vnto the halfe Pikes of <hi>Arabia,</hi> for the paſtime and ſporte which they would make.</p>
               <p>But becauſe theſe bee extraordinarie ſights, I haue thought good to write and diſcribe them ſomewhat more at length. Firſt of all, there were layde in the aboue named Parke, eyght heapes of Grauell, of equall height, and diſtaunce, foure on the one ſide, and foure on the other. In the midſt was a narrowe ſtraight way, but well couered ouer with fine thinne ſandy Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, of purpoſe: that if any of them in running ſhoulde fall downe, their fal ſhould not hurt, nor endaunger them, by meanes of the ſoftnes of the Grauell: vpon theſe hylls of Grauell, were faſtened ſtaues and poſtes, hauing foure on the one ſide white, all round at the point, and the other foure alſo white, made cirkle wiſe and as a fireſhouell, all made of Leather and Paper very properly. They were the poynts, and endes, where hée might ſitte and ſée all the ſporte and play of the Horſmen which began to march on that way ſteppe by ſteppe: fyrſt by great, then in raigne, and as in battail raye: vpon that they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of ranke altogether, and beganne theyr race with ſlacke brydle one after an other, and ſo neere, and iuſt vnto one another, that theyr horſſes were one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers heeles: and in running, they tooke theyr arrowes
<pb facs="tcp:9533:18"/>
out of theyr Duiuers, and couched them in ſuch good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they touched the verie rundels, ſo ſwiftly and ſo quickly as the eye was able readily to ſée the marke at the ſeconde courſe, becauſe they had not drawen, nor ſhott be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but onely at the rundels, they now ſetled themſelues againſt both the two, aſwell the rundels, as the others made cyrklewiſe (as I tolde you) and with ſo wonderfull a quicknes, and readineſſe therein, and helping themſelus ſometime with the left hand, and ſometime with the right without any turning or bowing of their bodies: and for the third charge, courſe or onſette in couching, they one while couered their right ſhoulder, and an otherwhile the left, with their bucklers, and that with quicknes incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, in running at all the brydle, they drew out theyr ſwoordes, and cutte the rundels, percing quite through the other faſhioned cirkles, and all this was doone in one onely courſe or race: then turning the bridle all ſhort, they addreſſed themſelues againſt the endes and poyntes thereof, and with their drawen ſwordes, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and beat downe the ſame: and by that meanes they got againe their bowes, and made one ſhoote or draught vp into the ayre: Furthermore, they wrought and did great maruailes with theyr halfe Pikes, in diuers kindes of Combatts, and in the ende when with theyr ſwordes they had cutte in peeces, they plucked vppe the ſtaues and poaſtes which were made faſt within the Grauell hylles, and caſt them vppe into the ayre, and in running, they caught and helde them faſt in their hands, then lyfting them vppon their horſe ſaddles, they beganne to vſe and handle them as before they did theyr ſwordes, and long bowes.</p>
               <p>But before I leaue off and giue ouer theſe particulers, I will ſpeake of one thing, moſt worthy of all to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and</p>

               <p>Out of theſe aforeſaid number of 50. went two younge men, verie faire and braue among all the reſt: the one of them ſtoode on his feete, in the ſaddle vpon the Horſback, and tooke his companion vppon his armes, ſtanding vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right vpon his feeſe, and béeing in this order, and manner, they put foorth the Horſe, (and gaue him the <hi>Carriere:)</hi> and they held them very faſt, and hee that was the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of them, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There were others alſo among them, which hauing ſixe naked ſwordes, and the poyntes thereof faſt tyed vpward to theyr Horſe ſaddles, put theyr heades alſo vpon, and toward the ſaddels, and theyr feete vpwarde, and ſo made the Horſſes to runne a galloppe, as faſt as if a man ſhould ſay, thus and thus it ſhalbe. On the otherſide there were among them, which ſette them two at once in one ſaddle, and as the Horſe ranne with all his power and might, they ſkipped vppe and downe from the Horſe, and then to the Horſe againe, very nimbly and luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, one after an other, and neuer made no ſtoppe nor ſtay at all: others there were, which turned themſelues bothe backwarde and forwarde in the ſaddell, the Horſe ſtill running, and courſing vp and downe verie roughlie, and

This béeing doone, they all ranne togeather on a heape, and béeing gotten vp againe on feete, vppon the Horſe ſaddels, they ſhot out theyr arrowes very ſtronglie and with great violence: and béeing in the ende diſperſed and ſet ſo a ſunder, they ranne one againſt an other, with their halfe Pykes and Iauelins, and did ſhow diuers ſuch notable feates, as the olde auncient ſpeare men were wont and accuſtomed to doo in courſes and feates of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie: furthermore, they taught very many fine feates and moſt notable, vnto theyr men of warre: as howe to prepare and make ready the battaill: to aſſaile: to preſſe: to encloſe the enemie, and hemme him in one euery ſide, to ſtrike him both on the right ſide and on the left, to deck and trimme vp their owne companies, and to giue the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette: to take in and to rebate: to pricke on, holde faſt, and turne theyr horſes, to purſue and follow after, to leaue off againe as they luſt: to take: to ſpoyle: to breake in, and thruſt vpon the enemie ouercome: to encourage the hearts of the Souldiers when he hath the worſt, to gather all his companies together: finally he taught all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pointes of warre, wherofboth Souldiers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ought not be ignoraunt.

But before I make an ende of the diſcourſe of the afternoone ſportes, I haue conſidered with my ſelfe, that it ſhall not be any thing at all hurtfull to the Reader, if I ſpeake a worde or two, of the dauncers ouer the lyne: many of them there, ſhewed foorth braue proofes of theyr ſkylles: but there was one among all the reſt, which gained and gotte the garland from them all: and I knowe no man that was not wholie rauiſhed, to ſée them runne ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainlie, with ſo good a grace, without ſtinting, and with ſo valiaunt a boldneſſe.</p>

For it coulde not bée, that by the power of one man, the whole worlde ſhould bee conuerted to God: and thus the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and inuiſible God, hath ſowen the trueth by hys worde in Ieruſalem: By his ſpirite hee illuminated and confirmed his Apoſtles, that they ſhould ſowe the trueth throughout the whole worlde, and that they ſhoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne death through the loue of God, who had ſent them, and by the loue of the ſaluation of the world, according to the enſample of Ieſus, who dyed willingly, according to that which was of man, that the world might be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Thus we beleeue one God in Trinitie, the Father, ſonne, and holy ſpirite, as our Lord Ieſus hath taught vs, and we beleeue that he is true, becauſe he is the trueth it ſelfe: and his Diſciples hath taught vs more at large: thus we doo vnderſtande of the power of his wiſedome.</p>
            <p>Wée beléeue that the word of God, and man, whom the that word of God put on, and the life of Chriſt in his fleſh was the life of man moſt holie, but the wiſedome of the power and workes of him, was the power of God.</p>
            <p>Wée beleeue, that as the ſoule and bodie is one man, ſo the word of God of one part, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other part. The ſoule and the body, are two diſtinct natures perfectly in one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo is the humanitie and deitye in Chriſt, two diſtinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, knitte together according to <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, neither is the word of God chaunged into fleſh or into the ſoule of Chriſt, neither is the fleſh of Chriſt, or his ſoule conuerted into the word of God, but the word of God was and is in Chriſt the word of God, by a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſputation, humanity, humanitie: and that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
<pb facs="tcp:9533:26"/>
haue not taken the deitie of the worde of Chriſte, but the deitie of the worde of God hath taken mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which conſiſteth in that, for as much as it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer thing is in God, and of God naturally, is God, becauſe there is nothing accidentall in God: and therefore we name and beleeue the intellectuall worde of God, to be God: and becauſe this worde of GOD was in Chriſte, for that cauſe wee confeſſe Chriſte to bee God and man: man, becauſe he conſiſteth of ſoule and body: God, becauſe of the word of God, which is in him.</p>
            <p>we beleeue, that the word of God is in Chriſt, and in the world, and in heauen, and in God, and in the Father, wherefore the word of God is infinite, as God is infinite, begetting him, that is as much to ſay: thinking, and hath an infinite power. But in God after one manner, and in Chriſt after an other manner, and in the world, after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner.</p>
            <p>We beléeue, that when God dooth communicate his goodnes and his grace to any creature, neuertheleſſe, it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from him, but thereby he is more magnified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the highneſſe of God, is made manifeſt by the vertue of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>The more excellent that the Creatour is, by greater communicating of his goodneſſe: ſo much the more the goodneſſe of God, and his loue towardes men, and hys power is declared.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the goodnes of God, and his loue towardes men, is more magnified in this point, that God himſelfe hath come into Ieſus Chriſt, with his omnipotentcie, then that which he ſent into his Prophets one of his graces or two, and in ſome one Prophet a leſſer grace, and into ſome other a greater.</p>
            <p>We beleeue that Chriſt was crucified and dyed, of hys owne proper will, for many and great profittes, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb facs="tcp:9533:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereof, we ſhould occupy many wordes: and he hath ſuffered all theſe thinges, according to that which was of man in him.</p>
            <p>As for the word of God, it is neither crucifyed, neyther dyeth, neither ryſeth againe: But he rayſeth vp the deade as hee raiſeth vp his owne fleſhe which he bare. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that Chriſt, after his reſurrection was aſſumpted vp into the heauens, and ſhall come againe with glorye, to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
            <p>Wée beleeue that mens ſoules are immortall, and that the bodyes of holy men, ſhall ryſe incorrupt, cleere, actiue, neither ſhall they haue any neede of meate, nor drinke, nor apparrell, nor any other corporall pleaſures: and that <note place="margin">Soules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</note> the ſoules and the bodies, of them that haue beleeued, and haue ledde theyr life vertuouſly, ſhall goe into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: but the impenitent, wicked, and Infideles, into pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: and that the Paradiſe of the Saintes, and the fruicion thereof, is in heauen: the puniſhment of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the earth: and that the fruition of the Saints is no thing els, then that ſuch ſoules ſhalbe perſit in knowledge, and ſhall beholde the miſteries of God, which they knowe not nowe, but by faith onelie.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was neceſſarie that the word of God, and God to be incarnate: many other thinges are neceſſarie, when neceſſity requireth, we are ready to render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof: after theſe reaſons, the ſeuen certifie vs of our Faith.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Prophets of the Iewes, haue ſhewed before, whom we receyue, of this Ieſus, what ſoeuer hee hath doone, or whatſoeuer haue béene doone, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer his diſciples haue doone by his power: The like the Oracles of the Greekes haue foreſhewed by the gift of God, and the like did the Aſtronomers of the Perſians and of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> with the preaching of Ieſus.</p>

               </gap>dent and wiſe: and by this meanes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious deceite of deuils was ouerthrowne. This faith and religion conteineth nothing impoſſible, neither any thing that is diſſonant with it ſelfe, neither any corporall thing, but all ſpirituall: and it is the way which leadeth mens ſoules vnto the loue of God, and of euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>So many as haue receiued this faith, and haue lyued bertuouſly, according to the Lawe of Chriſt, haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great gifts of God, and haue doone many miracles, which thin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To the ſame Ieſus our Lorde, the true God, be glory. Amen.</p>
