            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pretending to believe in Chriſt as their life and ſalvations and to deny all them and their Faith and wayes who ſay they have faith, but their life is not the life of Chriſt, but they live in ſin and worldly pleaſures, and ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved from their ſins in this world, but in part, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that they, for their parts, live the life of Chriſt in fulneſs of perfection here in this life, when it is evident to the contrary, and eaſily demonſtrable, that they are led away with a ſpirit of defuſion to believe lyes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For firſt, the Spirit of God teacheth us to <hi>honour all men:</hi> But their Spirit of deluſion teacheth and leadeth them not to honour or reverence any man at all, though in never ſo high or honourable a place or condition of life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God teacheth us to be courteous and tender hearted towards all men; but their Spirit teacheth and leadeth to be courteous and tender hearted towards no man, but teacheth them meer incivility, like the bruit beaſts that are led with ſenſuality as utterly void of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God teacheth us to <hi>judge nothing before the time;</hi> yea, even Chriſt himſelf biddeth us, <hi>Judge not that we be not judged;</hi> but their Spirit teacheth them both to judge and condemn, and with a moſt auſtere counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance call men damned, and carnall, and hirelings, and deceivers, and proud, when they can demonſtrate no ſuch thing, but in the judgement of charity might judge the contrary, if they had that ſpirit and faith which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God teacheth us to <hi>let other men praiſe us, and not our own mouth, strangers, and not our own lips,</hi> and to <hi>let our works praiſe us in the gates,</hi> like the verteons woman: But their fruits teacheth them to praiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they were perfect already, even as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, intimating, as if Chriſt already had impowered them to do the will of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God teacheth us to <hi>ſpeak the truth in love and meekneſſe,</hi> and <hi>not to truſt in our ſelves that we are

righteous, and deſpiſe others,</hi> like the proud Phariſee, but their ſpirit teacheth them both to falſifie and belie our doctrine and Profeſſion, intimating to the people by their falſe ſuggeſtions, that we ſhould teach ſuch doctrin as are quite contradictious to the word of God; to wit, That Chriſt is not <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come unto God by him;</hi> or that we ſhould not account him <hi>the great power of God to ſalvation of them that believe;</hi> All which we utterly deny to be our doctrine or faith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But we have learned from that Spirit which teacheth us not to exalt our ſelves, but to think ſoberly, and to ſpeak modeſtly of our ſelves in reſpect of our preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, as not accounting our ſelves already perfect, nor to ſpeak of our ſelves, above that which may be ſeen in us, or heard of us: though yet for ought they know, we utterly <hi>forget that which is behinde, and preſſe forward to that which is before, even the mark and the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus: If poſſible that we might attain to the Reſurrection of the dead:</hi> A mark which they know not as yet what it meaneth, though they prefeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perfect, and to have Chriſt within them, and that ſo many as have Chriſt have this power, and what have they not (by their own Profeſſion, if we can believe them) already within them; But I hope we may know the tree by its fruits: better than their own teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Spirit of God teacherh us not to own any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that is in Chriſt as properly ours, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it his, though we have Chriſt in us: For though <hi>the life we now live is by Faith in the Son of God, who hath loved us and hath given himſelf for us: yet it is not we that live, but Chriſt that liveth in us.</hi>

            <p>But their Spirit teacheth them to own every perfection that is in Chriſt as properly theirs; affirming that they that have Chriſt have power; and they that believe have power to do the will of God, and they deny all thoſe that ſay they have Faith in Chriſt, and yet their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not perfect, becauſe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is perfect, which yet is not properly theirs, but onely through

faith, and that by imputation, and they alſo deny all thoſe, and their Faith and hope, who ſay they hope to be ſaved, and yet live in ſin, making a profeſſion; for, ſay they, he that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure: ſo that if he be not purified in perfection like Chriſt, they ſay, it is but the hope of the hypocrite, which ſhall periſh: And they alſo deny all who ſay they have Faith and Chriſt, and yet their word and light is without them; for he that hath Chriſt or faith, hath this Word and Light which is Chriſt; as if a man could not have Chriſt by Faith, but he muſt of neceſſity have the fulneſſe of Chriſt, the eſſentiall Word and Light whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within them, whom the heavens of heavens are not able to contain, conceived as God, nor are all creatures able to comprehend. Again they affirm, that he that hath that Word of faith which the Apoſtles preached, hath this Word not in the Letter, but in the Spirit, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had onely ſpoke of Chriſt the eſſentiall word, and not incluſively of the ſpirituall miniſtration of the Word of God, in his ſacred Name: And ſo again they deny all them whoſe law is without and morall, for they own that Law which is ſpiritual within wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="8">8. The Spirit of Truth teacheth us, That <hi>Chriſt our righteouſneſſe was ſacrificed for us,</hi> and that his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe onely may be called perfect, and depended on for our juſtification, and not our own inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; yet we alſo endeavour to <hi>purifie our ſelves even as he is pure,</hi> and do preſs onwards towards perfection,
