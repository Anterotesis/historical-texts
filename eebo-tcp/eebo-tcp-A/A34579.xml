            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>A Pprove my weakness, and suffer my griefe,
It is but too just in so great a misery;
such storms as these ready to powr upon them,
will shake the stoutest courages; the least
dejected masc'line Spirit without disorder
can't exercise its Vertue; although mine
receive amazement at these rude alarmes,
the trouble of my heart can nothing worke
upon my teares, and amongst all the sighs
it send's to Heaven, my constancy raignes still
over mine eyes. When one doth stop the course
of the Souls sadness and affliction,
though it be less then man, 'tis more then woman:
in this extremity to command teares,
is to shew strength enough in our weake sex.</p>

                     <p>Enough, and too much for a common Soul,
that from the meanest danger doth expect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48680:5"/>
but one misfortune; a great heart doth scorne
such an abasement, it despaires of nothing,
though in occurrents doubtful; the two armies
stand in battalia before our walls;
but <hi>Rome</hi> knows not yet how to lose a field,
we need not fear her, rather lets applaud her;
since she goes forth to fight, she goes to conquer:
then banish, banish quite so vaine a fear,
and conceive brave desires worthy a <hi>Romane.</hi>

                     <p>I am a <hi>Romane,</hi> since my Hushands is so,
marriage makes me embrace <hi>Romes</hi> interest;
but it should hold my heart like a chain'd slave,
if it did make me to forget the place
where I was born. <hi>Alba,</hi> where I began
to breath my first aire, <hi>Alba,</hi> my deare Country,
and my first love, when between us and thee
I see the war commenc'd, I feare our Victory
as much as our destruction. <hi>Rome,</hi> if thou
complain'st that I am partial herein,
fix upon enemies that I may hate:
When I see drawn up'fore thy walls both Armies,
my three brave Brothers in the one, and my
undaunted Husband in the other, can I
pray for thee, and without impiety
importune Heaven for thy felicity?
I know thy State, yet in its infancy,
cannot without war fix its puissance:
I know it must grow great, and that thy destinies
will not at home be bounded with the Latins;
I know the Gods have promised to thee
the Empire of the Earth and that thou can'st not
See th' effect of it, but by the war:
so far am I from off'ring to oppose
this thirst of Glory, which obeyes so readily
the Gods decrees, and posteth to thy greatness,
that I would see thy Crowned Troops already
pass the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> carry thy battalions
into the <hi>East,</hi> plaint thy Pavillions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48680:5"/>
upon the banks of <hi>Rhine,</hi> make the proud columns
of <hi>Hercules</hi> to shake under thy feet:
But love a town to whom thou owest <hi>Romulus:</hi>
Ingratful, know that from her Kings rich blood
thou tak'st thy name, thy walls, and thy first laws:
<hi>Alba</hi> is thy original; stay, and wisely
consider that thou carryest the sword
into thy Mothers bosome; turn elsewhere
the force of thy triumphant armes: her joy
will breake forth in her childrens happiness;
and overcome with a maternal love,
her prayers will be for thee, if thou art not
against her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
                     <p>This discourse surpriseth me,
since from the time that we first arm'd against
her people, I have seen so much indifference
in you for her, as if you had been born
within our walls: I admired in you
the vertue that reduc'd your dearest interests
unto your husbands, and did pity you
in the mid'st of your plaints, as if our <hi>Rome</hi>
had caused all your fears.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sabina.</speaker>
                     <p>Whil'st they encountered
but in light skirmishes, not strong enough
to cast each other down; whil'st a glad hope
of peace flatter'd my trouble, it is true,
I tooke a vanity to be all <hi>Romane:</hi>
if I saw <hi>Rome</hi> prevail, with some regret
I suddenly condemn'd this secret motion;
again, if I resented in her contrary
success any malignant joy in favour
of my three brothers, suddenly to smother it,
calling my reason to me, I lamented
when Glory entered into their house.
But now alas! that one of them must fall,
that <hi>Alba</hi> become slave, or that <hi>Rome</hi> sinke,
and that after the battel there remaine
no obstacle more to the conquerours,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48680:6"/>
nor hope unto the conquered, I should
shew an unnatural hate unto my Country,
if I could be all <hi>Romane</hi> yet, and should
ask of the Gods your triumph, at the price
of so much blood which is so precious to me.
I tye me not so strictly to the interest
of a man, that I should forget my Country:
I'm not for <hi>Alba</hi> nor am I for <hi>Rome;</hi>
I am afraid for one, and for the other,
in this last conflict, and must be of that side
which fortune shall afflict; indifferent
to both untill the Victory, I will
participate the ils without assuming
any thing of the glory, and will keep
my tears in store for the conquered party,
and my hate for the conquerours.</p>

                     <p>How often
we see such traverses as these arise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in diverse spirits diverse passions!
In this <hi>Camilla</hi> acts clean contrary;
her brother is your Husband; yours, her Lover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but she sees with an eye far different
from yours; her blood in one camp, and her Love
in th' other; when you did conserve a spirit
all <hi>Romane,</hi> hers irresolute and fearful,
incertain, fear'd the storm of the least mixture,
of either party hated the advantage,
to the misfortune of the vanquished
still gave her plaints, and so she nourished
eternal griefes; but yesterday when she
understood that the Armies did advance
resolved to joyn battaile, on her brow
a sudden joy appear'd.</p>

                     <p>Oh <hi>Julia,</hi> how I fear so quick a change!
Yesterday in her faire and pleasant humour
she entertain'd <hi>Valerius;</hi> without doubt
she quits my brother for this happy rival;
her spirit shaken by the present objects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48680:6"/>
finds nothing amiable in an absent one
after two yeers. But pray excuse the heat
of a fraternal love; the care I have
of him, doth make me fear all things from her;
I frame suspitions from too light a subject,
The day of battel is unfit to change,
with a new dart few hearts are wounded then,
in so great trouble one hath other thoughts:
But who can have such pleasant entertainments,
and such contentments as may equall hers?</p>

                     <p>The causes are as obscure unto me
as unto you, I can't he satisfied
by any thought, any conjecture on't;
'tis constancy enough in so great danger,
to see it, to attend it without griefe;
but surely 'tis too much t'expresse it further
even unto joy.</p>

                     <p>See how a gentle Genius
hath fittly sent her to us! Try to make her
discourse upon this point, she loveth you
too well to conceal any thing from you:
I leave you, <hi>Julia,</hi> entertain my Sister.
I am asham'd to shew so much of melancholy,
and my heart hurthened with a thousand fears,
seeks solitude to hide its sighs and tears.</p>

                     <p>'Tis to no purpose to disguise a thing
that is so cleare: I saw you yesterday
receive <hi>Valerius</hi> court-ship, and the favour
which he receiv'd from you, gives him encouragement
to nourish a sweet hope.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Camilla.</speaker>
                     <p>If yesterday
I entertain'd him with a pleasing countenance,
think nothing on't but to his disadvantage;
of my content another was the object.
But to remove your error, know the cause on't;
I look on <hi>Curiacius</hi> with an amity
too pure to suffer my self longer to be
thought perjur'd. About five or six months after
my Brother marryed his Sister (<hi>Julia</hi>
you know it) he obtained of my Father
that I should be his Wife. This day was prosperous
and fatal to us both at once, uniting
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48680:7"/>
our houses, it did disunite our Kings;
our marriage and the war were both concluded
at the same instant, our hope as soon dead
as born, all promises lost assoon as made:
Oh how extreme then were our miseries!
how many blasphemies did <hi>Curiacius</hi>
Vomit forth against Heaven? how many Rivers
flow'd from mine eyes? I need not tell it you,
you saw our farwels; you have since beheld
the troubles of my soul, you know what prayers
my flame hath made for peace, and what sad plaints
at every encounter I have uttered,
as fate dispos'd it; sometime for my Country,
and sometime for my Lover: my dispaire
at last constrained me to have recourse
Unto the Oracles. Hearken unto
the voyce that yesterday they gave unto me,
and give me your opinion, whether I
have reason thereupon to reassure
my dismay'd spirit. That Greek so much renown'd,
who for so many yeers foretold our destinies
at the foot of <hi>Aventine,</hi> he I mean,
that inspir'd by <hi>Apollo</hi> ne'r spake false,
doth promise in these verses a quick end
Unto my travels.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>The Oracle.</speaker>
                     <p>Thy prayers are heard, <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> shall be
to morrow in a faire confaederacy,
and thou with <hi>Curicius</hi> shalt be joyn'd
never to part, so have the Gods enjoyn'd.</p>
                     <stage>She continues.</stage>
                     <p>Upon this Oracle I ground a firme
beliefe, and as the successe pass'd may hope,
I gave my soul over to ravishments,
which pass'd the transports of the happiest Lovers:
Judge you of their excess. I met <hi>Valerius,</hi>
and he could not, as he was wont, displease me,
he spake to me of Love without my trouble;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48680:8"/>
I perceiv'd not that I discours'd with him,
I could not shew him coldness, nor contempt;
all that I saw seem'd <hi>Curiacius</hi> to me,
all that he said unto me, spake his fires,
all what I said assur'd him of my love.
A general fight to day is doubted much,
I heard the news on't yesterday, and was
not troubled at it, my Spirit did reject
these fatall objects, charm'd with the sweet thoughts
of marriage and peace: But this last night
hath dissipated those so charming errors.
A thousand fearful dreams, and bloody Images,
or rather heapes of slaughter and of horrour
snatch'd my joy from me, and fill'd me with fear:
I saw dead bodies, blood, and nothing else,
a spirit appearing suddenly tooke flight,
they defac'd one another, and each fantasme
redoubled my fear by its confusion.</p>

Whether <hi>Rome</hi> fall, or <hi>Alba</hi> be o'rthrown,

let who will herein look on thy Renowne,

the more thy Love appears, the more she ought
to cherish thee: and if thou owest much
unto the place that gave thee birth, the more
thou quit'st for me, the more thy Love appears,
But hast thou seen my Father? can he suffer
thee in his house thus? doth he not preferre
the State before his private Family?
regardeth he not <hi>Rome</hi> more then his daughter
Lastly, is our good fortune well assur'd?

I give not up the interest of my towne,

<hi>Camilla;</hi> so long as the war hath lasted,
I have approv'd my self as good a Citizen,
as faithful lover. I would with my Love
reconcile <hi>Alba's</hi> quarrel, I sigh'd for you
in combating for her; and if we must
yet come to strokes, I should, alas! fight for her,
and sigh for you: in spight of the desires
of my charm'd soul, if the warre should continue,
I should be in the Army: it is peace
that giveth me a free accesse unto you,
peace, unto which our love oweth this happinesse.</p>

                     <p>Ye Gods, who even could have thought it!
Already the two Armies animated
unto the combate, with an equal heat
threatned each other with their eyes, and fiercely
advancing, look'd for nothing but the signall
to give the charge, when our discreet Dictator
putting himself some distance fore the ranks,
demanded of your Prince a minutes silence;
it being granted him, 
<q>What do we, Romans,
(said he) what divel provoketh us to arms?
let reason rule, and cleer your understandings.
We are your neighbours, your fair daughters are
our wives, and ours are yours; <hi>Hymen</hi> hath joyn'd us
by so many reciprocal strong knots
that there are few of our sons which are not
your Nephews; and to speak the truth, we are
but one blood, and one people in two Towns;
why should we tear our selves by civil warrs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48680:9"/>
where the death of the conquered weakneth
the conquerors, and the most beautious triumph
is watered with tears? Our common enemies
expect with joy, when one of us defeated,
shall leave the other as a prey unto them;
they have too long enjoy'd the benefit
of our divisons: let us for the future
joyne all the forces that we have against them,
and let us drown these petty differences
forever in Oblivion, which make
so ill allies of such good Warriours:
but if th'ambition to command each other
maketh your troops and ours to march to day,
if we would but appease her with lesse blood,
she will unite, farre from dividing, us.
Let us name Combatants for th' common cause,
each people fix it self unto their own;
and as the chance of Arms shall dispose of them,
the weakest party shall obey the strongest;
but with this reservation, that the conquered
without indignity to such brave Warriours,
shall not be slaves, but subjects, free from tribute
or shame, without other subjection
then to be bound to follow in all places
the Colours of the Conqueror. Thus our
two States wil make but one resplendent Empire.</q>
He ended here, every one figh'd with joy,
and looking each into the others ranks,
knew there a friend, a cozen, or a brother:
they wondred how their hands, greedy of blood,
flew rashly to so many parricides,
and shew'd a face at once cover'd with horror
of battaile, and with ardour for this choice:
At last the offer was accepted, and
the desir'd peace on those conditions
was swore of both sides, three should fight for all:
but for to make the better choice, our Chiefs
will take a little leisure. Your election
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48680:10"/>
is in the Senate, our within a Tent.</p>

are free, expecting when they shall be nam'd;
<hi>Rome's</hi> in our Campe, and our Campe is in <hi>Rome;</hi>
free access being allowed of both sides,
every one goes to finde his ancient friend,

my passion made me seeke your noble Brothers,

before all others, and opposing to us
no other armes but yours, braveth all ours

all is committed to your hands, there is
no <hi>Romane</hi> besides <hi>Horace</hi> and his Sons:
This choice can fill three Families with Glory,
and consecrate their names to future ages:
Oh yes! the honour which your doth receive

and since with you my fortune and may flame
have made me place my Sister, chuse my wife,
that which I ought to be, and what I am

as much as possibly I can: But sadly
another interest doth restraine my Joy,
and mingles bitterness amongst those sweets;
the war hath cast such a refulgent ray
upon your Valour, that I shake for <hi>Alba,</hi>

her ruine is assur'd; in making you

for her, in having so many brave Hero's
to chuse, and yet to take the worst; a thousand
of her faire Children, far more worthy of her
then we, could better have sustain'd her quarell:
But though this combat points me out a grave,
the Glory of this choice doth swell me up
with a just pride, my spirit doth receive
a masculine assurance by't, I dare
by vertue of it to hope much from my
small Valour, and what ere the projects be
of envious fortune, I do not account me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48680:11"/>
it'h' number of your subjects: <hi>Rome</hi> hath too much

in the condition that we are, I dare them

to do their worst now, what so e'r they have
of horrible and cruel, is much less

                     <p>Fortune, that opens us the lists of honour,
offers a glorious matter to our constancy,
she draines her force to strengthen a misfortune.
To measure her self better with our Valour,
as she esteemeth us not common souls,
she doth exclude our fortunes from the common.
To fight an enemy for the general safety,
and to expose ones self alone to stroaks
against a stranger, is but the effect of
a simple vertue, thousands have already
perform'd it, thousands can perform it still:
to lay ones life down for his Country, is
so faire a fate, so worthy an exposure,
that all should strive to purchase such a death:
But to be willing for to sacrifice
unto the publick that which we do love,
to tye us resolutely to the combat
against our other self, t' assault a party
that takes the Brother of a wife, and Lover
of a deare Sister for its sole defender,
and breaking all these knotts, to arme for's Country
against a blood which one would purchase with
his life, is such a vertue as belongs not
but unto us: The glorious lustre of
its great name makes but few jealous of it;
very few men have so imprinted it
i' th' heart, as to dare to aspire unto
so much renown.</p>

                     <p>'Tis true, our names henceforth
shall never dye, th' occasion is faire
'tis fit we cherish it, we shall be held
the mirrous of a vertue very rare.
But for all that, our constancy and courage
savours a little of barbarity:
few even of the great hearts would be proud
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48680:12"/>
to goe this way to immortality;
at how high price soever we do set
such a smoake, such vanity; obscurity
is better then so much renown: for my part,
I dare avouch it, and you might have seen it,
that I consulted not upon my duty;
nor our long amity: Love, nor alliance
could e'r suspend my spirit a moments space;
and since by this choice <hi>Alba</hi> shewes indeed
that she esteemeth me asmuch as <hi>Rome</hi>
doth you, I think to do as much for her
as you for <hi>Rome;</hi> I have as good a heart:
but lastly, I'm a man. I see your honour
consists in shedding of my blood, that all
mine doth depend on peircing of your body:
ready t' espouse the Sister, I must kill
the Brother, and all for my Countries sake;
although without fear I fly to my duty,
my heart is fiercely angry, and I tremble
for horrour on't; I cannot chuse but pity
my self, and cast an envious eye on those
whose lives our war hath ravish'd, yet without
any desire to retreat, or relinquish;
this sad and Violent honour moveth me,
but shakes me not; I love that which it gives me,
and waile that which it taketh away from me:
and if <hi>Rome</hi> doth demand a higher vertue,
I thank the Gods that made me not a <hi>Romane,</hi>
to conserve yet something of humane in me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Horat.</speaker>
                     <p>If you are not a <hi>Romane,</hi> make your self
worthy to be so: if you equall me,
make it appear more plainly. Solid vertue,
whereof I boast, admits no weakness with
its constancy, and it is ill to enter
into the lists of honour, and at first step
to looke behind us; our misfortune's great,
it is arriv'd unto the highest point,
I look it boldly in the face, without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48680:13"/>
trembleing to see it. Against whom soever
my Country doth imploy me, I accept
this glory blindly, but yet joyfully:
that, to receive such faire commands, should smother
in us all other sentiments; who considers,
besides to serve her, any other thing,
disposeth himself poorly to his duty;
this sacred right breaketh all other bonds;
<hi>Rome</hi> hath found out my arm, I'le not examine it;
with as sincere and full a joy as I
Married the sister, I will fight the brother.
And lastly, to cut off this frivolous speech,
<hi>Alba</hi> hath nam'd you, I know you no more.</p>

but this sharpe vertue was not known unto me;
as our misfortune now is, 't is arriv'd
unto the highest point, suffer me to
admire it, and not imitate it.</p>

you finde more pleasure in complaint, enjoy
so sweet a good with all full liberty.
Behold my Sister comes to lament with you:
I'le goe to see yours, to resolve her soul
unto this thought, that she is still my wife,
to love you still, though I dye by your hands,

render unto the honour that expects it,
its purity, without mingling of crimes
set its faire lustre on it: in a word,
I faine would make you lawfull enemies;
I am the sole bond of that sacred knot

or at least one of you shall justly fight
for to revenge his wife, or else his sister.
But what! you would fully so faire Glory,
if any other quarrell should provoake you:
your zeal unto your Country doth forbid you
such cares, you should do very little for it,
if less then this; unto it you must sacrifice,
and without hate, a Brother in law, no more then
deferre that which you ought to do; begin,
and practise by his wife to shed his blood,
begin to peirce his bosome by his sister;
begin to make a worthy sacrifice
of your illustrious lives to your deare praties
by the death of <hi>Sabina;</hi> y'are enemies,
you unto <hi>Alba,</hi> your to <hi>Rome,</hi> and I

the laurles of a brother or a husband
smoake with a blood that I so cherished?
can I between you two govern my heart then?
fulfill the duty of sister and wife?
embrace the conquerour in weeping for
the conquered? no, no, before <hi>Sabina</hi>
shall feel this stroake, the death which expect
from one of you, shall readily prevent it.
If you deny your hands, my own shall execute it;
on then, who holds you? on, inhumane hearts!
I shall have means enough to force you to it;

                     <p>MY soul, we cannot stand indifferent,
one side 'tis requisite I take; I must
be wife unto <hi>Horatius,</hi> or sister
to <hi>Curiatius;</hi> cease we to divide
our fruitless cares, let us desire something,
and fear a little less; but which to take,
alas! I know not, in a chance so contrary;
it is a hard extremity to chuse
a husband or a brother for an enemy;
Nature or Love doth speake for each of them,
and by the laws of duty I am ty'd
unto them both: on their high sentiments
rather lets rule our own, be the wife of th' one,
and sister of the other both together,
let's looke upon their honour as a good
unparallell'd, let's imitate their constancy,
and let us feare no more; the death which threatens them
is such a faire death, that we should not be
afraid to heare the news o'nt; let's not call then
the destinies inhumane, let us think
upon the cause, and not upon the hands,
let us behold the conquerours as if
we had no other thought but of the glory
which all their house receiveth from their Victory,
without considering what blood is shed
to raise their vertue to that glorious hight,
let's make our interests of their Family,
in the one I am wife, in th' other daughter,
and hold of both by such strong obligations
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48680:17"/>
that they cannot triumph but by my armes.
Fortune, whatever evils thy rigour sends me,
I have the means to derive joy from thence,
and to see now the combat without fear,
the dead without despaire, the conquerours
without confusion. Flattering illusion,
sweet and gross error, vaine indeavour of
my sonl, impuissant light, whose false sparks take
a priviledge to dazle me! how little
thou last's, and how soon vainshest! much like
unto those lightnings which in the thick shades
thrust forth a sudden day, and afterward
renders the night more gloomy and obscure;
thou struck'st mine eyes but with a moments brightness
to overwhelme them with eternal night.
Thou too much flattered'st my punishment,
and Heaven offended at it, selleth me
this moment of refreshment very deare,
I feele my sad heart pierc'd with all the stroakes,
that now deprive me of a brother or
a husband; when I think upon their death,
what ever I propose, I think by what arme,
and not for what cause, nor can I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ehold
the conquererours in their illustrious ranke
but to consider at what bloods expense;
the house o' th' vanquish'd party onely touches
my soul, in one I'm daughter, wife in th' other,
and hold of both by such strong obligations,
that they cannot triumph but by my armes.
This is that peace then I so much desired!
Too favourable Gods, you heard my prayers!
what thunder-bolts dart you, when you are wronged,
when even your favours are so full of cruelties?
And in what manner punish you offence,
if thus you use the prayers of innocence?</p>

                     <p>There was no need of such a tender spectacle,
their sight brought obstacle enough unto
their fight; assoon as they were ready to
measure their swords, both one, and th' other Camp
began to murmur, that persons so neer
ally'd, should sacrifice each others life
unto their Countries quarrel; one was mov'd
with pity, and another seiz'd with horrour,
some wonder'd at the madness of their zeal,
others extoll'd their vertue to the Heavens,
and some presum'd to name it sacrilegious
and brutish; all these diverse sentiments
had yet but one voice, every one accused
their Chiefs, all with a general consent
abhorr'd their choice, not able to endure
so barbarous a combat, they cry'd out on't,
advaunced therupon, and parted them.</p>

you may hope, you have less to fear: but yet
there doth remain unto you cause enough
wherewith to wail you. Vain was the indeavour
to free them from so sada fate, these generous,
or rather cruel combatants could not
consent unto 't; the glory of this choice
seemed so precious to them, and so much
charm'd their ambitious souls, that when they were
deplored, they esteemed themselves happy,
and tooke the pity that was shew'd unto them
for an affront: The trouble of both camps
seem'd unto them to sully their renown,
they rather would combat with both the armies,
and dye by the same hands that parted them,
then quit the honours were confer'd upon them.</p>

                     <p>They were so, but the armies mutany'd,
and uttering their cryes both at one time,
demanded other combatants, or battaile.
Scarce was the presence of the Chiefs respected,
their power was doubtful, their words not attended:
the King himself was much astonish'd at it.
Since every one (said he) dislikes this discord,
let us consult the sacred Majesty
of the great Gods, and see we if this change
be pleasing to them: where's that impious soul
will dare oppose their will, when in a sacrifice,
they shall be pleas'd to manifest it to us?
He held his peace, and these words seemed charmes,
yea from six combatants snatch'd away their armes;
and this desire of honour which shut up
their eyes, though blind, respected yet the Gods:
their boiling heat submitted to the counsell
of <hi>Tullus;</hi> and were it by an appeale,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48680:19"/>
or by a ready scruple, in both armies
'twas made a law, as if they both acknowledg'd him
for King; the victimes death will shew the rest.</p>

<hi>Horatius</hi> death is onely to be fear'd

the marriage that tyeth us unto
another family, untyeth us
from that wherein we lived maids; these knots
so different, are not to be compar'd;
we must leave Parents, Friends and all the world
to follow a deare husband. But if, Sister,
so neer unto a marriage, the Lover
which a glad farther gives, is less unto us
then husband, and not less then brother, surely
our sentiments between them do remain
suspended, our choice is impossible,
and our desires confounded. Thus you have

although we leave them, <hi>Hymen</hi> doth not raze out

our brothers; nature alwayes doth conserve
her first rights, when the death of either one

they are as well unto us, as a husband,

you never lov'd you know not Love, nor felt
his darts: one may resist him in the birth,
but when he's grown, and become Master of us,
we cannot banish him; especially
when the consent of Father in engaging
our faith hath made this tyrant lawfull King.
He entereth with sweetness, but he raignes
by force; and when the soul hath tasted once
his sweet temptation, to love no more
is that it cannot do; since it cannot
desire but what he will, his chaines are for us
as strong as faire.</p>

                     <p>I come to bring unto you sorrowful news;
my daughters, but in vain I should conceale it you,
which could not but a little time be hidden;
your Brothers are in fight, the Gods ordain'd it.</p>

                     <p>I must confess this news doth much astonish me
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48680:21"/>
I thought there was in the Divinities
much less injustice, and much more of goodness:
comfort us not, reason is troublesome
when it dares to oppose such a misfortune;
we have the end of our griefs in our hands,
who can resolve to dye, can brave disaster.
We easily could make, Sir, in your presence
a feigned constancy of our despaire;
but when one can without shame be without
resolved courage, 'tis a cowardise
to counterfeit it: the use of such art
we leave to men, and will not pass for that
but what we are: It is not our desire
that such a stout spirit should abase it self
by our example to complain of fortune;
receive these mortal tidings without trembling,
behold without mingling your own with them
our tears flow down our cheeks; lastly we crave
(as all the favour we desire in such
calamities,) that you will keepe your constancy,
and suffer our sad sighs.</p>

                     <p>I am so farre
from blaming the tears which I see you shed,
that I can scarce defend me from their force,
and should perhaps yeild to such strong assaults,
if herein we had both like interest:
not that your <hi>Alba</hi> by her choice hath made me
to hate your brothers, all three are deare persons
yet unto me; but amity is not
of the same ranke, and hath not the effects
of love nor blood. I do not feele for them
the griefe that doth torment <hi>Sabina</hi> as
a Sister, and <hi>Camila</hi> as a Lover;
I can behold them as our enemies,
and give without regret my prayers and wishes
unto my Sons; they are (thanks to the Gods)
worthy their Country; no astonishment
e'r perished their glory, and I saw
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48680:21"/>
their honour increase highly when their courages
refus'd the pity of both campes. If they
by any weakness had desired it,
if their high vertue had not presently
refused it, my hand should have reveng'd me
upon them of the affront which their effeminate
consent had done me; but when in despight
of them they would have other combatants,
I'le not deny't, I joyn'd my prayers with yours;
if pitiful Heaven had hearkned to my voice,
<hi>Alba</hi> should be reduc'd to chuse anew,
we should see then the <hi>Horaces</hi> triumph
without seeing their hands stain'd with the blood
of the bold <hi>Curiatii,</hi> and upon
the event of a combat farre more reasonable
the honour of the <hi>Romane</hi> name would now
depend. The prudence of the Gods doth otherwise
dispose thereof, on their eternall order
my spirit doth repose, it armes it self
on this occasion with generosity,
and of the publick good makes its felicity.
Indeavour both of you to do as much,
to ease your griefs, and think that you are <hi>Romanes:</hi>
you are become so, you (<hi>Camllia</hi>) born such;
so glorious a title is a treasure;
a day, a day will come that <hi>Rome</hi> shall make
its glorious name fear'd like the thunderbolts
through the whole earth, and all the universe
shall shake under its lawes, it will become
th' ambition of Kings; for the Gods have promis'd
this glory unto our <hi>Aeneas.</hi>

after this base bout every instant of

                     <p>Be pleas'd to understand; the valour of
this son, whom wrongfully you do condemn,
resting alone 'gainst three, (but in this passage,
all the three being wounded, and he free)
too weake for all, too strong for either of them,
he thought it fit a little to retire him;
he fled to fight the better; this quick policie
fitly divides the brothers, each of them
follows him with a pace more or less eager,
as he doth finde himself more or less hurt:
their heat was equal to pursue his flight,
but their unequal blows did separate
their pursuite: when <hi>Horatius</hi> saw them thus
scattered one from the other, he return'd,
and thought them more then halfe conquer'd already:
he did expect the first, and 'twas your son in law,
who all enraged that he should stay for him,
in vain did make a great heart to appear,
assaulting him, the blood that he had lost
weakened his strength: <hi>Alba</hi> began to fear
a change of fortune, she cry'd to the second
that he should ayd his Brother; he made hast,
and spent himself in vain attempts for her,
but found his Brother dead when he came up.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48680:24"/>
and soon redoubled <hi>Horatius</hi> Victory;
his courage without strength was a weak prop:
desirous to revenge his brothers death,
he fell down by him. The air did resound
with cryes, which all sent unto heaven upon it;
<hi>Alba</hi> breath'd sorrow, and the <hi>Romans</hi> joy.
As our brave <hi>Hero</hi> saw his enterprise
neer at an end, he would a little vaunt
as well as conquer: I am come (said he)
from sacrificing two unto the Ghosts

the Victory remain'd not long time doubtful;
the <hi>Alban</hi> pierc'd with wounds, could hardly stand,

the pompous sacrifice which we owe to the gods
for such a benefit; onely to day
we pay them but with songs of Victory,
and ordinary vows. The King doth lead him
unto the Temple, whilst he sendeth mee
to do this office to you both of joy

and grief together: But this is not yet
enough for him, he will come here himself,
perhaps to day; this noble action
so highly toucheth him, that he will thank you
with his own mouth, for giving your brave sons
to the good of his State.</p>

                     <p>Daughter, this is no fit time to shed tears:
it is not handsome when we see such honours:
We mourn unjustly for domestick losses,
when publick Victories proceed from thence:
<hi>Rome</hi> triumphs over <hi>Alba,</hi> and that is
enough for us; all our ills at this rate
ought to be sweet unto us; in the death
of a dear Lover, you lose but a man,
whose losse is easie to repair in <hi>Rome:</hi>
after this victory, there is no Roman
but will be proud to give his hand to you.
I must go to <hi>Sabina</hi> with this news;
this stroak (without doubt) will be grievous to her,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48680:25"/>
her Brothers stain all by her Husbands hand,
will give her juster tears and plaints then you:
But I hope easily to dissipate
the violence thereof, and that a little
discretion assisting her great courage,
will make the generous love she owes unto
the Conqueror, reign on so noble heart:
In the mean time, smother this unbecoming
and poor low passion. If he comes, receive him,
and shew no weaknesse; make your self appear
to be his Sister, and that in one womb
Heaven form'd you both of the same blood and substance.</p>

that a true Love can brave the Destinies,
and cannot take Lawes from those cruell Tyrants,
whom an injurious Star gives us for Parents.
Thou blam'st my grief, thou dar'st to name it base;
so much the more I lov't (unpitifull Father)
as the more it offends thee: by a just
indevour I will make it equall to
the rigours of my fortune. Was there ever
seen any yet, whose rude traverses took
in so short time so many severall faces,
that was so often sweet, so often cruel,
and gave so many various stroaks before
the mortall strok! Was ever seen a soul
more seis'd with joy and greif, with hope, and fear;
subjected (as a slave) to more events,
and made the pitious pastime of more changes!
An Oracle assures me, a Dream frights me,

my Lover's chosen forth to fight my Brother.

The two Camps in a mutiny, disavow'd
such an unjust choice, they brake off the partie;
the Gods renew it; Rome seems vanquished,
and only of three Albans, <hi>Curiatius</hi>
hath not at all in my blood stain'd his hands
God! did I not then feel too little grief
for Rome's misfortune, and two Brothers death?
Flatter'd I not myself too much, when I
thought I might love him yet without a crime,
and nourish some hope? His death scourgeth me
enough for that, and the inhumane manner
wherewith my terrified heart receiv'd
the news thereof: his Rival told it me,
and in my presence making the recital
of so sad a successe, upon his front
he wore an open joy; which griev'd my heart,
and made the publick good lesse then my losse
So building in the air upon anothers
misfortune, he triumphed over him
like to my Brother. But this is not all,
'tis nothing unto that which doth remain;
In such a fatall stroke they ask my joy,
I must applaud the Conqueror's exploits,
and kisse a hand that pierceth my sad heart:
in so great and so just a cause of plaints
it is a shame to weep, a crime to sigh.
Their bruitish vertue would, that (in this case)
I should esteem me happy; so with them,
one must be barbarous to be generous.
But we'll degenerate (my Heart) from such
a vertuous Father; let us unworthy
of such a generous Brother: 'Tis a glory
to passe for abject spirits, when bruitishnesse
is held the highest Vertue. My just Griefs,
break forth: to what end should I keep you in?
When one hath lost all, what's more to be fear'd?
Have no respect for this inhumane Conqueror:
Fiar from avoyding of him, come athwart him,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48680:26"/>
trouble his Victorie, provoke his anger,
and take (if possible) pleasure to displease him.
He comes, prepare we shew constantly

but (Son) thou mightst have spar'd thy self the shame on't:
her crime, though great, and worthy death, were better
unpunished, then punish'd by thy arm.</p>

                     <p>Dispose my fortune as you please; the laws
command it so: I thought I ow'd this stroak
unto the place that gave me my first being.
If my zeal to my Country seemeth criminall
unto you, if thereby I must receive
an everlasting staine, and by this action
my hand become disgraced and prophane,
you can with one sole word cut off my destinie.
Receive your blood again, whose purity
my basenesse hath unto so little purpose
defiled: My hand could not suffer crime
grow in our race; suffer you not a spot
in your own house: 'Tis in those actions
(wherewith honour is wounded) that a father,
such as you are, shewes himself interested.
His love must not appear, where all excuse
is null; himself takes part when he dissembles them:
and he makes small account of his own glory,
when he forbears to punish what he doth not
approve.</p>

                     <p>Suffer then,
O great King, and the justest of all Kings,
that all good men speak to you by my mouth:
not that our hearts, as jealous of his honours,
urge us to this; if he receiveth much,
his high deeds do deserve it; add unto it,
rather then lessen it; we are also ready
to contribute unto it: but since he
hath shew'd himself guilty of such a crime,
let him triumph as Conquerour, and perish
as malefactor: stop his fury, and
save from his hands, if you desire to reigne,
the remnant of the Romans: hereupon
depends the losse or safety of the rest;
seeing the blood shed by this fatall Warr,
and so many fair knots of marriage
wherewith our happy destinies have so often
united such neer nighbours, few of us
have enjoy'd such a happinesse, as not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48680:31"/>
I'have lost a Cosen, or a brother in law,
an uncle, or a son in law in <hi>Alba,</hi>
whereby to have occasion to shed tears
for their own losses in the publick joy:
If it be an offence to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
the fortune of his arms alloweth him
to punish this crime of our tears, what blood
will this fierce Conqu'ror spare, that would not pardon
that of his Sister, nor excuse the grief
which the death of a Lover doth infuse
into a Mistresse heart, when ready to be
lighted by the fair nuptiall Torch, she sees
her hope i'th' grave with him? Making <hi>Rome</hi> thus
to triumph, he enslaves it: by this means
he hath a right of life and death upon us,
and our offending dayes shall last no longer
then it shall please his clemency to suffer them.
I could add, for the interests of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that such a stroak's unworthy of a man:
I could demand, to be brought here before you
that rare exploit of a victorious arme;
you should see then a fair blood (to accuse
his rage) retort into his cruel face:
you should behold horrours which cannot be
conceiv'd; her age and beauty (sure) would move you,
but I hate those means that show artifice.
You have deferr'd the sacrifice till to morrow;
Think you that the just Gods (stil'd the revengers
of Innocents) will receive incense from
a parricide hand? This sacriledg would draw
their punishment upon you. Look upon him
but as an object of their hate, believe
(with us) that the good destinie of <hi>Rome</hi>
in all these three fights did more then his arm,
since these same Gods (the Authors of his Victory)
permitted that he suddenly should fully
the glory of it; and that such a courage,
after so brave an Act, should in one day
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48680:31"/>
be worthy of a Triumph, and of Death.
It rests (Sir) that your Sentence decide this:
<hi>Rome</hi> never saw a parricide till now.
Fear what may follow, and Heaven's anger; save us
from his unnaturall hand, and fear the Gods.</p>

                     <p>To what purpose
shall I defend me? Sir, you know the action,
as being told it now: what you think of it
must be a law to me. One ill defends
himself against th' opinion of a King:
and th' innocentest soul that e'r was born
is guiltie, if he judg him to be so:
It is a crime t' excuse himself unto him.
Our blood's his goods, he can dispose thereof;
and we must think, that when he doth do so,
he deprives not himself without just cause.
Then (Sir) pronounce, I'm ready to obey.
Others love life, and I am bound to hate it.
I reproach not <hi>Valerius</hi> heat, which makes him,
loving the Sister, to accuse the Brother:
my wishes at this time conspire with his:
he asks my death, 'tis that which I desire:
We differ onely in this point, that I
seek to conserve my honour in't, and he
to perish it. Sir, seldome is a subject
offer'd to shew the vertue of a great
and noble heart complete: according to
occasion, it acts or more or lesse,
and appears strong or weak unto the eyes
of those that are her witnesses: The people,
that onely looks upon the outside, judgeth
its force by its effects, and dares to think,
by an ill maxime, that who doth a miracle,
must do it still: After a complete action,
high and illustrious, what glitters lesse
ill answereth their expectation:
they would have us to be all times alike,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48680:32"/>
and in all places: they examine not
if one could better do then, nor that, if
they see not still a wonder, the occasion
is lesse, and Vertue equall: Their injustice
destroyes great names; the honour of the first
attchievements is forgotten by the second:
and when renown is pass'd beyond the mean,
if we'll not fall thence, we must act no more.
I will not boast th' exploits (Sir) of my arm,
your Majestie hath seen my three encounters;
hardly again shall I meet any such,
nor e'r the like occasion will be
to shew my courage, and crown the successe;
so that to leave here an illustrious memory,
death onely now can keep alive my glory,
and I must have it too as soon as I
have conquer'd; for I have outliv'd my honour:
Such one as I beholds his glory perish'd,
when he falls into any ignominie:
and my hand would have freed me on't already,
if my bloud durst come forth without your leave:
as it belongs to you, you must dispose on't;
to shed it otherwise, is to rob you of it.
<hi>Rome</hi> wants not store of generous warriours;
enough besides me will sustaine your Laurels;
henceforward let your Majestie dispense
with me herein. And if what I have done
deserves a recompence, permit, great King,
that with this conquering arm I sacrifice
me to my Glory, not my Sisters cryes.</p>

                     <p>Sir, hear <hi>Sabina,</hi> and see in her soul
the sorrows of a Sister and a Wife,
who (wholly desolate) at your sacred feet
laments her Family, and fears her Husband.
It is not that I would by any artifice
endeavour to take out o'th' hand of Justice
a guilty person; Whatsoever he
hath done for you, use him as such a one;
and punish (Sir) in me this noble Criminall:
with my unfortunate blood wash off his crime.
You shall not change your Victime for all that,
nor shall you herein take an unjust pitie,
but sacrifice the dearest mosty of him.
The knots of marriage, and his extreme love
makes him live more in me, then in himself;
and if you grant that I shall die to day,
he will die more in me then in himself:
the death which I beg, and would fain obtain,
will raise his punishment, and finish mine.
See the excesse (Sir) of my sad afflictions,
and the deplorable condition
whereto I am reduc'd: What honour is it
t'embrace a man whose sword hath cut the thred of
of all my family? and what impiety
to hate a Husband for his service to you,
his Country, and his Friends? What? shall I love
an arm stain'd with the blood of all my Brothers?
Shall I not love an Husband that doth put
a period to our common miseries?
O (Sir) deliver me by an happy death
both from the crimes of loving, and not loving.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48680:33"/>
I shall esteem that Sentence a great favour:
My hand can give me what I crave of you,
but this death shall be much more sweet unto me,
if I can free my Husband from his shame,
and by my bloud appease the anger of
the Gods, in dying satisfie the Ghost
of his offended Sister, and conserve
to <hi>Rome</hi> so good and glorious a Defender.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Old Horat.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, it concerns me then to give an answer
unto <hi>Valerius;</hi> I see my children
conspire with him against me, and all three
would ruine me: they arm themselves unjustly
against that little blood's left in my house.
Thou that by griefs (contrary to thy duty)
would'st leave thy Husband to go to thy Brothers,
go rather to consult their generous Ghosts.
'Tis true, they are dead; but they dy'd for <hi>Alba,</hi>
and hold them happy in't, since Heav'n would have it,
she should be subject: if that any sentiment
remaineth after life lost, this misfortune
seems lesse, and its stroaks not so rigorous,
since all the honour of it falls on us.
All three will disapprove thy grief, thy tears
and sighs, they will condemn the horrour which
thou hast of a brave Husband. Be their Sister
(<hi>Sabia</hi>) and observe thy duty like them.
<hi>Valerius</hi> in vain lifts up himself
'gainst this dear Husband: a first motion
was never held a crime; and praise is due,
in stead of punishment, when Vertue onely
produceth this first motion. To love
our enemies even with idolatry,
madly to curse the Country for their death,
to wish the State an everlasting ruine,
is that which we name crime, and that which he
hath punished; the onely love of <hi>Rome</hi>
provok'd his arm: He should be innocent,
if he had lov'd her lesse. What have I said, Sir?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48680:33"/>
he is so, and this my paternall arm
had punish'd him already, were he guilty;
I would have better used the full power
I have upon him by the lawes of birth.
I love honour too well, and am not of
a quality to suffer in my blood
affront or crime: of this I do desire
no other witnesse but <hi>Valerius:</hi>
he saw what rigorous entertainment I
prepar'd to give my Son, when ignorant
as yet of half the combat, I believ'd
that by his flight he had betray'd the State.
What makes him so officiously to trouble
himself with the cares of my Family?
What makes him to desire (in spight of me)
to vindicate my daughter? By what reason
in her just death takes he an interest
a father doth not meddle with? He fears,
that after this severity to his Sister,
he'll not spare others. Sir, we have no part
but in the shame of ours, and in what manner
another may act, what concerns us not
makes us not blush. <hi>Valerius,</hi> thou maist weep,
and in <hi>Horatius</hi> sight; he takes no interest
but in the crimes of his race; who is not of
his blood, can do no injury unto
th' immortall Lawrels that impale his brow.
Ye Lawrels, sacred boughs, which envie would
reduce to dust, you that conserve his head
from the confounding thunder, will you leave him
unto the infamous Ax, that makes offenders
fall underneath the executioners hands?
<hi>Romans,</hi> will you permit that they should sacrifice
a man, without whom <hi>Rome</hi> had not been <hi>Rome</hi>
at this time, and that any <hi>Roman</hi> should
traduce the glory of a Conquerour,
to whom all owe so fair a character?
Tell us, <hi>Valerius,</hi> tell, since he must perish,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48680:34"/>
where thou wouldst chuse fit a place for his punishment.
Is it within these walls, which many thousands
of voyces make resound yet with the noise
of his exploits? Is it without the walls,
in the midst of those places which smoak yet
with the blood of the conquer'd <hi>Curiatii,</hi>
between their three tombs, in that field of honour,
the witnesse of his valour and our happinesse?
Thou canst not from his Victory conceal
his Punishment: within the walls, without them
all speak his glory; all oppose themselves
to the indeavour of thy unjust love,
which would with such a glorious blood defile
so fair a day. <hi>Alba</hi> cannot endure
so sad a spectacle, and <hi>Rome</hi> with her tears
will put an obstacle to 't. But (Royall Sir)
you will prevent them, and by a just sentence
you can embrace her interest much better:
What he hath done for her, he can yet do;
he can secure her still from adverse fortune:
despair not yet (Sir) of my feeble years.
<hi>Rome</hi> now hath seen me father of four children,
three in her quarrell are already dead,
there is but one left me; keep him for her,
remove not from her walls so strong a prop;
and suffer me t' addresse my self unto him,
to make an end. <hi>Horatius,</hi> do not think
the stupid people should be absolute masters
of a substantiall honour; their vain voice
tumultnous enough makes often noise:
but as a moment raiseth it, a moment
destroyes it; and whatever they contribute
to our renown, i'th'twinkling of an eye
it vanisheth to smoak: It doth belong
to Kings, to great ones, to accomplish'd spirits
to see that Vertue in its least effects
be full; it is from them alone that we
receive true glory; they alone assure
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48680:34"/>
the memory of the true Heroes, live
still in <hi>Horatius,</hi> and still after them.
Thy name shall remain great, illustrious, famous,
though the occasion, lesse high or resplendent,
deceives the unjust expectation
of th'ignorant vulgar. Hate then life no more;
at least live for me, and to serve thy King
and Country longer. Sir, I've said too much;
but th' affair concerns you, and all <hi>Rome</hi>
speaks by my mouth.</p>

                        <hi>Valerius,</hi>
it is enough, your sound discourse by theirs
is not defac'd: I keep yet in my spirit
the pressing'st reasons on't, and all your arguments
are present with me still: this hainous action
(almost before our eyes) doth injure nature,
and even wounds the Gods. A sudden motion
of anger, that produceth such a crime,
cannot excuse him lawfully; the Lawes
that are the least severe condemn the act,
and if we follow them, he's worthy death:
If otherwise we will look on the guilty,
this crime, though great, hainous and inexcusable,
proceeds from the same sword and arm that makes me
now Master of two States: Two Scepters in
my hand, and <hi>Alba</hi> subject unto <hi>Rome,</hi>
speak highly in the favour of his life.
Had it not been for him, I should have yeelded
obedience, whereas now I give forth lawes;
and should be subject, whereas now I am
twice Soveraigne. There are in all the Provinces
many good subjects, that by feeble prayers
only acquit themselves toward their Princes:
all can love them, but all cannot assure
their States by some illustrious actions;
and th'art and power to establish Crowns
are gifts which heav'n gives but to some choice persons:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48680:35"/>
such servants are the wealth and strength of Kings,
and also are to be above the Lawes;
let them be silent then, let <hi>Rome</hi> dissemble
what from her birth she sees in <hi>Romulus;</hi>
She can well suffer in her Liberator,
what she hath suffered in her first Authour.
Live then <hi>Horatius,</hi> live magnanimous souldier,
thy Vertue sets thy glory 'bove thy crime,
Its generous heat produced thy offence;
th'effect of such a fair cause must be suffer'd.
Live to doe service to the State, but love
<hi>Valerius;</hi> let not any hate nor anger
remain between you, and whether he follow'd
or love, or duty, without any sentiment
resolve to see him. Hearken lesse (<hi>Sabina</hi>)
unto the grief that presseth you; remove
from this great heart those marks of imbecilitie:
in drying of your tears, you'l shew your self
true Sister of those Brothers you lament.
But we do owe to morrow to the Gods
a sacrifice, and should have heaven but little
propitious to us, if our Priests before
the action, finde not out the means to purge it.
His father shall take care on't, I believe,
it will not be hard for him to appease
<hi>Camilla's</hi> Ghost. I do deplore her fortune,
and to give to it what her amorous spirit
may happily desire, (since in one day
an equall heat of one and the same zeal
finish'd her Lovers destinie and hers)
it is our will that one day, as a witnesse
of their two deaths, may see in the earth's wombe
their bodies laid, and shut up in one tombe.</p>
