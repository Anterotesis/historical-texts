            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN HEROICK ELEGY Upon the moſt Lamented Death of that Excellent Hero Sir Edmund Wyndham, Knight Marſhal of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>A Wake ye dead, ye glorious Heavenly Hoſt,</l>
            <l>And bid your Welcomes to a new come Ghoſt.</l>
            <l>A Ghoſt of Honour, Rob'd with Chriſtian Grace,</l>
            <l>Who now hath fought his Fight, and gain'd his Race;</l>
            <l>Who hath paſs'd bravely o're this Worlds great Stage,</l>
            <l>Adorn'd with Crowns of Honour and of Age.</l>
            <l>He was a man of moſt accompliſh'd Parts,</l>
            <l>The learned Maſter both of Arms, and Arts.</l>
            <l>Doubly <hi>Palladian</hi> ſo he doth poffeſs</l>
            <l>The Crown of Glory and of Righteouſneſs.</l>
            <l>Nay, what to mortal more be added can?</l>
            <l>He was a moſt unblemiſh'd honeſt man.</l>
            <l>Who amongſt you can boaſt a greater thing,</l>
            <l>Than t'have been nurſing Father to a King.</l>
            <l>And ſuch a King who ſtudies ſtill to bleſs</l>
            <l>Theſe Kingdoms with a laſting Happineſs.</l>
            <l>Nay, in the fierceſt heats of Wars Alarms</l>
            <l>Did carry him in's heart, as well as Arms.</l>
            <l>So that His Majeſties moſt Royal Sence</l>
            <l>Plac'd Marſhals Staff, where he might's Conſcience.</l>
            <l>For his Endeavours always were to bring</l>
            <l>Great Glories to his Gracious God, and King.</l>
            <l>Farewell good <hi>Windham</hi> then, whoſe virtuous Soul</l>
            <l>Did all Rebellious Vermine here controul:</l>
            <l>Who beat long Serpents out of their round Beds,</l>
            <l>And broke the many headed <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Heads.</l>
            <l>He was the Glory both of Sword and Gown,</l>
            <l>And known Supporter of the Royal Crown;</l>
            <l>Which he appear'd to be in th'worſt of Times,</l>
            <l>When all this Land was laden with foul Crimes;</l>
            <l>When all Religion too was baniſh'd hence,</l>
            <l>And Treaſon paſs'd for good Convenience:</l>
            <l>When horrid Rebels kept their King in Awe,</l>
            <l>And Civil Arms were cri'd up Common Law.</l>
            <l>When all theſe Kingdoms were in miſchief hurld,</l>
            <l>He ſtood unmov'd, th' Eighth Wonder of the World:</l>
            <l>Fix'd like that <hi>Empiraeum,</hi> nor did know</l>
            <l>Or care for Tumults of theſe Orbes below.</l>
            <l>Theſe Orbes below, I mean which ſtill go round,</l>
            <l>And ne'er are quiet till they do confound.</l>
            <l>When baſe Rebellion was pure Virtue made,</l>
            <l>And ourſt High-Treaſon was become a Trade;</l>
            <l>He like another <hi>Archimed</hi> did bring</l>
            <l>Engines to work, to Reinthrone his King.</l>
            <l>Thoſe Engines ſure were Angels, that he ſent</l>
            <l>To help his oppreſt Prince in's Baniſhment.</l>
            <l>When all was out of help, nay hopes of man,</l>
            <l>He then advanc'd his Angels Guardian.</l>
            <l>He never fear'd Rogues Pillage, nor ſpar'd Purſe</l>
            <l>That he might clear his Country from that Curſe</l>
            <l>Which when His Majeſty well underſtood,</l>
            <l>He'd have him like himſelf, ſo great, as good.</l>
            <l>Nor could his gracious goodneſs make a ſhift,</l>
            <l>To give this Land a more Baſilick Gift,</l>
            <l>Nay, ſure his Royal Favour could afford</l>
            <l>No greater Honour, than his Marſhal's Sword:</l>
            <l>And who could better manage it than he,</l>
            <l>Whoſe Soul was the rich Sheath of Loyalty.</l>
            <l>Who can but humbly proſtrate, now adore,</l>
            <l>So brisk a Soul, in body 'bove Fourſcore;</l>
            <l>Yet he muſt yield at laſt to cruel Death,</l>
            <l>But for a Pauſe to gain immortal Breath.</l>
            <l>Where he doth now his <hi>Io Paeans</hi> ſing</l>
            <l>For his good King on Earth, to Heaven's great King.</l>
            <l>More Comfort is, that he hath left behind,</l>
            <l>Such Noble Sons, th' high Offſpring of his Mind;</l>
            <l>That you cann't chuſe but hope that we ſhall ſee</l>
            <l>Theſe Kingdoms bleſs'd in their Poſterity.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Hackney</hi> Poets now make haſte, and run</l>
            <l>To court the Glories of the Riſing Sun;</l>
            <l>Whilſt honour'd <hi>Windom</hi>'s Coarſe, more like the Sun</l>
            <l>Shines forth moſt glorious at his going down.</l>
            <l>And ſo he meets in that moſt pompous Dreſs,</l>
            <l>In th' other world, the Son of Righteouſneſs.</l>
