            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>BEing lately informed, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had left a Paper (<hi>with a
Gentleman in theſe Iſlands</hi>) intimating a chalenge to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
here, viz. <hi>Whether the Miniſters God, or the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
God, were the true God;</hi> little notice was taken of this
their <hi>Folly:</hi> in a ſhort time afterwards, a <hi>Juſtice of the
Peace</hi> acquainted me, that a <hi>Quaker</hi> brought him a Letter, and would have
him deliver it unto me, but he refuſed to receive it from him: And ſome few
dayes after this, an <hi>honeſt Neighbour</hi> told me, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had reported
up and down the Countrey, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>That I would as ſoon take a Bear by the
Tooth, as Diſpute with them:</hi> and withal, that thereby the <hi>Leading Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
did confirm and increaſe their party: Hereupon I ſent unto them (<hi>a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
of Libertines</hi>) the Charge in the <hi>Title Page</hi> aſſerted, <hi>[Being
Anſwers to three ſhort Queſtions.]</hi> And in the Paper (<hi>which was ſent
the</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>day of</hi> April 1678.) they were informed, that I would be ready
to prove (<hi>from the Holy Scriptures</hi>) the charge againſt them: upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
motion of any one or more <hi>Quakers</hi> in theſe <hi>Iſlands,</hi> (on any <hi>Lecture-day</hi>
in <hi>Devon ſhier-Tribe Church</hi>) in order to a <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
for the inveſtigation of the Truth of the true God; which <hi>Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r</hi>
the <hi>Quakers</hi> received and accepted. And according to the general Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therein given, they came (<hi>the firſt day of</hi> May <hi>following,</hi> to the place
aſſigned, (<hi>but without giving me any ſpecial notice of it,</hi>) Then <hi>Francis
Eaſtlack,</hi> a <hi>Teacher</hi> amongſt them, moved for a performance of my promiſe,
in reference to the Charge (which he called a <hi>Chalenge</hi>) under my hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: I forthwith told him, that I was ready (<hi>by Chriſts help</hi>) to do
it: howbeit, by the way (as I told them) I thought it fit to ſignifie unto them, <hi>ſc.</hi>
That as they had accepted the <hi>Paper</hi> which I had ſent to them, ſo they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bound themſelves to all the terms and conditions therein expreſſed: as <hi>Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
1. That the Diſputation is to be <hi>Regular;</hi> that is to ſay, I am (in the firſt
place) to prove the whole <hi>Charge,</hi> without any interruption from any one of
you; That then any one or more of you may (without interruptions from me)
anſwer my Arguments, or give your Aſſent. 2. That the Diſputation is to
be <hi>peaceable;</hi> that is to ſay, one perſon only (<hi>at a time</hi>) is to Anſwer; That
the Diſputation may not end (<hi>as uſually ſuch kind of Diſputes have done</hi>)

Hearers: And that at the end of all, <hi>They</hi> may judge (according to
<pb facs="tcp:45964:3"/>
the <hi>Scriptures of Truth</hi>) between you and me: Let me here pray the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
to take notice, that not any thing ſaid by me (touching the <hi>Regular</hi> and

unadviſedly to ſay, that what I had, and ſhould then have declared, I
would cauſe to be <hi>Printed,</hi> that full returnes might be given to the objections
made, and Scriptures <hi>wreſted</hi> by them: ſaying, <hi>If I could not be heard I

               <p>1. I do acknowledge with him, that the [<hi>Word</hi>] took fleſh of the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> and that he ſuffered without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
as it comes from a <hi>Teaching Quaker,</hi> it is undoubtedly no other, then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45964:7"/>
a deceitful ſhifting of the matter in queſtion: yet I am ready to grant,
that <hi>F. E.</hi> and his Partners may believe, that there was ſuch a man, who
(as Hiſtories mention) took fleſh, and was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi>
and ſuffered death without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> about ſixteen hundred
years ago: Alas, how many <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> are there that know and
believe all this; yet they do no more believe <hi>Jeſus of Nazereth,</hi> to be the
true Chriſt, and only Saviour, then a Teaching, Seducing <hi>Quaker</hi> doth:
Nay, ſuch a <hi>Quaker</hi> attributes no more ſoul ſaving <hi>Merit</hi> to the holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Jeſus Chriſt, then to the body of a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew:</hi> Therefore
its not ſafe to put any other conſtruction upon his acknowledgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
then a deceitful ſhifting the buſineſs in hand, that he might thereby
the more eaſily hoodwink the Hearer; for his Diſcourſe had no other
tendency, then to make us believe, that the true Chriſt and Saviour was
only in (not at all of) the body of Chriſts fleſh:</p>
               <p>2. I do again acknowledge with him, <hi>ſc.</hi> That the effects of Chriſts
death and ſufferings, are to be inwardly witneſſed, as received within us:
And if ſo, then there muſt be a cauſe of theſe effects inwardly received,
as previous and anticedent to them, <hi>to wit,</hi> The death and ſufferings of
the one Man Jeſus Chriſt (as in the third <hi>Argument</hi>) which is therefore
neceſſarily finiſhed, and perfected already by the one crucified body of
Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> upon the Croſs (without us) for us; which in right
reaſon muſt needs be, before the effects thereof could be revealed in us,
and ſo inwardly witneſſed; though this were the thing I argued for, yet
it was ſtrongly oppoſed by them all, (as may afterwards appear) making
thoſe effects within them, the true Chriſt, and their only Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to the Texts of Scripture repeated by <hi>F. E.</hi> which
ſhall be conſidered in order as he uttered them.</p>
               <p>John 1. 9. <hi>That was the true Light, which lighteneth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into the World:</hi> This Scripture he more eſpecially inſiſted on, to prove
Chriſt to be that true <hi>Light,</hi> and that <hi>Light</hi> to be the only <hi>Saviour,</hi> which
(as he ſaid) is in every man, that cometh into the world: whence he
Argued, that a <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended Saviour within him, is the true, and
not the falſe Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, that by [<hi>Light</hi>] in that place of Scripture, the true
Chriſt, and our only Saviour, is meant, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 29. and although it be
likewiſe true, (in a true ſence) that every man that cometh into the
world, is enlightened by Chriſt (<hi>i. e.</hi> with reaſon) the Son of God, as
he is the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> that made the World: yet, the <hi>Evangiliſt</hi> hath
not in that Text aſſerted, that there is a Light (or enlightening) in every
Man, as he cometh into the World, which is the true Chriſt, and our only
Saviour; ſo that, thou haſt plainly and openly belied that holy Man <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in ſaying of him as above, <hi>that he ſo witneſſed;</hi> Namely, that the Light,

as (in ver. 30 29.) he evidently affirms the Light (in <hi>ver.</hi> 9.) to be
the Man Jeſus, and as ſuch, he never was (nor can be) in any man: ſo
witneſſeth the <hi>Witneſs bearer,</hi> whom we are to believe, before a <hi>Seducing

               </p>
               <p>2. Thou (<hi>F. E.</hi>) didſt in thy Diſcourſe effectually affirm Chriſt to
be the <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> in every Man to be the Chriſt, implying
thereby, <hi>ſc.</hi> what might be truly ſpoken of the one, might be alſo ſo
ſpoken of the other: here hence then it muſt follow, that the <hi>Light</hi>
within a <hi>Quaker,</hi> was born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> laid in a <hi>Manger,</hi> hanged upon
a <hi>Tree,</hi> and gave up the <hi>Ghoſt;</hi> all theſe were truly and properly ſpoken
of the true Chriſt (<hi>who is the Light of the World:</hi> Now, what can be

every man that comes into the World (which comprehends both <hi>Elect,</hi>

Therefore the true Chriſt is not (as in your ſence) in every man that

how, or to whom was he manifeſted? its impoſſible to imagine,
that the Godhead (which is inviſible and incomprehenſible) can be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to the external ſenſes of men; But the true Chriſt, and our only
Saviour, was thus Manifeſted; as it is witneſſed by Chriſts faithful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

the righteouſneſs of the Law, and the righteouſneſs of Faith together:
and thereby ſhews that the righteouſneſs of the Law is not only uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3 impoſſible; but the righteouſneſs of Faith, is
both certain and poſſible: For 1. It doth forbid all doubting about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, becauſe Chriſt is aſcended up into Heaven for us, in our room
and ſtead. 2. It forbids all fear of being tormented in Hell; becauſe
Chriſt being riſen from the dead, hath overcome eternal death for us, in
our place and ſtead (being our ſurety) which is as much, as if <hi>Paul</hi> had
ſaid, The righteouſneſs of Faith, fetcheth a remedy againſt doubts of
Salvation, for that Chriſt is perſonally aſcended up into Heaven, and hath
taken poſſeſſion of it, in our Names, and there he maketh interceſſion
for us; (<hi>Heb. 6. 20. Chap.</hi> 7. 25.) and if ſo, (as truly ſo it is) we muſt
then deny Chriſts Aſcention (which is to bring him down from above) if
we doubt or queſtion in our hearts, how to be ſaved:</p>
               <p>And as the righteouſneſs of Faith, is a remedy againſt Doubts of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
ſo, is it alſo againſt fears of Condemnation: For, if Chriſt have
dyed, and be raiſed from [<hi>the deep</hi>] the Grave, then hath he thereby
gotten the Victory over S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into the <hi>Deep;</hi> and ſo, to bring him back again to the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> in theſe verſes, gives us a plain Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of what <hi>Moſes</hi> had elegantly propounded by a figure, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.
11, 12, 13, 14. from whence we are taught, that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
preſuppoſed a twofold preſſure upon the Spirits of ſinners, as 1. How
they may enter into Heaven: And 2. How they may avoid Hell, theſe
two <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (inſpired of God) do ſhew, to be taken away by
the righteouſneſs of Faith; the firſt is removed, becauſe we believe the
<hi>Aſcertion</hi> of Chriſt is to Heaven for us: and the ſecond alſo, becauſe we
believe Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the dead for us; whereby the Lord Chriſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45964:10"/>
demonſtrated his victory over hell, death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in our room and names.
It may hence be ſafely argued, that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> do conclude,
that if any man ſeeks juſtification by the righteouſneſs of the Law, (as
moſt <hi>Quakers</hi> do) he muſt needs be in continual fear of Hell, and deſpair
of Heaven: But he that (through <hi>Free grace</hi>) believeth that the Lord
Chriſt is riſen from the dead, aſcended up into heaven for him, in his place
and ſtead, is freed from both.</p>
               <p>The ſum of all, is this: Namely, That Jeſus Chriſt roſe from the dead,
for us, and aſcended up into heaven for us: and before either (which
muſt be implied) lived and died for us: But, he that believes not the
<hi>Deſcention,</hi> and the <hi>Aſcention</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for him, but ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Juſtification</hi> by the works of the Law; he doth (in effect) deny the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcention</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; which to do, were (as much
as in him lies) to bring Chriſt down from above, and likewiſe to bring
him up again from the deep. Now tell me <hi>Frances,</hi> whither theſe verſes

acceptance, juſtification and ſalvation with God, which is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
alone of the Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which he wrought out in his

and which agrees with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Explication, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. That is (ſaith he)
the Word of Faith which we Preach; now the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preached no

ver. 4. <hi>Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit of

was delivered,</hi> (i. e. to death) <hi>for our offences, and was raiſed up again for

I Preached unto you:</hi> What was that Goſpel, the Apoſtle tells us? <hi>ver. 3.
how that Chriſt died for our ſins, according to the Scriptures.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>And
that he was buried, and that he roſe again the third day according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
the laſt mentioned Scriptures do illuſtrate the righteouſneſs of
Faith, and word of Faith preached (in the aboveſaid verſes 6. 8.) and
therefore cannot poſſibly be underſtood for a <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended Saviour
within him (as this <hi>Diſputant F. E.</hi> would make us believe.)</p>

to be night, even in the mouth, and in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Its reſolved by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in ver. 9, 10. <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs
with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath
raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> That is to ſay; the Word of
Faith preached, is nigh in our mouths: when we confeſs before men, <hi>ſc.</hi>
That we believe that that righteouſneſs, whereby we are accepted of
God, juſtified and ſaved, is the only righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt of
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> which he wrought out in his perſonal Obedience, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
upon the Croſs (without us) for us: And it is nigh in our hearts,
when this confeſſion proceeds from a right perſwaſion ingrafted an plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our hearts by the ſpirit of Faith, as its teſtified by <hi>Paul,</hi> ver. 10.
<hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, (i. e.</hi> unto
the righteouſneſs of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth</hi>) ver 6. <hi>And with

Thus according to the command of Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,

who doth in his heart believe, and with his mouth confeſs that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

the righteouſneſs alone of Ieſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which he wrought

ſixteen hundred years ago: or, that doth believe and confeſs, that God,
(of his <hi>free Grace and Mercy</hi>) giveth Faith in this righteouſneſs of Jeſus

of your new coined Religion, and wounds it to death: which may be
thus argued; If the light which is (by natural Generation) in Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
coming into the World, be not the true Chriſt, then the light that
is in every man which comes into the World (by natural Generation)
is not the true Chriſt:</p>
               <p>But the light which is by natural Generation in Reprobates, is not the

into the world, (is not according to your ſelves) the true Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. I Anſwered, That this Text of Scripture underſtand, not the perſon
of Chriſt (as ſuch, he is the true Chriſt, and our only Saviour) but the
work of the Spirit of Faith, whereof perſonal Chriſt is the Author: for
here the Apoſtle frames an Argument, to prove the mighty work (or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
of the Spirit in his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as he had before affirmed to be in
them, <hi>ver. 3. Since ye ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, which to you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is not weak</hi> (i. e. in operation) <hi>but is</hi> [Mighty] <hi>in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in what ſenſe Chriſt was in <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking, in that ſame ſenſe was

               <p>To explain theſe Words (Chriſt in you) a little more; we muſt take

pleaſed him ſo well, as to make a deliberate repetition of it: yea, he
did not pretend Scripture for its confirmation; and therefore I could not
aſſuredly know, whether he ſaid it, as an <hi>Arminian,</hi> or as a <hi>Quaker:</hi> But
I am apt to think, that he ſpake it in imitation of his <hi>Friends,</hi> becauſe of

thoſe works we do by the aid of the ſpirit within us, which is the ſame
with that of the carnal Propheteſs above, only it is expreſſed in plainer
words, ſo that in truth, her Queſtion is but a ſly deſign, to renew again
the old <hi>Papiſh</hi> trick, to elude the genuine force of ſuch Texts, as above

without:</p>
               <p>By the way, in reference to her laſt queſtion, let two things be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>1. That <hi>Carnal Goſpellers</hi> do but deceive their own ſouls, by reſting in

               <p>2. As <hi>Carnal Goſpellers</hi> do thus deceive themſelves; ſo do <hi>Anti-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellars</hi>

of the ſpirit within them, maketh the true Chriſt, and their only
Saviour from ſins: Alas, poor deluded ones, this is to teſtifie, that
the effects of Chriſts death, ſufferings, redemption, and righteouſneſs do
conſtitute the true Chriſt, and Mans only Saviour: which effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
(ſay ye) being followed in all righteouſneſs, will bring you to
Salvation: now, what is all this? but in plain Engliſh, to be brought to
ſalvation, by the obedience of works: Oh, let every good Chriſtian
tremble to think of the dreadful conſequence of this your God provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>But, to ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> is come in the <hi>fleſh;</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>ſc. Paul</hi> is to be
conſidered as diſtinct from his body of Fleſh: And ſo to be in the <hi>fleſh</hi> of

contrary to the Scripture, above, but ſo abſurd and irrational, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
none but ſeduced, ſeducing <hi>Quakers:</hi> from whence I may ſafely
infer: That whoſoever doth not confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is come true
man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, doth deny that Jeſus Chriſt is come in
the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> But Teaching, Seducing <hi>Quakers,</hi> do not confeſs that

they do deny that Jefus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh: And by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
from the whole, they cannot deny (unleſs they will deny truth

being the words of that Scripture, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. may not be gain-ſaid:
the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> I do prove thus; <hi>The Ieſus intended by the Apoſtle, is Ieſus
born of Mary,</hi> (who is called Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 16.) the <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth
a man approved of God among the Iews,</hi> Act. 2. 23. But a Teaching <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
doth deny Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (born of <hi>Mary</hi>) a man approved of
God among the <hi>Iews,</hi> to be the Chriſt, and therefore the Concluſion is
undeniable: <hi>ſc.</hi> That a Teaching. <hi>Quaker</hi> doth deny that Jeſus is the
Chriſt: And as this is undeniable, ſo is the other; namely, That a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Quaker</hi> is a Lyar and an Antichriſt: which is further evidenced,
1 <hi>Ioh 4. 3. And every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Ieſus Chriſt is come in

               <p>1. They are apt to ſay (becauſe they have often ſaid it) that [<hi>Thou,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>2. Nor are theſe words (<hi>ſc. thee</hi> and <hi>you</hi>) alwayes in Scripture of

<hi>People</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> are of the ſame import: To theſe Scriptures (would it

               <p>3. They ſay for themſelves; That holy men (in the Scriptures) did
uſe the words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) not only one to another, but to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is granted; howbeit I pray, can any of you <hi>Quakers</hi>
produce me one holy Man (in Scripture expreſſed) which uſed theſe
words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) that he might thereby take occaſion to deny (as
ye wickedly do) all reverential reſpects to any ſort of men of what rank
or quality ſoever: ſure I am, ye cannot produce me one ſuch man; for
this bruitiſh kind of practice, is contrary to the manifold <hi>Precepts</hi> and
<hi>Preſidents</hi> alſo, in the Scriptures of truth, as afterwards ſhall plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
Indeed we Chriſtians do acknowledge, that holy men (in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
did uſe the words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) not only one to another, but
to God himſelf, for two eminent Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. That they might thereby be kept to the unity of the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45964:24"/>
although Jehovah is Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, yet he is not three
Gods, but one; therefore holy men holding their minds to the unity of
the eſſence; <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> were (and are) moſt proper and neceſſary
to preſerve their minds from a plurality of Gods: But this ground can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be pleaded by a <hi>Quaker,</hi> who denieth a Trinity in Unity, and ſo, he
denies the only true God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Holy men uſed theſe words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) to God, and one
to another, as occaſionally they were by <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> drawn out to either
of theſe words (<hi>ſc. thou</hi> or <hi>thee</hi>) for <hi>all Scripture is given by inſpiration of
God,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tim. 3. 16. and in 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. Holy men of God ſpake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo then, its plain that Holy men (in Scripture)
ſpake theſe words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) to God, and one to another; but it
was then, when they were moved thereunto by the Holy Ghoſt: but I
pray, do ye <hi>Quakers</hi> never uſe thoſe words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) but then
when ye are occaſionally drawn out, or moved by the Holy Ghoſt to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
if any of you, ſhould be ſo notoriouſlyvile, as to father the uſe of
thoſe words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) upon the Spirit; would not the Holy Ghoſt
tell thee, that thou art of thy Father <hi>the Devil, who is a lyar from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Although holy men frequently uſed thoſe words, as above; yet
they never thereby took occaſion to deny, but ever uſed reverential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to all ſorts of perſons, according to their rank and quality: as for
inſtance, <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 1, 2, 3. <hi>as he ſat in the Tent-door, he lift up his
eyes and looked, and lo, three men</hi> (Angels unawares) <hi>ſtood by him, and when
he ſaw them, he ran to meet them from the Tent-door, and bowed himſelf to the
ground, and ſaid my Lord:</hi> And David, 1 <hi>Sam. 20. 41. roſe out of his
place, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himſelf three times to Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than:</hi>
Again, in the 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 23, 25. Abigail ſaw David, and fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, on her face, and bowed her ſelf to the ground, and called him Lord:</hi>
Likewiſe Ruth, Chap. 2. 10. <hi>She fell on her face, and bowed her ſelf to the
ground to Boaz:</hi> And in ver. 4. <hi>Boaz courteouſly ſaid to the Reapers, the
Lord be with you; and they</hi> (in reverential reſpects) <hi>to him,</hi> Anſwered, <hi>the
Lord bleſs thee.</hi> Furthermore we read of reverential reſpects, between
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Idolatrous Neighbours, <hi>Gen. 23. 7. Abraham ſtood up,
and bowed himſelf to the People of the Lana, even to the children of Heth,</hi> and
ver. 8. <hi>he communed with them</hi> ſaying, <hi>if it be your mind:</hi> And ver. 5. <hi>the
children of Heth anſwered Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>hear us my Lord: thou art a
Prince of God amongſt us.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo, 1 King. 2. 10. aroſe from
his Throne, and bowed himſelf to his Mother; and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 28. 12.
bowed himſelf to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> with his face towards the ground:
And in the 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 6. Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and called him Lord:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45964:25"/>
unto theſe <hi>Preſidents,</hi> many more might be alledged: Thus we ſee,
though theſe holy perſons often uſed (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) yet, they ever uſed
reverential reſpects to all ſorts of men; and that according to Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
command, as <hi>Lev 9. 32. Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head, and
honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God, I am the Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
by Gods own inſpiration: but this ye <hi>Quakers</hi> do not: therefore the
Light of this Scripture reproves you, as no Fearers of God: And <hi>Exod.</hi>
20. 12. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> which is alſo recited by the
Apoſtle, <hi>Eph. 6. 2. Honour thy Father and thy Mother, which is the firſt
Commandment with promiſe;</hi> Note this Commandment comprehends not
only Natural Parents, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. the Fathers of our fleſh, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of our Country, as civil Magiſtrates and Rulers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 23. yea,
likewiſe Spiritual Fathers, as Goſpel Miniſters are phraſed by <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. we read, that in our Saviours time, there were ſome proud
Profeſſors, who inclined much towards this Principle and practice of a
<hi>Quaker,</hi> (but not in ſo bad a ſenſe) <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 10. ye (ſaith Chriſt) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him no more to do ought for his Father and Mother, making the
Word of God (the commandment above) of none effect; and indeed
as much more do the <hi>Quakers) Paul</hi> alſo, by the ſame inſpiration of
God, <hi>Rom. 13. 7. Render therefore to all</hi> (meaning higher Powers and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<hi>ver. 1, 2.) their dues, honour to whom honour:</hi> and the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 17. <hi>Honour all men,</hi> eſpecially in places of honour) <hi>fear God, honour
the King, as Supream and Governour, ſent by him.</hi> Moreover, 1 <hi>Tim. 5 3.
Honour Widows, that are Widows indeed;</hi> and in ver. 17. <hi>Let the Elders
that Rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour
in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> Theſe Precepts are given by the inſpiration of
God, and conſequently are obligatory on Conſcience, to be performed in
that uſeful, commendable, and neceſſary duty of reverential reſpects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared: and which hath been (in conſcience of Gods ſtrict, and
indiſpenſible command (obeyed by the holy <hi>Preſidents</hi> above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the light of Scripture hath manifeſted this your ſecond
evil alſo; even ſo likewiſe the Light of Scripture doth reprove it.</p>
               <p>1. It reproves you, as ſuch who want the fear of God, as above, <hi>Lev.</hi>
19. 32. and as ſuch, who harden their hearts againſt, not only the many
<hi>Precepts</hi> above, to bind the Conſcience, but the many <hi>Preſidents</hi> to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the practice; Now, as both are manifeſt reprovers of you, ſo I
wiſh they might make you not only aſhamed of your ſneaking, ſurley,
dumb, and ſcurvy carriage towards Chriſtians: but alſo convince you,
that this kind of Behaviour, is not in the written Scripture without,
but from the pretended unwritten Scripture (that <hi>Idol-light</hi>) within:
proudly contemning the ſacred Oracles of God, above aſſerted. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45964:25"/>
which is thus further argued: what can the Saints (in all places and
Countries) be more ſenſible of, then that the generality of <hi>Quakers,</hi>
do purpoſely uſe thoſe words (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) to deny all reverential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to any ſort of men, of what rank and quality ſoever: that by
that means, they may intrude themſelves to be equal with any of what
rank or ſort ſoever: nay, thereby to advance themſelves, above all men,
under the notion of a ſeeming perfection, which is a manifeſt product of
their (God and Man) provoking pride: according to that of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
<hi>Pſal. 123. 4. Our ſoul is exceedingly filled with the ſcorning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the proud:</hi> and how is the Propheſie fulfilled in you, <hi>Iſai. 3. 5.
The child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the antient, and the baſe againſt
the Honourable:</hi> and obſerve ye well the words of the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi>
7. 22. <hi>Deceit, Blaſphemy, Pride, Fooliſhneſs:</hi> of theſe four links, hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
made your Chain of darkneſs; which is moſt evident, from a due
conſideration of the foregoing truths: Oh, how ſuitable is the Prophets
Viſion to a <hi>Quakers</hi> condition, <hi>Obad. 1. ver. 1, 2. Behold, I have made
thee ſmall, thou art greatly deſpiſed, the pride of thy heart hath deceived
thee,</hi> &amp;c. From the whole be ye adviſed.</p>
               <p>1. To ceaſe from making your Idolized <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> (the ſpring
of your ſcurvy and ſurly deportment) with their mask, <hi>to wit,</hi> that holy
men (in Scriptur recorded) did oft uſe (<hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>) one to another,
and to God himſelf: Now, what is your deſign herein? can it be ought
elſe, then to put a cheat on the judgements of ſome ignorant creatures:
as thus, Oh ſurely (ſay they) the <hi>Quakers</hi> do make Conſcience of the
Scripture for their warrant and authority; thus poor ignorant ones are
deluded by your equivocations: though its moſt certain, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no here commands a <hi>Quaker</hi> to (<hi>thou</hi> or <hi>thee</hi>) any man, much leſs

to give the honour which is due to them, as Fathers of the Country,

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45964:26"/>
himſelf, <hi>John 5. 44. How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another,</hi>
The other part of the verſe (giving light to theſe words) is uſually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them, <hi>ſc. and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is that Honour which cometh from God only?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>23d.</hi> verſe tells us, <hi>All men ſhould honour the Son, even as
they honour the Father; he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which hath ſent him,</hi> (meaning, to fulfill all righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15.)
Its then clear, that the Son of God, is the honour intended above; if any
ask, who is this Son of God? the good Angel tells us, <hi>Luk. 1. 35. That
holy thing, which ſhall be born of thee,</hi> (Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ver. 34.) <hi>ſhall be called the
Son of God:</hi> ſo then the Man Jeſus Chriſt, is the honour that cometh
from God only; which honour the <hi>Jews</hi> (like the <hi>Quakers</hi>) received
not, as this Son of God told them, <hi>ver. 43. I am come in my Fathers Name,
and ye receive me not</hi> (ſc. by Faith,) hence Chriſt infers, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. above,
<hi>How can ye believe, which receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which cometh from God only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Honour which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> received one of another, was the
Doctrine of Juſtification, and Eternal Life, by the works and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Law, fulfilled in and by the Son of God alone: which righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of the Son, is the juſtifying and ſaving honour that cometh
from God only, to right Believers: will it hence follow, becauſe the proud
<hi>Phariſees</hi> took divine honour to themſelves, and thereby received honour
one of another; therefore civil honour ought not to be given one to
another: let me tell you, ye <hi>Quakers</hi> could not have brought a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more full againſt your ſelves: for, under Heaven, there are not a
People to be found, that receive more honour one of another, then the
men of your <hi>Sect</hi> do: For ye affirm, and boldly teach, That he who
made Heaven and Eearth, Angels, Principalities and Powers, that hath a
Name above every Name that is named: King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords, the Prince and only Saviour, that gives repentance, and remiſſion
of fins, is in each of your vile bodies. Its not to be wondred at, that ye
are ſo poſſeſſed with the infernal Spirit of ſuperlative pride againſt Jeſus
of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the man approved of God, and all true Believers on, and
lovers of him. So much for ſome further ſatisfaction to <hi>William Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45964:26"/>
is brought: For, 1. Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, in this <hi>7th.</hi> verſe, is
that Word of Life, which the Apoſtles, <hi>ve.</hi> 1, 2. had heard and ſeen with
their eyes, and looked upon, and with their hands had handled; who
could be no other than the Man <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which to prove, they bring
in the operations of three of their five ſenſes: Now, this Man Jeſus
Chriſt the Son of God, as ſuch, he cannot be in a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By the Blood of this Son of God, is meant the grievous ſufferings,
pains, and tortures, which he endured on the Croſs to the death; and
therefore called the <hi>blood of the Croſs,</hi> Col. 1. 20. as the Man Jeſus Chriſt,
cannot be in a <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſo conſequently, his bloody ſufferings cannot be
in a <hi>Quaker.</hi>

Beſides, this Title, (<hi>ſc. Th. Son of Man</hi>) is frequently attributed to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> as in Mat. 8. 20. <hi>The Foxes have holes,
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head:</hi> alſo in Mat. 10. 23. &amp;
11. 19. &amp; 12. 8. &amp;c. The Lords Chriſt is called the Son of Man, which is
to ſhew the truth of his humane mankind Nature, it being lineally
deſcended from <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, and therefore Chriſt is
ſtiled the Son of <hi>David, (Luk.</hi> 20. 41.) Moreover, he hath the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(of the Son of Man) in reference to his participation with our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, in all things which concern created-nature, as its ſtated by
the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. and in Chap. 4 15.) <hi>In all things it behoved him</hi>
(Chriſt) <hi>to be made like unto his Brethren:</hi> and he was tempted in all
points like as we are, yet without ſin: ſurely, he that is in all things like
man, except ſin, is rightly called the Son of Man: for, ſin is not at all the
Form, but all the Deformity of Man: The iſſue is, that the <hi>Fox</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his craft, putting no difference between the terms, <hi>ſc. Humune</hi> and
<hi>Humane:</hi> he knew full well, that the Fox's craft would be ſoon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhould he admit the Lords Chriſt to have a humane Nature, or a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as is common to Man kind: and therefore (in Pag. 71. above) he
quarrels the word [<hi>Humane</hi>] and querieth, where doth the Scripture
ſpeak of <hi>Humane?</hi> where is it written, (quoth he) that we may ſearch
for it? <hi>Rep.</hi> Though we have not the Word, yet having the Thing, it
might ſatisfie all, with whom the light of Reaſon hath any credit.</p>
               <p>Once more; Chriſt the <hi>Second Man,</hi> is ſaid to be Lord from Heaven,
becauſe, he is to reſtore the heavenly life, which was loſt by the firſt man
<hi>Adam:</hi> who was alſo ſaid to be Earthly, by reaſon of Tranſgreſſion: and
Chriſt is alſo ſaid to be from Heaven, by reaſon of Reſtoration. By he

in once, into the holy place, into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of
God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. 24. the whole is, That the body of Chriſts fleſh and

conſecrated for right Believers to draw near to God, for juſtification
through Faith in the one only <hi>vail</hi> of Chriſts fleſh glorified in Heaven

               <p>
                  <hi>That the main end of the Quakars Meetings in theſe Iſlands, is, to make

               </p>

(through the mercy of God) never ſhall be (as one of you) in any

aim at in your Meetings, for ye are <hi>G. Foxes</hi> Diſciples, and ye have
learned his <hi>Doctrine:</hi> and as I was about to read ſome of it, they grew
impatient, and by no means would have it read; thereupon I did forbear,
but I have here inſerted it: <hi>to wit, G. Fox,</hi> in his Book intituled the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi>
Page 49, 50. hath theſe words, <q>Ye ſcorn me, the light in you,
they have diſobeyed it, and called it a natural light: and ye have ſaid,
that I the light am not able to ſave thoſe that believe in me:</q> 
                  <hi>Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi>
Page 54. <q>That if ye would believe, and wait on me the light: I
will purge out all your iniquity, and forgive all your Treſpaſſes, and I
ſhall change your natures, if you hearken to me, and obey the light
within:</q> Theſe are the words I would have read, but being hindred,
I told them what they taught in their Meetings: <hi>to wit,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the pretended Light in them, is their true Chriſt, Teacher, Rule,
and Guid: to be heard, believed in, walked up unto, and obeyed, as the
only Saviour; to give remiſſion of ſins, and Salvation with God: to
which <hi>F. E.</hi> forth with replied, That he would for this, lay down his life:
and to confirm him therein, <hi>W. Harriot</hi> then ſaid, we deny the out ſide
Chriſt, to be our Saviour: Then I requeſted the Hearers to take good
notice: <hi>ſc.</hi> they have plainly granted, that the end of their Meeting to
be, for to Teach a denial of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Man approved of God,
(<hi>Act.</hi> 2, 22) to be the true Chriſt, and our only Saviour: which Teaching,
is to make the Lord Chriſt, his Holy Spirit, his Angels, and Apoſtles all
Lyars, and Falſe-witneſſes of God: which I proved in their particular
order, from the Scriptures of God. As,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45964:30"/>
1. <hi>That this their Teaching, doth (as much as in them lies) make the
Lords-Chriſt a lyar: for we read</hi> Joh. 9. 35. 36, 37. Doſt thou (<hi>ſaith Chriſt
to the Man that was born blind</hi>) Believe on the Son of God; he anſwered
and ſaid, who is the Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jeſus ſaid unto
him, thou haſt both ſeen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>If our Lord ſpoke truth here; then he, whom this man both
ſaw and talked with (with his bodily eyes and tongue) was the</hi> Meſſias,
<hi>the</hi> Chriſt <hi>and</hi> Saviour, <hi>the</hi> Son of God: <hi>and in</hi> Ioh. 4. 25, 26. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſaid unto him, I know that Meſſias (<hi>our Saviour</hi>) cometh, which is
called Chriſt: when he is come, he will tell us all things: Jeſus ſaith unto her,
I that ſpeak unto thee am he.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as of purpoſe to rebuke this lying
Spirit (of a <hi>Quakers</hi> Myſtical<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heard, by the bodily eyes and ears of the Woman, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed,
was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the true Chriſt, and Teacher of all things: And
in <hi>Mark 14. 61, 62. Again the High Prieſt asked him, and ſaid unto him,

                  </gap>ed of himſelf, that he on whom the High-Prieſt
looked, and to whom he ſpake) was the Chriſt, the Son of the
bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Mat. 16. 13 to</hi> 18. the Lord Jeſus propoſeth two queſtions
to his <hi>Diſciples. Firſt,</hi> What Opinion others had of him, <hi>ver. 13. Whom
do men ſay, that I the Son of Man am?</hi> and they ſaid, <hi>ver. 14. Some ſay
thou art Iohn the Baptiſt, ſome Elias, and others Ieremias, or one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi>
when Chriſt heard of thoſe various apprehenſions which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
concerning him: he preſently asked his Diſciples a ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<hi>ver. 15. But whom ſay ye, that I</hi> (the Son of Man. ver. 13.) <hi>am?
Peter</hi> (in the Name, and as the mouth of the reſt) gives Anſwer, <hi>ver. 16.
Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> Chriſt was ſo highly ſatisfied
with this Anſwer, that firſt, he pronounceth him bleſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
declares, that this confeſſion, is the rock upon which the Church
is built: and withal Chriſt aſſures his Diſciples, that againſt this <hi>Rock (the
joyn confeſſion,</hi> ſc. <hi>That Ieſus the Son of man, is the Chriſt the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, the Gates of hell ſhall never prevail:</hi> O ye <hi>Teaching Quakers,</hi> is
not this enough to open the eyes of your blind <hi>Idol</hi> within. Again, how
hath our Lord himſelf, ſaid of himſelf (even ſince his being aſcended and
glorified) <hi>Act. 22. 8. I am Ieſus of Nazareth,</hi> whereby is plainly affirmed,
the now preſent glorified exiſtence of the Man Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
and hereunto agrees that which he foretold of himſelf, <hi>Mat. 24. 30. And
they ſhall ſee the Son of Man, coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with power
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45964:31"/>
and great glory:</hi> the whole is this, if Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (whom they
wickedly call the out ſide Chriſt) be not the true Chriſt and our only
Saviour; then he is (according to a <hi>Quakers</hi> inſide Chriſt) a Lyar in
all the words uttered by him above: but let God be true, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Liars; ſuch Liars are <hi>Teaching Seducing Quakers;</hi> yea, accurſed
Liars, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. as above.</p>
               <p>2. That this Teaching in their Meetings, doth (as much as in them
lies) make the holy Spirit of Chriſt a Lyar: for we read in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 10, 11. the Prophets, ſearching what, or what manner of time the
Spirit of Chriſt, which was in them did ſignifie, when it teſtified before
hand the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glory (Salvation Grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.)
that ſhould follow: and in <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31, 32. the Holy Ghoſt doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that God raiſed up the ſame Jeſus, whom the <hi>Iews</hi> ſlew, and exalted
him to be a Prince and a Saviour: Likewiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 26, 27, 28, 30. That
the Holy Ghoſt revealed to juſt and devour <hi>Simeon,</hi> that the Child Jeſus,
which he took up in his arms, and ſaw with his bodily eyes, was the Lords
Chriſt, and Salvation, prepared before the face of all people. And <hi>Paul</hi>
alſo (by the inſpiration of the Spirit) aſſures us, <hi>Rom. 5 15 That the
Grace of God, and gift by Grace, which is by one man Ieſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
to many:</hi> this one Man, is no other then Ieſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the
man approved of God (not in, but) among the <hi>Iews, who with their
wicked hands, did take, and him they crucified and ſlew,</hi> Act. 2. 22, 23. The
ſum is this, If the Man Ieſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom the <hi>Iews</hi> ſlew,
and hanged on a tree, and God raiſed from the dead the third day, and
exalted to be the only Saviour (be a ſpiritual inſide Chriſt, a Heavenly
Man of Myſtical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inviſible fleſh and blood) then the holy ſpirit of Truth
muſt be a Lyar; which to affirm (as <hi>Quakers</hi> in effect do) is horrid
Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They do in their Meetings and aimes make the Angels of Chriſt
Liars, as it appears by the</hi> Evangeliſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 20, 21. Behold the Angel of

who did eat and drink with him, after he roſe from the Dead: and we</hi> (the
Apoſtlss) <hi>are witneſſes of theſe things, and he commanded us to Preach unto
the people, and to Teſtifie that it is he, which is ordained of God, to be judge
of quick and Dead.</hi> When I had thus proved the ſecond part of the charge

               <p>But they betook themſelves to their former practice, of repeating ſome

               <p>1. If when <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chriſt was to be formed in
them, then the light that is in every man (a <hi>Quakers</hi> rotten Principle) by
natural Generation, is not the true Chriſt: but according to this Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant)
when <hi>Paul</hi> was travelling in birth for the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chriſt was not
formed in them, Therefore, the Light that is in every man that comes
into the World, is not the true Chriſt. Though this poor deluded, <hi>ſoft</hi>

               <p>2. That Chriſt formed in a Saint, is Chriſt framed and wrought in him
by the ſpirit of Faith, as the ſame Apoſtle explains it to the <hi>Galatians,
Chap. 5. ver. 5. For we through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteouſneſs

was formed, namely, by a through work of Faith in their hearts; that

Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth</hi> alone; without Circumciſion, or any other
work of the Law wrought, in or by themſelves, as cauſal of juſtification

               <p>Why ſhouldeſt thou not be whipt by the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> for this
thy notorious and open Blaſphemy? [<hi>viz.</hi> For <hi>Nick-naming</hi> the Lords
Chriſt, and our only Saviour, an out ſide Chriſt, (an unſcriptural
phraſe) and no Saviour.] the reaſon of this <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, Becauſe, we
read that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>whipt</hi> ſundry perſons (honeſtey
then thy ſelf, and for a leſſer offence) as in <hi>Joh. 2. 13, to 17. And Jeſus
went up to Jeruſalem, and found in the Temple thoſe that ſold Oxen, and Sheep,
and Doves, and the Changers of Money ſitting: And when they had made a
ſcourge of ſmall Cords, he drove them all out of the Temple, and ſaid unto
them, make not my Fathers houſe a houſe of Merchandize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do thou now conſider, if our Lord Jeſus Chriſt made (at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>)
a whip of ſmall Cords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with it did whip the people, for abuſing the
Temple, which was but a Type or Figure of the humane or mankind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Jeſus Chriſt; which is teſtified in <hi>ver. 19, 21. Deſtroy this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in three Dayes I will raiſe it up:</hi> But he ſpake of the Temple of
his Body; in which all his Fathers true Worſhip was to terminate, as it
appeareth (by comparing ſome Scriptures,) the 1 <hi>Kings 8. 30, 44, 48.
And hearken thou to the ſupplication of thy Servant, and of thy People Iſrael,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45964:33"/>
when they ſhall pray towards this Temple, (i. e.</hi> towards the Temple in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi>
for the words were uttered by <hi>Solomon</hi> at the Dedication of the
Temple: and in the faith hereof, <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed, <hi>Chap. 6. 10. His</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<hi>being open in his Chamber towards Jeruſalem:</hi> and thus it was (in
thoſe dayes) with every true Believer, in all forreign parts of the world,
they did worſhip the Father (in his Son) with their faces towards the
Temple in <hi>Iervſalem:</hi> yea, <hi>Ionah</hi> in the belly of the Fiſh, <hi>Chap. 2. 4. Yet
I will look again towards thy holy Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if in the judgement of Jeſus Chriſt, the people deſerved to be
Whipt for abuſing, but the ſhadow of Chriſts Man-hood; how much

meek Lambs of God:</hi> but I can aſſure you, that the perſons which Jeſus
Chriſt whipt out of the Temple, were far more praceable then your

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Wilkinſon:</hi> he repeats ſome of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Col. 1. 27.
Chriſt in you, the hope of Glory:</hi> which Text they wreſt, by forcing this
ſenſe upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt in us, is our preſent glory, and glorious
Saviour: I Anſwered,</p>
               <p>1. This enforced ſenſe, doth deſtroy the true nature of the Word
[<hi>Hope</hi>] for, it only quickens a Believer to the lively expectation of the
promiſed glory, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of eternal Life</hi> (or glory) <hi>which God hath
promiſed:</hi> Likewiſe, Gal. 5. ver. 5. <hi>For we through the Spirit wait, for the
hope of righteouſneſs by Faith:</hi> well then, the office of hope, is, to look at
ſome good to come, as <hi>Rom. 8. 25. If we hope for that we ſee not, then do we
with patience wait for it:</hi> which ſhews us, that this Grace of <hi>Hope,</hi> is not
exerciſed about things preſent (as Quakers falſely gloſs) but only about
ſomething future, for it is a waiting Grace.</p>
               <p>2. As the forced ſenſe above, doth deſtroy the nature of the Word
[<hi>Hope</hi>] ſo it doth the genuine nature of the phraſe [<hi>Glory</hi>] which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
Eternal Life, (<hi>Tit. 1. 2. above</hi>) which is in reverſion, or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 1. I who am a witneſs of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Chriſt, and alſo a partaker</hi> (ſc. by Faith) <hi>of the Glory that ſhall be
revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the entire Clauſe in the Scripture above alledged, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27.
be duely conſidered, it will plainly ſhew us, that the ſenſe afore impoſed
by them, is antiſcriptural; for the whole clauſe in the Verſe runs thus,
[<hi>which is, Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi>] which is (they uſually leave
out) refers to the former part of the verſe; namely, The riches of the
Glory of the Gentiles: which Riches, Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory:
Note that it was the perſon of Chriſt, which was the Riches of the Glory
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45964:34"/>
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as of the people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2. 32. again, the
Lords Chriſt, is called <hi>the Riches of glory, and the unſearchable Riches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles;</hi> who is, ſaid, <hi>ver. 17. to dwell in the heart by Faith:</hi> ſo
that the mind of <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is explained in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. that is to
ſay, Chriſt in you (by Faith) is the hope of Glory to be revealed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
5. 1. though it be Chriſt in you, the <hi>Hope,</hi> yet not the <hi>Merit</hi> of Glory;
And therefore <hi>by Chriſt in you the hope of glory,</hi> we are not to underſtand
either preſent Glory, or our glorious Saviour to be in us: Hereupon
<hi>F. Eaſtlack,</hi> ſhoots this bolt: <hi>to wit,</hi> that the <hi>Deity</hi> was within him,
(meaning that the <hi>Deity</hi> only, was the true Chriſt and his Saviour:) to
which I <hi>Replied,</hi> that the eſſential general preſence of the Deity, was in
<hi>Cats</hi> and <hi>Dogs,</hi> as well as in him, and therefore if the preſence of the
Dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y only, were the Saviour, it might be ſo in theſe, as well as in him:
forthwith, he cryed out, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken Blaſphemy:</hi> I told him,
that I had not ſpoken Blaſphemy but good Divinity; and then proved it
to be ſo, by the Teſtimony of the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Act. 17 24. God that made
the world, and all things therein, he giveth</hi> ver. 15 <hi>to all, life, and breath, and
all things:</hi> here hence I inferr'd, That as the <hi>Deity</hi> was not included in
any thing, or creature; ſo nor was it excluded: To which <hi>F. E.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
ſaying, I <hi>thought</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that thou hadſt meant otherwiſe:</hi> this
Anſwer was like himſelf.</p>
               <p>But for aſmuch as ſome of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have (as I am informed) ſince
affirmed, <hi>ſc.</hi> that <hi>F. E.</hi> did me no wrong, in charging me with Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as above: I ſhall therefore endeavour ſome further ſatisfaction in
in this matter: As from the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap 23. <hi>ver. 23, 24. Am
I a God at hand, ſaith the Lord, and not a God afar off: can any hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſecret places, that I ſhould not ſee him? ſaith the Lord, do not I fill
Heaven and Earth? ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> are reſolved into this one <hi>Poſition;</hi> namely, that
the <hi>Deity</hi> is omnipreſent, in all things every where. The <hi>Divine Being</hi>
filleth all things and places: for, though he be not circumſcribed by any
thing that is made, nor limited to any place; yet it is not excluded from
any place, creature or thing. <q>This (ſaith Mr. <hi>Carils</hi> on <hi>Ier. 23. above,</hi>)
is a Myſtery which indeed we are not able to comprehend by reaſon,
but we muſt take it down by Faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which gives credit to the Word of
God, and perſwades the heart, that the report therein made, is a Truth.</q>
But if any ask, <hi>how the Deity may be ſaid to be every where, and in every
thing, and creature that is made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, This Myſterious and aſtoniſhing Queſtion, with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
(<hi>Epiſt. 55. ad Dard.</hi>) who affirms. <q>That the Deity is wholly every
where, and in every thing; for the Godhead cannot be divided or parted:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45964:34"/>
That it is whole within all things, and whole without all things, no where
included, no where excluded, containing all things, contained of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet not at all mingled with the nature of theſe things, nor defiled
with their pollutions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Truth in all theſe Aſſertions, for the <hi>Deity</hi> is infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible,
and therefore whereſoever the <hi>Deity</hi> is, he is all and altogether,
filling all places, creatures and thing in heaven, hell, ſea, and earth; as
<hi>Pſal. 139 7, 8 Job. 11 8, 9. Iſai.</hi> 43. 2. And therefore their Teacher, <hi>F. E.</hi>

Here the Apoſtle reports to us, a great Example of unholy ſcorn; <hi>ſc.
Iſhmael</hi> perſecuting <hi>Iſaac; Moſes</hi> tells us the manner how, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
wherewith, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did not lift up his hand againſt <hi>Iſaac</hi> (as <hi>Cain</hi> did
againſt <hi>Abel</hi>) but his tongue: he mocked him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9. reproachful
mocking, is one of Satans choice Engines to wound the bleſſed Goſpel at
the very heart: even ſo it is now (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> there) and we may now
ſay, even ſo it is now; that is, they that are born after the Feſh, do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
them that are born after the Spirit (or of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13.) who
are Believers in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (ver. 12. <hi>comp.</hi> 45.) Its
but too well known, how the <hi>Quakers</hi> (who glory in their own Fleſh <hi>Gal.</hi>
6. 13. and in that reſpect, born after the Fleſh) do with moſt unholy
ſcorn, <hi>mock</hi> them that are born after the Spirit, <hi>ſc.</hi> after the Spirit of Faith
in the Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> reproachfully ſaying: O, you believe in
a humane, earthly Chriſt in an out-ſide Chriſt, a Chriſt in Name, Shew
and appearance only; no real Chriſt, no real Saviour: ſurely, theſe
kind of ſayings, muſt needs be bitter mockings, ſarcaſtical Jearings, and
moſt Blaſphemous Scorning of the holy and juſt one, born of <hi>Mary</hi> the
Son of the Higheſt, which in <hi>ver. 29. above,</hi> the Apoſtle calls <hi>Perſecution:</hi>
for it plainly notes a contemptuous and malignant carriage againſt Jeſus
of <hi>Nazareth the Man approved of God among the People, Act.</hi> 2. 22. in
ſhort, the whole is this: <hi>to wit,</hi> Let any rational Saint judge whether the
Earth doth (or can) bear, greater perſecutors of the Man Jeſus Chriſt
of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> than theſe Scoffing, Quaffing <hi>Quakers,</hi> and conſequently
are the <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> both in having, and acting the very nature, and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> but I ſhall likewiſe paſs this, and return to the third
Scripture, which <hi>William Wilkinſon</hi> repeated, <hi>viz. 1 Cor. 6. 11. But ye are
waſhed, but ye are juſtified by the Spirit of God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I told him, 1. That he had prophanely diſmembred that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

                     </gap>xt</hi> of Scripture, as his Brother <hi>F. E.</hi> had done before him, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the Name of the Lord Jeſus, (a Name too hard for them to bear.)</p>
               <p>2. That I had already ſhewed the mind of the Apoſtle, touching thoſe
words: and that it would be a disingenious act, to weary the judicious
Hearers with needleſs repetitions: but be continued clamourous, query<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>Why they might not be waſhed, and juſtified by the Spirit now, as well
as others heretofore?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I replied,</hi> That the Spirit as ſuch, never juſtified any Saint from fin in
the ſight of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much leſs ſuch a one as he was, who never had the
Spirit of God in him; he forthwith required me to prove that, <hi>to wit,</hi>
That he had not the Spirit of God in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I proved by 3 Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> Was taken from 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 8. There are three th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t bear witneſs in
Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, and theſe three agree in me:</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:45964:36"/>
But the Spirit that is in thee, doth not agree with the water of Baptiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
nor blood of the Super: (<hi>for thou haſt renounced both the Sacraments</hi>)
therefore the Spirit of God is not in thee.</p>
               <p>[Note: though I thus Argued; yet it was not to exclude other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
reſpects in this Text of Scripture.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which he Replied, ſaying,</hi> That he had both Baptiſme, and the Lords
Supper within him: <hi>But I proved the contrary, thus;</hi> Baptiſme and the
Lords Supper are viſible ſignes, of the inviſible efficacy of Chriſts one Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Body; but the viſible ſignes, (<hi>namely</hi> waſhing with water in (<hi>or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>)
the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and the Bread and Wine,
broken, and given, and poured forth) are not within thee, therefore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of Baptiſme, and the Supper of the Lord are not within thee: <hi>To
this he made no Reply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the way, let the <hi>Reader</hi> obſerve, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the Teaching, Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Quakers</hi> do uſually affirm, the true Church Officers, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Worſhip, are in God; and that the <hi>Deity</hi> is in them: therefore
all theſe are inviſibly in them: being (as they prate) immediately made
by the Spirit (<hi>ſtill the Idol-light within</hi>) whence they conclude that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
and the Lords Supper are within them: though their aſſertions
herein, be frequently and moſt plainly contradicted by themſelves: For
they maintain and keep up viſible Meetings, Officers, Light worſhip, and
Worſhippers: and thus by their conſtant viſible practice they clearly
confute themſelves, living in contradiction to their own fanciful Principles
and being ſelf confuted, they are ſelf-condemned: <hi>How great is this
darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, here hence it is, That they acknowledge no other Baptiſme,
then of the Holy Ghoſt, and of Fire (which makes many of them (as
its ſuppoſed) ſo hot, two <hi>Wives</hi>) calling it their internal warmth, and
ſpiritual refreſhment: nor no other Lords Supper, than their daily Feaſts
of fat things, which (as they dare ſay) feed them with heavenly joyes,
glories, and unſpeakable delights: often attended with a diſſembled kind
of <hi>canting-hummings</hi> within: a new kind of charm to ſeduce the itching
ear, and ſoft head, with unſcriptural novelties: ſo much for their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and inviſible Sacraments. I paſs to the ſecond <hi>Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Arg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Was taken from</hi> Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs
with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</p>
               <p>But this holy Spirit doth not bear witneſs with thy Spirit, that thou art a
Child of God: <hi>Therefore, the Spirit of God is not in thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He denied the Aſſumption; which I proved, <hi>The Holy Spirit witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them only to be Gods Children,</hi> which do believe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>
to be the true Chriſt, and their only Saviour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:45964:36"/>
But thou doſt not believe on Jeſus of Nazareth to be the true Chriſt, and
thy only Saviour; <hi>Therefore,</hi> the Holy Spirit doth not bear witneſs with thy
Spirit, that thou art a child of God, and conſequently thou haſt not the Spirit
of God within thee: <hi>To which he made me no Return at all; ſo that his</hi>
ſtaring ſilence, <hi>gave open conſent to the concluded Truth above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> 3d. Argument <hi>was thus formed: ſc.</hi> He that maketh God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Lyar, hath not the Spirit of God in him: but thou makeſt God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Lyar: <hi>This Minor he confidently denied, but I proved it, thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that believeth not the Record, which God gives of his Son, makes him a
Lyar, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10. But thou believeſt not the Record, that God gave of his
Son <hi>Therefore,</hi> thou makeſt God the Father a Lyar:</p>
               <p>He denied the Minor Propoſition; For (as he ſaid) he believed the
Record that God gave of his Son: But I proved the contrary, thus,</p>
               <p>The Record that God gives of his Son, <hi>is this,</hi> ſc. That Ieſus Chriſt (<hi>as
Man</hi>) is the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29,
30. <hi>with</hi> 34. verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou doſt not believe the Record,</hi> Namely, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (as Man)
<hi>is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World;</hi> Therefore thou
didſt not believe the Record, that God gave of his Son; conſequently,
thou makeſt God a Lyar, and ſuch Blaſphemers have not the Spirit of
God in them: here again the Lord ſtopt his Mouth, that he had not a
word to ſay for himſelf.</p>
               <p>As I was thus Arguing this Truth, (<hi>ſc.</hi> That the Spirit of God, was
not in this Diſputant <hi>W. Wilkinſon</hi>) I obſerved (and O let it never be

               <p>As I were thus ſpeaking to him, the Lord undoubtedly took hold on his
heart; for though he were a Man of parts, yet he made no reply of any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which (in real tenderneſs to his Soul) I had ſpoken above: but
immediately he ſtept down, in a trembling poſture, with tears in his eyes,
went out of the Church: the next morning be came to my houſe, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

this weighty matter, concerning Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Mary;</hi> that he is now in a preſent, glorified and bodily exiſtence in the
third Heaven above, and that he now hath (though denied by <hi>Socinians</hi>
and <hi>Quakers</hi>) in the Heavens above, true fleſh and blood, the nature
and properties of a true mankind body; which Mr. <hi>Doolittle</hi> plainly
proves, by propounding (in the <hi>Young-man's Inſtructor</hi>) four Queſtions.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 
                  <q>Had not Chriſt a real humane, mankind body, when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
out of the Grave; foraſmuch as he ſhewed the prints of the nailes in
his hands and feet to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Joh. 20. 27. ſurely, this cannot be denied
with any colour of reaſon.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:45964:37"/>
2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 
                  <q>Did he not aſcend with the ſame body, or had he not the
ſame body when he was parted from his Diſciples; foraſmuch as they
ſaw the ſame body, go up, that talked with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. No
man can deny this, with whom the Scriptures of truth, have either Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
or Credit.</q>

               <p>3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 
                  <q>Can you ſay, that Chriſt put off his body, after he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of ſight before he came into heaven; or if you ſhould ſay it,
doth any Scripture favour you herein? neither <hi>Socinian, Quaker,</hi> or any
other to this day ever produced (nor can) any ſuch Scripture: For
<hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw Chriſts humane body ſince in Heaven above, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55. 56.</q>

               <p>4 <hi>Queſt.</hi> 
                  <q>Or can you tell, that Chriſt put off his body, ſince he came
to Heaven, and <hi>Stephen ſaw him there:</hi> I am (ſaid he) moſt ſure, that
you can tell no ſuch thing; for the teſtimony of the holy Angels is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, for they did aſſure the Diſciples, that the ſame Jeſus that they
ſaw aſcend, ſhould be ſo ſeen to come again, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And will not theſe four things, put you out of doubt, <hi>ſc.</hi> that Chriſt
hath the ſame body now, that he had upon the earth: Oh, how great is
the ground of a true Chriſtians comfort, that the ſame perſon that died
for us, is thus ſate down at the right hand of God: aad that there we
have the ſame Jeſus interceeding for us in heaven: on the other ſide is it
not matter of dread and terror to the wicked (both in practice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that ſtill continue to oppoſe an exalted Chriſt, and prefer their

                  <hi>I anſwered,</hi> 1. It was plainly implyed in that <hi>Text</hi> of Scripture; and
it doth evidently concenter therein: Beſides, in reaſon, there is nothing
that could be the ground or occaſion of this Fight (or violent contention)

It cannot be called a Reſurrection, but a new Creation, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(in effect) to deny the reſurrection of the dead; and ſo a plain
ſelf contradiction.</p>
               <p>Next <hi>W. Bullock</hi> appeared: telling us, that the ſame body which dies,
ſhall not riſe again; alledging theſe words: <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is
raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Replied, 1. That the Words repeated by him, were in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44.
and withal, the Apoſtle ſaith not, that the body ſhall be raiſed a Spirit, but
Spiritual; as Chriſts body of fleſh and bones, after the Reſurrection, was
Spiritual, but not a Spirit: for Chriſt aſſured his Diſciples, that his body
was not changed into a Spirit; <hi>Behold and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and
bones, as ye ſee me have,</hi> Luk. 24. 39. <hi>It is the ſame true and real body which
is preſented to you,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is I my ſelf.</hi> Now, as it was with Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
raiſed from the dead, ſo it ſhall be with our body (as to the ſubſtantial
ſameneſs) after the Reſurrection, inaſmuch as the Reſurrection of Chriſts
body is made a pledge of our Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 14. And God hath
both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe up us by his own power.</hi> Again,
<hi>But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that
ſlept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20.</p>
               <p>2. It is raiſed a Spiritual Body, becauſe then the body ſhall have no
need of natural helps, of which a natural body ſtands in need of, as ſleep,
meat, rayment; but a ſpiritual body needs them not, this is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all orthodox Authors: Chriſt told the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (who ſaid <hi>there
is no Reſurrection</hi>) That after the Reſurrection, <hi>Mat. 22. 39. They neither
Marry nor are given in Marriage, but are as the Angels in Heaven?</hi> Chriſt
doth not ſay, that they ſhall be Angels, or that their bodies ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Francis Eaſtlack</hi> ſtood up again, and boldly ſaid, That the Scripture

               <p>I Anſwered, That the laſt words [<hi>ſc. To every ſeed his own body</hi>] do

for qualities:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>F. Eaſtlack</hi> Replied, ſaying, The Scripture ſaith, it is not the ſame

body, but thou ſayeſt it is the ſame body; I told him. what I had ſaid, the
ſame Texts of Scripture do (in effect (ſay, <hi>ſc.</hi> Though it be not the ſame

and withal I told him, if he would not admit of a diſtinction, how then
could he reconcile theſe Scriptures to his underſtanding. <hi>viz. God repents
and he repents not: God tempts no man, yet God tempted Abraham: Reprove
a Fool in his folly, and reprove not a fool in his folly: I and my Father are

quarell'd Diſtinctions any more.</p>
               <p>As for the ſimilitude of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Grain,</hi> mentioned in the verſes above,
I ſhall anſwer with Reverend Mr. <hi>Caril:</hi> 
                  <q>It is (ſaith he) very true,
that the Corn or Grain which is ſowed, doth not ariſe again in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or after that quality or likeneſs in which it was caſt into the ground:
we ſow bare Seed, but when it comes up again it comes with a ſtalk, and
an ear and ſhoots up in much greeneſs and beauty: there is a great
difference between a grain of wheat in the buſhel, and a flouriſhing ſtem,
or ear of Corn in the field: God gives it another body in the growing
up, but yet it is ſtill a body, and there is the ſame nature in it ſtill, and
the ſame ſubſtance of the grain remains ſtill; only there is an addition
of beauty and greenneſs when it is riſen and grown up: ſo the Body
that is caſt into the Ground, is like a [<hi>bare</hi>] grain: it is caſt in a bare
(or naked) body, but when it ſhall be raiſed again, the body ſhall have
many beautiful and glorious additions: ſo that in the Reſurrection there
will be an adding of ſomewhat to that which was before; the Corn
grows up, with ſomewhat that it had not, but it doth not loſe any thing
that it had: tis ſtill a garin of wheat and better, ſo the body laid down
in the Grave, is raiſed, not the ſame in all things, but better in many
things added: Now the excellent endowments and qualifications added
to the body, cannot work a loſs or an annihilation of the frame or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of corporial parts and members,</q> ſo much for Mr. <hi>Caril,</hi> upon
the 1 Cor. 15. 36, 37, 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now conſider the laſt Text of Scripture, which was by <hi>F. E.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
<hi>to wit:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Cor. 15. 30. <hi>That fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God;</hi>
Therefore, the ſame body that dies ſhall not riſe again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwered</hi> 1. That the <hi>Socinians</hi> (your Brethren and fellow Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the truth) do urge this Text of Scripture, to confirm their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt Chriſt and the Reſurrection of the ſame body; <hi>to wit,</hi> that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45964:40"/>
Chriſt hath not now fleſh and blood, nor the nature and properties of a
true Mankind body; this hath been afore propounded and confuted: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
(they ſay, as ye do) <hi>How can the body ariſe of fleſh, when the Apoſtle
ſaith, Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; if no fleſh ſhall
inherit the Kingdom of God, how can it be affirmed that the ſame true fleſh ſhall
be raiſed to enter upon that inheritance</hi> (perhaps this improvement he had
forgot.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Theſe inferences</hi> are not only defective, but contrary to the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Reſurrection, which denotes a taking up of that which was laid
down: It muſt hence follow, <hi>ſc:</hi> If the ſame body that dies be not raiſed
up, but another kind of body, it cannot be a Reſurrection, as above;
Moreover, If a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Reſurrection it be not the ſame, but another body,
then, that body which actively and paſſively honoured God in this world,
ſhall not (according to Divine Promiſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4.) be glorified with
Chriſt in the World to come, but another body ſhall be there glorified,
which never did or ſuffered any thing for God's honour, and to which
God never made any Promiſe: yea, that body which wickedly ſinned, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and dyedin finall impenitency and unbelief: Shall not (according to
Divine threatning, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 41.) be for ever tormented: but another
body ſhall which never ſinned (nor was ever threatned) be eternally
dammed in hell with the Devil and his Angels: Theſe inavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents
are no leſs than high blaſphemies againſt the Juſtice, Truth, and
Righteouſneſs of God Himſelf, eſpecially in that Scripture of ſacred
truth (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10) <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt,
that every one</hi> (ſc: the ſame whole man) <hi>may receive the things done in
his body, according to that he hath done, whether good or bad:</hi> And the Lord
Chriſt aſſures us (<hi>John.</hi> 5. 28, 29.) <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the Graves</hi> (Are there any other bodies in the Graves then the

               </p>
               <p>And ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Reſurrection of

(<hi>in</hi> Matt. 25. 46.) <hi>alſo</hi> Proved.</p>
               <p>3. That by <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> (in that place of Scripture above) is not
meant the ſubſtance of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> the parts of a Man's body (as
now it is) But it is to be underſtood of the ſinfull qualities of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(that are to be done away) as in other places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18, 24.
Chap. 8. 1, 6, 7. <hi>Gal</hi> 5 17, 19, 24. Fleſh doth ſignifie; or of naturall
Fleſh and Blood, of which the body is now compoſed and made up; as
ſuch, it is corruptable, and cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;
and thus <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it, as in the latter clauſe of the ſame 50. <hi>verſe.
Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption: That is, corruptable Fleſh</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:45964:40"/>
and blood (or fleſh and blood that hath the Seed and Principles of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)
ſhall never enter into <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> ſuch fleſh
and blood is unfit to wear the Crown of Glory; as our Souls muſt be
changed, before they can be fit for Glory, ſo alſo muſt our Bodies from
their natural eſtate, to a ſpiritual: for at the Reſurrection, our bodies
ſhall not be raiſed natural, corruptable bodies; but ſpiritual, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
bodies, and as ſuch they will be fit for Glory in the Kingdome of
Heaven; as its illuſtrated, <hi>ver. 52. And the Dead ſhall be raiſed incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and we ſhall be changed:</hi> but how? the next verſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> 53. tells us,
<hi>This corruptable muſt put on incorruption:</hi> Note [<hi>This</hi>] <hi>Mortal muſt
put on immortality:</hi> well then, though the body of Man be now natural,
corruptable, and mortal fleſh and blood (and as ſuch unfit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven:) But in the Reſurrection the body will not be ſo; for
it will then be ſpiritual, incorruptable, immortal fleſh and blood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(not Diſcuſſed in the <hi>Diſputation</hi>) Held and Profeſſed by moſt <hi>Quakers:
To wit,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there is a ſtate of perfect freedome from ſin in this Life.</item>
                  <item>2. That the matter contained in the Scriptures, is not (1.) The
Word of God. (2.) Nor the infallible ſtanding Rule of Faith, and
Life.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Soul in Man is God, in part, and ſo Infallible.</item>
                  <item>4. The denying of the Trinity: <hi>ſc.</hi> three perſons in one Deity.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe corrupt <hi>Principles</hi> maintained by moſt Teaching <hi>Quakers,</hi> I have
(on Requeſt as above) conſidered, and made ſome <hi>Replies</hi> to each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
diſtinctly, as in their order afore expreſſed.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Principle.</hi> That there is a ſtate of perfect freedome from ſin, in this
Life; Alledging that the Scriptures do teſtifie the ſame: <hi>as Job 1. ver.</hi> 1, 8.
22 <hi>Pſal. 37. ver.</hi> 37. &amp; 39. 1. &amp; 119. 5. <hi>Mat. 5. 48. Rom.</hi> 6. 18. &amp; 8. 4.
&amp; 2. 15. <hi>Phil. 3. 15. Eph. 3. 19. Luk.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>That I might herein give ſome ſatisfaction, I have conſidered the above-mentioned
Scriptures, one after another in their aſſerted Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Scripture,</hi> Job 1. ver. 1, 8, 22. There was a Man whoſe Name
was Job, and that man was perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>1ſt. verſe.</hi> By <hi>Perfect</hi> here, we are not to underſtand a
<hi>Legal</hi> perfection, ſuch as <hi>Adams</hi> before the Fall; though it be contended
for by the Teaching <hi>Quakers,</hi> and affirmed by them as poſſibly attainable,
yea, actually attained by many of their <hi>Friends</hi> in this Life: but the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
doth not in any one of theſe verſes, expreſs (no, nor in end) <hi>Iobs</hi>
perfection from all ſin in this life: nor did <hi>Iob</hi> ſo underſtand it, witneſs
his own confeſſions. <hi>Chap. 9. 20. If I juſtifie my ſelf, my own mouth ſhall

to ſay, if I juſtifie my ſelf, by the actings and expreſſions of my life, my
Mouth would condemn me: ſo, if I ſay, I am perfect in the thinkings and

               </gap>cret motions of my heart, it would prove me perverſe (<hi>Caril in locum</hi>)
and in <hi>Chap. 10. 6. Thou enquireſt after my Iniquity, and ſearche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſin:</hi> likewiſe in <hi>Chap. 42. 6. Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt
and aſhes:</hi> but to put the word <hi>Perfect,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. out of all doubt,
it is explained in the <hi>8th. veſe</hi> above, <hi>There was none like him in the Earth,
a perfect and an upright man:</hi> which referred to that Generation in which
<hi>Iob</hi> lived. So we read of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. <hi>That he was a juſt man and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in his Generations:</hi> in like manner conſider <hi>Iob</hi> in the time and age
wherein he lived; there was none like him in the Earth for Godlineſs and
uprightneſs: hence for any man to infer, that either <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Iob</hi> were
were perfect from all ſin in this life, would be a miſerable perver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of
the places of Scripture: they being only perfect comparatively, <hi>i. e.</hi> in
compariſon of all other men, which lived in their Ages, and Generations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as for the</hi> 22d. verſe. In all this Iob ſinned not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Theſe words are not to be taken in a <hi>Quakers</hi> ſenſe (as if <hi>Iob</hi>
had been at any time without ſin in this world) for, in the <hi>11th. verſe,</hi> he
(<hi>Iob will curſe thee to thy face:</hi> Satan was confident that <hi>Iob</hi> would Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,
by curſing God to his face: this Satan did promiſe to himſelf,
and did undertake with God; which plainly interprets the words, <hi>ſc.
In all this Iob ſinned not:</hi> that is ſuch a ſin, (in thought or word) as to
<hi>Curſe God:</hi> he was not tranſported by paſſion or impatiency, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or Curſe the Living God, but gave him Glory, ſaying, <hi>ver. 21.
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the
Lord;</hi> As to the phraſe perfect above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If any of you ſay, as ſome Teaching <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſaid: <hi>ſc.
That it was in the time of Iobs affliction,</hi> when he ſaid; <hi>If I ſay that I am
perfect, it will prove me perverſe;</hi> but after his deliverance he was perfect
without ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is wholly falſe: for the character given of <hi>Iob, viz. a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
man,</hi> was before his affliction; for Gods commending of him (as
perfect and upright) was the occaſion of the Devils deſiring leave of
God to afflict him, and of Gods grant, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. that his Word might be
found true: upon the whole, obſerve in <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 25. <hi>ver. 4. How then
can Man be juſtified with God, or can he be clean, that is born of a Woman,</hi>
This <hi>Queſtion,</hi> carrieth a ſtrong denial, <hi>viz.</hi> it cannot poſſibly be, or it is
impoſſible to be: as if <hi>Iob</hi> had ſaid, do but acknow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>edge that any one
is born ordinarily of a Woman, and we may conclude him to be ſinful and
unclean, with (or in the ſight of) God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Scripture,</hi> Pſal. 37. ver. 37. Mark the perfect man, and behold
the upright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> in the latter clauſe, doth interpret, perfect, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ſo then the perfect man, is the upright or ſincere hearted man; we
read in <hi>Iacobs</hi> character, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 27. and <hi>Iacob</hi> was a plain man; this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45964:42"/>
phraſe <hi>plain man</hi> here, is the ſame wite <hi>perfect man</hi> in the Text above: a
<hi>plain man</hi> and a <hi>perfect man</hi> (in a Scriptural account) are convertible
terms, 1 <hi>Chron</hi> 29. 9, 27. and do ſignifie, a man that hath not a heart and

one thing and meaning another: It is alſo the ſame word, that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. <hi>He was perfect in his Generation,</hi> or he was ſound,
upright plain hearted with God: And it is that God ſpake to <hi>Abraham,
Gen. 17. 1. Walk before me and be thou perfect;</hi> or ſound, upright, plain,
in thy walking before me: now, though <hi>Job, Noah, Jacob, Abraham,</hi> are
ſaid to be <hi>perfect;</hi> yet it is not to be found in the Scriptures, that God
ever ſaid of all or any one of them (or of any other meer Saint) they
were <hi>perfect</hi> without ſin in this world: but the contrary is (as may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appear) often found in Holy Writ: foraſmuch as it is ſincerity
(or the Law written in the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8.) which is the only Goſpel
Perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Scripture,</hi> Pſal. 39. 1. I ſaid, I will take heed to my wayes, that I
ſin not with my tongue: <hi>compare with Jam.</hi> 3. 2. If any man effend not in

            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> heedfully endeavoured circumſpection, not to
offend with his tongue, yet he ſinned with it, Pſal. 116. 11 <hi>I ſaid in my

and about the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the <hi>Hittite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Might it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>David</hi> ſinned not with his tongue, yet he
might ſin in thought; although, it be moſt true, which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>
ſpeaks above, <hi>ſc. If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. Theſe words, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 2. in their litteral ſenſe, denote a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
[<hi>If</hi>] <hi>any man offend not in word,</hi> that is, (as Dr. <hi>Manton in loc:</hi>
ſaith) <q>If there be ſuch a man, who never ſpake a word untruly, nor
unſeaſonably, nor uncharitably; a man whoſe words were alwayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity, and folly. without obſenity, raſh Oathes, and Paſſion, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only known truths: if theſe be ſuch a man, who at all times avoids
the evils of the tongue, I will (as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay) make bold
to call him a <hi>perfect man,</hi>
               </q> ſuch another as is not to be found among
<hi>Mortals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> (by way of ſuppoſition) ſaid unto the Children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> Lev. 18 5. <hi>Which</hi> [<hi>If</hi>] <hi>a man do, he ſhall live in them:</hi> here <hi>Moſes</hi>
propoſeth an unlikely, yea, an impoſſible practice, under the word [<hi>If</hi>]
<hi>which if a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

perfect man, but ſuch a <hi>non offender</hi> is not to be found, and conſequently
not a Man of a perfect tongue.</p>
            <p>2. Some take the word [<hi>Perfect</hi>] for Upright, Sincere; that is to
ſay, if a man offend not in word, he is perfect or upright, ſincere without

their thoughts accuſing them, becauſe they have done that which is not
right: which plainly argues the imperfection of ſin, and not a perfection
from any, (much leſs from all) ſin, in Men, as Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ninth Scripture,</hi> Phil. 3. 15. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,
be thus minded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> The word <hi>Perfect</hi> here, may not be taken, <hi>for a perfect freedome
from ſin:</hi> for <hi>Paul, ver.</hi> 12. ſaith (in effect) that he was not perfect from
ſin, which may appear by the <hi>11th verſe If by any means, I might attain
unto the Reſurrection of the dead:</hi> now, the eſtate which accompanies the
Reſurrection from the dead, excludes all ſin, the Saints ſhall then be legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect: this, the Apoſtle aimed at, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and uſed all means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh,
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. but he could not attain it, as he doth confeſs in the
<hi>12th</hi> verſe <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect:</hi>
meaning, with that perfection from ſin, which accompanies the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the dead: ſo then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only deny himſelf to be perfect
from ſin, but withal inferres, ſuch an eſtate of perfect freedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to
be attainable in this life, by any meer Saint; becauſe it attends the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
from the dead; which is ſufficiently evidenced from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
verſes (he grants a Goſpel, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. but denies a legal perfection,
<hi>ver.</hi> 12. if ſo, then the phraſe Perfect, in the <hi>15th verſe</hi> above, cannot be
underſtood, (in a <hi>Quakers</hi> ſenſe) for <hi>Paul</hi>'s being perfect from ſin; we
may not affirm that of <hi>Paul,</hi> which he himſelf effectually doth deny, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifeſt wrong to the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Term <hi>Perfect</hi> (let us, as many as be <hi>perfect</hi>) may be aken
(as learned, judicious <hi>Authors</hi> have averr'd) for ſome ripeneſs, and
growth in matters of Chriſtianity; as in the <hi>Jewiſh Diſcipline,</hi> there
were two ſorts of Learners, Beginners, theſe did only exerciſe themſelves
in the firſt principles of religious matters; and while they were but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45964:44"/>
               <hi>Beginners,</hi> they were accounted weak, or imperfect in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
then there were others, that had made ſome progreſs in, and
attained to ſome growth in Chriſtian matters learned, theſe were called
ſtrong or perfect (in compariſon of the <hi>Beginners</hi>) Thus, <hi>Perfect</hi> is to
be underſtood, in the 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 6. Howbeit, we ſpeak wiſdome among them
that are perfect:</hi> meaning, however imperfect weaklings are taken <hi>with
inticing words of mans wiſdome,</hi> ver. 4. accounting the Preaching of the
Croſs (Chriſt crucified) Fooliſhneſt; yet, grown mortified Chriſtians
will diſcern wiſdom and ſublimity, in the plain preaching of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt
Crucified;</hi> and this ſenſe, may be accommodated to this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Phil. 3. 15. above) As many of us as be perfect,</hi> i. e. ſuch of us, as
are no <hi>Beginners,</hi> or Learners, ſuch as try experiments in Religion: But
<hi>Perfect,</hi> ſuch as have made ſome towardly progreſs therein, that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if any <hi>Teaching, Seducing Quaker,</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That by
the word <hi>Perfect,</hi> as it referrs to Saints in this world, it doth ſignifie a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
freedome from all ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This was the lying Doctrine of the Heretical <hi>Cathariſh</hi>'s, and

               </gap>les intend, their having of
ſin after (as well as before) the new birth; for, obſerve the <hi>8th. verſe,
If we</hi> (that is, we, who are in the new birth) <hi>ſay that we have no ſin, we
deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us:</hi> Note here, that the words
in this <hi>8th verſe</hi> are expreſly of the preſent time; <hi>to wit,</hi> if we (not have

had) no ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which doth moſt plainly prove; that the born of God
have ſin after (as well as before) their new birth.</p>
            <p>2. As to the words alledged out of the 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 9. Whoſoever is born
of God, doth not commit ſin:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the words ſhould be underſtood in the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
aſſerted: then the new birth would exclude the being of ſin, in all
the born of God: for the new birth agrees to them all, to one as well as
to another; as the reaſon given is the ſame verſe doth teſtifie: <hi>Becauſe his
ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> now the
ſeed remains in all the born of God, as well as in any: well then, it muſt
be meant of all Saints, or none: Now, if the Teaching <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould
be ſo ſtark mad, as to affirm all Saints to be free from ſin, the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8. will reprove their madneſs: for, <hi>if we</hi> (who are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Saints, and born of God) <hi>ſay, that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves,
and the truth is not in us:</hi> all men may ſee, that theſe words were ſpoken
of and by ſuch Saints, as had, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. fellowſhip with the Father, and his
Son Jeſus Chriſt: and yet they have certified, <hi>ſc. if that we ſay, that we
have no ſin, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> That the words in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. cannot be meant of freedome
from the nature and being of ſin, in the born of God, but only of the
Trade and Cuſtome of ſinning, which is explained in the foregoing <hi>8th
verſe For the Devil ſinneth from the beginning, i. e.</hi> he hath never ceaſed to
ſin ſince he began, it hath ever been his trade or cuſtomary way; thus to
ſin, the born of God cannot, for the courſe and cuſtome of ſin being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
there's not now ſuch a free correſpondency between the Soul and
Sin, as before Regeneration: this is the Character of the unregenerate,
<hi>They cannot ceaſe to ſin,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 14. But ſo the born of God ſinneth not,
(<hi>i. e.</hi> without ceſſation,) inaſmuch as he is daily pleading (in his prayers)
againſt ſin, deſiring ſtrength, not only againſt, but victory over it: thus is
was with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom, 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me
from this body of death,</hi> ſc. from this burden and bondage of inherent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
corruption; yea, all this, after he was moſt truly the born of God:
It is therefore a manifeſt wreſting of the above mentioned Texts, (ſc.
1 John 1. 10. in forcing them to ſay, <hi>that the born of God ſinned, before
they were in the new birth, but not after it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth Scripture, <hi>Eph. 3. 19. That ye might be filled with all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God:</hi> which (ſome ſay) excludes the being of ſin in Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. The phraſe [<hi>Fulneſs</hi>] is to be expounded by a diſtinction,
there being a double fulneſs; namely, of <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Degrees:</hi> for the
firſt of theſe, we read, <hi>Act. 7. 55. But he</hi> (Stephen) <hi>being full of the
Holy Ghoſt;</hi> this Reſpects the fulneſs of parts only; that is, he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45964:45"/>
of every Grace, though not a perfection of any Grace; An Infant
may be ſaid to be a perfect man, as it hath a perfection or fulneſs of parts,
but not of growth and degrees.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The fulneſs of God,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Degrees,</hi> is to be had only in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above; And even there, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intends not equality (but quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
of fulneſs: that is, a divine and glorious fulneſs of or from God: ſo
then the fulneſs of God above expreſſed, is to be underſtood of a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(not on Earth, but) in Heaven, which is the proper import of that
place of Scripture: for, the Apoſtle prayes, that they [<hi>Might</hi>] be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
&amp;c. And ſo they ſhould be in Heaven, but he aſſerts not, that either
they were, or ſhould be ſo filled in this life: the perſon is, becauſe here,
we know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 9, 22. For now we ſee through a Glaſſe darkly,
but then face to face, now, I know in part, but then I ſhall know, even as I am
known:</hi> Therefore, <hi>the fulneſs of God</hi> above, doth not exclude the being
of ſin in this life.</p>
            <p>The eleventh Scripture, <hi>Luk. 1. 6. Walking</hi> (ſc. <hi>Zecharias</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth'</hi>
his Wife, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the
Lord blameleſs:</hi> here the <hi>Quakers</hi> think they are perfect Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> The word [<hi>Blameleſs</hi>] doth not (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> would have
it) ſignifie [<hi>Sinleſs</hi>] before the Lord, but <hi>Rebukeleſs</hi> before men, in this
World, no man can be ſo <hi>blameleſs,</hi> as to be <hi>ſinleſs</hi> in the ſight of God; 'tis
true, we read. <hi>Numb. 23. 21. He hath not ſeen iniquity in Jacob,</hi> that is, not
with an eye of revenge, but pity: God ſaw iniquity in <hi>Jacob</hi> his people,
but not ſo as to deſtroy them, which was the unwearied deſign &amp; deſire of
<hi>Balack</hi> the Princes of <hi>Moab,</hi> ver. 17. in which ſenſe, the not ſeeing
of iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> is only meant.</p>
            <p>Indeed, at the glorious <hi>ſecond coming</hi> of the Lords Chriſt, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the juſt ſhall be <hi>ſinleſly blameleſs</hi> before the Lord, as in 1 <hi>Cor. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> in that day of
Chriſts coming in glory,, <hi>the Saints ſhall be found of God in peace, without

willingly grant, that Believers may walk in all the Commandments and
Ordinances of the Lord, <hi>blameleſs,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>rebukeleſs,</hi> in regard of
Men: this is verified by the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 2. 15. That ye may be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,

               </gap>e <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were <hi>blameleſs:</hi> for <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
was ſo far from being <hi>perfect</hi> without ſin, that he was found (at the
very time, that the words above were uttered of him) guilty of the great
ſin of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and for it was puniſhed with dumbneſs, <hi>Luk. 1. 20. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thou ſhalt be dumb, and not able to ſpeak, until the day that theſe things
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45964:46"/>
ſhall be performed, becauſe thou doſt not believe my words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Here the <hi>Quaker</hi> will be apt to ſay. <hi>But there is no ſin charged
upon</hi> Elizabeth; <hi>ſo that ſhe might be perfect without ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The phraſe [<hi>Blameleſs</hi>] (on which the <hi>Quaker</hi> puts his
whole ſtreſs) may refer to an Unbeliever, yea, to a perſecutor of Jeſus
Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth, Phil. 3. 6. Touching the righteouſneſs which is in the
Law, Blameleſs;</hi> even then, when <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>graceleſs,</hi> he was <hi>blameleſs:</hi>
this I have only noted by way, that <hi>Teaching Quakers</hi> may plainly ſee,
that the word [<hi>Blameleſs</hi>] ſimply in its own nature, will be ſo far from
proving <hi>perfection</hi> of Grace that it will not prove any truth of Grace.</p>
            <p>2. It will not therefore follow, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was perfect without ſin,
becauſe there is no mention made of her ſin; let it be well obſerved,
that in the <hi>6th verſe</hi> above, <hi>They are both ſaid to be righteous and blameleſs,</hi>
even then when the beſt of them both, was guilty of actual ſin: now, if
the expreſſions of <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Blameleſs,</hi> were applicable to <hi>Zecharias,</hi>
when he was under ſin; then the ſame expreſſions (<hi>ſc.</hi> of <hi>Righteous</hi> and
<hi>Blameleſs</hi>) will not argue her to be more free from ſin, then her Husband,
there being the ſame reaſon for the one, as for the other: to deny this,
were to deſtroy the rules of right reaſoning; beſides, death took hold of
her, as well as of him, <hi>which is the wages of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 23.</p>
            <p>3. If the Term <hi>Blameleſs,</hi> ſhould prove <hi>Zecharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (in
their life time) <hi>ſinleſs,</hi> or perfect without ſin, it would prove the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God <hi>ſinful,</hi> (which to aſſert were Blaſphemy,) for the Holy
Scriptures do utterly deny ſuch a <hi>blameleſneſs,</hi> or freedome from ſin in
Mortals; As in <hi>Eccleſs, 7. 20. For there is not a juſt man upon the Earth,
that doth good and ſinneth not:</hi> that is, that ſinneth not in doing good: the
Spirit doth ſay ſimply, that there is not a juſt man, that ſinneth not, but a
juſt man that doth good, and ſinneth not: intimating, that in our moſt
religious Actions, there is ſome mixture of ſin; hence the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi>
64. 6. <hi>That all our Righteouſneſs is as filthy rags;</hi> Noting to us, that no
righteous work of ours is ſo pure, but there is ſome taint, and filth of ſin
cleaving to it, which without a Mediator (in the rigor of the Law) would
be damnable: ſo then, though the action (as to the matter) be not ſinful
yet there is ſome ſin in the Action: this difference is expreſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 38
where the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to bear the iniquity of the holy things;</hi> holy
things in the matter of them, yet iniquity in the manner of performing
them, <hi>Rom. 7. 18. How to perform that which is good I find not:</hi> here hence
it is, that we read, 1 <hi>King. 8 46. If they ſin againſt thee, for there is no man
that ſinneth not:</hi> and again, 2 <hi>Chron. 6. 36. For there is no man that ſinneth

all:</hi> he ſaith, We, including himſelf, though an eminent Saint, and an

Apoſtle of great holineſs; <hi>All of us offend in many things, and many of us

a curſed root of bitterneſs, which God doth mortifie, but not nullifie in
this World; 'tis ſubdued, but not removed, 'tis caſt down, but not caſt

            </p>
            <p>To wit,</p>
            <p>That the written Scriptures are not (1.) The Word of God. (2.) Nor

            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. VVhereas they ſay, <hi>The written Scriptures are not the Word
of God:</hi> if thereby they mean the Scriptures, as expreſſed by humane
tongues, or as written, or printed with ink and paper, by the art of the
VVriter, or Printer; if ſo conſidered, we do not affirm the Scriptures
to be the VVord of God: But as the <hi>Written Scriptures</hi> do declare the
mind of God to us, ſo the matter therein contained, is the declarative
VVord of God: as in <hi>Heb. 1, 2. God who at ſundry times, and in divers
manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt
dayes ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What hath the Son of God ſpoken, touching the <hi>Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He tells us, that the Scripture is the VVord of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.
13. <hi>Making the Word of God of none effect.</hi> Here the Son of God, calls
the fifth Commandment (in the written Scriptures) the VVord of God,
and in <hi>Iohn 2. 22. They believed the Scripture, the word which Jeſus had ſaid.</hi>
Alſo <hi>Ioh. 10. 34, 35. And Jeſus anſwered them, It is written in your Law,
I ſaid, ye are Gods: if he called them Gods, unto whom the word of God
came, and the Scripture cannot be broken.</hi> Note, in theſe Texts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Lord
and only Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God affirms, that the VVord
of God, is the Scripture, and that the Scripture is the VVord of God, as
being convertible terms; that is, what is truely and properly ſpoken of
the one, is alſo ſpoken of the other, for ſo it is with all propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible.</p>
            <p>Moreover, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God,
and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in
Righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, in the Righteouſneſs both of Faith, and Life:
And therefore as the Scripture is the VVord of God, ſo likewiſe it is the
infallible ſtanding Rule of Faith and Life.</p>

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45964:47"/>
It being evidently ſo: I need not ſtay, to ſhew you the excellency of any
part of the Scripture, having pointed you at ſuch an original of the whole,
which adviſeth you ſeriouſly to conſider, what the Lord ſpeaks to all ſuch
as they are: we read, <hi>Numb. 15. 30. The Soul that doth ought preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>
(whether he be born in the Land, or a ſtranger) <hi>the ſame reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Lord:</hi> O how highly do you Teaching <hi>Quakers</hi> reproach the
Lord, when you deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God) <hi>that Soul
ſhall be cut off from the peeple?,</hi> but mark the ground and reaſon of it:
<hi>Becauſe he hath deſpiſed the Word of God,</hi> ver. 31. <hi>and hath broken his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi>
Note here, that the Lord concludes his word, and written
Commandments to be one and the ſame thing, and thereupon the Lord
paſſeth this heavy Sentence; <hi>That Soul ſhall be utterly cut off, his iniquity
ſhall be upon him:</hi> i. e. It ſhall never be forgiven him, (except God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
grant repentance for and from theſe dead works,) O ye <hi>Quakers,</hi> are
you not herein, worſe then the <hi>Egyptian Heathens:</hi> for they believed the
Word ſpoken to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be the Word of God, <hi>Exod. 9. 20.
He that feared the Word of the Lord amongſt the Servants of Pharaoh, made
his Servants and his Cattle to flie into the Houſes:</hi> howbeit, they will think
themſelves either wronged or feared, if their Arguments be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Argument,</hi> That which is the Word of God, dwells within, <hi>Col.</hi>
3. 16. <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdome:</hi> whereas

the ſpirits are to be tried by the Scripture, and not the Scripture by the

the ſpirit ſhould be divided againſt it ſelf, it ſhould be ſpirit of

the true Chriſt and our only Saviour was and is Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth,
a man approved of God, who was taken by the Jews, ſlain and hanged upon a
Tree, whom God raiſed from the dead the third day, and exalted to be a Prince

Chap.</hi> 5. 30, 31, 34.</p>
            <p>But a <hi>Quaker</hi> pretends, that the ſpirit witneſſeth in his Conſcience,
that there is a light within him, which is the true Chriſt and only Saviour,
which is not the Man Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> never ſlew, nor
hanged upon a tree, nor was ever raiſed by God from a bodily death.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>The ſpirit witneſſeth in the Scripture:</hi> That he is a Righteous
man, who walketh in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 16.</p>

               </hi> that
(after the Fall) the Word of God was manifeſted to <hi>Adam</hi> and his wiſe,

            <p>Note here, that the words which the Father gave to Chriſt, and
Chriſt to his Apoſtles, they believed, and (ſo believing) Preached
them to the World: the Subſtance whereof is in their written Goſpel,
and Epiſtles: which is to true Chriſtians, the Word of God, and the
ground of their Faith, but ye (Soul-deceivers) labour to diſſolve this

Idolized Light, hath no more real blood in it, then there is in the

            <p>Reply, <hi>To the firſt Scripture,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. And the Lord God formed Man
of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his Noſthrils the breath of life,
and Man became a living Soul: <hi>hence they argue, that the Soul (in this
life) is God in part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. It is to be noted; That in the former part of the verſe, we
have the Creation of <hi>Adams</hi> body: <hi>The Lord God formed Man,</hi> that is he

with all his outward limbs and lineaments in their due places, without;
and Veins, Arteries, Venticles, and Bowels in their due places within.</p>
            <p>2. The Creation of Mans Soul is deſcribed, <hi>i. e.</hi> breathed into his
noſthrils, (which <hi>Syn<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

life: Go<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s order herein is very obſervable; <hi>ſc.</hi> after the Lord had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his body, he gives in (not himſelf in, but) from himſelf the Soul:
here's the nature of Gods act [<hi>Breathed</hi>] it is ſpoken after the manner
of men, for as God hath no hands to form, ſo nor mouth to breathe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo
that hereby muſt be meant, Gods powerful Creation of his Body, and
infuſion of his Soul: which God doth as eaſily, as man breathes: But
to the matter in hand;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Divine Being is infinite and indiviſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> therefore the Soul of
man cannot be God, either in whole or in part.</p>
            <p>2. The words being ſpoken after the manner of men: that is to ſay as
the breath of Man, is not man in whole or in part, but only from him; ſo
the Soul being breathed, is only from God by infuſion.</p>
            <p>3. The Soul of Man was made after Gods Image, <hi>Gen. 1. 26. And God
ſaid, let</hi> [Us] <hi>make man in our (ſc.</hi> the Father, through the Son, by the
Spirit) <hi>Image, after our likeneſs,</hi> i. e. in our Image, moſt like to (not the
ſame with) us. It is an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> noting a ſuperlative Image, moſt
like the <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This image or likeneſs ſtands in repreſenting God three wayes.</p>
            <p>1. It is a made Image. 2. It is a true Image. 3. It is very near
and likely Image, which appears not only in the ſpiritual and immortal
nature of it, but in rectitude of Mind, Will, Affections, Members, all
pure and righteous, conformed to Gods will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. which evidently
proves, that the Soul cannot be God the Creator, it being made as above,
it muſt be a Creature, and conſequently a created ſubſtance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not (after a <hi>Quakers</hi> groſs and abſurd manner of ſpeaking) God in
whole, or in part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> When God breathed into <hi>Adams</hi> liveleſs body, he breathed not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45964:52"/>
himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he was there before: for, God is in every thing excluded
out of nothing, as before evidenced; whence, it undeniably follows, that
into <hi>Adam</hi>'s liveleſs body, God breathed not himſelf, but mans reaſonable
Soul, which is mans proper form, and without it, Man is not a Man: So
much for the firſt Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Scripture,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 7. Then ſhall the duſt return to the
Earth, as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it: <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence,
they argue,</hi> The Soul of Man is God in part, for God is a Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. Though God be a Spirit, yet every Spirit is not God, An
Angel is a Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, but not God; ſo, though the Soul be a Spirit
yet it is a made Spirit, as afore obſerved; likewiſe hereunto agrees, <hi>Iſai.</hi>
57. 16. <hi>For the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made:</hi>
Souls are of Gods making, and therefore a created (not uncreated) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
beſides, to ſay, that God is a Spirit, and the Soul of Man is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
therefore the Soul is part of Gods eſſence, is not only falſe but a moſt
ſilly inference: for there is multiplicity of ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fication in words, and
here lies the fallacy: <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſometimes ſignifie God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the wind, <hi>Ionah</hi> 3. 8. Now, its no good inference thence, therefore
God and the Wind are the ſame: howbeit, here is ſome of a <hi>Quakers
Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The ſcope and import of the Text it ſelf above, excludes this their
Interpretation: <hi>For.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. When its ſaid, the <hi>Spirit ſhall return,</hi> it notes, a paſſing from one
place to another, which cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God: for that
being infinite, filleth all places at once.</p>
            <p>2. To God that gave it: Now according to the Rules of right reaſon,
the <hi>Giver</hi> and the <hi>Gift</hi> are diſtinct.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>When the Duſt</hi> (the body) <hi>returns to the Earth, then the Spirit</hi> (the
Soul) <hi>ſhall return to God:</hi> that is, to Gods only and alone diſpoſing,
either to Weal or to Woe, for Eternity, <hi>according to what it hath done in
the body, whether it be good or evil, 2 Cor.</hi> 5 10. in this ſenſe it is that the
Soul returns to God; which Truth, the Scripture points us unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as with
the finger; in the examples of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> (Luk. 16. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to affirm, the Soul returns to <hi>God,</hi> as a part of God, is abſurd and
ſinful with a witneſs: for it renders God defective, till the Soul returns,
<hi>making him a finite, not an infinite God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Scripture,</hi> Act. 17. 27, 28. Though he be not far from every

               <hi>Reply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I have already and fully granted, that the <hi>Eſſential preſence of God,</hi>
is in Heaven and Earth, and all created natures: yet I do herewithal
ſay, though all created Natures are in his, and his in theirs: but yet his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45964:52"/>
uncreated nature, and their created natures are ever diſtinct and different;
<hi>theirs</hi> finite and bounded, <hi>his</hi> infinite and boundleſs, not included in, nor
excluded out of any thing; for God is infinitely beyond their beings,
lives, and motions, where never any created nature was, nor ever ſhall be,
otherwiſe he is not God infinite: furthermore the very Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
above alledged, confutes their inference, for it expreſly ſaith, <hi>God is

            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> 1. This place of Scripture, doth only ſignifie, that the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

this; namely, that they partake of the divine Nature, who are partakers
of the grace and peace promiſed: theſe being divine qualities, are of a
divine Nature, called the <hi>Communion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 14. If
this be the genuine and proper ſenſe of the Text; how far is it from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Soul of man to be part of God; To clear this matter yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

            <p>2. The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> may be taken in a twofold ſenſe; as</p>

as they do agree with the infallible Spirit within him, juſt ſo, the

            <p>Of which robbery (in reference to Chriſts <hi>Prieſtly Office</hi>) the <hi>Quakers</hi>
are equally guilty: for, they give to their light (that <hi>Maſſe-Prieſt</hi>) with

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be ſaid, the plural number [<hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth ſo; but when God hath determined plurality to three,
it is time then to ſettle, and to be certain, that there are no more, which
is confirmed, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Baptizing in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> that is, to believe in, obey and worſhip the
Father, in the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: here you ſee, are three in the
divine Nature, that do live underſtand, will and act; and here, its plainly
revealed, that they are ſo diſtinct, that the one cannot be the other.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>Socinians</hi> (the <hi>Quakers Brethren</hi> in this thing) do deny the
Holy Ghoſt to be a perſon; and ſay, <hi>It is the power, vertue, and efficacy of
God the Father:</hi> if ſo then the Scripture above, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. muſt be read
thus, <hi>Baptizing them in</hi> (or unto) <hi>the Name of the Father, of the Son;
and of the vertue, power, and efficacy of the Father</hi> (to be believed in, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
and worſhipped) which ſounds abſurdly, utterly diſagreeable to
reaſon: But above all, it is inconſiſtent with the Scriptures of truth, as in
<hi>Ioh. 1. 4. And the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld
his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father:</hi> and in ver. 18. <hi>No
man hath ſeen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, which is in the boſome
of the Father, he hath declared him:</hi> and in <hi>Iohn 14 26. But the Comforter,
which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name:</hi> Theſe
Texts of Holy Scripture do ſhew us, that the Father begets the Son, the
Son is begotten of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from both?
Furthermore, when the Lord Chriſt was Baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 15, 16, 17. the
Father was heard and not ſeen, the Holy Ghoſt (in the form of a Dove)
ſeen and not heard: and Chriſt the Son both ſeen and heard: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſaying of Chriſt, this is my Son; and the Holy Ghoſt deſcending
and lighting upon him, which is a moſt clear demonſtration of their real
and perſonal dictinction.</p>
            <p>Again, in 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 7. For there are three that bear Record in Heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one:</hi> Now if they
be three, then they muſt be (in ſome reſpect) more then one, and not
the ſame; beſides it argues weakneſs to quarrel the Phraſe [<hi>Perſons,</hi>]
for as much as the [<hi>Perſon</hi>] doth <hi>Grammatically (tria neceſſaria ſunt, ut
aliquid perſona dicatur</hi>) ſignifie, firſt, ſecond and third, which makes three,
this only by the bye, for illuſtration rather then evidence: though we do
not find this Phraſiology in the Scriptures, <hi>ſc.</hi> Trinity of Perſons: yet
this is not a ſufficient ground to deny it; for though we have not the
words, yet having the things ſignified, in and by the words, it ought to
ſatisfie a rational Saint: as for the things ſignified, the Texts above, are
fair and plain: affirming <hi>there are three that bear Record</hi> (or witneſs) now
to bear witneſs, is properly the office and act of a perſon, or perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, are declared as
three diſtinct witneſſes?</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, that they are ſo may appear by the teſtimony of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Joh. 8 18. I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and the Father ſent
me beareth witneſs of me,</hi> and Joh. 15. 26. <hi>But when the Comforter is
come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Futher, even the Spirit of
truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me:</hi> here, we
have the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, witneſſing; that is to ſay, the
