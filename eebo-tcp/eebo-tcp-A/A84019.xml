            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Engliſh Man's Complaint.</head>
            <p>IF <hi>Kings</hi> were as wife and good as their Office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to be, <hi>Monarchy,</hi> certainly, would be the happieſt Form of Government in the World; but ſince experience tells us they are like us in all things, <hi>Kingſhip</hi> excepted, and are for the moſt part but the <hi>worſe</hi> for. That, it has been the Wiſdom of all Nations to take the beſt caution and ſecurity of them for their freedoms that they could get. This, I and many more expected at the hands of our <hi>Senators,</hi> after not only the <hi>harms</hi> of others, but our <hi>own</hi> might have taught them how to make uſe of ſo happy an oppertunity; but as leſs then a years time has ſhown us the vanity of our hopes in them, I preſume they are not leſs inſtructed of the vanity of their own in him, it being viſible, to all the thinking World, that he is not able to ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf three Months longer, upon the meaſures he takes, between <hi>King James</hi> and a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> for one of them will be quickly too hard for him, and only one of them can prevent the other. And becauſe no man has had a greater Sence of this Providence then my ſelf, and that I have been perticularly converſant with thoſe that went into this abdicating Intereſt, I find my ſelf touch'd in duty and honour to be early and free with them upon the Jealouſies that fill my Heart; and the Hearts of many good Men, about the preſent ſtate of our affaires.</p>
            <p>They have been guilty of ſins, both of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion:</hi> They have neglected the main things they ought to have made the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of this change, and they have viſibly acted the quite contrary. And laſt of all, ſeveral things have happened, both at home and abroad, that render the continuance of our preſent Goverment impractable; therefore we muſt not only ſuffer, but ſeek another ſtate or change, and that ſpeedily. The faults of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> are theſe; they have made a King, but have not made it impoſſible for that King to be like the Kings that went before him, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame power over the Rights of the People, and they lying as open to the mercy and ſtroke of ambition, and arbitrary Power as before, which is only changing of Hands, and not Things; Men, and not Meaſures and Securities. That this is the caſe, let it be conſidered he is <hi>unaccountable,</hi> which contradicts their Principles they choſe him upon. He has the <hi>ſame Power over Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> that his Predeceſſors had, which are accounted the <hi>true Conſervators</hi> of the Peoples freedoms. Their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are as <hi>inſecure</hi> as ever. Their Meetings as <hi>uncertain,</hi> being neither <hi>Yearly, Duenneally</hi> nor <hi>Triennially.</hi> Neither are they <hi>Maſters</hi> of their own Seſſions, to <hi>Adjourn</hi> and <hi>Prorogue</hi> as they pleaſe. And if they have prepared the moſt uſeful or neceſſary Law in the World, as the caſe now ſtands, <hi>he may refuſe to paſs it,</hi> by Proroguing or Diſſolving them, which renders the whole Conſtitution of Parliaments precarious, and at his <hi>Will and Pleaſure.</hi> Much leſs does the Parliament <hi>nominate his Council,</hi> or is he oblig'd to act in the Intervals of Parliaments by the Advice and Approbation of a Council; but on the contrary to theſe Rights and Securities, he can <hi>call, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue</hi> and <hi>diſſolve Parliaments at pleaſure,</hi> whoſe very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections lie as open to Fraud &amp; Violence as ever; Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; Corporations being in no better condition then they were. He <hi>picks</hi> and <hi>chuſes</hi> his Council. He <hi>Names</hi> all the great Officers of the <hi>State, Navy, Army and Church,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Houſhold;</hi> and he abſolutely commands the Malitia, as yet; which is having the <hi>whole</hi> in his Power, for thereby he has a <hi>Mortgage</hi> upon every man; the <hi>Gain</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> of his Office being a <hi>Bribe</hi> to byaſs him to the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the Prince: That already they have not been able to keep themſelves from the diſtinction of <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> party, who the other day objected it to their Enemies as a Vice in Government. This has ſomething in it very abſurd, and it reproaches the honeſty or underſtanding of ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that when they ſay they can <hi>make</hi> Kings, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>can't</hi> or <hi>won't</hi> take care to limit and regulate them to our Safety: by which means the King, that is made by the People, may rule <hi>without them,</hi> inſtead of ruling <hi>for them,</hi> and govern <hi>jure divino,</hi> though he be created <hi>jure humano,</hi> which renders his execution <hi>Independent</hi> of his Commiſſion, and himſelf in all things <hi>impunible.</hi> We have herein <hi>left the Principles</hi> that lead us to leave <hi>King James</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> the very meaſures upon which we changed the Government. We made uſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican</hi> Reaſons for our alteration, and, for ought I ſee, we go upon <hi>Tory</hi> methods to eſtabliſh it. This renders our caſe much worſe then it was in the time of <hi>King Charles</hi> and <hi>King James;</hi> in that then we had Kings that were ſuſpected, to be ſure not belov'd, and the firſt not feared from his humour, and the laſt, at last as little apprehended from his Intereſt: But this Gentleman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the Reputation of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and has our <hi>own choice</hi> &amp; Religion both to blind us, &amp; bind us. Being there more popular, and not <hi>more limited, we are not more ſafe,</hi> but our Liberties more expoſed: And unleſs ſuch a King has <hi>irreſiſtable Grace,</hi> or ſtronger tyes upon him, the Reaſons of our preferring him may be the Inſtances of our danger. Let theſe ſerve as brief hints of the pernitious <hi>Omiſſions</hi> we have made, about the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Government, and give me leave now to point at our Sins of Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort the <hi>Suſpenſion of the Habeas Corpus</hi> act will challange the preference. It is what can never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by us <hi>Whiggs,</hi> to ſtab ſuch a Law, nay, our own Law three times ſucceſſively. In this the <hi>Toryes</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted us, for they have humoured us into a <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of our own Principles. Next, it has been a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Error, that ſo many <hi>Members</hi> of bath Houſes have ſo faſt and ſo firmly got into <hi>Places of Profit.</hi> This is a Scandal to the Cauſe, our old Clamours and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions conſidered; and all the World ſees the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it has had to ſtifle this Reformation in its very birth, Suffering ſo many <hi>Foreign Troops</hi> that are the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinaries</hi> of this Prince, to continue amongſt us, and more come in upon us, when there are ſo many moderate Church-men and Diſſenters, of unqueſtionable valour and ſincerity, ready to ſerve in their Station, purely for the ſake of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and a <hi>National Intereſt,</hi> is both unjuſt, unwiſe and unſafe. It was likewiſe a fatal Error to be buſie in ſending ten or twelve Thouſand men into <hi>Holland,</hi> before we ſent twelve Hundred into <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſhows ſome Body's heart is as <hi>Foreign</hi> as his Birth. Juſt ſo we have done by <hi>Sea;</hi> been buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Fleet, and careleſs of our Trade, that as a witty Member of the Houſe of Commons ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Dutch <hi>have run away with our Trade, and the</hi> French <hi>with our Ships, notwithſtanding our Fleet.</hi> It is certain they left <hi>Breſt</hi> when they ſhould have ſtaid there (by which means the <hi>French</hi> joyned their Fleets) &amp; are come home, when there is moſt uſe of them abroad, whereby the French are left to ſcour our Seas. Many are employed that either do not understand their buſineſs, or are not in our Intereſt, becauſe they can give moſt Money. <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> eſpecially, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> have been quarter'd upon private Houſes, and Gentlemen's Seats have not eſcaped them. <hi>Martial Law</hi> has been executed <hi>to Death,</hi> before
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:133263:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Act paſſed. <hi>Schombergh</hi> ſent too ſoon, ſince he went ſo late, unleſs he had carried his <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Proviſions</hi> with him, and while we have entertain'd the World with an Opinion that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> will not fight, we at laſt decline to fight the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and have loſt our Army.</p>
            <p>But theſe are little Errors, and lie remotely, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of ſome that affect the very center or head of our Affairs. The <hi>King</hi> himſelf ſhews us he is <hi>infected</hi> with <hi>Dominion,</hi> and that by two broad inſtances, <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>his Miniſters at home.</hi> For he has not only already <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> the very Fundamentals of the Conſtitution of that Kingdom he ſwore to maintain, when he received that Crown, but <hi>huff's</hi> thoſe men of Quality that came up from that Nation to repreſent the breach of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon which he took the Crown. And for the preſent <hi>Miniſters</hi> of his Government here, the very naming of them, is giving the Reaſon, both for the Sins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion:</hi> And indeed how ſhould we hope to have our Liberties eſtabliſh'd under them, who in the late Reigns were the Authors of the Miſeries we call'd in this <hi>Prince</hi> in hopes to be delivered from; and by what we have already ſeen of their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt conclude they have either a <hi>King James</hi> in their Belly, or in their Hearts, the Principles of making <hi>more</hi> then a King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>King William.</hi> And truly they have carried him a good way towards it, when they have made him afraid of protecting that gallant Gentleman, <hi>Lievtenant General Ludlow,</hi> becauſe for ſooth, he was a <hi>Common-wealths-man, &amp; one of the Judges of King</hi> Charles <hi>the firſt,</hi> though upon his Principles, we have <hi>abdicated</hi> the Son, which is to refuſe him the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Reaſons, upon which we pretend to ſave our ſelves. This makes me believe a Story of this King, which I was even ſorry to hear, that upon ſome Bodies telling him t'other day, the <hi>Common-wealths-men</hi> began to be very buſie, he ſhould ſay, <hi>Let me alone with them, for after I came into the Government of</hi> Holland, <hi>they never could do any thing:</hi> And it is certain, his party were the <hi>Tories</hi> of that State.</p>
            <p>But it is not only <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Errors that make me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, though they are enough to ſink this Government, but the very Nation is in hazard, in reference to our Affairs abroad, more then ever; and I would not, while we reproach the Governments that went before us, that we ſhould do worſe for the Common Safety. What condition we are in as to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the charge it has been to the People, and how much greater it is like to be, and that we have now a more Melancholly proſpect of the Concluſion of the War then we had ſix Months ago, are felt as well as ſeen. I need not tell my Country-men, that our Intereſt is grounded upon Trade, and that whatever leſſens that, leſſens us; and that, that Country that rivals us in that point, <hi>is our Enemy by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and we can hardly have a greater: But perhaps it may ſurprize them, to tell them at this time, that <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is that Country: But ſo it is, and the indifferent World ſees it, and even the Partial amongſt us, begin to <hi>feel</hi> it. It would have been the Wiſdom of this King as ſoon as he became ſo, to have conſider'd <hi>his Intereſt changed</hi> upon his being ſo. Inſtead of that, we have ever ſince had our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt govern'd by <hi>Dutch Councils,</hi> and we have felt the effects of it; which our Enemies are ſure to improve to our diſhonour and danger; as if we had deliver'd up the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> inſtead of making that Country an <hi>Hand-maid,</hi> to her gteatneſs. And truly it is a ſcurvy Dilemma, that we are brought into, that we cannot hope for peace with <hi>France,</hi> nor to be long at Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> and keep our Trade, nor to ſupport a War with both, if to out-live our own Factions: and this the <hi>Dutch</hi> know as well as we, and therefore, you ſee, <hi>they Looſe no time,</hi> but make the War their great gain: For as we let them manage it they add <hi>Our ſhare</hi> to their own: This is the language of all Ports, both abroad and at home. <hi>Sink</hi> therefore we must, when our Friends help to do it, and the King we have made, will not ſee it. If this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality proceeded only from the ſence he has of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the <hi>States</hi> have ſhown him, one would hope it were but to be once done; but I am told there is more in it; that he intends to purchaſe them to himſelf at our Coſt, for a worſe purpoſe, viz, an <hi>unreaſonable greatneſs:</hi> and it falls pat with the <hi>Dutch</hi> intereſt, for with them, it is a Maxim, <hi>the leſs we are free, the leſs they have to fear;</hi> nothing being more <hi>cavileer</hi> in England then a <hi>Dutch Republican.</hi> This, if I know any thing, compleats our miſery, that we are got into a War, for the ſake, of a Country that, is, <hi>in reaſon of State,</hi> the moſt; firm ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to our Liberties at home and our Traffick abroad, and that will only be of our ſide as long as we let them go away with our Trade; but the hour we ſhow, we underſtand them, we may depend upon it, they will make up with <hi>France,</hi> and leave us in the lunch. It is not enough that the <hi>parliament</hi> will give mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; I do not doubt that; but that, may be our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery as it may be given. Let us firſt conſider, <hi>for what we give it?</hi> it will be ſaid, to pull down <hi>France;</hi> But that is the <hi>Emperors</hi> work, whoſe Competitor he is, and not ours. But as things now move, ſhall not we ſet up <hi>Holland,</hi> that is our Competitor every where, and in every thing? <hi>Taxes</hi> muſt riſe heavily upon ſuch proſpects of our Affairs. There is in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion a nearer way to the Mill then all this, and I think the only one <hi>Let the Parliament but make it plain to the People, that they have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Change, and I will paſs my word for them, they will be at the charge of it;</hi> But that they ſhould aſſiſt ſuch a Revolution, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Perſons to all hazards, and their Eſtates to the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that will follow it, and at laſt ſit down with a leſs Trade abroad, and with ſomething worſe then the worſt part of <hi>King Charles</hi> the ſecond's Reign at home, is, I hope, too groſs to paſs upon the Nation. They that long ſince owed their Heads to the Publick, muſt not now think to ſet up for the <hi>Guides</hi> of it. The reflection of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weath</hi> is too ſtale a Calumny to put a zealous &amp; juſt claim of Rights out of countenance.</p>
            <p>It was flung at the brave <hi>Lord Ruſſel,</hi> &amp; at all the <hi>Patroons</hi> &amp; <hi>Martyrs</hi> of the people, but in vain are their <hi>Attainders reverſed,</hi> while their <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are impeached.</hi> That a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> ſhould be an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now, to ſuch a ſettlement of our Freedoms as can only ſave us, is a moſt ſevere One againſt the Goverment, eſpecially when the ſame Gentlemen have the Power of making it, that made it once before. We can go upon no other Principles, except we will ſet up that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrery Power</hi> we have ventur'd all to oppoſe. Nick-names muſt not ſcare us, nor vain Flatteries abuſe us: <hi>We muſt have our Liberties,</hi> or ſhift for our ſelves, and that quickly, before he brings in more Foreign Forces upon us. A Reproach we can never wipe off, that what we objected againſt King <hi>James,</hi> ſhould be endured from a Stranger in ſo diftruſtful a manner, and a Parliament fitting, unconſulted. I will end with this Queſtion;</p>
            <p>Is it not a <hi>breach</hi> of publick Faith and Safety, for a Prince, of his own Head to call in Foreign Force to rule a People, that called him in but t'other day to rule and protect them by their own Laws &amp; Arms? It ſhows a plain diſſolution of Truſt and Confidence in the People, that truſted him, as well as a Violation of the Conditions of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And if ſo, are not the Obligations of the People diſcharged? nay, are they not obliged before God and Man, to take ſpeedy care of their own future Safety one way or other? Now or Never.</p>
