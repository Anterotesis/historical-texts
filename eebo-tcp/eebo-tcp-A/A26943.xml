            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </head>
            <p>THou art deſired to conſider, That the Reaſon why
the Author of theſe Papers has given thee the
Judgment of <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> againſt communicating
with the Pariſh-Aſſemblies, as by Law required, is to
undeceive thoſe who think, that he has been of late writing
<hi>for it;</hi> whereas that which he hath written does hold
good only on Suppoſition, the Pariſh Aſſemblies are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
Churches, independent on the <hi>Dioceſane
Biſhop,</hi> who is for our holding Communion with them only
as ſuch.</p>
            <p>It has very much grieved the Author to ſee how
many have been led from their Principles by ſome men,
who though otherwiſe Diſſenters, have ſince the late vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Execution of the <hi>paenal Laws,</hi> not only gone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Church, but done their beſt to engage Others
to do ſo too; and to that end have obſerved the Rule
of the <hi>Polititian,</hi> To <hi>preſs the Examples and Practices
of ſome Eminent Men, as a good means to draw
on the reſt.</hi> Thus have they publiſhed the Names of
<hi>Nye, Robinſon, Owen,</hi> and <hi>Goodwin</hi> to countenance
their Commnnicating with the <hi>Pariſh Aſſemblies</hi> in the
<hi>Liturgy-Worſhip,</hi> which is manifeſt Abuſing thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:66265:3"/>
Perſons, while they are made to plead for a Practice they
Diſavow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Deſigne of the Publiſher of</hi> Mr. Nye, Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp;c. (<hi>as he himſelf profeſſeth</hi>) Is as well to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thoſe that ſcruple Communion with the Church
[<hi>To wit,</hi> with the Pariſh Aſſemblies in their Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-Worſhip]
as to vindicate thoſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed;
<hi>whereas there is not one of theſe men that ſpake
a word in favour of</hi> Pariſh Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Nye</hi>'s and <hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi>'s Rapers are <hi>ONLY</hi>
for the Lawfulneſs of Hearing the <hi>Conformiſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
preach, not for Communicating with the Pariſh in
their <hi>Liturgy-Worſhip.</hi> Beſides, it muſt be noted,
That what they wrote was confined to private Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,
until ſome Years after their Death, and never,
it may be, deſigned for publick view. And the Author
of <hi>A ſpeedy Remedy againſt Spiritual Incontinency,</hi>
pag. 4. doth aſſure us, <q>
                  <hi>That at</hi> Leyden, Mr. Robinſon
<hi>being confuted in the preſence of above Three
Hundred People, did revoke his Opinion about</hi>
Hearing, <hi>and acknowledged that</hi> Hearing <hi>was a
ſinful partaking with that Miniſtry.</hi>
               </q> That this was
Nine Years before <hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi>'s Death, and that
<hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi>'s Papers were not publiſhed in ſome
years after his Death, and had not been publiſhed then
neither, had they not through Inadvertency eſcaped the
Flames, and fell into the hands of an Inverterate Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
who printed them. Soon after they were printed, <hi>Mr
Cann</hi> wrote an Anſwer; notwithſtanding which, theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Papers are now Re-publiſhed, and <hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
urged to juſtifie the <hi>LAWFULNESS</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66265:3"/>
Communicating with the Pariſh Aſſemblies in the Liturgy-Worſhip.</p>
            <p>In like manner, <hi>Dr. Owen,</hi> who did grant that
Forms of Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, <hi>in Theſi,</hi> may be lawful, is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as an Approver of the Lawfulneſs of the impoſed
Liturgy and Ceremonies in particular; than which there
cannot be a greater Abuſe.</p>
            <p>Dr. Goodwin <hi>likewiſe, after the</hi> Dioceſane Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
<hi>was laid aſide, did ſay,</hi> 
               <q>That in ſome of the
Pariſhes <hi>in</hi> this Kingdom there are many Godly
Men, that do conſtantly give up themſelves to the
Worſhip of God in publick, and meet together
in <hi>one place,</hi> to that end in a conſtant Way, under
a Godly Miniſtry, whom they themſelves have
choſen to cleave unto (though they did not chuſe
him at firſt) Theſe (<hi>ſaith the Doctor</hi>) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their Mixture, and want of Diſcipline, I
never thought for my part, <hi>but that they were true
Churches of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Siſter Churches,</hi> and ſo ought
to be acknowledged; And as for holding Communion
with them, I ſay, as <hi>Siſter-Churches, occaſionally,</hi> as
Strangers, men might hold Communion with them.</q>
               <hi>So far</hi> Dr. Goodwin.</p>
            <p>Note here, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That he deſcribes a Church, which
for its kind is <hi>Congregational,</hi> though in it there is a
Mixture and want of Diſcipline. His Diſcourſe is of a
<hi>compleat Congregational Church,</hi> not of an <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi>
part of the <hi>Dioceſane.</hi> 2<hi>dly.</hi> He writes for
our acknowledging 'em to be <hi>Siſter Churches,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with them occaſionally as Strangers; but
ſpeaks not of our communicating with ſuch Pariſh-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
as are of the Dioceſane Frame, nor of fixing
<pb facs="tcp:66265:4"/>
our Communion there, as the Law now requires. 3<hi>dly,</hi>
He inſiſts only on the <hi>Faultineſs</hi> of <hi>Mixture,</hi> and <hi>want</hi>
of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> not on the <hi>Liturgy-Worſhip,</hi> which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evinceth that he meant it of the <hi>Presbyterian
Congregations,</hi> which had no Liturgy; not of the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copals</hi>
which have. For whoever conſults what he has
in his Expoſition on the <hi>Revelations,</hi> will find enough that
ſhews how much he was againſt the Liturgy-Worſhip. But yet
this Doctor's Judgment muſt be produced for the juſtifying
our communicating with the Pariſh-Aſſemblies, that are but
incompleat parts of a Dioceſane ſingle Church in their
Liturgy-Worſhip, as by Law required.</p>
            <p>Much after the ſame manner doth the Reverend Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> deal with us, when he refers us to the Judgment
of the <hi>Old Nonconformiſts,</hi> who though they were for
Communion with the Pariſh Aſſemblies then in being,
yet eſteemed the Dioceſane kind of Churches, Miniſtry
and Ceremonies to be <hi>Violations</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> And as to
the controverted Ceremonies (for inſtance, <hi>Kneeling at
the Sacrament) Mr. Baxter</hi> knows best how much he
differs from ſeveral of them, to whom he refers us; for
they aſſert theſe Ceremonies to be <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and
<hi>Idolatrous.</hi> But <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> notwithſtanding the high
Applauſes he gives 'em, has openly relinquiſhed their
Doctrine, and fallen in with <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſe,</hi>
having alſo eſpouſed that very Diſtinction of <hi>Primary</hi>
and <hi>Secondary</hi> Worſhip, which they received from
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez;</hi> the inſufficiency whereof has
been long a go detected by Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Reply</hi> and
<hi>Freſh Suite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66265:4"/>
Moreover, it must be obſerved, that <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> has
not given us ſo full and diſtinct a ſtate of the preſent
Controverſie, between him and thoſe he calls Separatiſts,
as was neceſſary; for, <hi>his Diſcourſes for Communion
with the Pariſh-Aſſemblies, without fuller Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
will (as now they are) be generally taken
as if he meant it of the Pariſh Aſſemblies by Law
eſtabliſhed, which are in a kind deſtructive of
Chriſt's Churches, Miniſtry and Diſcipline,</hi> as
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> himſelf avers; whereby the weaker ſort
miſtaking <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> are induced to conclude the
eſtabliſhed Conſtitution to be good. But what is this leſs
than the caſting a ſtumbling Block in the way of his weak
Brethren?</p>
            <p>Theſe things then being ſo, 'tis become neceſſary that
ſome-what be done to undeceive the World; and ſeeing
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> is the Perſon on whoſe Authority moſt
of thoſe Diſſenters who are now for <hi>Pariſh Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
do lean, I have thought it expedient to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them an impartial ſtate of <hi>Mr. Baxter's</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I find it in ſome of his late Writings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with thoſe Reaſons that he doth furniſh us with,
(as Arrows which we may gather up to ſhoot back upon
him) againſt <hi>communicating</hi> with the Pariſh Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
as by Law required. The giving a juſt Account
of <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s Judgment againſt <hi>Pariſh-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
is, I acknowledge, but <hi>Argumentum ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
adapted chiefly for the ſilencing <hi>Mr. Baxter;</hi>
but the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that are couched in what is given
out of <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> are more than ſo, and ſuch as
muſt receive another Anſwer than meerly the ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:66265:5"/>
That <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> is grown wiſer, and hath changed his
Judgment; for until <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> or ſome other do
validly anſwer what <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> has ſaid in his <hi>Five
Diſputations</hi> againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
and in his late Treatiſe againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> what I
have here urged will abide in its ſtrength, and carry

            <p>THere has been of late no little ſtir about going to
the Pariſh Aſſemblies, and communicating with
them in their Liturgy-Worſhip, and in ſpecial
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> hath been warmely engaged in the <hi>Defence,</hi>
(as he himſelf will have it) of his own, and the Practice of
thoſe that are for Pariſh-Communion, and cannot ſuffer a
little Manuſcript, ſaid to be <hi>Dr. Owens,</hi> to eſcape his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions
and Oppoſition. It is at this time no part
of my Province to examine <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Dr.
Owen</hi>'s Arguments; I call the Manuſcript <hi>Dr. Owens,</hi>
not only becauſe common Fame directs me to do ſo, but
becauſe in the Arguments there is the Doctor's
wonted <hi>Accuracy</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi> There are very many
Scripture-Reaſons couch'd in a few Lines, and ſuch as
are too ſtrong to receive any harm from <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s
Anſwer, as I could by divine Aſſiſtance clearly evince: but
at this time it ſhall be no part of my Work. In this,
my aim is to ſhew, <hi>What it is Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>is really for,</hi> that
he is <hi>as much againſt holding Communion with the Pariſh-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
as by Law required,</hi> as thoſe are, againſt whom he
writes, and that we are furniſhed with unanſwerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<hi>againſt ſuch Pariſh-Communion,</hi> by <hi>Mr. Baxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much will be made very manifeſt to a common
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66265:6"/>
Capacity, by ſhewing what are <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s avowed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
about the <hi>Inſtitution, Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt's Churches,</hi> and what are the natural conſequences
of thoſe Principles he holds, and wherein lies the point,
in which he differs from his Brethren. In doing which I
will give you <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s ſence, for the moſt part in his
own words, directing you to the very pages of thoſe Books
of his I make uſe of.</p>
            <q>
               <p>§. 1. All Chriſtians (ſaith <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>) are agreed,
that Chriſt is the Author of the Univerſal Church (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
both as <hi>Baptized</hi> or <hi>Externally Covenanting,</hi> call'd
<hi>Viſible,</hi> and as <hi>Regenerate</hi> and <hi>ſincerely Covenanting,</hi> call'd,
<hi>Myſtical</hi>) as it is headed by Chriſt himſelf, and called his
Body and ſpecial Kingdom.</p>
               <p>§. 2. We doubt not but Chriſt has inſtituted the Office
of the ſacred <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> to be under him as a <hi>Teacher,
Ruler</hi> and <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> of the Church, in <hi>Teaching, Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Worſhipping,</hi> and that he has inſtituted <hi>holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
and <hi>Societies,</hi> for theſe things to be exerciſed in.
And that [a Society of <hi>Neighbour Chriſtians,</hi> aſſociated
with ſuch a <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Paſtors,</hi> for <hi>Perſonal Communion,</hi>
even in ſuch Doctrine, Diſcipline and Worſhip] is a
Church-form of divine Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>§. 3. We know not of any proof that ever was produced
that <hi>many</hi> Churches of the <hi>firſt Rank,</hi> muſt (of duty)
make <hi>one fixt greater Compound Church</hi> by Aſſociation,
whether <hi>Claſſical, Dioceſane, Provincial, Patriarchal</hi> or
<hi>National,</hi> and that God has inſtituted any ſuch form,
<hi>vide Mr.</hi> Baxter's <hi>Nonconformiſts plea for peace, p.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Chriſt has ſtated on the Paſtors of his Inſtituted
Churches, the Power of Teaching Aſſemblies, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſons of leading them in publick Worſhip, and
Sacraments, and of Judging by the power of the Keyes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66265:6"/>
whom to receive into their Communion by Baptiſm,
and profeſſion of Faith, and whom to admoniſh, and
for Obſtinate Impenitance reject; and this Inſtitution
none may Alter.</p>
               <p>§. 5. He has Inſtituted Ordinary Aſſemblies, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
particular Churches, as is aforeſaid, for theſe Holy
Exerciſes, and forbad all Chriſtians to forſake them,
and he and his Apoſtles, have appointed and ſeparated
the Lords day hereunto. None therefore may abrogate,
or ſuſpend thoſe Laws; all this is proved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19,
20. <hi>and</hi> 16. 19. <hi>and</hi> 18. 18, 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.
37, 38. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 36. <hi>and</hi> 22. 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> 24. 45, 46.

            </q>
            <p>
               <q>§. 6. The Dioceſane kind of particular Churches,
which has only One Biſhop over many ſcore or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fixed parochial Aſſemblies, I take (ſaith <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>)
to be it ſelf a Crime: Which in its very Conſtitution, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthroweth
the Office, Church and Diſcipline, which
Chriſt by himſelf, and his Spirit in his Apoſtles, Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
For 1. Pariſhes are made by them <hi>no Churches,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no ruling Paſtors, that have the power of judging
whom to Baptize, or admit to Communion, or Refuſe,
but only are Chappels, having preaching Curates. 2. All
the firſt Order of Biſhops in ſingle Churches are depoſed.
3. The Office of Presbiters, is changed into Semi-presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</q>
4. Diſcipline is made impoſſible; Mr. Baxter'<hi>s
Church Hiſtory of Biſhops and Council abridged,</hi> ch. 1. §. 54.
The like he affirms in his five Diſputa. of Church-Government,
<hi>pag.</hi> 19. <q>As to the eight ſort of Biſhops
(<hi>viz.</hi>) [The Dioceſane, who aſſumeth the ſole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66265:7"/>
of many Pariſh Churches, both <hi>Presbiters</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>]
as ten, or twelve, or twenty, or more, as they uſed
to do, even a whole Dioceſs, I take them (ſaith <hi>Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
to be <hi>Intollerable and Deſtructive to the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of the Church, and therefore not to be admitted
under Pretence of Order or Peace, if we can hinder them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>§. 7. This Dioceſane Church Government, being <hi>de
facto,</hi> eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom, the pariſh Aſſemblies
are not compleat particular Churches of the firſt Rank
and Order, they are but <hi>parts</hi> of a Dioceſane, which is <hi>de
facto,</hi> eſtabliſhed as a ſingle Church, <hi>Infime ſpeciei.</hi>
               </q> That
pariſh Aſſemblies are not particular Churches, is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> principles. For 1. <hi>That Cement which
is neceſſary to the being of a Church, is wanting.</hi> 
               <q>And it is
impoſſible (ſaith <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Cathol. Concord, p.</hi> 231.)
to be a Church without the <hi>Cement</hi> of <hi>Conſent.</hi> If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be forced into a Temple, not <hi>Conſenting,</hi> it is a <hi>Priſon,</hi>
they are not a <hi>Church</hi> if they <hi>Conſent</hi> only to Meet on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Occaſions,</hi> as for ſome <hi>Occaſional Act</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> it is
not thereby made a Church. If they be commanded to
conſent, and do not, and if it only be their Duty, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them not a Church, but only proveth that they
ought to be one:</q> So far <hi>Mr. Baxter.</hi> And it is manifeſt,
that in purſuance of <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Statute Law,</hi> the Pariſhes
are <hi>de facto,</hi> ſettled as parts of a Dioceſane Church; and
whoever joyn themſelves unto the Pariſh aſſemblies, as
by <hi>Law required,</hi> conſent to be of the Pariſh aſſembly, as
It is a part of the Dioceſane Church; this doth every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Minſter, who ſwears <hi>Canonical Obedience,</hi> that is,
Obedience to his Ordinary <hi>ſecundum Canones,</hi> and who is to
reſt ſo fully ſatisfied in the <hi>Dioceſane Government,</hi> as
to declare he will not endeavour, on any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the alteration of it. But to form the Pariſh aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66265:7"/>
into a compleat particular Church, is to make a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Alteration</hi> in the <hi>Dioceſane Conſtitution.</hi> Beſides
the <hi>Veſteries,</hi> who (as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ſaith) do after a ſort
repreſent the Pariſh Aſſembly, are alſo ſworn to the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſane
Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and therefore cannot be
juſtly interpreted to conſent to the Pariſh Aſſemblies, being
a compleat particular Church; Whatever conſent there is
between the Miniſter and People, it muſt be ſuppoſed to
be no other than what is agreeable to the <hi>Dioceſane Rule,
(i. e.)</hi> to be parts of the <hi>Dioceſane Church,</hi> taking none
for their Paſtor but the <hi>Dioceſane Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This <hi>Pariſh-Aſſembly</hi> doth not only want <hi>conſent</hi> to
make it a <hi>Church,</hi> but it has no <hi>Parochial Paſtor,</hi> though
the <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Flock</hi> are the eſſential conſtitutive parts of
a particular <hi>organiz'd Church,</hi> yet its not to be found in
our Pariſhes. <hi>It may be a Community</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mr. Baxter,
ubi ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.) without a Paſtor;</hi> not a <hi>Polity,</hi> not an <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Society.</hi> That the <hi>Pariſh Miniſter</hi> is not a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> is
manifeſt; for he is deprived of what is eſſential to the
<hi>Pastoral Office.</hi> This is evident (according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>) who diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>Old</hi>
and <hi>New Epiſcopacy,</hi> and who though he had more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thoughts of the <hi>Old</hi> than of the <hi>New,</hi> and knows
that the preſent is more like the <hi>new</hi> than the <hi>old,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
worſe; yet writing againſt the reſtoring the
Old, he lays down his fourth Argument thus,—
<q>4. That <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which degradeth all the <hi>Presbyters</hi>
in the Dioceſs, or cauſeth them to ſuſpend an Eſſential
part of their Office, is not to be reſtored under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the right Order of Peace.</q> But ſuch was the late
<hi>Engliſh Epiſcopacy;</hi> And in his <hi>Advertiſement</hi> to his <hi>Five Diſp.</hi>
p. 13, 14, &amp;c. to ſatisfie thoſe that make ſome doubt of
the truth of the <hi>Minor,</hi> he ſaith, <q>All men in <hi>England</hi> that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66265:8"/>
knew but twenty years ago what belonged to theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
are paſt doubt of it. And I have no mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
againſt them that contradict the common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Nation, as if they ſhould doubt whether
ever we had a King in <hi>England.</hi> 2. Read over the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and the yearly <hi>Viſitation Articles,</hi> which the
Church-Wardens ſwear to preſent by, before they had
ever read the Book, or heard what was in it. And then
judge, 3. Their Arguing for the <hi>ſole Juriſdiction of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
and that they only were <hi>properly Paſtors,</hi> and that
<hi>Presbyters</hi> had not the Key of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but of <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
is ſome Evidence.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>It is known to the Nation, that the Paſtors of the Pariſh-Churches
had no power by their Laws, (or ſufferance) to
caſtout any the moſt erroneous Sinner or Heretick from
the Church, nor to bring them to open confeſſion of their
ſin, nor to abſolve the Penitent, but by reading of their
Sentences, and publiſhing what they ſent from their
Courts, and conſequently could do nothing of all the
means hereunto; for the means cannot be uſed where
the end is known to be impoſſible. All the obſtinate
ſcandalous Perſons and ſcorners of a holy Life, we muſt
take as Members of our <hi>Churches,</hi> having no power to
caſt them out. Indeed we had the ſame Power as the
<hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> to put our Names to the Preſentments,
but a power of <hi>Accuſing</hi> to a <hi>Chancellors Court,</hi> is not a
Power of <hi>Governing,</hi> eſpecially when <hi>Piety,</hi> under the
Name of <hi>Preciſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Puritainiſm,</hi> was ſo hated and
perſecuted, that to have accuſed a man for meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs,
would have been ſo far from obtaining the
end, as that it was like to have been the undoing of the
Accuſer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But is not the power of Diſcipline given them in
their Ordination?</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66265:8"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> In their Ordination, the Biſhop ſaid to
them [<hi>Receive the holy Ghoſt, whoſe Sins thou doſt remit,
they are remitted; whoſe Sins thou dost retain, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi>]
and in the Book of Ordination it was asked them,
[<hi>Whether they would give their faithful Diligence alwayes to
adminiſter the Doctrine and Diſcipline of Christ, as the Lord
has commanded, and as the Realm has received the ſame,
according to the Commandments of God?</hi>] And the <hi>Rubrick</hi>
of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> enables the Curate to admoniſh
open and notorious evil Livers, by whom the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is offended; and thoſe that have wronged their
Neighbours, that they come not till they have openly
declared, <hi>That they have repented and amended.</hi> But,
1. This doth but ſerve to leave them inexcuſeable that
acknowledge Diſcipline to belong to the Office of a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
when yet he might not excuſe it. The Biſhops
in the Ordination of Presbyters enabled them to <hi>Preach
the Goſpel,</hi> and yet they were after that forbidden to
preach, <hi>till they had a Licence,</hi> and it was put into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation
Article, to preſent thoſe Miniſters, that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without a <hi>Licence.</hi> If they will deny us the exerciſe
of the power, that they firſt confeſs belongeth to our
Office, we are not anſwerable for, their ſelf-contradictions.
2. By <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> I ſuppoſe they mean but our Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and our publiſhing their Orders for Penance, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
or Abſolutions. 3. They were the Judges
of the ſence, of the Laws as far as the Execution requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the univerſal practice of <hi>England;</hi> which their
Writings ſhewed us, to our coſt, their Judgment; what
good would it do us, if the Law had been on our ſide,
while the Concurrent Judgment and Practice of the
Governours denied it, and went aganiſt it? 4. He that
has kept a man from the Sacrament, according to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66265:9"/>
plain Words of the Rubrick, was to have been acount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for it at their Courts, and ſo likely to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by it:</q> So far <hi>Mr. Baxter.</hi> Which ſufficiently ſhews
that the Pariſh Miniſter is in his Judgment degraded and
deprived of what is eſſential to the Paſtors Office; for by
taking from them the power of Church-Government they
deſtroy the very Office of the Presbyters; for Ruling is as
<hi>Eſſential</hi> to their Office as preaching; notwithſtanding
which, as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> proves, and expreſly aſſerts, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Epiſcopacy,</hi> taketh from the Presbyters the Power of
Church Governing; ſee his <hi>five Diſput. p.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>But if it had been only the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Pariſh Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
Power that had been ſuſpended, yet conſidering the
Suſpenſion is <hi>ſtatedly eſtabliſhed</hi> by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Life of the Miniſter, its a deſtroying his Office;
ſaith <hi>Mr. Baxter;</hi> 
               <q>Though an Office may be Unexerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for a time on ſome ſpecial Reaſon, yet if it be <hi>ſtatedly
ſuſpended,</hi> and that ſuſpenſion eſtabliſhed by <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
during the Life of the Miniſter; this is <hi>plainly</hi> a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying</hi>
or <hi>nulling</hi> the Office it ſelf, and not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</q>
And ſurely, the Exerciſe of the Paſtoral power
is <hi>ſtatedly</hi> ſuſpended, and the ſuſpenſion is by <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom</hi>
eſtabliſhed, during the Miniſters Life, and therefore the
Office is <hi>nulled</hi> and <hi>destroyed;</hi> that is, the pariſh Miniſter
is not a Paſtor, nor has the Pariſh Aſſembly any Paſtor, it
is not a particular Church.</p>
            <p>All this <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ſaith, of the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, and
yet thinketh that the preſent is much worſe than the Old.
In his ſecond <hi>Defence of the Nonconformiſts, p.</hi> 64. <hi>Dr.
Still.</hi> ſaying, <hi>That t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere is no other reaſon of our Separation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Terms of our Communion, than what was from
the beginning of the Reformation.</hi> Mr. Baxter <hi>Anſwers,</hi> 
               <q>To
ſay, that we grant that there are no more Reaſons now,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66265:9"/>
than were then, is <hi>too bold an untruth,</hi> there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(1.) From the <hi>Quality</hi> of the things impoſed (2.) From
the deſignes and drifts of the Impoſition. (3.) From the
effects. (4.) From the Aggravation of Conformity, as
in the Church that we muſt communicate with. (5.) From
the things which give us a <hi>fuller cauſe for our Preaching and
Aſſemblies, viz.</hi> The late general contrary Church ſtate
and Engagement to it, &amp;c. On theſe particulars <hi>Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
enlargeth; I will but juſt intimate what he ſaith on
ſome of them. (1.) As to things impoſed now which
were not then. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The <hi>Veſtry Act</hi> was not then made,
by which ſo conſiderable part of the Pariſh Churches as
the <hi>Veſtries</hi> are, are to renounce all Obligations, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any alteration of the Government of the Church,
from the Oath and Vow, called the Covenant; ſo that all
Reformation of Church Government, as ſo ſworn, was
renounced by them, who in a ſort repreſent the Pariſh
Church. 5. The Reordination of Miniſters, Ordained
by Presbyters, was not then required, and made a Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
condition of their Miniſtration and Church relation,
(even by them that confeſs Reordination Unlawful.) And
therefore Plainly intimateth the <hi>Nullity,</hi> of the firſt.—
9<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Word [<hi>Paſtor</hi>] as applyed to Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
diſtinct from [<hi>Curates</hi>] was not then blotted out
of moſt places in the Liturgies, nor the 20th of the
<hi>Acts,</hi> as applyed to <hi>Presbyters</hi> left out [<hi>Take heed to your
ſelves, and to the Flock &amp;c.</hi>] in plain deſign to <hi>Alter the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Pariſh Churches.</hi>
               </q> To all this let us add.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <q>That he that will hold <hi>Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church,</hi>
muſt conſent to the <hi>Miniſtry, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of
that <hi>Church,</hi> ſee <hi>Cathol. Concord, ubi ſupra.</hi>
               </q> So that he
that will Communicate with the Pariſh Aſſemblies muſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66265:10"/>
conſent to the <hi>Miniſtery, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of their
<hi>Aſſemblies;</hi> that is, he muſt conſent to the <hi>Dioceſane
Paſtor,</hi> to the <hi>Pariſh Semi-presbyters,</hi> and to the <hi>Pariſh
Aſſemblies,</hi> as being a part of the <hi>Dioceſane Church,</hi> and
to the <hi>Dioceſane Diſcipline;</hi> for <hi>de facto,</hi> this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and Frame of Pariſh Aſſemblies, they are but
parts of the Dioceſane Church, they are under no
other Paſtor but the Dioceſane Biſhop, have no other
Miniſter than a <hi>Semi-Presbyter,</hi> who wants what is
eſſential to the Paſtoral Office, and the Aſſembly
wants that <hi>Cement</hi> of <hi>conſent</hi> that is neceſſary to the
making e'm a compleat particular Church.</p>
            <p>This being ſo, <hi>May we by any Act or Deed contribute
to the fixing and eſtabliſhing the Dioceſane Epiſcopacy
amongſt us?</hi> I'll Anſwer according to ſound Reaſon,
in conjunction with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Principles: If
it were unlawful to reſtore the old Engliſh Epiſcopacy,
its unlawfull to give countenance and ſtrength to it,
once reſtored; for the ſtrengthening it, is but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the thing reſtored: and if we might not
lawfully help forward, nor conſent unto the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it, we may not lawfully fix it, when once
reſtored; for all theſe Miſchiefs that are ſaid to be
the Fruits of its Reſtoration, will be continued by a
fixing it.</p>
            <p>But according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> it was not lawful to
reſtore the Old <hi>Engliſh Prelacy,</hi> much leſs Lawful to
ſettle the New, which (he ſaith) is worſe. His Reaſons
are many, <hi>e. g.</hi> 
               <q>It deſtroys the end of Government,
and is certainly inconſiſtent with the neceſſary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Diſcipline, to be exerciſed in the Churches;
It unavoidably cauſeth Separations and Diviſions in
the Church; it degradeth all the Presbyters in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66265:10"/>
Dioceſs, and deſtroys and nulls their Office; it is the
product of <hi>proud Ambition</hi> and <hi>Arrogancy,</hi> contrary to
the expreſs command of Chriſt: It ſo far gratifieth
lazy Miniſters, as to eaſe them of the moſt painful
part of their Work: It is contrary to the Word of
God, and Apoſtolical Inſtitution, according to their
own Interpretation. Moreover, it <hi>gratifieth the Devil
and Wicked Men,</hi> not by an unavoidable Accident, but
by a <hi>natural Neceſſity;</hi>
               </q> therefore (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in
his <hi>five Diſput. pag.</hi> 32, to 50.) <q>not to be reſtored under
any pretence of the Order or Peace of the Church:</q>
And for the ſame Reaſon (ſay I, according to Mr.
<hi>Baxters</hi> principles) not to be complyed with, not to be
countenanced, not to be fixed and ſtrengthened by us,
though now reſtored. Though the Order and Peace
of the Church be pretended, yet we muſt do nothing
that countenanceth or ſtregthens the Engliſh Epiſcopacy,
we muſt not hold communion with them; for that is
to conſent to the uninſtituted ſpecies of their <hi>Church,
Miniſtry, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Worſhip.</hi> What then muſt we
do? May we ſeparate without contracting the guilt
of Schiſme? Take Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Anſwer.</p>
            <p>§. 9. <q>If any <hi>Prince</hi> would turn his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or a
whole <hi>Province, Dioceſs</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> into <hi>one onely Church,</hi>
and thereby overthrow all the <hi>firſt Order</hi> of Churches,
of Chriſts Inſtitution, <hi>which are aſſociated for perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Communion,</hi> allowing them no Paſtors, that have the
power of the Keys, and all eſſential to their Office,
though he ſhould allow parochial <hi>Oratories</hi> or <hi>Chappels,</hi>
which ſhould be no true Churches, but parts of a Church,
it were no Schiſm to gather Churches, within ſuch a

            </p>
            <p>Thus according to <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> principles, a ſeparation
from the Pariſh Aſſemblies, and an erecting particular
Churches, according to Goſpel Order, is not <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Our
ſeparation from the <hi>Dioceſane Conſtitution,</hi> and from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Churches, as but parts of the Dioceſane, is juſtifyable,
and not to be Condemned. Now the <hi>Lay-Nonconformiſts</hi>
are fully perſwaded, that the Law of the Land requires
our coming to Church, our going to the pariſh Aſſemblies,
as they are parts of the Dioceſane <hi>Church,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi>
ſaith they muſt not do.</p>
            <p>This being ſo manifeſt, I preſume the Reader will
be querying about Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Practice, and late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and ſay, <hi>Why then does</hi> Mr. Baxter <hi>go to Church?
Why doth he write ſo much for it, and cannot ſuffer a few
Lines in Manuſcript to paſs without a publick Confutation?
What! doth</hi> Mr. Baxter <hi>ſay and unſay, or is his Conſcience
againſt communicating with the pariſh Churches, and his
Practice for it?</hi> God forbid I ſhould think ſo of one,
whoſe Goodneſs and Learning both ſeem above the ſize
of what is Ordinary: Really therefore that I might
find out the Notion on which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> inſiſts to
ſatisfie himſelf, in holding communion with the pariſh
Aſſemblies, even when he is ſo very much againſt them,
as they are <hi>but parts of the Dioceſane Church,</hi> I have taken
ſome pains, and have been impartial in my Search, and
I think I have found out the Notion he builds on, which
I take to be this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> diſtinguiſheth between the many <hi>Pariſh
Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Dioceſane,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
as conſtituted of ſuch <hi>Dioceſane Churches.</hi> The old
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66265:11"/>
                  <hi>Nonconformists</hi> commonly owned the <hi>Pariſh Churches,</hi>
(and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as made up of ſuch)
but not the <hi>Dioceſane.</hi> It is therefore a Miſtake,
that owning the <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> is an
<hi>owning of the preſent Dioceſane Conſtitution.</hi>
               </q> Mr. B. againſt
Dr. O. p. 9.</p>
            <p>So that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> diſtinguiſheth between the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> as it is made up of many particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Churches that are <hi>Parochial,</hi> and as it is made up
of many particular <hi>Dioceſane Churches.</hi> And here it muſt
be Noted,</p>
            <p>1. That though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſuppoſes the National
<hi>Church of England</hi> to fall under theſe two <hi>diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,</hi>
yet <hi>de facto,</hi> its notorious that there are not
two ſuch National Churches of <hi>England</hi> exiſtent; and
in truth, its impoſſible that there ſhould be two ſuch
Churches, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> exiſtent in one Nation; for
a <hi>National Church</hi> made up of many compleat <hi>Parochial
Churches,</hi> is in its very <hi>conſtitution</hi> deſtructive of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church</hi> made up of many particular <hi>Dioceſane
Churches.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, that the
<hi>Dioceſane Church</hi> made up of many <hi>Parochial Aſſemblies,</hi>
and eſtabliſhed as a ſingle Church, <hi>Infimae ſpeciei,</hi> of the
loweſt Rank and Order, is deſtructive of the very
conſtitution of <hi>Parochial Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Dioceſane
Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> deſtructive of the <hi>Parochial;</hi>
and the ſame may be ſaid, <hi>è contra,</hi> of the <hi>Parochial,</hi>
it is deſtructive of the <hi>Dioceſane.</hi> So that its impoſſible
there ſhould be in this Nation two diſtinct <hi>National
Churches,</hi> the one made up of many <hi>Parochial</hi> compleat
ſingle Churches, the other made up of many <hi>Dioceſane</hi>
ſingle Churches. If then the <hi>National Church</hi> be in
purſuance of the Laws, <hi>de facto,</hi> ſettled as made up
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66265:12"/>
of many <hi>Dioceſane ſingle Churches</hi> (whether this be of
Divine or Humane Right, matters not) its impoſſible
to joyn our ſelves to the Pariſh-Aſſemblies, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
particular Churches. For what-ever <hi>Mental No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
we may have of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> our
Notions cannot make the Conſtitution to be <hi>de facto,</hi>
otherwiſe than it is; and all know that the <hi>National
Church</hi> is <hi>de facto,</hi> a <hi>National Church</hi> made up of ſeveral
<hi>ſingle Dioceſane Churches,</hi> and that there is no <hi>National
Church of England</hi> exiſtent made up of many compleat
Parochial Churches. But,</p>
            <p>2. Suppoſe one Pariſh Aſſembly, or more, ſhould
form and frame themſelves into compleat ſingle
Churches, and the People ſhould conſent to take the
Pariſh Miniſter for their Paſtor, and the Miniſter
ſhould exerciſe the whole power of a Paſtor in this
Pariſh Church. If this be ſo, it's acknowledged that
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may hold communion with this Pariſh
Church, and not own the preſent Dioceſane Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
But then it will alſo unavoidably follow, that
this Pariſh Church cuts it ſelf off from the National
ſettled Order, it is a <hi>Diſſenting Church;</hi> for it hereby
ceaſes to be a part of the Dioceſane Conſtitution, it
is no more under the Paſtoral Over-ſight of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſane
Biſhop, but aſſumes to it ſelf all that Paſtoral
Power that in purſuance of Canon and Statute Law
is fixed in the Biſhop; ſo that this Pariſh Church is
not eſtabliſhed or allowed by the Law, but is a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Congregation, of the ſame Nature, Form and
Conſtitution with that of other Diſſenting Churches;</hi> for
the ſpecies of theſe <hi>Parochial Churches Conſtitution, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi>
and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is the ſame with theirs, and as
perfectly inconſiſtent with that of the Dioceſane, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66265:12"/>
by the <hi>Church of England's</hi> Repreſentative declared to
be <hi>No True Church,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Veſtry,</hi> who
conſent to this Alteration, do act contrary to their
ſeveral <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> and are by the Canons
Excommunicate, and their Aſſemblies declared <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 11<hi>th Canon,</hi> whoſe Title is [<hi>Maintainers of
Conventicles cenſured</hi>] its expreſs, <q>That whoſoever
ſhall hereafter affirm or maintain, that there are
within this Realm <hi>Other Meetings, Aſſemblies</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi>
of the King's born Subjects, than ſuch as
by the Laws of the Land are held and allowed, which
may rightly challenge to themſelves the Name of true
and lawful Churches, let him be Excommunicated,
and not Reſtor'd, but by the Arch-Biſhop, after his
Repentance and publick Revocation of ſuch his
Wicked Errors.</q> And in <hi>Can.</hi> 12. <q>Whoſoever ſhall
affirm, That it is lawful <hi>for any ſort of Miniſters</hi> and
<hi>Lay-Perſons,</hi> or either of them to joyn together and
make Conſtitutions in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, without
the King's Authority, and ſhall ſubmit themſelves to
be ruled and governed by them, Let them be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and not be reſtored until they
Repent, and publickly revoke thoſe their Wicked and
<hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Errors.</q> And in <hi>Canon</hi> 73. where the
Title is [<hi>Miniſters not to hold private Conventicles</hi>] it is
thus ordained; <q>For as much as all Conventicles and
ſecret Meetings of Prieſts and Miniſters, have been
ever juſtly accounted very hurtful to the ſtate of the
Church wherein they live, We do now ordain and
conſtitute, That no Prieſts or Miniſters of the Word
of God, nor any other Perſons ſhall meet together
in any private Houſe, or <hi>elſe-where,</hi> to conſult upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66265:13"/>
any matter or courſe to be taken by them, or upon
their motion or direction by any other, which may any
way tend to the impeaching or depraving of any part
of the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline now eſtabliſhed in the
Church of England,</hi> under pain of Excommunication,
<hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that thoſe Pariſh Aſſemblies that are erected in
other manner than according to the Dioceſane Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and made compleat particular Churches, they
are as ſuch no more a part of the ſettled National Order,
than the preſent diſſenting Congregations, but are by
the Canons declared to be Conventicles, and the
Miniſters and People that have had a hand in the
framing their Pariſhes into this Order, are <hi>ipſo facto,</hi>
excommunicated. This then being ſo, I deſire it to
be obſerved, that when Mr. B. joyns with theſe
Pariſh-Aſſemblies, Thus conſtituted, his Communion
is ſtill confined unto the Diſſenters Congregations, he
doth not hereby hold any Communion with the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> any more than the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do;
for his Communion with theſe <hi>Pariſh Churches,</hi> is
with them as they are erected, <hi>in Oppoſition</hi> unto and
deſtruction of the <hi>National ſettled Order,</hi> which is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To undeceive the World then, I muſt tell them
(and <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> cannot deny it,) that <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> is
no more for the joyning with the Pariſh Aſſemblies,
as they are parts of the ſettled <hi>National Church,</hi> than
the congregational Diſſenters are, That when he goes
to <hi>Church,</hi> he holds no other Communion with the
<hi>Church of England</hi> than they do who go not to Church;
for his Communion is ſtill confind to a diſſenting
<hi>Pariſh Church,</hi> erected as much contrary to the Law
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66265:13"/>
of the Land, as their Congregations are. Its true,
he joyns with them in ſome part of the Liturgy,
and ſo goes farther then they, but he holds not
Communion with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it is a
Church of <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment,</hi> any farther than they
do. For he Eſteems the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as by
Law eſtabliſhed, to be deſtructive of that <hi>kind</hi> or
Species of thoſe <hi>Churches, Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi>
which is of Chriſts <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Parochial</hi> or <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.
Mr. Baxter</hi> and they (I ſay) are agreed in their
diſſent and ſeparation from the <hi>Pariſh Aſſemblies,</hi> as
they are parts of the ſettled <hi>National Order,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about the <hi>Frame</hi> of <hi>Parochial Aſſemblies;</hi> for <hi>Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſuppoſes them to be what (<hi>conſideratis conſideran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>)
other Diſſenters judge Impoſſible.</p>
            <p>To make this as plain as poſſible I can, it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> affirms the <hi>Pariſh Aſſemblies</hi> to
fall under a <hi>Twofold Conſideration;</hi> They muſt be looked
on, either as they are compleat particular <hi>Congregational
Churches,</hi> independant on the <hi>Dioceſane,</hi> or as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
parts of, and dependant on the <hi>Dioceſane.</hi>
Now as the Pariſh Aſſemblies are parts of the <hi>Dioceſane;</hi>
they are not by any means to be owned or approved,
but as they are particular <hi>Congregational Churches,</hi> ſo they
are to be communicated with and owned.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s Judgment; but on the other hand,
his Diſſenting Brethren hold, that though <hi>Parochial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>
may be actually formed and framed according to
the Congregational Conſtitution, that is, an Aſſembly
of good Chriſtians living in a Pariſh, may give up
themſelves to God, and aſſociate themſelves for perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Communion in the <hi>Doctrine, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Worſhip of
Chriſt,</hi> chuſing a Paſtor and other Officers; for this end
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66265:14"/>
the pariſh Aſſembly may conſent to be of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and may chuſe a Paſtor, and in this Aſſembly
all the Ordinances of Chriſt may be regularly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
and Diſcipline duely exerciſed. This may be,
but though it may be ſo, yet they affirm that the Pariſh
Aſſemblies are not thus conſtituted, their Conſtitution is
not <hi>Congregational,</hi> but <hi>Dioceſane.</hi> They are not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Church, but incompleat parts of the <hi>Dioceſane;</hi>
there is no ſuch conſent as is neceſſary to Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
ſuch a Church; but a conſent to be what the
Law directs 'em to be; they have no Paſtor amongſt
them, as a Congregational Church has, nor are they
independant on the Dioceſane, as the Congregational is.
They are not a particular Church of Chriſts Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Though they may be a ſound part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, or of the Chriſtian Kingdom, yet they
are not an Inſtituted Church, they are not a true
particular Church, and therefore it is impoſſible any
ſhould communicate with them, as with ſuch a Church.
Whatever we may fancy them to be they alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the ſame, our Imaginations cannot make any
change on their Conſtitution, our Mental Conceptions
are but <hi>Iminanent Acts, Et Nihil penunt in eſſe.</hi>
Think any man what he will of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>de facto,</hi> it remains the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> A Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church made up of many ſingle Dioceſane Churches,
<hi>Infimae ſpeciei,</hi> of the loweſt Rank and Order; for
which reaſon its Impoſſible for any to joyn with
the Church of England, as made up of many ſingle
compleat <hi>Parochial</hi> Churches; we cannot Communicate
with it as ſuch, becauſe it is not ſo made; there is not
any one Pariſh thus Conſtituted. Let <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them to that Pariſh, that is thus framed, that is,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66265:14"/>
a particular compleat Church of Chriſts Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he would do ſomewhat, but till then,
although there be ſome ſuch Pariſh Churches, it is
to them as if there were none ſuch; for [<hi>de non
Apparentibus et non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio.</hi>] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
they ſay, That if there be any ſuch Parochial
Congregational Church actually exiſtent in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Miniſter and People privately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
ſo much, they think, that if without an open
profeſſion of their Church conſtitution, as different
from the National eſtabliſhed Order, their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unicating
with them muſt be interpreted a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
with them as they are a part of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
National Order, which is Dioceſane, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done without an owning the preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſane
Conſtitution. But if ſuch a profeſſion be
made, they communicate not with the Church of
England, but with a Congregation of Diſſenters,
from the National Conſtitution. Farthermore,
ſome are afraid, that the erecting ſuch Pariſh Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
cannot be without the Miniſters and
Veſtry Mens contracting the guilt of Perjury. In
fine, I muſt again beſeech the Reader to fix it in his
thoughts, <hi>That the Church of England, as made up
of many ſingle Dioceſane Churches, is not in Mr.</hi> Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
<hi>Judgment a true Church;</hi> Though it be a ſound
part of the Church Univerſal; yet the Dioceſane
Churches, which make up the National, and which
in purſuance of the Law are, <hi>de facto,</hi> ſettled and
eſtabliſhed, are not <hi>true Churches. Mr. Baxter</hi>
doth hold that the Pariſh Aſſemblies, as parts
of Dioceſane Churches, are not true <hi>Churches;</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66265:15"/>
for they have not Paſtures, as has been largely
proved, and its no Schiſm to deny 'em, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
proper to a true particular <hi>Church.</hi> What
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ſaith of a Pariſh, that wants a Paſtor,
on the account of the Peoples not conſenting to
one impoſed on 'em, the ſame may be ſaid of
that Pariſh, whoſe Miniſter wants what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the Paſtoral Office; and <hi>This</hi> all Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
according to the ſettled National Order
do want, and therefore it may be ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>That that
Pariſh Church is no Pariſh Church,</hi> in the proper po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Organized ſence, as we now ſpeak of a
Church, as conſtituted by the Governing and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
part. For that which wanteth an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
part wanteth the Eſſence. And therefore it is
no <hi>Schiſm</hi> to pronounce it no ſuch Church, [i e.
<hi>no true Church of Chriſts Inſtitution</hi>] and to deny
it the Communion proper to ſuch a <hi>Church.</hi>
               </q> Mr.
Baxters <hi>Nonconformiſt plea for peace, p.</hi> 82.</p>
            <p>This then is <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> Judgment, touching the
<hi>Dioceſane Churches,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conſent unto them, nor hold Communion with
them as ſuch. For the very kind and frame of
their <hi>Churches</hi> is falſe, ſo is their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline,</hi>
even-<hi>deſtructive</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Churches, Miniſtry</hi>
and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. <q>A Congregation or Nation of Men
(ſaith <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>) of eminent Sanctity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſound Doctrine and Worſhip, may by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty take ſome one Falſhood or Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thing to be neceſſary to Miniſtry or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66265:15"/>
(as they ſay, ſome Churches unhapily
of late reject all that own not the Antiquity of
the Hebrew points) I cannot have local Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with that Church, (ſaith he) for they will
not receive me, unleſs I ſubſcribe either a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
or that which I judge falſe) but yet I high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honour and Love 'em, and have mental <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion</hi> with them, when perhaps
neceſſity makes me joyn with a Church of
far worſe Men and Order, that will impoſe
no ſin on me.</q> Mr. Baxter's <hi>Schiſm Detected,
pag.</hi> 56.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of this principle <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> layes
down, his Brethren ſeparate from the Church of
England; for there are ſeveral things which they
Judge unſound, that are made neceſſary to their
Communion with them. By <hi>Cannon</hi> 27. <q>No
Miniſter, when he celebrateth the Communion
ſhall wittingly Adminiſter the ſame to any but
ſuch as <hi>Kneel,</hi> under pain of <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> nor under
the like pain to any that refuſe to be preſent at
publick Prayers, <hi>according to the Orders of the Church
of England;</hi> that 'tis according to the 18<hi>th. Canon,</hi>
The Communion muſt not be adminiſtered
to him, that will cover his Head in the
Church or Chappel, in time of Divine Service, or
that doth not <hi>Reverently Kneel,</hi> when the general
Confeſſion, Lettany and other Prayers are read,
and ſhall not ſtand up at the ſaying of the Belief,
or refuſe to make due and lowly Reverence, when
the Name of the Lord Jeſus ſhall be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in time of Divine Service, or refuſe to ſay
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66265:16"/>
in due place, and audibly with the Miniſter,
the Confeſſion, the Lords Prayer, and the <hi>Creed,</hi>
or not make ſuch other Anſwers, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers, as are appointed in the Book of
<hi>Common-prayer.</hi>
               </q> Whoever refuſeth theſe things,
he is one who though preſent at the publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
yet not according to the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
is not to be admitted to the <hi>Communion,</hi> that is,
all thoſe things are made <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
And here it muſt be obſerved, that though
the admitting notorious Offenders to the Comunion
be forbiden by the 26<hi>th Canon,</hi> yet not under the
penalty of <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> as it is in this caſe of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thoſe who refuſe to Kneel, or to be preſent
at the publick Prayers, according to the Orders of
the Church of England.</p>
            <p>But theſe things ſeveral Diſſenters for great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
refuſe to do, I'll at this time only inſiſt on
the Ceremony <hi>of Kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament, and
give the Reaſons of ſome Learned Men againſt it.
1ſt. Let us hear <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>five Diſput.</hi>
p. 410, 411. <q>As for Kneeling at the Sacrament, I
doubt not at all but the Impoſing it, and that on
ſuch Rigorous Terms, tying all to it, and eaſting
all out of the Communion of the Church, or
from the participation of the Sacrament, that
durſt not uſe it, was a very grevious Sin, and
tended to Perſecution, and Injuſtice, and Church
dividing. It is certainly in a doubtful caſe the
ſafeſt way to do <hi>as Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and
the <hi>Vniverſal Church</hi> did for many hundred Years;
either the Geſture is <hi>Indifferent in it ſelf, or not;</hi> If
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66265:16"/>
it be, how dare they thus divide the Church by
it, and caſt out Chriſtians that ſcruple it, when
they have theſe and many other Reaſons of their
Scruples (which for brevities ſake I omit)? If
they ſay, That <hi>Kneeling</hi> is of it ſelf Neceſſary,
and not Indifferent, becauſe it is <hi>Reverent.</hi>
               </q> [Now
if the Reader conſiders the <hi>Rubrick</hi> added in the
New Common-Prayer-Book, he will find that
<hi>Kneeling</hi> is enjoyn'd for a <hi>Signification of our humble
and grateful Acknowledgment of the Benefits of Chriſt
therein received, and for avoiding ſuch Prophanation
and Diſorder in the holy Communion, as might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
enſue.</hi> Thus we ſee the Geſture of <hi>Kneeling</hi>
is made a <hi>Reverent Gesture,</hi> neceſſary to avoid
Diſorder and Prophanation. But ſayes <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi>
if Kneeling is of it ſelf neceſſary, and not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
becauſe it is Reverent] Then, <q>1<hi>st,</hi> They
make <hi>Chriſt an imperfect Law-giver.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> They
make himſelf or his Apoſtles, or both, to have
been <hi>Sinners.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> They condemn the Catholick
Church of Sin. 4<hi>thly,</hi> They condemn the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the chief General Councils. All which
are Conſequents that I ſuppoſe they will diſown.
What a perverſe prepoſterous <hi>Reverence</hi> is this!
when they have leave to lie in the Duſt before
and after the very Act of Receiving, through all
their Confeſſions and Prayers; yet they will at
other times ſtand, and many of them ſit at
Prayer, and ſit at ſinging Pſalms of Prayer
and Praiſe to God, and yet when Chriſt doth
invite them to a Feaſt, they dare not imitate
his Apoſtles and Univerſal Church in their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66265:17"/>
Geſture, leſt they ſhould be ſinfully Irreverent. So
ſar Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is accurate in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing,
and as to the part of the Receiver,
may yet ſee how to anſwer all theſe Arguments,
and ſatisfie himſelf in kneeling, yet he cannot but
believe, that Godly and Judicious men may be ſo
<hi>far</hi> under the powerful Convictions of ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
againſt the Impoſition, as to be unable
to ſatisfie their Conſciences in complying with
the Geſture of Kneeling. Surely Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells
the World ſo much in his firſt <hi>Nonconformists plea
for Peace,</hi> p. 150, 151, 152.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Some Nonconformiſts (ſaith he) <hi>Lay</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi>
judge <hi>Kneeling,</hi> as things now ſtand, <hi>Vnlawful:</hi>
Their Reaſons are, 1. In Doubtful caſes <hi>Duty</hi>
lieth on the ſureſt ſide; but this to them is a
doubtful caſe on one ſide, and to imitate Chriſt's
Inſtitution by ſuch ſitting, as men uſe to do at
Meat, is certainly lawful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they think Kneeling <q>
                  <hi>violateth the
Reaſons of the ſecond Commandment,</hi> being uſed
where by whole Countries of Papiſts round about
us, and many among us, it ſignifieth <hi>Bread-Worſhip,</hi>
or <hi>Idolatry</hi> by the <hi>ſame Action,</hi> at the <hi>ſame Seaſon</hi>
uſed. For they ſuppoſe that the <hi>ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
forbiddeth <hi>Images,</hi> as being external corporal
Idolatry, and <hi>ſymbolizing</hi> ſcandalouſly with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
though the Mind intend the Worſhip of
God alone: And ſuch they think this Kneeling
is, and that encourageth the Papiſts.</q> So far Mr.
<hi>Baxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66265:17"/>
2. I'll only add one Argument more, which I
find in a Propoſition concerning <hi>Kneeling,</hi> joyned
to <hi>Mr. Bradſhaw</hi>'s <hi>Twelve Arguments,</hi> which is taken
from the <hi>Abuſe of Kneeling</hi> in this Ordinance, by
the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> 'Tis there ſaid, <q>That the Apoſtle,
to Reform an <hi>Abuſe</hi> which crept (even in their
Times) into Love-Feaſts, which were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before or after the Lords Supper, did baniſh
them thence, and reduced the manner of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
the Lords Supper to the firſt Inſtitution,
ſaying, <hi>Shall I praiſe you in this? I praiſe you
not; for I have received of the Lord that which I
delivered unto you, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. verſ. 22, 23.
Whereby it is apparent, That that form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
which differeth from the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
is <hi>worthy no Praiſe,</hi> and therefore no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Service to God. For if the Apoſtle
would not tolerate an Indifferent thing (as was
a <hi>Love-Feast</hi> till then) to continue ſo near the
Lords Supper, when it was abuſed, how would
they allow the change of <hi>Sitting</hi> into <hi>Kneeling,</hi>
eſpecially in theſe two Conſiderations?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe the abuſe of <hi>Love-Feaſts</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>
Superſtuity) was never ſo great and ſcandalous in
the Apoſtles time, as the abuſe of <hi>Kneeling</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>
Idolatry)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was and is in the Synagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And beſides, <hi>Love-Feasts</hi> were either before or
after the Lords Supper; whereas Kneeling is in
the principal part of the Holy Communion.
Therefore if the Apoſtle baniſhed <hi>Love-Feaſts</hi>
from the Lords Supper, becauſe of the <hi>Abuſe,</hi>
and brought the Church to the Simplicity of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66265:18"/>
firſt Inſtitution, is it not a tempting Sin to retain
the <hi>Idolatrous Kneeling</hi> of Papiſts, and reject the
exemplary Sitting of our Maſter Chriſt? And
the rather becauſe it is in that Sacrament, and
in that <hi>part</hi> of the Sacrament which eſpecially
ſetteth forth our communion with Chriſt and
his Church, and is therefore called the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
—Doth not God ſtrictly forbid us to
ſerve him as <hi>Idolaters</hi> do their <hi>Godds?</hi> The
which conſidered, can Kneeling, wherewith
Papiſts honour their <hi>Breaden God,</hi> be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his holy Sacrament?</q>
            </p>
            <p>For ſuch Reaſons, many are convinced, that
<hi>Kneeling</hi> at the receiving the <hi>Communion</hi> is Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and ſeeing without Kneeling they cannot
have Communion with the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
they cannot locally communicate with her, but
yet highly honour her for the ſoundneſs of her
Doctrine, and do mentally hold <hi>Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with her, ſo far as ſhe agrees with the
<hi>Catholick Church;</hi> but Neceſſity makes them to
with-hold local Communion from them. To
make this yet more clear, the Reader muſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the Argument Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them with, runs thus, <hi>It is not lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with thoſe that impoſe Sinful Terms of
Communion:</hi> This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms. But <hi>the
Church of England impoſeth many things as Terms
of Communion with them, which they think are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
Ergo <hi>They muſt not communicate with them.</hi>
Now in the Minor Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and they differ;
he thinks the things they ſcruple (for inſtance,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66265:18"/>
               <hi>Kneeling</hi>) are Lawful, but yet propoſes ſtrong
Arguments againſt the Lawfulneſs of Kneeling;
which Arguments, though not Convincing unto
him, yet are ſo unto them. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is his Liberty, it is their Duty to with-hold
their Communion from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
ſtill honouring her for the ſoundneſs of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. 11. <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Schiſm detected,</hi> p. 40.
affirms, <q>That he who is unjuſtly caſt out of the
Church, and by its very Laws Excommunicated,
<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> is no damned nor ſinful Schiſmatick,
for Worſhipping God in a Church, that will
receive him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But according to the Judgment of <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi>
Proteſtant Diſſenters, are unjuſtly caſt out of the
Church of England, and by its very Laws, <hi>ipſo
facto,</hi> Excommunicated. <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Schiſmaticks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ſpeaks of going to another
Church, <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> muſt be underſtood to mean
a with-holding Communion from the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
Church, and commuicating with another,
whoſe Laws do not, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> Excommunicate.
The which being ſo, the Argument againſt <hi>Mr.
Baxter</hi> is valid for the acquitting their Seperation
from the Guilt of Sin.</p>
            <p>§. 12. There is another Argument which <hi>Mr.
Baxter,</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>Dr. Sherlock</hi> gives us,
and which will acquit the Lay-Diſſenter from Sin,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66265:19"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> no Sin, but a Duty to with-hold
Communion from a Schiſmatical <hi>Church:</hi> This Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>
doth over and over aſſert. <hi>But the Church of England
is a Schiſmatical Church,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> It is a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical

Schiſme. <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>firſt Plea,</hi> p. 41. ſaith,</p>
            <p>§. 14. <q>If any Proud, or Paſſionate, or Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noous

undeſervedly, by unjuſt <hi>Suſpenſions, Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings</hi>
or <hi>Excommunications,</hi> it is TYRANNICAL
SCHISME, what better Name ſoever cloaks
it. If any ſhould make <hi>ſinful Terms of Communion</hi>

by God, on thoſe that will have communion
with them, and expelling thoſe that will not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And the further thoſe Laws extend, and the more
Miniſters or People are caſt out by them, the
greater is the Schiſme.</q>
            </p>
            <p>§. 15. <q>If any ſhould not only Excommunicate ſuch
Perſons for not complying with them in ſin, but alſo
proſecute them with Mulcts, Impriſonments, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or other Proſecution, to force them to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs;
this were yet <hi>more haneouſly aggravated Schiſm.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. <q>All thoſe would be deeply guilty of <hi>ſuch
Schiſm,</hi> who by <hi>Talk, Writing</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> juſtifie

               <hi>Baxter,</hi> reflect on your Talk and Writing, and clear
your ſelf from the guilt of Reproaching the Innocent
as <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> if you can.] But I'll proceed:</p>
            <p>§. 17. <q>If any ſhould corrupt ſuch a Church, or its

caſting out the Officers, Worſhip or Diſcipline in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by Chriſt, and then proſecute others for not

Haneous Schiſme.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>§. 18. <q>If either of the laſt named ſorts would not be

and <hi>conſent</hi> to all that they do by <hi>Subſcriptions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,

be yet <hi>more aggravated Schiſm.</hi> So far Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let any impartial Reader compare what is here
ſaid, with what elſe-where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> accuſes the
<hi>Church of England</hi> of, and he'll find all this to be but
his <hi>Deſcription of the Church of England,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the general import of his Writings, muſt
be looked on as guilty of <hi>Haneous, Aggravated</hi> and
<hi>Tyrannical Schiſm,</hi> that is, to be deeply Schiſmatical;
and therefore, according to <hi>Dr. Sherlock,</hi> not to be
communicated with.</p>
            <p>But I'll draw to a cloſe, beſeeching the <hi>Reader</hi> to
conſider well what <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> judgment is, about
communicating with the Pariſh-Aſſemblies, by Law
eſtabliſhed, how much he is againſt it, and what are
ſome of his Reaſons, and he will find,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66265:20"/>
I. That <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> is as much againſt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the Pariſh-Aſſemblies, as by Law required,
as his Brethren are. The Pariſh-Aſſemblies, by Law
eſtabliſhed, are Dioceſane, and with them, as ſuch,
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> communicates not. But firſt fancies
the Pariſh Aſſembly to be a <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> and
the Pariſh Miniſter to be an <hi>Independant Paſtor,</hi> exempt
from the ſpiritual Juriſdiction of the Dioceſane Biſhop,
and then holds communion with it as ſuch, that is, he
either communicates with it as if it were what indeed
it is not, or if it be really ſuch a Church as he fancies
it to be, his communion with it is only as 'tis a Church
ſeparated from the National ſettled Order: For the
Pariſh Aſſembly, as a part of the National ſettled
Order, is no Church, it has no Paſtor, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>II. That <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s communion is no more <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
than theirs; though he talks more of the <hi>Name,</hi>
he has no more of the thing than they have. Doth
he hold <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> mentally with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church? ſo do they. Do they with-hold
mental communion from Pariſh-Aſſemblies, as by Law
eſtabliſhed (<hi>i. e.</hi>) as they are parts of the Dioceſane
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſtitution? So doth Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5+ letters">
                  <desc>•••••…</desc>
               </gap>tions,
to which their local Communion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
of a Conſtitution different from, and <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
on the <hi>Dioceſane?</hi> So is the Pariſh Church with
which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> communicates, if it be really what
he fancieth it to be; ſo that his <hi>Local Communion</hi> is
as much confined to <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Aſſemblies as theirs is.</p>
            <p>This is on a Suppoſition that <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were operative, <hi>ad extra,</hi> and would make a real
change on the Conſtitution. But if the Pariſh Aſſembly
continues, <hi>de facto,</hi> as eſtabliſhed, then I muſt ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:66265:20"/>
III. That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> holds both thoſe Premiſes,
from which a concluſion (juſtifying their ſeparation)
doth naturally follow. The Premiſes are theſe; <hi>It is
our undoubted Duty to ſeparate from the Corruptions that
are in the Pariſh Aſſemblies. But the very Conſtitution
of the Pariſh Aſſemblies and Miniſtry, by Law eſtabliſhed,
are Corruptions.</hi> Theſe are Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Premiſes. And
let the World judge whether this Concluſion [namely,
<hi>That it is our undoubted Duty to ſeparate from the Pariſh
Aſſemblies and Miniſtry, as by Law establiſhed</hi>] doth not
naturally flow from them, juſtifying a with-holding
Communion from the Pariſh Aſſemblies. In fine, it
muſt be obſerved, that if the Pariſh Aſſemblies be really
<hi>de facto, but parts of the Dioceſane Church,</hi> and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Churches, <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> muſt juſtifie the Separation,
and that he doth ſo, I will give you his own words, as I
find 'em in his <hi>Schiſm detected,</hi> p. 28. <q>Either our Pariſh
Churches (ſaith he) are true Churches, or not; if not,
the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> are ſo far in the Right, and ſeparate not
from true Churches, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe they ſeparate
from them: ſo far Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> who, if the Pariſh.</q>
Aſſemblies be but parts of the Dioceſane <hi>Conſtitution</hi>
and not true compleat particular <hi>Churches,</hi> juſtifies the
ſeparation from 'em; And who knows not, that the
Pariſh Aſſemblies, as by Law eſtabliſhed, are but parts
of the <hi>Dioceſane?</hi>
