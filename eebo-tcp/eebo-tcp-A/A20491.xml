            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A direction concerning the Plague or Peſtilence, for Pooore and Rich.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Plague which is called of the Greekes <hi>Epidemia,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Lues peſtis</hi> or <hi>peſtilentia,</hi> and I a ſtranger and a German who many times haue beene imployed in this ſicknes, as at <hi>Cullen, Oſtend, Amſterdam</hi> and many other Townes more, may with great credit beare me witneſſe of it; ſo I can ſay &amp; write of this fearefull diſeaſe more then any other can. The cauſe is euident, that it is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from God, whereof many examples may be ſet downe, which I leaue for breuity ſake: for it is a matter which belongs to Diuines; the other cauſe is, that the vpper parts haue infected the Aſtris with a Diſtemperature where through the Plague hath his domination into our bodies, whereof we leaue this beſides to our learned Philoſophers. Now to come to my intent which is out of loue, more then for gaine, for to take ſuch a dangerous matter vpon me in mine old age (The which God be thanked haue no great need of, but beeing firſt mooued to it, by diuers of this City, for to do ſomething in this time of ſickneſſe, I haue ſayd nothing all this while (but finding the ſicknes increaſing more and more, do determine to ſhew my beſt skill for it, thus through my experience, where I haue in former times (putting my truſt in God &amp; with his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand) ſaued many a mans life. Firſt, pray to God to forgiue your ſinnes, and after vſe the naturall meanes which God hath ordained to euery ſicknes, and as well for this ſicknes, as for any other, I haue a preſeruatiue which euery body ſhall find by me. Alſo a certaine precious Pill, to keepe in your mouth, when you goe abroad or perceiue any danger.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt ſeuerall Antidotes for the preſeruation of mans body from the Plague with certaine directions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly a certaine <hi>Elixar,</hi> or a water for them that are infected, beſides certaine orders and directions for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming of their houſes, chambers &amp; roomes; for to alter the ayre, to preſerue their houſes; beſides for thoſe houſes that are already Infected to cleanſe them, with certaine directions, waſhing them with waters wherein certaine hearbs are boyled, and after ſtroying the houſe with hearbs, fitting for this ſicknes, and perfume. Now after many and ſeuerall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines both in Phyſicke and Chirurgery, which are neceſſary in this ſicknes, as Cordials, Iulips, cooling waters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues, Oyles, Oyntments, ſmelling or ſmooking balls, as Pomanders, Quilts, with other Chirurgicall medicines for Carbonckles, Antraxs or other ſwelling as Byles, and Impoſtumes. The Profeſſor hath Poulteſſes, Balſomes, Oyles, Plaiſters &amp; all things elſe belonging to this diſſeaſe, beſides it is neceſſary for euery one to be ſolible in his body, or to take ſome conuenient purge by directions from the Phyſitions. Likewiſe Fountenell or Iſſues, are very commendable, the which I haue made in Germanie and other places, in vehement Plagues, as a preſeruatiue againſt Infection. Such people are not apt to be Infected that haue any running ſores, as Vlſers, nor thoſe which are troubled with other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies which run. There are certaine rules to be obſerued, as to forbeare to go in ſtinking places, &amp; not too goe abroad till the Sun be vp, principally in moiſt and foggy weather; in the euening auoyd the ſtreets, &amp; goe not to late abroad, which is principally hurtfull for Children, and yong people, ouerfill not your bodies with meat which is hard of diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, for it breeds ill humors. All theſe medicines euery body may haue in his owne houſe for a reaſonable price, with certaine directions in print. This I take out of ancient writers, which haue bin many times approoued; this I do through &amp; with counſell of diuers learned Phyſitions, ſome of the Kings Maieſties, &amp; others of my friends, although there will be ſome Calumniating night-Oules, perhaps, will ſpeake againſt my intent. Let them ſhow a better or elſe let this alone.</p>
