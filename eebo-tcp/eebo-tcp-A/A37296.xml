         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But let me here ſo far preſume on your vitiated patience, as to ſalute you with this one query, Is it not as lawful for others as for you to teach? and may not their doctrine be as effectual to this end, to turn peoples minds from darkneſs to light, as is yours? and whether it be not the ſpirit of Satan in you, that cries down that in others, which it preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up in your ſelf? And is it not the ſpirit of confuſion, that cries up one while, and down another, the ſelf and the ſame thing? And are not Scriptures external means, and ſo granted by you to be uſeleſs? and how then are they means of perfection, if they be not uſeful, or doe you mean ſomething not external, and ſo intitle a falſe thing Scripture? But I fear your Miniſtry is rather miſery then mercy; for if you had receiv'd the mercy that <hi>Paul</hi> had, you would alſo renounce the hidden things of diſhoneſty, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, not walking in crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The end of thoſe gifts was for perfecting the Saints, and bringing all into one faith unto a perfect man, which they that teach that none can be perfect by thoſe gifts while they live, do ſet up a faith in people contrary to the end of thoſe gifts; and by ſetting up external things in ſtead of theſe ſpiritual gifts, have you loſt the gifts, and have made them void, and ſo are become enemies to the end and intent of them in others who have them and believe the end of them: And thus the end and intent for which they were given, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come void to you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12.</p>

(as you doe the Scripture) unto your owne will, which we are not to query what; for that I know as well as you can tell me, if not better; but if external means were uſeleſs, and ſo conſequently theſe gifts, how became their end void for which they were given? ſo that you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer not at all to the queſtion, but at confuſed randum, and ſtuffe up lines with lyes: Firſt, that to teach that none can be perfect in this life by theſe gifts, is to ſet up a falſe faith; produce a preſident of one perſon in all the Scripture that ever was perfect by any meanes whatſoever (except Chriſt) if you can, or elſe yeild your ſelf a lyar. Secondly, that by ſetting up external things for thoſe ſpiritual, I have made them void, which is another lye, and that two-fold. Firſt, prove that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I ſet up external things in ſtead of ſpiritual things, if you can; but have not you and your Ghoſtly Father the Pope done it, in ſetting up carnal dictates of your own brains, for that of the ſpirit of God? Secondly, that I have made them void; teſtifie this if thou canſt, O ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til deceiver. Thirdly, that I am become an enemy to the end of theſe gifts in others; I declare in the preſence of God, I honour, though you oppoſe them, whereſoever they be; which is backed by a fourth lye, that the end and intent of them is become void to me, when my end is is not yet come; but how ſoon it may, God knowes; but this I can teſtifie, the fruits of thoſe gifts have I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in my meaſure, and by them in others have been both eſtabliſhed and inſtructed in the truth, and ſo I can witneſſe the effects, though not the end of them as yet: But what means <hi>Paul</hi> by the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect in heaven, if they were perfect before on earth, and whether is <hi>Paul</hi> or you a lyar herein?</p>

And here you againe abuſe the Text; for that incorruption is not to be put on, till this corruption ſhall be put off by a diſſolution of the body; till when, the ſting of death remaines, which is ſinne; but then, when by a natural death, as due for the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhall riſe againe to incorruption, and life everlaſting, as due for the meritorious obedience of the ſecond; and when the laſt enemy, death, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, then <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? and O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi> but not before; and therefore all that you ſeem to heap up as a mountaine, is nothing pertinent to the thing required; for if the ſting of death were wholly aboliſhed, then death could have no power on us, and this were tereſtrial and preſent immortality, the enjoyment whereof, is not till having put off this corruptible, by death we ſhall have put on incorruption, which is not earthly, as you pretend to ſay it is in this life, but heavenly, and in another; ſo that you know neither how, nor where death reignes, nor where or when it reignes not; and though I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but you have <hi>Cain</hi>'s malice, yet bleſſed be God, if you had alſo his might, you could not ſo far reach, as to murder them that are tranſlated from the death of ſinne and condemnation, through a diſſolution of the body by a natural death, unto everlaſting life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 26</note>for there is, and ever will be, a gulfe betweene you and your Captain General, and their eternal habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

Interceſſion is a paſſing between, or being ſurety to undertake to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for ones debt: now if you acknowledge no debt due for ſinne, what need have you of a ſurety? is he not uſeleſſe unto you in this reſpect? And a Mediator is one that goeth betwixt, or withſtandeth a matter, that it goeth not forwards; that is, betwixt us and Gods wrath againſt us for ſinne; and how can he withſtand that which is not?

                  <head>An Anſwer to the Second Query.</head>
                  <p>When firſt I conſiderately peruſed this your Query, I in part determined to have returned it back as I found it, holding it a thing cautious, whether it were a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject lawful to diſpute, without a prejudice to conſcience, ſavouring ſo much of ſpiritual preſumption, that I leave it unto you to conſider and examine, whether it extend to heretical abomination, or no? But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtability of your vitiated braines, which with a blaſt mounts upon the falatious clouds of vainglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imaginations, as to boaſt of the victory before the encounter; I thought better to give it a curb, then to paſſe it by uncorrected. Foraſmuch as you query how much of the Scripture is uſeful, how much not? it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeares you ſuſpect, if not aſſert ſome of it to be uſeleſſe, which ſeemes unto me an apparent ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods perfect wayes in his actings; for if God hath made, or compoſed any thing that is uſeleſſe, then hath he wrought in vain; and this to believe and teach, appeares unto my apprehenſion little better, if any thing at all, then blaſphemy in a high degree; for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Saints had never particular &amp; peculiar commands, but that which was pleaſing to God in one, was alſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56387:15"/>
acceptable in another; ſo the command was not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or at the leaſt not peculiar; for this were to affirm mutability in God, that the thing which pleaſed him now, ſhould not content him another time, except upon ſome more then extraordinary occaſions; and this would be, at the leaſt, partiality in him, which is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſuppoſe; but it is freely confeſſed, that the Saints in their particular employments had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commands, as <hi>Noah,</hi> that all mankinde might not <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 13, 14.</note>be deſtroyed, had a particular command to build an Ark, and <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their bondage, had a peculiar command to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to lead them through the Sea, to hew forth Tables, to receive the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and to conſecrate. <hi>Aaron</hi> had a command to array himſelf in Prieſtly Ornaments; St. <hi>John</hi> to <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 10, 11.

                  <p>In this Query I finde no leſſe then two lies at the leaſt, if not three. The firſt laid on Chriſt, God-man bleſſed for ever, that he preached the Kingdome of God within unbeleevers.

                     </note> abuſed by your ſpiritual impious impudence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. For the firſt, * I have obſerved the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all the Expoſitors, who have upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commented upon that place, that ever I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſight of, who all concur in one opinion, and render it thus from the Original Language; The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is within, or among you; the word in the <hi>Greek</hi> ſignifying both, and ſo you have it in the Margent of your larger Bibles: Now, if the word in the Original ſignifie both, then the one ſo well as the other may be uſed; but that muſt needs bee moſt proper, which moſt concurs with other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore among, rather then within, ſince <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in you</hi> (writing to the faithful, not to the faithleſſe) <hi>except ye be Reprobates;</hi> and again, <hi>Know you not that no unrighteous perſon in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eriteth the Kingdom: of God;</hi> where it is cleare, that it does not poſſeſſe men, as inheriting them, for this implyes a contradiction;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56387:16"/>
but it is to be poſſeſſed of men, and they to inherit it; <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 28. Mar. 10 15 Mat. 25. 21 He might enter into it, but it could not enter into him.</note>and from this inheritance the unrighteous are excepted and exempted too; therefore it is certainly a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious lye, to ſay Chriſt preached the Kingdome of God in unbeleevers, though among them; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all his excellencies that attended him in his Incarnation were among them, but not in them, and an error in the Tranſlation, makes not an error in Chriſts Doctrine. Thus for the firſt; I come now to clear the Apoſtle from your falſhoods; for you (ſpeaking of unbeleevers) ſay he ſaith that all which may be known <note place="margin">Rom. 1 19</note>of God, or of his glory, is manifeſt in them. This you pretend to be a proofe, that there is a light in every man to reveale all that may be known of God, or of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which I ſay can be nothing leſſe then the Spirit of God, when if you read the verſe following, for the firſt hath a dependency on the latter, you ſhall ſee the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20 Joh. 14. 26</note>of the former expreſſion; <hi>The inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeene, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things that are made.</hi> Now this cannot be the Spirit of God or Chriſt, which teacheth all things needfull for ſalvation, except you can prove him to be made at the Creation, and ſo a creature, and not a Creator; and therefore it muſt be ſomething <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26</note>in the creature, which can be nothing elſe but the eye of the rational ſoule, which is reaſon, by which may be ſeen the inviſible being of God; and that he is ſo, <hi>Cicero, Ariſtotle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Plato,</hi> but meer Heathens, have attain'd unto, therefore this is humane, not divine. I ſhal not ſtand to ſtate arguments to prove it experimentally, becauſe I intend brevity. I Come unto the other Scripture which you adde, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they</hi> (ſpeaking of unbeleevers ſtill) <hi>came to the knowledge of God and his glory by the light that ſhone in them.</hi> A moſt notorious lye, wreſting the meaning of the Apoſtle unto your owne wills, and I leave it to you to examine with feare and trembling, whether it be not alſo unto your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction too; for the words are theſe, <hi>For God who</hi>

                     <hi>commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſse, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the grace of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Where is obſervable, Firſt, what it was that ſhined, <hi>God, that commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe hath ſhined.</hi> Secondly, the perſons to, and in whom he ſhined, <hi>in our hearts.</hi> Now the word <hi>(our)</hi> maketh a ſeparation between <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom he writ who were Beleevers and Reprobates who beleeved not; therefore you muſt needs acknowledge you have belyed him, in ſaying he ſpoke of unbeleevers, when he ſpoke to, and of Saints, <hi>in our hearts,</hi> unleſſe you can prove that that <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ſuch as you ſpeak of, even unbeleevers. Thirdly, the intent and purpoſe for which he ſhone, <hi>to give,</hi> (it was not free to all, as you ſay, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly given to ſome) <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.</hi> And then Fourthly, the manner how, <hi>in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I intend not to write an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on the words, but onely rightly to divide them, and ſo to cleare them from the ſcandal laid on them by you, which is clear.

Acts 4 12.</note>been hid from generations, and from you (I fear) alſo, but is revealed unto us by faith in him, we can ſee that he, even Jeſus, is the Chriſt, the Son of the living God, and that in him, and his name onely, is eternal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to be found or preached and ſalvation in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the Sunne; that he is bodily aſcended unto glory, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us; and this they could not ſee, though we ſee this, and much more by faith in him; and wee can ſee the way wherein we muſt run to attain the end of our race, even eternal reſt, which neither they, nor you, their ſucceſſors could, or can ſee. But ſince with a parentheſis of nonſence you ſeem to direct your latter part of his Query, <hi>(To any who deny the light of Chriſt)</hi> finde them out, and let them anſwer it, for it concerns not me; and ſo I have ended my Anſwer.

                  <p>Q. 14. And ſince I have proved Scriptures may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, why not a verſe, or a chapter, or more or leſs? and ſince it ought to be divided, can there be any diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without parts? if ſo, prove it; if not, why may it not be diſtinguiſhed under the names of Doctrines, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Uſes, and the like, as well as to goe without name? or doe you reſiſt it, becauſe the Scriptures allowes it?</p>
                  <p>Q. 15. And ſince you ſeem to exhort that none ought to begin or conclude their ſpeech in Preaching, till the ſpirit move them thereunto by irreſiſtable motions; did ever the gift of the Spirit exclude prudent reaſons ſo much, as to ſet mens tongues ſo on going, as that they had no power to ſtop them? and is not your tongue oyled with a ſpirit of confuſed deluſion?</p>

                  <p>Q. 18.
