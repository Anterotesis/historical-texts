         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt becauſe I envy thoſe of the Papal Church, or deſire them any evil; Not that I deſire they ſhould be expoſed to a ſuffering condition for matters of Religion, or that they ſhould be denied any liberty in that reſpect which I deſire my ſelf, nor for any other prejudice (God knoweth) do I publiſh this ſmall Treatiſe: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I judge my ſelf concerned at this time to give my Teſtimony for the Truth, againſt ſome Papal Tenents; for divers cauſes: As firſt,</p>
            <p>I am at this time under reſtraint, and though nothing hath been laid to my charge, yet it is rumour'd by ſome that I am a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> yea, in this place of my Confinement, have I been told to my face by ſome of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Clergie, that I am a <hi>Roman Jeſuite.</hi> And indeed this is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſperſion which hath been caſt upon thoſe in general to whom I am related upon a religious account, viz. <hi>That we are all Papiſts, or will turn Papiſts,</hi> &amp;c. and this, not ſo much to our perſonal prejudice, as to the diſhonour of that antient way of Truth by us profeſſed. Secondly,</p>
            <p>A more particular occaſion of the publication of this Treatiſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, in ſending Seven <hi>Queries</hi> to the Baptized Congregations in this County (commonly called <hi>Anabaptiſts)</hi> To which, through the importunity of ſome Friends, I formed a brief Anſwer; little thinking, I confeſs, that ſo much contention would have riſen thereupon, as ſince I have met with. And I likewiſe confeſs, that the undertaking is ſuch, as that it requireth a more fit Inſtrument than my ſelf to manage it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I hope I may ſay, that hitherto what hath come to paſs in this conteſt, hath fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Truth; for which cauſe I have thought fit to offer it to the peruſal of others, ſo much of it I mean, as I conceive is at preſent needful; and that is the ſubſtance of what hath paſſed about the means whereby we muſt decide or reſolve Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108098:3"/>
It now wants but few months of a year, ſince I ſent my final Anſwer, containing a Review of all that had been ſaid in way of Anſwer to the <hi>Queries</hi> before, in which I produced the Teſtimony of divers Antient Dictors, as concurring with what I had therein ſpoken, and, as being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to my <hi>Antagoniſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have heard of late, that he is gone out of this Nation, ſo that I expect no more Reply from him. And though for divers Reaſons hereafter ſhewed, I have not publiſhed the whole Diſcourſe (which, if need be, may in due time be brought to light) yet I have thought it meet here to ſet down all the <hi>Seven Queries,</hi> that ſo if any Chriſtian, of ſuitable endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the Vindication of Truth, againſt the oppoſition that lyeth in the ſaid <hi>Queries,</hi> ſhall think fit to lay forth his Talent in that Service, he may take hold of this occaſion wherein to do it, (for the <hi>Queries</hi> were not directed to any particular perſon) however, I ſhall joyn to each <hi>Query,</hi> one <hi>Antiquery,</hi> which may ſerve at this preſent to blunt the edge of them, as they carry an oppoſition to the Truth.</p>

Alſo, whether there be any that hold the firſt day under the notion of a Sabbath among the Baptized Churches? and yet whether there be not clear Texts for the religious obſervation of it? <hi>Act. 20. 7.</hi> Alſo, whether it he not abſurd for you to ask for clear Texts to prove unwritten things? Alſo, whether Rurgatory, and the Real Preſence, as you hold them, is not plainly deſtructive to ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith?</cell>

               <hi>TO THE Nameleſs Author OF THE VII. QUERIES; And in him, to all the SONS of PAPAL ROME In the County of</hi> LINCOLN.</head>
            <p>HItherto the things pertaining to Religion, as they concern the Baptized Congregations, (commonly called <hi>Anabaptiſts)</hi> and you that are commonly called <hi>Papiſts,</hi> have been very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. And whether it ſhall ever pleaſe God to try his Peoples Faith and Stedfaſtneſs, by your open oppoſition, as he hath done it by others, I may not preſume to determine; nor doubt I, but if it ſhall ſo fall out, he will advance his Truth thereby.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that of thoſe many wayes whereby the antient path of the Goſpel hath for a long time been oppoſed, there is not found any more potent than yours; and the rather, becauſe your ſubtilty is utterly unknown to the generality of Chriſtians in this Age and Nation, where your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath, as it were, lain dormant for many years.</p>
            <p>The moſt dangerous ſtratagem wherewith you uſually aſſail your oppoſits, is, your denyal of the Scripture, &amp;c. the high doom of Judgment in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith; and aſcribe that dignity to your ſelves, under pretence of your being the Church; wherein if you conquer any one, your work is, as it were, wholly accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, I have here preſented to the world, ſomewhat of your skill, in this important Queſtion, <hi>Whether we are to reſolve all Differences in point of Religion, only out of the written Word of God?</hi> yea, I have faithfully tranſcribed your laſt Reply to my Anſwers, which contains the ſum of what you ſaid in all your other Papers. Whereby the Reader will diſcern (if I think right) wiſdom uſed to the hurt of them that have received it. I have forborn at this time to publiſh all that hath paſſed
<pb facs="tcp:108098:5"/>
between us about the <hi>ſeven Queries;</hi> partly, for that one thing is oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in our ſeveral Papers; and partly, and indeed eſpecially, for that it is to little purpoſe to controvert any particular point of Religion, till we be agreed about the Judge, that muſt determine our Differences. Now, whereas you do aſcribe this Prerogative to your ſelves, under pretence of your being the Church of Chriſt, I have therefore laid down ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by which it may appear, that you are not the Church, and ſo not that Judge, whereunto you pretend to be ſo willing to adhere.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe ſhewed, that we, your oppoſits, have the true claim to the title of Chriſt's Church; that ſo, if you will appeal to her, you muſt then appeal to us; which yet we believe you will not be perſwaded to, nor indeed do we deſire you ſhould, whilſt this is the Queſtion, <hi>Whether we, or you, be the Church?</hi> No, we are content to ſay with <hi>Auguſtine, Ask not us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt.</hi> contra <hi>Max.</hi> l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>in this caſe, we will not ask you, but let this matter be tryed by the Scripture: yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles be Judge,</hi> Yea, we ſay further in his words, Let matter with matter, cauſe with cauſe, reaſon with reaſon, counted by authority of the Scriptures, not proper to any but indifferent Witneſſes to both parts.</p>
            <p>My final Anſwer to the firſt of the <hi>ſeven Queries,</hi> I have here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, with as little alteration or addition as poſſibly I could, to give the Reader a true underſtanding of the matters in difference. And if you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any thing hereupon, I deſire no fairer dealing from you, than you have in this caſe from me.</p>
            <p>I have ſeriouſly conſidered what ſhould be the deſign of your <hi>Queries;</hi> and hitherto it appears to be chiefly, to exalt the authority of mens Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, above the lively Oracles of God, <hi>the Scriptures.</hi> For though it ſhould be granted (which you can never prove) that there hath continued a true Church at <hi>Rome</hi> ever ſince it was there planted; yet would it not follow, that all which your Church holdeth under the title of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> muſt needs be obeyed by us; for it is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſtate of a true Church, when yet their Traditions (however by them accounted) were but the Traditions of men, which both the Prophets and Chriſt himſelf, termed <hi>vain Worſhip;</hi> eſpecially ſuch of them as made void the Commands of God, as we are ſure many of yours do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>Why do you tranſgreſs the Command of God by your Tradition?</hi> the ſame we are humbly bold to ſay to you, when <note place="margin">Mar. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> you ask us, why we tranſgreſs your Traditions? for ſurely, of none can it more fitly be ſaid than of you, <hi>that laying aſide the Commandments of God, you hold the Tradition of men.</hi>

            <head>THE BAPTIST AGAINST THE PAPIST.</head>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>The FIRST PART ſheweth, the SCRIPTURE and ROME to be in Contention about the SUPREAM SEAT of JUDGMENT in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of RELIGION.</head>
               <p>THe firſt of all Controverſies is founded upon this <hi>Query: What is the authoritative Judge of Controverſies?</hi> And indeed till there be ſome agreement in this point, there can be no expectation of any fruitful iſſue of any Controverſie.</p>
               <p>Now all Controverſies amongſt the ſons of men, are reduceable to one of theſe two heads, namely, <hi>things humane,</hi> or, <hi>things divine;</hi> things preciſely pertaining to this life, or things which only pertain to that which is to come; concerns of a <hi>ſecular conſideration,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of a <hi>religious conſideration.</hi> And according to the nature of theſe Controverſies, ſuch ought the Judge for deciſion thereof to be.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Judge of <hi>Religious Controverſies,</hi> there are divers opinions. Some ſay that the <hi>Light,</hi> or that of God in <hi>Every Man,</hi> is this only infallible Judge of all Religious Controverſies. But if this be admitted, a multitude of inconveniences muſt needs follow, of which this is not the leaſt, That there can be no end of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, becauſe, if every man have this Judge of all Debates in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he aver, that what he ſaith and doth is according to the voice of this Judge (or, <hi>that of God in him)</hi> no man can take in hand to judge contrary thereunto, without becoming the Judge's Judge,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108098:6"/>
and ſo violate the Rule propoſed. For this opinion refers not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters to that of God in ſome men, or a ſelect number of men, but to that of God in every man.</p>
               <p>There is another Opinion, which ſaith, That amongſt all men which pretend to own Chriſt, and challenge to themſelves the title of his Church, and yet do deny each other to have an intereſt in that title; That amongſt all ſuch parties of the ſons of men, the only infallible and authoritative Judge of their <hi>Controverſies about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is the LORD Himſelf, as he ſpeaketh by his Spirit in the holy Scriptures; together with <hi>right Reaſon:</hi> or thus, which is all one, The Apoſtles and Prophets, as they ſpeak <hi>in</hi> their holy Writings, are the onely infallible authoritative Judge in theſe Controverſies. Yet three things are in this Opinion allowed: firſt, That the living voice of the Paſtors (with the Church) in their reſpective Ages wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live, are of great importance in order to the terminating ſtrife in the Church, as a Church. Secondly, That Records of Antiquity are of ſome uſefulneſs for the reſolving ſome Controverſies, and for the better diſcovery of ſome Errors, yet not ſo abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but that the Church may ſufficiently reſolve her Controverſies without them. Thirdly, That there is a Judgment of Science to be allowed every man, as touching all things which he chuſeth or refuſeth in matters of Religion, to be uſed with moderation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet ſubjection. And this is the Opinion to which for my part I do adhere.</p>
               <p>There is another Opinion which ſaith, That the Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Supream Judge and Catholick Moderatrix of all Diſputes in matters of Faith, and that <hi>All</hi> are bound to hear and obey her Voice under pain of Damnation; and that the Scriptures, as taken in the ſecond Opinion, is not the Judge of Controverſies. Now this is the Opinion which at this time I am to examine, which in much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs I humbly purpoſe to do, and leave it to the ſober conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all men.</p>
               <p>And for the better diſcharge of this duty, it is meet we ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> mean by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this I find, that under that title they would involve the whole Church of Chriſt from the Apoſtles dayes until this preſent time, at leaſt all the Faithful ſince the time that <hi>Paul</hi> declares the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to have been famous, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. But this is the very thing denied by us: for though we willingly grant that there was a very famous Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to them; yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that there is ſuch a Church there now, or that all that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108098:6"/>
ever from that time to this have walked in the ſteps of true Faith, muſt needs be ſuppoſed to have been Members of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or rather of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſo called) eſpecially ſince it was Papal. So that in this Controverſie they muſt be content to define the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on this wiſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> All that in any Age ſince Chriſt, was of the ſame Faith and Practice in things religious, which is at this day found in the Papal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe only, are the perſons of whom the Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth conſiſt. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is as much as they can reaſonably deſire; for if thoſe holy men who lived in times paſt, were of a Faith and Practice contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct to that which <hi>Rome</hi> hath now received, Then may not the preſent Papal Church without wrong, challenge them to be of their Church? As for example: <hi>Paul,</hi> who bore witneſs for Chriſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Chriſtians there in his dayes, was of the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rome;</hi> yet we deny that they were any part of the Papal Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore, defined as before, I do deny to be the infallible authoritative Judge of all Controverſies about matters of Faith or Religion: And I do further ſay, That the Scriptures and right Reaſon, as laid down in the ſecond opinion, much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be received for this ſupream Judge of Controverſies, than the Papal Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and that there is not an other Umpire that can ſo effectually decide the Controverſies of Religion, which depend between ſuch parties of men as lay claim to the Title of Chriſt's Church, and yet deny each other to have an intereſt therein.</p>
               <p>And how far forth the truth in this Point hath been evidenced in that <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> Diſcourſe (ſo far as it relateth to the firſt of them) which hath been occaſioned by the writing of the <hi>Seven Queries</hi> I have before ſpoken of, is here offered to the Conſideration of all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men, that profeſs to own the Glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>firſt Query</hi> of the <hi>Seven</hi> was this, propounded by the nameleſs Papiſt.</p>

                  <p>To which Queſtion theſe enſuing Anſwers were given before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Adverſaries laſt Paper, which, with the Anſwers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108098:7"/>
I will tranſcribe <hi>verbatim.</hi> I ſay the Anſwers were,</p>
                  <p>That the word <hi>Controverſies</hi> being underſtood of ſuch Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies only as depend between thoſe parties of men who deny each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the Church; that then there is no other way whereby <hi>WE</hi> can reſolve thoſe Controverſies, but by the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit ſpeaking to us [through the undoubted Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Primitive Churches] in the lively Oracles of God, the Scriptures of Truth, together with the help of right Reaſon in a way of ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to thoſe divine directions. Or, if the word Controverſies, ſhall relate only to all ſuch Controverſies as fall within the compaſs of the Church, that then to the former means, we are to joyn the living Voice and Authority of the Church (in preſent being) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with her Paſtours, as the ordinary means appointed of God to terminate ſtrife in the Churches. But if the Diviſion in the Church be ſo great, as that it be not this way deciſſive; or the Doubt ſo ſecret, as not this way to be reſolved; there is not then a better way, than for both Parties to reaſon it out till Truth and Innocency do prevail, as the two Tribes and an half did with the other Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and prevailed, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 22. or in ſome doubtful caſes the uſe of Lots may be admitted for the reſolution of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</p>

                     <hi>It is worth obſerving, how many windings and turnings you have to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the difficulty of this</hi> Query; Whether we are to reſolve all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in point of Religion, only out of the written Word of God? <hi>Firſt, you leave out the word</hi> [only] <hi>in which lay the very knot of the difficulty.</hi> 2. <hi>Then you give me a piece of an Anſwer, and keep in</hi> the living voice of the Church, <hi>as a reſerve for your Second Paper.</hi> 3. <hi>When you are ſhewed how you for ſake your old fort,</hi> the ſole ſufficiency of Scripture, <hi>as if you were afraid to come too near us, you give back again, and do your worſt to diſcredit this</hi> living voice of the Church, <hi>ſo that in effect it ſtands but for a meer cipher, as I foreſaw it would when it came once to the ſcanning.</hi> 4. <hi>Upon ſecond thoughts, finding your error, by putting the</hi> Query, What is become of the living voice of the Church? <hi>you ſhuffle again, and would gladly make ſomething of it; but this ſomething, in the end, falls to juſt nothing, as I ſhall make it further appear by ripping up the particulars of this your laſt Anſwer.</hi>

                  <p>I have uſed no windings to avoid the difficulty of the <hi>firſt Query;</hi> but you are to know, that when I firſt anſwered it, I took the word
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108098:7"/>
                     <hi>Controverſie</hi> to relate only to ſuch Controverſies as depend between ſuch perſons as deny each other to have any preſent right to either the Name or Priviledges of the Church.

Till they be agreed, they cannot agree us. 3. And ſith you take not the Scripture as being of any authority, till they, as the Church, give it you; I demanded, by what you would agree them in their diviſions? 4.

And as for the holy Fathers, when there is any ſuch difficulty in any one of them, we muſt look upon the reſt what they ſay, and to follow their unanimous conſent: for if we take them ſingly, no doubt they have erred, and theſe errors we know by their diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the reſt; for otherwiſe, certainly the authority of any one of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108098:8"/>
antient Fathers, when he expounds Scripture, or relates the Chriſtian practice of his time, and is not cenſured or contradicted by the reſt, or condemned by the Church in a General Council, is of greater authority to decide Controverſies in point of Religion, or to know the true meaning of Scripture, than any thing you have alledged, as we ſhall ſee by and by, when I have firſt examined what you bring to diſcredit the Fathers and Councils.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Againſt the Fathers, you firſt bring St.</hi> Aug. retract. 21. <hi>contradicting himſelf by ſaying, that,</hi> Matth. 16. <hi>Chriſt built not his Church upon</hi> Peter, <hi>but upon</hi> Peter<hi>'s Faith: ſure you read not St.</hi> Aug. <hi>for he there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds that place of Chriſt himſelf, and not of the Faith of St.</hi> Peter; <hi>nor doth he recal his expounding it elſewhere of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>but leaves both Expoſitions as probable, concluding thus;</hi> Hunc autem ſententiam quae ſit probalitur eligat lector. <hi>Is this fair dealing? Again, you bring in St.</hi> Aug. contra. Petil. c. 2, 3, 4. <hi>as contrary to himſelf and me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he teaches, That the Church is to be found out by the words of Chriſt. But though (I doubt) you cannot make this appear in any of theſe three Chapters, yet were it nothing to the purpoſe; for we deny not but the Church is to be found out by theſe clear marks, whereby the holy Scripture hath deciphered her.</hi>

                  <p>

I Anſwer.</hi> 1. <hi>That it is the Opinion of the Learned, that neither St.</hi> Chryſoſt. <hi>nor indeed any Grecian, could be Author of that work.</hi> 2. <hi>I ſay, the Sacrament may be truly called the ſimilitude of Chriſt's Body and Blood, becauſe it is not given in the form of fleſh and blood, of which men would have a horror, as the ſame St.</hi> Amb. <hi>obſerves, but under the Forms of Bread and Wine.</hi>

But this was a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meeting, never owned for a Council, neither by the Greek nor Latine Fathers, and expreſly condemned in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council: and the jeſt is, this Mock-Council was ſo far from condemning Tranſubſtantiation as you affirm, that they ſwore by the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, to aboliſh the Worſhip of Images:</hi> [Something ſhould here have been ſaid concerning <hi>Bertram,</hi> who is ſaid to have oppoſed Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but in the tranſcription of my Third Paper, there was an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi> and the Inſtance is not material; ſo that what is ſaid about him, I will expunge in both Papers.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſay further againſt the Authority of Councils, That they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted each other in their Decrees, about the Laityes communicating in one or both kinds: But we grant that the Church may vary in Cuſtoms of this nature, which being indifferent, may be altered as ſhe ſhall think fit, according to ſeveral circumſtances: What we deny is, that the Church, or General Councils ever made contrary Decrees about the belief of any point of Faith.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is no wonder that you have a fling againſt the Pope, after you have been ſo bold with Holy Fathers, and General Councils; but I muſt tell you, Though many of our Divines hold him infallible, when he ſpeaks</hi> ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra, <hi>as they call it, yet is it not the Opinion of all, and conſequently no Article of our Faith. Only we agree in this, That for preſerving peace in the Church, all are bound ſo far to ſubmit to the Popes Decrees, as not to oppoſe them until a General Council be called, from whoſe Judgment we admit no Appeal. What you ſay of the wicked Lives of ſome of them, is nothing to the purpoſe; for as wicked</hi> Caiphas <hi>play'd the Prophet, ſo might the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>with the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, be true interpreters of God's Word, for all their wicked lives; ſuch</hi> Gratia gratis date, <hi>which are given for the good of others, do not argue his Sanctity that hath them.</hi>

                     <hi>To make you a true Prophet, I will here cry out, What is become of the living voice of the Church, ſince you have done what you can to diſcredit her, by caſting all the dirt you can in her face, as it is evident, unleſs you will throw out the Holy Fathers and General Councils (the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives) out of the Church!</hi>

                  <p>I perceive our Judgments differ concerning <hi>the living voice of the Church,</hi> what it is? I have told you, That I take it for the preſent Church and her Paſtours, in thoſe particular Ages wherein they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108098:9"/>
live. You take this <hi>living voice</hi> to be the Decrees of Councils, and Books of the antient Fathers. And here I cannot but marvel, why you ſhould be willing to Appeal <hi>to</hi> the Books of the Antients, and their written Decrees, as <hi>a living voice,</hi> and <hi>clear way</hi> to decide our Controverſies, and yet appeal <hi>from</hi> the Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as being <hi>but dead Letters, and ſenceleſs Characters.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any Writings now extant, may be called <hi>the Churches living voice,</hi> the Holy Scripture doth better deſerve that title than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor will it ſuffice here to object (as it is the Papiſts uſual way) that our difference is about the Scripture and the Senſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſame difference is found amongſt us, touching the Books and Senſe of Councils and Fathers: yea, I think I may be bold to ſay, That even the Learned are ſo much divided concerning them in both reſpects, as that they can never be therein reconciled.</p>
                  <p>But is it ſo? that the voice of the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who only ſpeak in their Writings, is a means or way of equal clearing to decide our differences, as the voice of a living Judge in a Caſe of Law amongſt men? Then what reaſonable man can render a reaſon, that the voices of the Prophets and Apoſtles, though only ſpeaking to us in their Books and Decrees, may not be appealed to, as a clear way to decide our differences? Sith all men, profeſſing Chriſtianity, muſt confeſs that the Prophets and Apoſtles ſpeak with as much Life and Power, Certainty and Authority, as any that ever writ ſince their time: No-whither now can you turn your ſelves, but to your ſelves (as I have formerly noted) and take upon you to be the <hi>only</hi> living voice, that muſt, without controul, interpret Fathers, Councils, and Scriptures too; and when you have done, ſit down as Judge, to give Sentence for your ſelves, and againſt your oppoſers.</p>
                  <p>Well, you have aſſigned us a Judge of Controverſies; To wit, the Fathers and Councils of the Church (long ago deceaſed) and this is a clear way, you ſay, to agree all. But I have noted that it's a very cloudy way, and that becauſe they could not yet agree them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they are oppoſite each to other to this day, inſomuch as you are utterly unable to reconcile them, ſince (as I have ſhewed) you muſt not make uſe of the Scripture to that purpoſe; becauſe, before the Scripture can have any authority to any purpoſe, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Judgment) your Councils muſt deliver it to us as the Word of God; which they cannot do till they be found, Firſt, holy Fathers and Councils of the Church; And ſecondly, at unity among themſelves, and each with himſelf. And I have asked you, How you will effect this difficult work? To which you Anſwer; Firſt,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108098:9"/>
                     <hi>That General Councils have no ſuch Controverſies as I talk of.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That when there is ſuch difficulty in any one of the Fathers, we muſt look upon the reſt what they ſay, and ſo follow their unanimous conſent; for</hi> (ſay you) <hi>if we take them ſingly, no doubt they have erred, and theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors we know by their diſſenting from the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt, That General Councils have erred, and that in matters of Faith, is undeniable, if Records may be credited rather than you. As firſt, The Council of <hi>Arimi.</hi> did err ſo, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <note place="margin">Theſe were both Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils</note> for the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, namely, That there was a time when Chriſt was not the Son of God: and ſure you account that an errour in point of Faith. Secondly, The Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did err ſo, as to conclude for the <hi>Eutichian</hi> Hereſie, namely, That the Body of Chriſt was not of one Subſtance with ours; and is not this an errour in point of Faith? Or will you ſay, that theſe things were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted and cenſured by other Councils? Theſe things are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by your eminent Diſputant. See the Book intituled, <hi>Certamen Religioſum.</hi> So then it appears, that General Councils have erred, and contradicted each another in very high points of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as to the things whereof I chiefly ſpake in my laſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it is manifeſt that Councils have contradicted one another about the Sacraments; for the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> confirmed by Pope <hi>Martin the Fifth,</hi> doth curſe the Laity, or excommunicate ſuch as receive the Sacrament in both kinds. And yet by the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the Laity are allowed to receive it in both; which Council was alſo confirmed by a Pope, namely, <hi>Felix the Fifth.</hi> Sure one of theſe Councils muſt needs err. But you have a way to ſalve this errour (ſuch as it is) and that is to tell me, <hi>That the Church may vary in cuſtoms of this nature.</hi> Sure this is a corrupt opinion, by which it will follow, That we have no certainty of, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in any Ordinance of Chriſt; for if the Church have power to take the Cup away, ſhe hath power alſo to take the Bread away; for certainly ſhe hath as much to do with the one, as the other. But truly this your variation, as it is clear beſide the Inſtitution of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11</note> Chriſt, and the Doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo it hath in a manner deſtroyed both Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord, as is evident by the practice uſed in divers of your <hi>Maſſes,</hi> where the People partake neither of the Bread nor Cup. As alſo your <hi>Peda-Rantiſm,</hi> hath in a great meaſure defrauded the Sons of men of the Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>But be pleaſed to conſider, that this your ſacrilegious diviſion of <note place="margin">Cyprian Serm. Penet.</note> this Sacrament, is condemned by <hi>Cyprian, Gelaſius,</hi> and others. Firſt,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108098:10"/>
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>How can we exhort the People to ſhed their blood for Chriſt, if we deny them the Blood of him?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gelaſ.</hi> conſec. Diſt. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The diviſion of this Mystery cannot be without great Sacriledge,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gelaſius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, you cannot be ignorant how the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the Books of <hi>Tobit, Judith, Eccleſiaſticus, Sapience,</hi> and <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> ſhould be received for Canonical, notwithſtanding they were rejected out of the ſacred Canon by the Council of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> and here by the way I may take notice, how you would have me walk by ſuch a rule as you your ſelf do not obſerve; for you propoſe the Judgment of thoſe who lived neareſt to the Apoſtles times, as my ſafeſt rule to walk by, ſuppoſing they knew the Mind of God, or Chriſt, better than thoſe that came after; but then why do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Judgment of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council, which is more antient than that of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which yet you follow in receiving the Books of <hi>Maccabees</hi> into your Canon of holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is marvellous to ſee, what work you make in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the Fathers without the Scriptures. And ſeeing you are ſo hardy as to undertake this task without Scripture, as undoubtedly you ſee you muſt, or elſe grant, that the Scripture muſt be that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt decide all Controverſies in Religion; for certainly, if we muſt decide all the Fathers Controverſies in Religion with or by the Scripture, it is not then very likely that either we or they ſhould decide ours without them: but I ſay, ſith you have undertaken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Fathers Differences without Scripture, pray tell me, before you meddle with their Differences, how you know them to be holy Fathers of the Church? can you prove them Church-members with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture? I believe this is as hard a task as to reconcile their Differences without Scripture; and yet this alſo muſt you do, before you can look upon the Scripture as any Rule for either them, or your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>You tell me, if I take the Fathers ſingly, no doubt they have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yet you ſay I muſt follow their unanimous Conſent, (a pretty Paradox) Follow their Conſent! in what? why ſay you, in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture. Of Scripture! Why there is no ſuch thing as yet for them to interpret; for you know (that by your own directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) we have laid by the Scripture, and muſt reconcile theſe Fathers by themſelves. Miſerable Guide! haſt thou not led me into a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, and run thy ſelf into a ſufficient Maze? I'le back again and ſee how theſe Fathers themſelves direct me in this difficult point. And firſt I meet with famous <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who tels me how he took
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108098:10"/>
notice of the Fathers that were before him. Saith he,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My conſent without exception I owe not to any Father, were he never</hi>

                     <hi>ſo well learned, but only to the Canonical Scripture: For whereas the Lord hath not ſpoken, who of us can ſay it is this or that? and if he do ſay ſo, how can he prove it?</hi> Yea, ſaith he, <hi>I require the voice of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd reade me this matter out of the Prophets, Pſalms, the Gospel, or</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> in <hi>Iohn.</hi> Tract. 94.</note> 
                     <hi>the Apoſtles Epiſtles. Neither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ought we to take the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions OF ALL MEN, how CATHOLICK SOEVER they be, or be they never ſo commendable as</hi> we take <hi>the canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as though we may not (ſaving the honour that's due to ſuch men) reprove or refuſe any thing of their Writings, if we find they meant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the Verity doth allow, by the help of God found by us, or by others.</hi> Again, he ſaith, <hi>I am not moved with</hi> Cyprian's <hi>Epiſtles; for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> ad <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>I do not take the Letters of</hi> Cyp. <hi>as the Canonical Scripture, but I do try his Writings BY THE CANONICAL SCRIPTURE; and whatſoever in them doth agree with the Authority of the holy Scripture, I do receive it with his Commendation; and whatſoever doth not——I do by his good leave refuſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for further teſtimony of <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s integrity, hear what he ſaith of himſelf: <hi>Truſt not me,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nor credit my Writings, as if they were Canonical Scripture, but whatſoever THOU findeſt in the Word, although thou didst not believe it before, yet ground thy Faith on it now; and whatſoever thou readeſt of mine, unleſs thou know it certainly to be true, give no certain aſſent unto it.</hi> Again, he thus teacheth, <hi>We</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Prolog. l. 3. de Trin.</note> 
                     <hi>muſt be partakers of other mens Writings, wholly after the manner of Bees; for they flie not alike to all Flowers, nor where they ſit do they ſnatch all quite away, but ſnatching ſo much as may ſerve to their honey-making, they take their leave of the reſt. Even ſo we, if we be wiſe, having gotten ſo much of others as is ſound and agreeable to Truth, we will leap over the reſt. Which rule, if we keep in reading and alledging the Fathers words, we ſhall not ſwerve from our Profeſſion, the Scriptures ſhall have the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign place, and yet the Doctors of the Church ſhall loſe no part of their due eſtimation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſaith <hi>Origen, We have need to bring the Scriptures for witneſs,</hi>

                     <hi>for our Meanings and Expoſitions without them, have no credit,——the diſcuſſing of our Judgements muſt be taken ONLY of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Fathers were not of your mind, that the Readers of their Books ſhould not try them by the Scripture, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that as we find them conſenting to, or diſſenting from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (not one another as you teach) accordingly they adviſe us to believe, or not believe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108098:11"/>
As I have ſaid, it is a cloudy way to appeal to Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo you now prove my ſaying true: for I alledged <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as being oppoſite to you and your Church, touching the meaning of <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Upon this Rock, &amp;c.</hi> and, firſt, you tell me I read him not; but I muſt tell you, I read him after a Scholar ſufficient: and though your reading differ ſomething from his, yet they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the received Opinion of your Church concerning that Text; for if Chriſt be that Rock, as you confeſs <hi>Auguſtine</hi> there teacheth, then it cannot be meant poſitively of <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo not conſequently of your Popes.</p>
                  <p>My quotation out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. you invalidate, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, that Book was not writ by him. And this I find to be the uſual way of Learned-men, when the paſſage alledged is clear and convincing, then a ſuſpition muſt be caſt upon the Book, &amp;c. I could inſtance the beſt part of a thouſand Books, Epiſtles, &amp;c. which are intituled under the names of the Antient Fathers; amongſt which, as you obſerve, is reckoned the Book of <hi>Dynis</hi> the Areopagite, which I alledged in my Rejoynder. And do not theſe things contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething towards the proof of my Aſſertion, namely, That it is a cloudy way to appeal to Fathers and Councils to decide Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Religion. If then your way be cloudy, mine muſt needs be clear, unleſs you can aſſign a third way, oppoſit to both; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there is a clear way to decide Controverſies.</p>
                  <p>You again preſcribe me a way to find the meaning of the Fathers, and that is, to <hi>explicate their obſcure places by ſuch as are plain,</hi> &amp;c. But by your leave, we can neither know which of their ſpeeches are obſcure or plain, without ſome rule whereby to know this. And now, what can ſupply this our neceſſity? For example, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read, affirming the Sacrament to be the real Body and Blood of Chriſt; otherwhiles he is read directly oppoſit to this: And how can you, or any body elſe, tell which of theſe ſayings is clear or obſcure, fith none muſt be permitted the uſe of his reaſon (by you) in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; and how he ſhould judge according to Faith, I know not, ſith you, as yet, debar us of that by which Faith NOW cometh, namely, the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles as contained in the Scriptures.</p>

                     <hi>Three things you affirm in relation to the Churches Authority.</hi> 1. <hi>That ſhe is to rule her ſelf according to Scripture; which no body denies.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Church in former Ages is not to be a Rule for after Ages to rule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by; becauſe ſhe could not foreſee the Controverſies that riſe up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. What if the ſame Errors be revived now, which in their times were condemned, is not the Judgment of the Church in thoſe dayes a ſafe Preſident for us to condemn the ſame Errors? Beſides, Is it not evident that the Paſtors of the Church, the nearer they were to Chriſt's time, were the better able to judge of Chriſt's Doctrine? You ſay, 3dly. That the Church is to be no Rule for thoſe that are out of her communion. A ſtrange Aſſertion. As if a clear light (as the Church is in holy Scripture) with ſo many marks to know her by; as Unity, Sanctity, Univerſality, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp;c. were not a good means for him that gropes in the dark to find out his way. Look well upon theſe marks, and you will find them to agree Only to the Roman Catholick Church, and to no upſtart Congregation, and conſequently, that you ought in all reaſon to give her the hearing in matters of Faith, and to have recourſe unto her, as to the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. <hi>which place you let ſlip, and this under pain of being accounted a Heathen, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>for though this place doth point out chiefly the obedience which Members of the Church owe her in point of Diſcipline, as you ſay well enough, yet hath it no ſmall force in our preſent Debate, ſince thoſe that will not hear her Voice when ſhe ecchoes out the Voice of God, may well be eſteemed by her as a Heathen. And in your own ſence I ſuppoſe you will have your</hi> proviſo, <hi>That the Church is to be obeyed only when ſhe ruleth according to God's Word, of which you will be Judge too: So in concluſion all comes to this, That you and your ſpirit must be Judge of all Diſputes. And then have not I reaſon to ask again (ſince I, or any body elſe, may challenge as large a ſhare in the Spirit and right Reaſon as you) who ſhall take up the Quarrel? And is not my compariſon here very pat, That there muſt needs be as great confuſion in your Church, as in a Kingdom where every one were left to decide his own caſe? This was not the old way, as you may ſee,</hi> Deut. 17. 8, 9. <hi>and</hi> Malach. 2. 7. <hi>which places you had no mind to take notice of: and yet you charge me for letting paſs your Inſtance of St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>concerning the</hi> Libertines, Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>&amp;c. which makes nothing at all for your pretended Evidence of God's Word: For though his Judgment might be well taken in expounding Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as being full of the holy Ghost, and confirming what he ſaid by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108098:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the Scripture tells us he did, yet this is not your caſe, for I think you will not arrogate ſo much to your ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What you ſay of Christ and his Apoſtles vindicating their Doctrine out of Scripture, is very true, and our Church doth the ſame: but it is not true, that either Christ, or the primitive Saints were alwayes wont to ſend their Proſelytes to the Scripture, to regulate their Faith. Did not Christ himſelf ſend St.</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Ananias <hi>for inſtruction? Had you been of his counſel, you would have rather wiſhed him to look into the Word of God, and ſee there what he was to do. And when there aroſe a Debate, even in the Apoſtles dayes, about the neceſſity of Circumciſion,</hi> Act. 15. <hi>did they not aſſemble the Church, and ſo pronounce Sentence</hi> conciliariter, <hi>with a</hi> viſum eſt Spiritui ſancto &amp; nobis?</p>

                  <p>[It is here worth noting how you diſpute beyond the due bounds of the <hi>Query,</hi> which, as it concerns you <hi>Papists</hi> and us <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> hath no relation to the Differences which ariſe in the Church, as ſuch, and indeed you go amiſs in this matter throughout the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.]</p>
                  <p>Here you ſeem to acknowledge, <hi>that the Church ought to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture;</hi> but you will allow me to judge whether ſhe do ſo or not. But I anſwer, that there is a Judgment of <hi>Science,</hi> as well as a Judgment <hi>Authoritative;</hi> the latter I know cannot be exerciſed by me, nor any other Member of the Church, becauſe this Power lyeth in the Church as imbodied together; but the former, to wit, a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Science or Knowledge, is particular to each individual, and ſo my ſelf, if a Member of the Church, am allowed the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even in matters of Religion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>I ſpeak to wiſe men: judge ye what I ſay.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not here give, any wiſe man at <hi>Corinth</hi> leave to judge of that which he ſaid, ſo as to cenſure what he had delivered, yet he muſt exerciſe his underſtanding to judge of what <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, thereby to find out the verity of what was ſpoken. But yet I do confeſs, that our caſe, and the caſe of Chriſtians then, do differ: for <hi>Paul</hi> was a Foundation-layer, a Maſter-builder, (ſo that the Members might not ſo well judge then, as now, yet) the Church now is to build upon the Foundation which is laid already: and you know that I have in my Rejoynder acknowledged, that it very nearly concerns particular Members of the Church, to have great regard to the Judgment of the Church, when, after ſerious debate, they deliver their Sentence in any point diſputable. And further (as touching your Church) you tell me anon, that even a Heathen may judge of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108098:12"/>
the <hi>holineſs</hi> of your Church, by the Law of Conſcience; and then, why may he not by the ſame Law judge your Church concerning her <hi>unholineſs?</hi> nay verily, he muſt be able to ſpeak both wayes, or elſe he hath no Judgment. And if a Heathen have this priviledge and ability, then why not a man profeſſing Chriſtianity, who hath not only the Conſcience-Law, but alſo the written Law of God, by which he underſtands things more excellent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. From all this I only conclude, that each particular ought to have the free exerciſe of his Judgment in what he chuſeth or refuſeth, ſith without this he cannot chuſe or refuſe any thing with confidence, nor to his comfort.</p>
                  <p>And concerning Controverſies in the Church, I do not ſee that (in theſe dayes) we are bound to follow the ſentence of a multitude, (though aſſembled in Council) SO, as to hold their Sentence abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely infallible; for the promiſe of infallibility is not made to a certain ſelect number <note n="*" place="margin">The Apoſtles are here excepted</note> of Biſhops, but to the Church, taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively; and we may remember that a great Aſſembly of Prophets in the old Church, erred in Judgment with unanimous conſent, when yet the Lord had one <hi>Micaiah</hi> at home which underſtood the truth of his Will. Wherefore I here conclude, although the Members of the Church ought to weigh with great reſpect the things concluded of by their Paſtors, yet ſo may it be that they may ſwerve from the Truth, whilſt God clears it up by ſome particular rather than by ſuch an Aſſembly. And to this agrees very well a ſaying of <hi>Gerſon, If it ſhould ſo happen that there ſhould be a General Council aſſembled, in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>FAITH, the ſaying of a LAY-Man ought to be preferred before that of the Pope, if his ſaying be more probable by better authority of Scripture than that of the Pope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You often tell me, that to appeal to the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scriptures, &amp;c. is not a ſufficient way to decide OUR Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and that becauſe you may challenge them to be for you, &amp;c. To which I anſwer, by retorting your Argument thus, That which you call <hi>the living Voice of the Church,</hi> to wit, Volumns of Fathers, and Decrees of Councils, is therefore inſufficient to decide OUR Controverſies, becauſe your oppoſites do ſay they are for them, and againſt you: and now you muſt anſwer your own <hi>Query,</hi> viz. <hi>Who muſt take up this Quarrel?</hi> You anſwer, that we muſt <hi>explicate them one by another; the places which are obſcure, by ſuch as are plain.</hi> And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108098:13"/>
then I ſtill ask you, why we may not as well agree our ſelves this way by the Volumns of the Prophets and Apoſtles?</p>
                  <p>I ſhewed before, how you miſapply that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and though the caſe is ſo plain, as that you cannot defend your ſelf, yet you ſeem loth to decline your error, and would faſten a very groſs paſſage upon me; namely, that I ſhould ſay, That the Church is <hi>no Rule for thoſe that are out of her Communion, as not to be a light for ſuch as grope in the dark.</hi> A manifeſt wrong; I only ſay and prove, That thoſe that are not of the Church, are not within the power of her Diſcipline; nor can ſhe reaſonably deſire unconverted ones to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to her Judgment-ſeat in Controverſies between them and her. And I asked you, If you would not ſcorn us, if we ſhould call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to appeal unto us as your Judges, <hi>Whether we, or you, be the Church?</hi> and not doubting but you would, I concluded, that it is equally abſurd for you, to deſire us to appeal to you as our Judges. But you may find it plain enough in my Papers, That I do believe the Church <hi>SO</hi> to be a Rule to the world, as to ſhew them the way of Life, and ſo a good means for their Illumination and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—</p>
                  <p>As for your three Texts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8, 9. <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. 7. As they do your cauſe no good, ſo they do mine no harm: I grant the Church is the pillar and ground of the Truth, and that ſhe hath Power to hear and determine all Controverſies among her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as aforeſaid; and that it is the duty of the Members, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their Paſtors, what is the way of God concerning them: But what of all this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only infallible Judge, and Moderatrix of all Contention about Religion. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we muſt all appeal to the Papal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as our Judge, in this Queſtion, <hi>Whether we be of the Church, or not?</hi> though we be in doubt, Whether ſhe her ſelf be a true Church, or not? yea, though we are ſatisfied ſhe is not. Are not theſe <hi>Monſtrous</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences?</p>
                  <p>Be it here obſerved, That I do believe the Church of Chriſt to be the Pillar of Truth, <hi>ſo,</hi> as that ſhe was never ſo over-clouded with error, but that ſhe hath enjoyed the fruition of that Promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. in ſome good meaſure ever ſince it was made: Nor ſhall ſhe ever <hi>ſo</hi> cloſe with the gates of Hell, as by general conſent, and full authority to diſſert that Faith, which having Chriſt for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is the Rock ſhe is built upon: and therefore you ſee, I hold the Church cannot err (in ſome ſenſe) and indeed, he that holds the contrary, muſt (for ought I ſee) raze out that Promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108098:13"/>
and many other. And yet nothing from all this accrues to the Papal Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I alledged <hi>Stephen,</hi> as defending the Truth by the authority of Scripture <hi>Only, &amp;c.</hi> Nor can it be groundedly imagined, that (had it been the mind of God, <hi>that ſuch as are not of the Church,</hi> ſhould be ſummoned to her Tribunal) <hi>Stephen</hi> (being full of the holy Spirit, the leader into all truth) would have omitted the uſe of that means, but he knew that ſuch authority the Church had none, as I ſhewed from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>What have I to do to judge them that are without? do not ye alſo judge them that are within?</hi> And therefore he could not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſuch power. And though <hi>Stephen</hi> did many wonders among the People, yet at this time when he ſo powerfully vanquiſhed his adverſaries, he did none at all, but only overcame them by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deſired you to ſhew me <hi>but one</hi> Inſtance, where ever any of the Primitive Saints did appeal to the Church, of which they were preſent Members, as Judge between them and ſuch as never received their Doctrine: but you have not done it, nor indeed can it be done. As I ſhewed, that <hi>Stephen</hi> appealed to Scripture <hi>ONLY, &amp;c.</hi> ſo I alſo ſhewed, That it was the way of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, frequently to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Doctrine <hi>againſt ſuch as were not of their Church,</hi> by appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptue (eſpecially amongſt ſuch as owned the Scripture) this you confeſs; and alſo you tell me, that your Church doth the ſame: But this cannot be true of <hi>All</hi> your Doctrine, becauſe you have told me, That <hi>many Points of your Faith are reſolved without the written Word of God;</hi> or elſe you never anſwered my firſt <hi>Antiquery,</hi> which demandeth, What Controverſie in Religion you can reſolve without the written Word of God? And in your Anſwer you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, The Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son, Sabbath, Infant-Baptiſm, and MANY OTHER POINTS OF FAITH; and I ſhall ſhew anon, that we have it <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> from your Champions, that there be ſome Points of your Faith, which is not GROUNDED UPON, nor MENTIONED IN the SCRIPTURES; and therefore your Church cannot vindicate ſuch Points of her Faith and Doctrine by the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Although Chriſt ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ananias</hi> for inſtruction, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that we muſt take <hi>Romes</hi> inſtructions without Scripture. Is there no difference between the time that now is, and then was? Much of the Scripture (if not all the New Teſtament) was then unwritten. Again, <hi>Ananias</hi> was immediatly ſent of God. If you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108098:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are <hi>ſo</hi> ſent, prove it to us, as <hi>Ananias</hi> did, by ſhewing the Miracle of reſtoring <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſight. If you are not <hi>ſo</hi> ſent, to what purpoſe do you alledge this Text? I believe I might form you a <hi>monſirous Conſequence</hi> here.</p>

                     <hi>You that will not truſt the Churches Judgment, lay down four wayes of reſolving Doubts; The firſt,</hi> To argue it out till Truth prevail. <hi>But if we muſt argue only out of Scripture, and be our own Interpreters of it, there can be no end of arguing, as I have often ſhewed.

                  <p>You here wrong us, to ſay, that we will not truſt the Judgment of the Church; for the Church, truly and univerſally taken, we do cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as her that is appointed of the Father, to be the Pillar and Ground of the Truth; of which Church, we take the Prophets and Apoſtles to be the principal Members, and ſo in all Points of Faith, to be credited in the firſt place. But if by Church, you mean the Papal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I confeſs we dare not truſt her Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt, not in all that ſhe ſaith; for example theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 1. Your Church tells us, That it is not needful for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be read to, or by the Laity, in a tongue which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: and that though they Pray (after another) in Latine, though they underſtand not what they ſay, yet ſuch prayer is ſufficient, <hi>Rhem. Teſt. Annot. in</hi> 1 <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 2. Your Church tells us, That the Sacrifice of your Maſſe, is available to take away, or obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins by the work wrought. <hi>Con. Trident. Seſs.</hi> 22. That the whole Maſſe is a propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and dead; and whoſo ſaith, it is only a commemoration of Chriſt's Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is accurſed. <hi>Con. Trent.</hi> 3. Your Church holds, That ſuch as deny that the real Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, is in the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament, ought to be burnt to death. 4. Your Church holds, and tells us, That Images, and old clothes of Saints, ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with religious Worſhip. 5. That men are AS FULLY Juſtified by good Works, AS THEY ARE DAMNED BY
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108098:14"/>
evil Works. 6. That it is unlawful for Miniſters of Chriſt to Marry. 7. That the Scripture doth not contain all things neceſſary to Salvation. To omit many other, theſe are Points of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Judgment, which we dare not truſt, till by you, or ſome other, proved to be Truths.</p>
                  <p>I aſſigned the uſe of Lots as lawful in ſome doubtful caſes to end Controverſies, and for proof, I quoted <hi>Acts</hi> 7. and this you will not allow for two Reaſons. 1. Becauſe (you ſay) the Apoſtles were inſpired to uſe them; but were it ſo (as that you cannot prove) yet it cannot be denied, but we may do ſome things which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to do: for the Holy Ghoſt was to lead them into all Truth, and they were to lead us into the ſame Truth, by their Example and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, 2. And be it here obſerved, That the Holy Ghoſt led thoſe, our Teachers, to ordain the Miniſtry by Prayer, and laying on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 6, and <hi>Acts</hi> 13. which practice of theirs, is a good preſident to act by; a preſident I ſay; for this practice is not expreſly commanded in Scripture, no more than the uſe of Lots in the election of Miniſters. If it here be objected, That Chriſt might give <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in Precept when he was with his Apoſtles. I Anſwer, So alſo might he give them the other to be uſed, when there might be perſons found of ſeemingly equal fitneſs to ſerve the Church. 2. You reckon the uſe of Lots, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Miracles, as your other Reaſon, why we may not uſe them to decide any Controverſie; but why you ſhould ſo do, I ſee no more reaſon, than to ſay <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. mention'd any Miracles towards the compoſure of the difference between the two Tribes, and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> where in truth no ſuch thing can be found, though you ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</p>

                  <p>I have ſaid enough to ſatisfie any reaſonable man, that it doth not follow from my alledging <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. that I ſend you, or any body elſe, to Heaven for Miracles to decide our Controverſies. For at the firſt I ſhewed, that in the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> there was Miracle againſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; only God gave a note of diſtinction between thoſe ſigns, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the Serpent that came of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod devoured the other: from whence I only noted, That it's God's way to give ſome power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful note of diſtinction, between the Witneſs of his Servants, and Deceivers. And now, is not this my Obſervation very pertinent to our caſe? You ſay, you are the Church. We ſay, we are the Church. Here is Teſtimony againſt Teſtimony, as there was Miracle againſt Miracle; and if the Lord do not now give ſome powerful note of diſtinction between our Doctrine and yours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church, as he did between <hi>Stephen's</hi> and the <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> I pray, who muſt take up the quarrel between <hi>U S?</hi> Is it fit that you ſhould be Judge in your own caſe here? If ſo, why may not we? If the Councils and Fathers were of the Papal Church, then it is not any more reaſonable that you ſhould ſummon us to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitriment, than it is for us to ſummon you to the Judgment of our Predeceſſors; but foraſmuch as <hi>you</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are agreed, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles were infallibly aſſiſted to write the Mind of God for us to obſerve; therefore it's moſt reaſonable that we ſhould both appeal to them. If you object, the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not alive to interpret their Writings, and that our difference is about the ſenſe thereof; I Anſwer, This objection is every way as forceable againſt the Decrees of Councils, and Volumns of Fathers; for their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings muſt be interpreted, expounded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we differ about the meaning of them. Secondly, the way you aſſign us to agree them, is to conſult them together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I would know, why we may not be allowed this way to ſeek out the meaning of the Prophets and Apoſtles? In a word, there is not one Objection which yet I have met with, levelled againſt our appealing to holy Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the only infallible means to decide all Controverſies between YOU and US; but the ſame objections are more forceable againſt all that you appeal to, for deciſion of the ſaid Controverſies.</p>

                  <p>You will ſtill have your Miracles to be an infallible mark of the truth of your Church, eſpecially thoſe of the Bleſſed Virgin (you mean the Image ſo called at <hi>Loreto)</hi> or as you phraſed it in your third Paper, <hi>The Lady of Loreto.</hi> But let me tell you, that there is ſmall cauſe you ſhould refer me to what is done there, as an infallible mark that your Church is the Church of Chriſt. For by the relation of two eye-witneſſes, which I have read, it is a place of moſt groſs Idolatry, blind devotion, and deceit. One of which Authors, was once a Teacher of your Church, who, before his ſeparation from you, travelled to <hi>Loreto,</hi> to ſee if the <hi>Image of the Virgin</hi> would inform him of the truth or falſhood of the Roman Church, as it is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; for he was doubtful in this matter, and had been informed, that if any perſon were guilty of Mortal ſin (which if the Papal Church be the Church of Chriſt, he concluded he muſt needs be guilty of, in queſtioning her, at leaſt in the Judgment of the Fryers, who waited there upon that <hi>Image)</hi> he had been informed (I ſay) that if ſuch as were guilty of Mortal ſin, did but pray before the Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Image</hi> would either bluſh, or fall into a ſweat, and ſo reſolve the Petitioner in the affirmative. But if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and this <hi>Informant,</hi> then it is no Mortal ſin to think, that the Papal Church is not the Church of Chriſt: For this doubtful man prayed earneſtly, and beheld the Lady as ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but no ſweat nor change befel her at all. Therefore, according to the Fryers rule, it is no Mortal ſin to think the Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But this one thing is eſpecially obſervable here, That whereas you would perſwade your ſelf, and others, that I ſend men to Heaven for Miracles to decide Controverſies; it is manifeſt that you are the man that is herein guilty: For the Controverſie is, <hi>Whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>be the Church of Chriſt?</hi> You affirm; I deny. To decide this Controverſie, you refer me to Miracles, as the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108098:16"/>
ſpecial means, or chief mark, whereby I may be reſolved in this matter, as is evident in this, and your two former Papers; So that what you would caſt upon me, falls clearly upon your ſelf, ſave that, inſtead of ſending me to Heaven, you ſend me to <hi>Loreto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[In my Rejoynder I urged, <hi>that of neceſſity the Scripture muſt decide all our Controverſies, as aforeſaid; becauſe, as things now ſtand, the Word (or Scripture) is antecedent to the Church, ſo that inaſmuch as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find the Church without the Scripture, it ſuppoſes clearly that the Scripture muſt be found before the Church: and ſo, if the Scripture must of neceſſity reſolve this great Controverſie about the Church, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently followeth that they must reſolve all Controverſies; becauſe all Religious Controverſies are involved in this one general Query,</hi> Where is, and who are the Church?]</p>
                  <p>Something here, which the Adverſary doth further write, is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe it may be more fitly taken notice of afterward.</p>

                     <hi>I had reaſon to take notice of your general ſaying, that the Word was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Faith and the Church, ſince there was a Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Faith before the Scripture was written. Now it ſeems you meant not the Scripture by the Word, but I know not what Word, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward committed to writing. It is paſt my underſtanding what Word you mean; for ſince it cannot be</hi> Verbum Scriptum <hi>before it be written, It muſt either be</hi> Verbum Traditum, <hi>and I ſuppoſe you will not allow that; or</hi> Verbum Dei Patris; <hi>and that cannot be the Word you ſpeak of, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing.</hi>

                  <speaker>BAPTIST.</speaker>
                  <p>By that Word which was antecedent to Faith and the Church, as it relates to the Church under the Patriarchs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean the Word which God ſpake to them, and by them, at ſundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</note> manners. And if you take that term <hi>[Word]</hi> to relate to the Church of Chriſt in its plantation, then I ſpeak partly of the written Word of God, and partly of that which was (at that time) only ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by word of mouth, by Chriſt and his faithful Stewards; and if you will call this part of the word, <hi>Verbum Traditum,</hi> I ſay, that is the Word I ſpeak of. And I do alſo ſay, this Word was afterward committed to writing; which Word, together with the former, I mean that of the Prophets, is that whereon the Church (as now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) is founded <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Not denying Chriſt to be her foundati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on in the main.</hi> Eph. 2. 20.</note>, by which ſhe muſt be known. And in this ſenſe, I ſay, the holy Scripture is now antecedent to the Church. And therefore well ſpake that Learned perſon, <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> when he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108098:16"/>
forewarned the ſons of men, that if they took heed to any thing, in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chriſoſt. Hom. in</hi> Mat. 24</note> order to their knowing the Church (in the latter times) beſide Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they would fall headlong into the Abomination which maketh deſolate, and not be able to know the true Church.</p>

                  <p>I Think it meet here to give the Reader ſome account of my Judgment of theſe five Texts, which I brought to juſtifie my Anſwer to the firſt <hi>Query;</hi> which, with my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> was as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Whether we are to reſolve all Differences in point of Religion, only out of the written Word of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Spirit ſpeaking in the Scripture, together with right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as truely ſubſervient, is that whereby we are to reſolve all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, &amp;c. For proof I cited, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9, 10. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. where note, that under the term <hi>We,</hi> ought not to be underſtood, any perſon but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the one part, and the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> on the other, who do deny each other to be the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Church is to defend her ſelf againſt all that come to ſpoil her of her Church-ſtate, by the Scripture onely (as that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes her whole ſtrength) is that which I brought theſe Texts to prove.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. The Prophet foreſeeing a Judgment coming upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even ſuch, as God would hide himſelf from them; and the Law and Teſtimony ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108098:17"/>
be like a Book bound and ſealed up; as ver. 16 &amp; 17. compared with ch. 29. 11, 12. The Prophet likewiſe foreſeeing, that when God ſhould hide his face, <hi>Iſrael</hi> would enquire of Wiſards, and ſuch as ſpoke from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Spirits (as <hi>Saul</hi> did, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like judgment, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6, 7, 8.) wherefore the Prophet, that he might warn the remnant of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, whom he foreſaw would be as wonders amongſt the reſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, as from the Lord, that WHEN men ſhould ſay unto them, Seek unto ſuch as have familiar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to go to the LAW, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their way to go to God himſelf: for ſaith he, <hi>Should not a People ſeek unto their God? To the LAW, &amp;c.</hi> and certifies them that by that they ſhould know Deceivers; for, ſaith he, <hi>If they ſpeak not according to This Word,</hi> [the Law] <hi>there is no light in them:</hi> So that I infer thus much, that when ſuch as are enemies to the Church come to invade the Saints with their deceit, the only infallible way to know them to be Deceivers, is, to enquire of God's Law and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. I know that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the Teſtimony or ſtanding Oracle, beſide the written Law. And the <hi>Church</hi> now hath the new Teſtimony open in the <hi>Church,</hi> beſide the Law &amp; Prophets; &amp; hereunto, I ſay, the Church is only to apply her ſelf, as aforeſaid, to find out the deceit of thoſe who would rob her of that inheritance, which ſhe holdeth by the deeds of God's Law, and Promiſes, contained in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108098:17"/>
Scripture; by theſe, as the <hi>only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule,</hi> ſhe knows thoſe to be lyars, <hi>who ſay they are the Church, and are not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to this agrees the next three Scriptures, the very reading where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſheweth, that when the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is between the Church and ſuch as pretend falſly to that Title, the onely infallible means to refel them, is, the <hi>Spirit ſpeaking in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thus ſaith the firſt of them: <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſom words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine that is according to Godlineſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ſaith the ſecond, <hi>He that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth not us. Hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the ſpirit of Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ſaith thus, <hi>Whoſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrin of Christ, hath not God. He that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God-ſpeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe Texts it appears, that unleſs the <hi>Papiſts</hi> can produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which they can infallibly prove to be Chriſt's Doctrine, beſide what is contained in holy Scripture; or, that the Apoſtles may be heard as infallibly by ſome other means, as by the holy Scripture; or, that the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108098:18"/>
Saints received ſome Doctrine for Chriſts, that is not contained in the Scripture; I ſay, unleſs they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſhew ſomething of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, my Anſwer is good. But if they can produce any other thing of ſuch authority, then I acknowledge my Anſwer to be deficient. Howbeit, if any man, or the Church her ſelf, do decide a Controverſie, by inſiſting upon the Scripture, this is no more than my Anſwer included; for I do not imagine that the Church muſt not pronounce what is contained in the Scripture: but if ſhe hath power to ſpeak as from the Lord (in theſe dayes) when yet the Scripture ſaith no ſuch thing, then I profeſs my ſelf ſhort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the power of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. I only made uſe of this Text thus far, that in Religious Controverſies the Apoſtle gives Reaſon her place, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be delivered from unreaſonable men.</p>

                     <hi>ONce more you offer to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Conſequences drawn out of the five Texts. But I ask once more, To what purpoſe did you bring them? was it not to prove what you had ſaid in your</hi> Anſwer <hi>to my</hi> Query, <hi>That the Scripture, ſo we took right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon along with us, was ſufficient to reſolve all Controverſies in matters of Faith? No rational man can reade your first Paper but muſt think ſo; and indeed, otherwiſe you must have brought them to prove ſomething that was not under debate, which had been impertinent. Must not that very Aſſertion of yours be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to theſe five Texts? and them, have I not reaſon to cry out, that there never appeared ſuch Monſtrous Conſequences? But, to avoid this inconvenience you fall into the other, and will have ſome of your Texts brought to prove certain Propoſitions, which you had not mentioned in your</hi> Anſwer. <hi>Howſoever, let us now ſee what you make of them.</hi> Iſa. 8. 20. <hi>God's People are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have recourſe</hi> rather <hi>to the Law, &amp;c. than to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Oracles,</hi> Ad Legem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, &amp;c. <hi>And they have a ſign
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108098:17"/>
given them to convince ſuch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of falſhood, if they ſpeak not according to the Word or</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie <hi>of</hi> Iſaiah. <hi>This is the clear ſenſe of that place, out of which you draw this ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Scripture, &amp;c. is to reſolve all matters of Faith. A ſtrange Conſequence, I ſay, as will appear, if we turn your Euthymeme into a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, thus: Recourſe is to be had rather to the Law; than to falſe Oracles, whoſe falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood appears, if they ſpeak not according to the Word or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of</hi> Iſaiah. <hi>But if this be ſo, the</hi> Scriptures, &amp;c. <hi>are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all points of Faith.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. <hi>What a prodigious</hi> minor <hi>have we here? How doth it follow, that becauſe God's Word is to be more credited than ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitioas Oracles; or, that ſuch Oracles are not to be credited, when they ſpeak againſt God's Word: Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c. are to reſolve all points of Faith. I know you have not the word</hi> rather <hi>in your Engliſh Tranſlation as we have in ours, but the clear ſenſe of the place bears as much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 Tim. 6. 3. <hi>ſaith, they are proud that teach contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> Ergo, <hi>you infer that the Scripture is to judge whoſe Doctrine is of pride.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108098:17"/>
This is as mad a concluſion as the laſt; for when there is no clear Text of Scripture for either ſide, as it often happens, or Scripture brought on both ſides; How can the Scripture judge whether par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be proud? or, how can it be judge of its own ſenſe, when it is alledged on both ſides, who both pretend to have the Spirit and Reaſon on their ſides?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 John 4. 6. <hi>Thoſe that hear not the Apoſtles, are not of God, nor have his Spirit.</hi> Ergo, <hi>ſay you, the Scripture reſolves who are religious: Doth it follow out of this Text, that when parties contend, that they hear the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, the Scripture, can reſolve the difference, and pronounce who are religious? &amp;c. Not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 John 9. 10. <hi>Gives Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt thoſe that follow not Chriſt's Doctrine. You infer</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go <hi>the Scripture muſt try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men bring this Doctrine. Strange Logick: for unleſs your Text proved that the Scripture containes all Chriſt's Doctrine, which it doth not, your Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt needs be faulty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 Theſſ. 3. 2. <hi>you ſay proves, that Reaſon is ſome wayes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to decide Controverſies in Religion. I will not examine the goodneſs of this Conſequence, but I am ſure you need not have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108098:18"/>
brought Scripture to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo manifeſt a Truth, which cannot be denied by any, but ſuch as pretend to have ſo much of the Spirit, that me-thinks they ſhould have little need of the uſe of Reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>Concerning my five Texts, and what I infer thence, <hi>I</hi> need not ſpeak much here; yet it is worthy obſerving how apparantly you miſs the clear ſenſe of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. whilſt you reſtrain the relatives [this word] to the Word or Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> whereas it is as clear as the Sun at noon, that they ought to be referr'd to the Law and Teſtimony; for thus <hi>I</hi> read, <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony, if they ſpeak not according to This Word.</hi> Having thus miſſed the ſence of the Text, then in all that you ſay further, you diſcover a taunting ſpirit, endeavouring to beſpatter me with what dirt comes next to hand.</p>
                  <p>I did not quote any one of the <hi>five Texts,</hi> as taking it ſingly to prove the whole Aſſertion; and therefore you did injure my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to argue from them apart, as brought to prove the whole Poſition; but I brought them to prove ſuch Propoſitions, as being laid together, do amount to ſo much as my Aſſertion (as I explicate it) doth contain. For the firſt <hi>four Texts</hi> do <hi>all of them</hi> ſhew, how God's People ought to try and defend themſelves againſt ſuch as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church and Truth of God, as I ſhewed in my <hi>Rejoynder:</hi> and the <hi>fifth,</hi> gives Reaſon her place in Religious Conteſts. But there is not one of the Arguments which I formed from my <hi>five Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> but you deprave and abuſe it, by both adding terms of your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108098:18"/>
own, and omitting mine; yea, ſometimes whole ſentenoes: and when you have ſo done, you flout at the Concluſions. Which deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is too bad for a ſober Diſputant,</p>
                  <p>It were a very eaſie thing to turn all your Objections here againſt the Scripture as inſufficient to reſolve differences in Religion, upon the Church as therefore inſufficient to reſolve them. For, whereas you ſay, That when both Parties pretend to have Scripture and Reaſon on their ſides, then the Scripture cannot decide the Controverſie; Might not I as well ſay, when both parties pretend to have the Church on their ſide (as that's the caſe between us) the Church then cannot decide our difference?</p>
                  <p>Again, where you ſeem to ſay, that when both parties contending, do ſay they hear the Apoſtles, that then the Apoſtles cannot (as they ſpeak in the Scriptures) decide the Controverſie: Hath not this the ſame force againſt the Church, when both parties contend they hear the Church? See how you can defend your ſelf, and I doubt not but therein you will defend my Arguments for the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe you do cry up the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſo clear a way to decide all our Controverſies, I will therefore ſhew you, that they do clearly avouch the <hi>Anſwer</hi> which I have given to this your firſt <hi>Query,</hi> as will evidently appear to the impartial Reader of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quotations which I have before alledged, and which do here follow.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantine Mag.</hi> There are the Goſpel, the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which do teach us what to hold in Religion; wherefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling all hoſtile and bitter contention, let us ſeek the Solution of theſe Queſtions out of the Scriptures. Thus ſpake this famous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> at what time the Biſhops had like to have jarred into pieces.</p>
                  <p>THus have I given an impartial Relation of what hath paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Popiſh Queriſt</hi> and my <hi>Self,</hi> in our <hi>two laſt Papers,</hi> (which contains the ſum of what paſſed in the other) as touching this Queſtion about the Judge of Controverſies. And now, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction, That the Scripture, as aforeſaid, ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the high Prerogative of Judge in our Debates; conſider, that <hi>of neceſſity it muſt be ſo.</hi> My reaſon is, becauſe either the Scripture, or ſome other Writings, muſt be our Judge, eſpecially in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Queſtion, <hi>WHICH IS THE TRUE CHURCH?</hi> For when we contend about her, it is very unreaſonable, that any party
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108098:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contending for that title, ſhould be permitted to give Judgment in their own cauſe: As for example, The preſent Aſſembly of <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, <hi>That they are the true Church:</hi> and the preſent Aſſemblies of <hi>Baptiſts</hi> ſay, <hi>That they are the true Church.</hi> Is it fit that either party contending, ſhould here give Judgment deciſſive? What then muſt we do? why <hi>of neceſſity</hi> we muſt to ſome Writings, whereby to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided or agreed in this Controverſie. Theſe Writings muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scriptures, or ſome other; but no other can compare with thoſe, ſo that they do deſerve this Prerogative better than any other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ordinary way in this difficulty, is to tell us, that we muſt here be tryed by the Tradition of our Fore-fathers; in which they ſay, <hi>we cannot be deceived:</hi> which Tradition, they ſay, <hi>is the only thing that is unqueſtionable, and needs no other ground to ſtand upon, but</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>it ſelf.</hi> And againſt the Scripture's being received, upon its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or authority, they uſually do thus object, <hi>that before we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what it teacheth, we muſt be aſſured of its truth.</hi> And again, <note place="margin">T. B. <hi>End to Contro.</hi>
                     </note> they ſay, <hi>the Scripture may not be the Judge of Controverſie, becauſe it may be corrupted, tranſlated, ill interpreted, not rightly underſtood.</hi> And by theſe, and other like objections, they uſually in all their Writings, invalidate the Scriptures certainty, authority, and ſufficiency, that ſo they advance the authority of their Traditions.</p>
                  <p>But let it be ſeriouſly conſidered, whether theſe Objections have not the ſame force againſt what they reſt upon, which they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Scripture? Firſt then, whereas they tell us, <hi>the Scripture cannot teach us any thing, till we be aſſured of its truth:</hi> Doth not this conclude againſt any other thing as ſtrongly? Ought we not to be aſſured of the truth of the Church before we receive her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments? Ought we not to be aſſured of the truth of that Tradition which we receive for the Rule of our Faith? But how muſt we be aſſured of the truth of the Papal Church, and Tradition? There is not a man living, that can remember when either began, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch its beginning to be of <hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> and the continnance of the ſame ever ſince its beginning, to have been without any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: What then muſt we do? Why we muſt ſearch <hi>Romes</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. And then I ask, are they not as queſtonable, and liable to miſ-interpretations, as eaſily miſ-underſtood as the Records of God? What is now become of theſe Objections, the force whereof is evidently againſt the Papal Church and her Traditions, of the truth whereof we muſt be aſſured BEFORE we can be taught by either of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:108098:20"/>
I ſay again, There is not a man of all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that can evidence <hi>Rome</hi> to have been a Church two hundred years ago, and then much leſs one thouſand ſix hundred years ago. So that <hi>OF NECESSITY</hi> we muſt to the Writings of ſome men (whom we never ſaw write one word) to find the Church. And then <hi>I</hi> would know why we may not make enquiry at the Pen of <hi>Paul,</hi> what the Church was at firſt, and what it ought to be now, as well as at the Pen of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Cannot the Pen of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle give us as good information in this matter, as the Pen of any <hi>Pope,</hi> pretending to be his Succeſſor? If the <hi>Papiſts</hi> anſwer, That we know not the Pen of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul:</hi> We anſwer, as well as they know the Pen of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or <hi>Gregory.</hi> If they ſay <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writings may be corrupted, and muſt be interpreted, may be miſ-underſtood. <hi>I</hi> return the ſame Anſwer of all other Books whatſoever; yea, thoſe which contains <hi>Romes</hi> Tradition. See therefore what is gained by deviſing objections againſt the authority or certainty of the holy Scriptures. Such doings do only tend to the deſtruction of all Faith, making every thing doubtful, and the effect is the uſhering in of all uncleanneſs on the one hand, or if men miſs this ſnare, they are catched in another, <hi>viz.</hi> to walk at random as their own, or other mens fancy leads them. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by what we have ſeen in the <hi>Ranters</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> on the other.</p>
                  <p>Let us trace this matter a little further, thus. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (moſt, if not all of which, have been committed to Writing ſeveral hundreds of years ago) muſt ſpeak for themſelves, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable of themſelves, muſt challenge no ground but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtand upon: But the ſacred Scripture which hath eſpecial Promiſe from God for its preſervation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. muſt have none of theſe high priviledges allowed it; Is not this a moſt peccant Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Again, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be no Judges of Controverſies in Religion, as they ſpeak to us in their Epiſtles; but the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> dead long ago, and now only ſpeak in their Writings, yet they muſt be our infallible Judges in theſe Controverſies. The great Council of Apoſtles, Elders, and Brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. can be no Judge of any Controverſie, though their Decrees are yet extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; but the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who only ſpeak in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, muſt be our Judge, and that <hi>ſo</hi> as from their Judgments no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal can be admitted. The Apoſtolical Council ſends forth their Decrees in the Name of the holy Ghoſt, and themſelves; and in thoſe their Decrees, they prohibit the eating of blood, and ſtrangled things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Papal Councils will ſend forth a Decree directly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108098:20"/>
oppoſite to this, and yet ſign'd with theſe powerful words; <hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis.</hi> If we appeal in this matter to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Council, they may not be permitted to pronounce a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence deciſſive. But <hi>from</hi> the ſentence of the Papal Council we muſt in no wiſe appeal. Can any thing be ſaid more unworthily?</p>
                  <p>Thus then, Firſt, the godly Reader may perceive, That whether he be able to anſwer all the cunning Objections that men, by reaſon of the long experience they have had in the wayes of deceit, have found out; yet he hath an Argument of <hi>NECESSITY</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to oppoſe their ſubtilty. And, Secondly, he hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all their own objections, againſt themſelves; yea, againſt their Church, Tradition, and all that they ſtand upon. Being ſeaſonably retorted upon them. Wherefore I ſhall conclude with the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> words,</p>

               </head>
               <p>VVE have heard of how dangerous a Conſequence that Papal Opinion is, which leads them to ſet up their own Authority (under pretence of their being the Church) above the holy Scripture; inſomuch as they allow it no Authority, till it be delivered to us for God's Word, by their Church; ſo that by this Doctrine, we muſt find their Church, before we can find the Word of God, as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Upon which Conſideration, we ſhall endeavour to ſhew, That the preſent Papal Church, is not the true Church of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what Power ſoever the Church hath, yet they cannot have it; Becauſe they are not the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>The Firſt Reaſon.</head>
                  <p>The preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot poſſibly prove her ſelf to be the Church of Chriſt: Therefore ſhe is not the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>The Firſt Reaſon maintained.</head>
                  <p>THe Conſequence of the Argument no underſtanding man can deny; for unleſs a party pretending to be the Church of Chriſt, can ſome wayes ſufficiently prove that they are his Church, they cannot reaſonably blame any body that refuſes ſo to account of them. And for the Antecedent, namely, that it is impoſſible for the preſent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108098:21"/>
Papal Church to prove her ſelf the Church of Chriſt, it is evident from this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> They make both the Scripture, and all other Writings, depend on their Church for their Authority; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt prove themſelves to be the Church without the help of any authentical or authoritative Writings; which thing is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to do.</p>
                  <p>Being thus diveſted of the help of all Records, as is more fully ſhewed above, there remains now nothing for them to lean upon but their own Evidence, or the Tradition of their Fore-fathers; not that which is contained in any Records, but only that which hath been delivered by word from man to man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alas! what Tradition is this they ſpeak of? Not the Tradition of the Church to us, till the perſons delivering the ſame, be found to be the Church; which, as before, they cannot be found to be, without the Scripture. And for their own Evidence, that may not prove them to be the Church to thoſe that contend with them; it cannot avail them, ſith each party contending in this caſe, will, and may, as reaſonably as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> look that their own Teſtimony ſhould be as available for theſe, as the other for thoſe.</p>
                  <p>It is as vain here to tell us, they are the Church, becauſe the true marks of the Church do agree to the Papal Church, and none elſe. For, firſt, the true marks of the Church are confeſſed by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to be found in the Scripture; which Scripture they receive not, but from the authority of their Church <hi>(yea, their preſent Church)</hi> ſo <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Author of the</hi> 7. <hi>Queries</hi>
                     </note> that till the Scripture can tell us authoritatively which be the marks of the Church, no Church can be found by thoſe marks; nor can the Scripture tell us of thoſe marks authoritatively, till <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Church, give it us for God's Word: So then <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be found the Church, before there be any marks to find her by; which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>As for example: To clear this matter further, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, <hi>That Holineſs is a mark of the true Church:</hi> But now ſet the Holy Scripture aſide, and how ſhall I know <hi>holineſs</hi> from <hi>unholineſs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture? Here the <hi>Papiſts</hi> being in a ſtrait, rather than they will let the Law of God, or the Scripture, have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, do Anſwer thus; That <hi>we have a Law in our Conſciences, which</hi>

                     <hi>dictates what is good, and what is otherwiſe; and by this Law, even a Heathen may judge our Church holier than any other Congregations of Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a miſerable plunge (of <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> or <hi>Quakeriſm)</hi> are they brought to here? How do they know that a <hi>Heathen</hi> may, by the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108098:22"/>
Law of Conſcience, judge their Church to be more holy than <hi>ANY</hi> other Congregation of Chriſtians? Were they ever <hi>Heathens</hi> to know this? But alas! what holineſs can a <hi>Heathen</hi> judge of? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not that which is an infallible mark of the true Church; for this Spiritual matter is fooliſhneſs to the Natural man, nor can he know it, becauſe 'tis ſpiritually diſcerned. It is true, there is <hi>a Holineſs</hi> diſcernable by the Law of our Conſciences. But this only, is not an infallible mark, that any Society is the Church of Chriſt; nor did ever any man (I am perſwaded) hold forth ſuch a Doctrine, that was a faithful Miniſter of the New Teſtament, or Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Again, What of this kind of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> whereof a <hi>Heathen</hi> (as ſuch) can judge, is there found among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which may not be found among the <hi>Baptiſts?</hi> yea, among thoſe that are oppoſite to both, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and others; yea, among the very <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> may be found as much of this kind of <hi>Holineſs</hi> as among the <hi>Papists,</hi> if any credit may be given to Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do object the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>It would be here noted, That neither the marks of</hi> Unity, Univerſality, &amp;c. <hi>nor the</hi> Creed, <hi>do prove a People that hath them all, to be the Church; becauſe none of them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>without which there cannot be a viſible Church.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Creed</hi> as ſufficient, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a man to be a Member of the Church, though he know not whether there be any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But I Anſwer, How ſhall this be proved to be the <hi>Creed?</hi> it muſt not be its own evidence; for then the Scripture may as well ſpeak for it ſelf, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not allow; nor can the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confer any authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Creed,</hi> till they be found to be the Church: So then this is the Concluſion, <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be found to be the Church, before there be a <hi>Creed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do therefore humbly deſire theſe few Obſervations may be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thought upon by all ſober men, but eſpecially the <hi>Papists,</hi> that ſo men may give to the holy Scriptures, that which is proper to them; that is, That they may ſpeak, without controul, both for themſelves, and every thing elſe of a Religious conſideration; or elſe all Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of the Antients, and Societies of men, pretending to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity (as things ſtand in our dayes) muſt depart into utter ſilence.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Baptiſm of the true Church is found in the Scripture. But the Baptiſm of the preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not grounded upon, nor mentioned in the Scripture. Therefore the preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is moſt clear, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>And, that the Papiſts Baptiſm is not found in the Scripture, I prove thus. Becauſe they themſelves do confeſs, that Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not mentioned in the Scripture, nor grounded upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor any Scripture for it. See to this purpoſe, the Works of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and a Book, entituled, <hi>An Antidote,</hi> written by <hi>S. N.</hi> a Popiſh Doctor; as alſo <hi>T. B.</hi> his <hi>End to Controverſie.</hi> In which Books you will find the very words which I have repeated. Adde hereunto the Anſwer which I received from the Author of the <hi>Seven Queries,</hi> when <hi>I</hi> asked him what Controverſies in Religion he could reſolve without the written Word of God? he aſſigned <hi>Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> as one that was ſo to be reſolved.</p>
                  <p>So then, we have it <hi>pro confeſſo</hi> from the Papiſts own mouths, That their Baptiſm (which is <hi>Infant Baptiſm)</hi> is a <hi>Scriptureleſs-Baptiſm:</hi> Therefore ſay I, it is no Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>No Baptiſm, I ſay; becauſe the Church hath but one Baptiſm of Water, and it is mentioned in the Scripture, and grounded upon it, and much Scripture found for it; ſo is not <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> which is the Baptiſm of the preſent Papal Church. Therefore the Papal Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is no Baptiſm. How can they defend themſelves? Will they ſay, the Church hath a Scripture-Baptiſm, and an unwritten Baptiſm? This they muſt ſay and prove, or elſe deny their <hi>Infant Baptiſm.</hi>

But, ſecondly, The preſent Papal Church is ſo adulterated in the manner of the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, as that, had they a true ſubject for Baptiſm, yet, they would be found to have no Baptiſm. This will appear as clear as the Light, from the Papiſts own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for they grant, <hi>that the antient and primitive way of baptizing, was, by dipping the party baptized, over the head and ears in Water; and that it was their Church which changed this way, to a little ſprinkling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the forehead.</hi> This is plainly to be ſeen in a Book, entituled, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamen Religioſum.</hi>

                  <p>This bold Change, which men, without any allowance from God, have made in this Miniſtration of Baptiſm, is directly againſt the Scripture. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 9. <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 38, 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. In all which places it's evident, that our Lord Jeſus, <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and the other <hi>Baptiſts</hi> of thoſe times, did ſo underſtand the mind of God in reſpect of the manner of the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, as that they thought it could not be done without ſo much Water as they might go into (both the Perſon baptizing, and the Perſon to be baptized) And now, do not all that will preſume to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves in this thing with a few drops of Water put on the face only, from a Man's fingers ends, or out of a Glaſs in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes pocket, lay great folly and ignorance to the charge of Chriſt and his primitive followers? doubtleſs ſuch, as is not leſs than the folly of that man, that hath occaſion only for one Gill of Water, and he may take it up at the ſide of the Brook, and yet will needs wade into the middle of a River to take it up; or a man that hath occaſion to waſh his hands only, which he may perform very commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly without wetting his foot, and yet is ſo ſimple that he will needs go into the middle of the River to that purpoſe, eſpecially ſuch a River where there is much Water. I ſay, the practice of Sprinkling which the Papiſts and others uſe, if that anſwer the mind of God in the caſe of Baptiſm, doth even thus reflect upon Chriſt and the Chriſtians in thoſe dayes. But let our Saviours practice herein be juſtified, and all ſuch practices as tend to the rendring it ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, condemned.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts only Reſerve for the defence of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> is this: They ſay it is an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> that is, a Precept delivered by the Apoſtles Word, but not mentioned in their Writings.</p>
                  <p>This I ſhall ſhew to be utterly falſe, for divers important Reaſons. Firſt, No Apoſtolical Tradition, tends to the making null or void any Apoſtolical Writing. But Infant Sprinkling makes null and void all that is written in the Scriptures, concerning the ſubject and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108098:23"/>
of Baptiſm, in all that part of the World where the Papiſts (or ſuch as they) get the Civil Power on their ſide: yea, we ſee that by this means the ſons of men are great enemies to the way of God in this matter. How long have many Nations lain deſtitute of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> by reaſon of the interpoſition of this cloudy Tradition of <hi>Pedo-Rantiſm?</hi> How have men, pretending to be Miniſters of Chriſt, never, in many Generations, preached <hi>Peter</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, for the Remiſſion of ſins?</hi> Note this Obſervation well; for although the Baptiſm of Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath not been cryed down in the Nations of Chriſtendom, (by ſuch as counted themſelves the only Preachers of the Goſpel) yet it was not for that theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had no need of the practice of Baptiſm; for they daily have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed ſomething under that notion, which is rheir Infant-ſprinkling; So that it's plain, Infant-Baptiſm makes void the Apoſtolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: Therefore Infant-Baptiſm is no Apoſtolical Tradition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Infant-Baptiſm is not an Apoſtolical Tradition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no mention is made of it in the firſt hundred of years after Chriſt. Although I am not much read, yet I have uſed the utmoſt of my diligence to know the Truth in this Point, and I have attained to ſufficient ſatisfaction, that the greateſt favourer of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that yet I have met with, durſt not ſay that ever he ſaw any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Antiquity that mentioned ſuch a thing, and that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not mention it, the Papiſts grant.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Papiſts make ſuch boaſt of the conſent which they have in this matter from Antiquity, I will therefore here put in ſomething by way of Evidence to the contrary. For it is certain that Infant Baptiſm, as it was not heard of in the firſt hundred, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it generally received till above half a thouſand years revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt, as is undeniable; for that it is plain, that the moſt famous (or at leaſt, very famous) Chriſtian Parents brought up their Children without having them baptized; ſuch were the Parents of <hi>Greg. Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and others; yea, the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> born of Chriſtian Parents, was not baptized till he was about thirty years of age <note n="*" place="margin">See a Book, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, A well grounded Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning Baptiſm.</note>. See alſo theſe enſuing Teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>I will declare unto you, how we offer up our ſelves unto God in <note place="margin">Juſtin Mart. in or at. ad Autho. pium.</note> Baptiſm. After that we are renewed through Chriſt, ſuch as are inſtructed in the Faith, and believe that which we teach them, being to live according to the ſame; we admoniſh to faſt and pray, and we faſt and pray with them; then they are brought to the Water,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108098:24"/>
and there calling on the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are waſhed <hi>in it.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Eraſmus, paraphraſe</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>If they believe that which you teach them, and begin to be repentant of their former life, then dip them</hi> In Water, <hi>In the Name, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord commanded his Apoſtles, that they ſhould firſt inſtruct <note place="margin">

                  <head>The third Reaſon maintained.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. TO make the Goſpel-Church National, conſequently deſtroyes the Doctrin of Converſion, as it is a principle of the Doctrin of Chriſt appertaining to the beginning of a Chriſtian man: For, if men can regenerate, or beget perſons to God in their infancy, then the Word of Regeneration or new-birth is needleſs in order to our admiſſion into the Church of Chriſt, and ſo the preaching of Faith and Repentance muſt ceaſe <hi>(as it is a Principle pertaining to a Chriſtian man)</hi> in all thoſe Nations which are called <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which is a great part of the World. And indeed, Experience hath long ago proved this Concluſion to be moſt true; for ſince the Church (as they term it) was National, the Word, or Work of Converſion, hath been little known in the life and power of it: nay, verily, the very term <hi>[Converſion]</hi> is become a reproach among our National-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members. But thus to make the Word of Converſion unneceſſary, in order to perſons admiſſion into the Church of Chriſt, is contrary to the Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To make the Goſpel-Church National, puts an end to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt touching that Separation, and thoſe Diviſions, which for the Goſpel-ſake <hi>muſt be in Nations and Families,</hi> as appears from theſe Scriptures; <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. and 17. 14, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40, 47. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 49, to 54. And therefore in vain doth any perſon think to do God ſervice, by compelling Families, Towns, Countries, Nations, or many Nations, to be of one mind in matters of Religion. I ſay, it is in vain, becauſe the Scripture foreſees, and alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhews, that the contrary effects muſt follow the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and yet they may, yea, and ought to live in one form of Civil Government: for that is the will of God concerning <hi>every ſoul, Rom.</hi> 13. 1, to 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Goſpel-Church cannot be National; becauſe that takes away from her, Perſecution for the Goſpel-ſake, &amp; makes her become a Perſecutor: For it is impoſſible for a Church to be National with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out penal Laws, whereby to force men to that kind of Worſhip which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108098:25"/>
the greater part approveth, which may as poſſibly be falſe as true. But the true Church muſt not look to be free from Perſecution, if ſhe live godly in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> nor is any thing more <note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>uncomly</hi> for her than to puniſh or perſecute men into a Conformity to her Faith or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice, <hi>John</hi> 15. 19, 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 56. And the greateſt part of the <hi>Revelations</hi> do ſhew, that the Church was to be in a ſuffering condition, and are therefore bid to <hi>be patient, until the coming of the Lord,</hi> Jam. 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A National-Church cannot obſerve the diſcipline of the Church of Chriſt; for, in the caſe of withdrawing from diſorderly perſons, they do not only ſeparate men of diſorder from the Church, both in Civil and Religious concerns, but they caſt them wholly out of the World, from all Markets and Fairs, yea, quite out of their Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which kind of Excommunication the Scripture foreſees to be proper to the Churches Adverſary, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the Goſpel-Church ought to be National, then ſhe was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in point of Power in the Apoſtles dayes: for ſhe had not then any Power to put Hereticks to death for their Hereſie. But to ſay, that the Primitive Church wanted any Power to puniſh any ſin, as it concerns the Church to puniſh it, is to diſparage the Apoſtolical Churches, and is alſo contrary to the Scriptures, which plainly ſhew they had Power then to revenge all diſobedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 6.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>THe Conſequence of this Argument no man can deny; for there is nothing more oppoſit to the true Church, than to love, or cauſe darkneſs to ſeize upon any.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108098:26"/>
greatly withſtood the Tranſlation of them into every Tongue, as is evident, partly from what Hiſtory declares, and partly from that which themſelves do ſay. To omit Hiſtory, hear what they ſay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In their Preface to the Reader in the <hi>Rhemist Teſtament,</hi> thus they ſpeak:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Order was taken by the Deputies of the late famous Council of</hi> Trent <hi>in this behalf, and confirmed by ſupream Authority, That the Scripture, though truly tranſlated into the vulgar Tongues, yet may not be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently read of all men, nor of any other than ſuch as have expreſs Order thereunto of their lawful Ordinaries.</hi> So that we ſee the Liberty here given, is unlike the Liberty given by Chriſt to his enemies, whom he commanded to ſearch the Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. And the rich Glutton's Friends are ſaid to have the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> Luk. 16. 29. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was of old indifinitly required to lay up the Book of the Law in their heart; to talk of it as they ſate in their houſes; as they went abroad; they muſt teach them to their children, and write them upon the poſts of their doors, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4, to 9.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this and much more liberty given by the Lord both to his Enemies and Friends, to reade his Word, you ſee the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> will have none permitted, but whom the Ordinaries permit, to reade the Scripture, and they are only ſuch as they judge diſcreet, &amp;c. <hi>Pref.

                  </p>
                  <p>Is it not ſtrange that men, pretending to be Chriſt's true Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhould thus contradict him? He allowed that to his Enemies, which they will not allow to his Friends. Sure they have neither heard his Voice, nor ſeen his Shape, or, at leaſt, not learned of him. Miſerable is the Goſpel-Church by the Council of <hi>Trents</hi> Doctrine, they have not that priviledge which <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet they are as ſtrictly bound <hi>to bring up their Children in the admonition of the Lord;</hi> which they cannot do, unleſs they have the Law in their heart, that ſo they may talk of it to their Children. But ſurely, thoſe that will not let the Law come within the ſight of our eyes, have no mind it ſhould ever come in our hearts: So then they labour to keep us in the dark.</p>
                  <p>What can they ſay againſt mens reading the Scripture, which hath not the ſame force againſt the hearing of it preached? Did not ſome conceive as groſs opinions concerning Chriſt's ſaying, men muſt eat his fleſh, as ſome have by reading them? The <hi>Jews</hi> thought they were ſo to be underſtood, as that they might eat his <hi>real fleſh;</hi> and that was not a greater nor a leſſe Error, than is found in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who read the ſame word. It is doubtleſs a ſhrewd ſign that thoſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108098:26"/>
who will not ſuffer us to <hi>ſee</hi> the Law of God, do not intend that we ſhall <hi>hear</hi> very much of it; peradventure ſuch Points as talk of Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, it is evident, that they intend not to let us hear much that ſhall profit us; for they have deviſed, that the very Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of their Church, be ſaid and ſung in a tongue which the People underſtand not. Yea, they tell us, <hi>That it is enough for the People to underſtand that the Prayer is made to call upon God in all our deſires; and more than this is not neceſſary (they ſay:)</hi> So that the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Papacy, know not what are the things deſired; only they are told, The Prayer is made to God in all that is therein deſired. Are not theſe People kept in darkneſs? But ſaith <hi>Paul, How ſhould the unlearned ſay,</hi> Amen? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>That which is moſt ſtrange, is, That the Papiſts ſhould deliver this dark Doctrine, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. then which no Scripture more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an underſtanding in thoſe that pray, and in thoſe that joyn with them; nor doth any Scripture more clearly ſhew us, to how little purpoſe it is to perform any Service in the Church in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue. Read the Chapter; ſaith <hi>Paul, If I come unto you ſpeaking with tongues, what ſhall I profit you?—</hi>but <hi>in the Church I will ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that I may inſtruct others alſo, rather than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, as the Papiſts themſelves tranſlate them.</p>
                  <p>Another way whereby they keep men in darkneſs is this, They cumber mens minds with ſuch a <hi>MULTITUDE</hi> of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Repetitions in their Prayers, that the mind is ſufficiently charged to remember how many times over they muſt ſay ſome two or three words; nay, it's evident this is no wrong, witneſs their Beads which ſerve to ſupply the defect of their memories. As I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there is not leſs than fifty Orations and Poſtulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <note place="margin">Willit.

                  <head>The Sixth Reaſon maintained.</head>
                  <p n="1">1.

So that the Papal Church is gathered (gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) of ſuch Perſons as are not ſo regenerate, as Perſons ought to be, and muſt of neceſſity be, before they be admitted into the Church of Chriſt. The Seed of the Woman (or Goſpel-Church) are all ſuch as have the Faith of Jeſus, and keep the Commandments of God, at leaſt in Profeſſion; for that is the thing that is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, in order to any Perſon's admiſſion into the Church of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 5, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>ult. Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the Children of the new Covenant, or Church of Chriſt, do <hi>DIFFER</hi> from the Church under <hi>Moſes, SO,</hi> as that they, each individual, do ſo know the Lord, as that they need not, in ſome ſort, teach <hi>one another,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Know the Lord,</hi> Heb. 8.

                  <p n="3">3. There appears no more ſign of Regeneration, or new-Birth, in the Infants, or Members of the Papal Church, at their admiſſion, than there appears in ſuch as the Papiſts ſay are not regenerate. Now where the Spirit of regeneration is, it is not without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable operation; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The wind bloweth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thou heareſt the ſound thereof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>SO IS EVERY</hi> One that is born of the Spirit.

4. There can be no Regeneration in an ordinary way, without preaching the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. But the Papal Church is generally (if not only) gathered without the Word preached, in order to the regeneration of the Members, before their admiſſion. Therefore they are not regenerate in an ordinary way. And if they have an extraordinary regeneration, let them ſhew it.</p>

                  <p>THis Reaſon, or Argument, may ſeem to be harſhly laid down; yet if it be true, there is neceſſity to propound it. And for the truth of it, I deſire you weigh what followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To forbid Marriage, and to command to abſtain from Meats which God hath created to be received, of ſuch as believe and obey the Truth; this is the doctrine of Devils. But it is well known that the Papiſts do forbid the whole Calling of their Clergy to Marry, and thouſands beſide of thoſe that live in their Monaſteries and Nunries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this under pain of <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> You ſhall hear them ſpeak their own words, wherein they do not only prohibit Marriage for ever to ſuch as enter into the Miniſtry; but if any be married, and afterwards come into the Miniſtry, they wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive ſuch of the enjoyment of their Yoke-fellows. Thus they ſpeak; <hi>The cauſe why the Church requireth chaſtity in the Clergie, and</hi>

Again, They teach from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>That none ſhall Marry that come into holy Orders.</hi> And, <hi>that if any of the Clergie, in other Countries, had been permitted, in times paſt, to enjoy their Wives, yet they</hi>

                     <hi>now declare it to be against the Apoſtles Rule; And this they ſay is the Sentence of the Council of</hi> Nice. But ſurely <hi>Paul</hi>'s words are clear
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108098:28"/>
contrary; for he ſaith, <hi>A Biſhop muſt be the Husband of one Wife, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Children in ſubjection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In further proof of this matter, it is upon Record, That <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. <hi>An.</hi> 1070. did enforce Miniſters by Excommunication, to leave their Wives. And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 2. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1066. Decreed, That it might be <note place="margin">

And <hi>Fox</hi> recordeth, That it was made Felony, by the Act of the <hi>Six Articles,</hi> for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to marry Wives, <hi>Fox, p.</hi> 1135. And this cruelty <hi>Bellarmine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends by a ſaying of <hi>Jerome,</hi> That a Biſhop begetting Children, ſhall be condemned as an Adulterer.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas I ſay they forbid Meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do not mean, that it is not meet for the Church to Faſt and Pray, and in ſuch a ſenſe to forbid meat. But for their Church to forbid one kind of meat above another; as that we may not eat Eggs in Lent, and divers other creatures which God hath created, to be received of ſuch as believe. For the true way of Faſting, is a total faſting for the time (unleſs neceſſity deny.) And truly the Papal Faſt of Lent is in a manner no Faſt, which allows the drinking of Wines, and the eating to the full of ſuch delicacies as do inflame the fleſh as much as Eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet the Papiſts by no means will permit men to eat.

Yet they deny that <hi>Rome,</hi> as now conſidered, is <hi>Mystery Babylon;</hi> only, ſay they, it is to be referred to <hi>Rome</hi> in her <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> eſtate. But thus I reaſon;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be not <hi>Mystery Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> then either the Papiſts, or ſome body elſe, can ſhew us a People which better deſerves that title. But this no man can do (ſo far as yet I have learned) and therefore (as yet) I muſt ſay,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108098:28"/>
The preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (together with her Daughter Churches) is <hi>Mystery Babylon.</hi> And for further proof in this Point, I thus reaſon:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The preſent Papal Church hath the Marks of <hi>Mystery Babylon;</hi> therefore ſhe is <hi>Mystery Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I prove it thus:</p>
                  <p>One Mark of <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> is a Regiment over the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>The Woman which thou ſaweſt, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> This Mark the preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath above all other; Witneſs the Papiſts own Books, T. B. <hi>End to Controv. chap.</hi> 26, 27. where he ſets up the Pope above all Kings and Emperors; and plainly calls the Popes, Kings and Monarchs; and the Papal Church, he terms an invincible Empreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Mark of <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> is great Riches and wordly Pomp. That <hi>Rome,</hi> in her preſent Church-ſtate, hath this Mark, her Doctor, <hi>T. B.</hi> is my witneſs. So is <hi>Helen. Geog. p.</hi> 192, 193. and <hi>Napier, Rev.</hi> 9. which Authors ſhew her Riches (even of the Clergy only) to be quite out of the reach of the beſt Arithmaticks to paſs an <hi>Entrado</hi> upon it. Add to all other witneſſes that of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> and it will ſhew us, That when their Church had her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in this Land, they knew where the beſt Ground lay; as the Ruins of their Abbeys do evince. Compare all theſe with <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. and ſee if they do not agree.</p>
                  <p>Another Mark of <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> is, She ſits upon Nations, Tongues, and Peoples. <hi>Rome</hi> hath this Mark; <hi>T. B.</hi> in his <hi>End to Controverſies, chap.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Another Mark of <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> is, She enſlaves the Souls of men, and is drunk with blood. Now that the Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath this Mark, I need only to refer my Readers to thoſe large Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Sleidan, Fox,</hi> and <hi>Benzo</hi> the <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As I noted, it is confeſſed by the Papiſts, That <hi>Mystery Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17. &amp; 18. <hi>chapters,</hi> is meant of <hi>Rome;</hi> only they think to free themſelves from the force of that blow, by telling us, That it's meant of <hi>Rome</hi> in her <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and under the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Emperors. But this is but a poor ſhift, as may appear, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Antients do write againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Fab. Chron.</note> after the perſecuting Emperors were down; for the Papiſts ſay, <hi>That</hi> Conſtatine <hi>put an end to the Perſecution, when he was converted,</hi> which was about the year 300, and a few odd years; at which time
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108098:29"/>
the Papiſts ſay, <hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>was given up to the Pope.</hi> 1. <hi>Jeroms,</hi> who lived about the fourth hundred, writing to <hi>Euſtoch. &amp; Marcelus,</hi> doth <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Augustine</hi> is moſt clear in this matter, in his Book of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug. de Civitat. Dei, lib.</hi> 18.</note> 
                     <hi>City of God;</hi> where he calls <hi>Rome</hi> another <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Weſt. And <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Eaſt, firſt <hi>Rome:</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſecond <hi>Babylon.</hi> Willing men to conſider, That in the beginning of the <hi>City of God,</hi> which was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, the firſt <hi>Rome,</hi> that was, Eaſtern <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> was builded in <hi>Chaldea.</hi> And about what the firſt <hi>Babylon</hi> was deſtroyed, leſt the <hi>City of God</hi> ſhould want her Enemy, the ſecond <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> was erected.</p>

                  <p>THat the preſent Papal Church cannot have the true Mark of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is thus evidenced; <hi>viz.</hi> The Papal Church is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church; But no Goſpel Church was National in the firſt Age: Therefore no National Church hath the true Mark of <hi>Antiquity.</hi>

                  <p>The ſtrength of this Argument lyeth in the clear difference of the ſtate of the Church under <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> to what it was under Chriſt and his Apoſtles. For,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which was to be National, took its form in a National way, even in the very firſt Family where it began, as appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where Parents, Children, and Servants too, muſt all be brought into that Church-ſtate forthwith, or not be ſuffered to co-habit together.

But when the Goſpel Church began, it is very evident, that it <note place="margin">

                     <hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi> No, ſaith <hi>Paul, We</hi> (meaning the Goſpel-Church) <hi>which are of Faith, are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and Heirs according to Promiſe;</hi> For the Promiſe (which chiefly) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the Goſpel, was not made to ſuch as were born after the Fleſh, but ſuch as are born after the Spirit; Whereupon he ſaith, We henceforth know No man after the Fleſh [or becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from the loins of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other.] For if any man be in Chriſt (ſo as to be a demonſtrable or viſible Member of his Goſpel-Church) he is a new-creature. Old things are paſſed away, [yea, the old priviledge of ſtanding in the Church by the Father's intereſt, though the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf] is [now] paſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all things [in this reſpect] are become new. Whereupon <hi>Peter</hi> contributeth his ſentence, and ſaith, <hi>Of a truth I perceive God is no reſpecter of Perſons, [but</hi> the Perſons accepted upon a Goſpel-account, ſo as to be his Church, are ſuch as <hi>in every Nation fear him, and work Righteouſneſs</hi> [which no <hi>Infant</hi> can do.] But what? Hath God rejected <hi>Infants</hi> wholly, that now he will not ſhew them ſo much favour as afore-time? God forbid. He hath not ſhut up his tender Mercies from them wholly, or in part; For as they are ſuch, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108098:30"/>
dying in their infancy through <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, ſo in Chriſt ſhall they be made alive. Wherefore look how far ſoever they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16, 18.</note> fall in the firſt man of the Earth, ſo far they ſhall be reſtored by the Lord from Heaven; yea, the Gift to them by Chriſt ſhall exceed the Loſs they had by <hi>Adam.</hi> But if they live to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and become actual ſinners againſt God, then the way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the remiſſion of their ſins, is, <hi>to repent, and be baptized,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, <hi>to</hi> 41.</note> 
                     <hi>every one of them, that they may receive the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo be by it led <hi>into all Truth; and attain at the end the ſalvation of their ſouls, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Argument whereby it appears the Church of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be National, is this; No man is bound to become a Chriſtian under pain of corporal puniſhment, as Death, &amp;c. but living peaceably as men, no man hath power to compel them to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or to walk in the Chriſtian Profeſſion, as is clear from the Texts before recited. Now take away Force in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a National Church cannot ſtand in an abſolute National Form; this all experience can teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Again, That the Church of Chriſt at the firſt, or in the firſt Ages was not National (in the firſt method or way wherein a Church beginneth to be ſo, namely, by the admiſſion of Infants into the Church) is very evident; becauſe it is utterly incredible, that the many thouſands of Infants, of ſuch as in thoſe dayes believed, ſhould be admitted into the Church, and not ſo much as the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſuch a thing to be found in all the holy Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And beſide, I have ſhewed from the Teſtimony of <hi>Vives, (Auguſtines</hi> Commentor) That the Church had not the cuſtom to baptize Infants in old time.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe certain (if Hiſtory be true) That the Goſpel-Church uſed no compulſion in matters of Faith for more than three hundred years after Chriſt. About which time <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ordained grievous puniſhments for ſuch as ſpake againſt <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fab. Chron. 4th part. Yet this</hi> Euſebius <hi>doth ſeem to contradict.</hi>
                     </note> Chriſt; and allowed the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to uſe the Unbelievers hardly. But God did not bleſs theſe doings: for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> became an <hi>Arrian</hi> Heretick, and perſecuted the Biſhop that baptized him, as alſo others that continued faithful.</p>
                  <p>Hence then I conclude, That ſeeing the preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not the true Mark of Antiquity, Therefore they loſe at once, the next three, <hi>Succeſſion, Univerſality,</hi> and <hi>Viſibility:</hi> For,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108098:31"/>
Antiquity being wanting, no true Succeſſion can be found; becauſe the Root of Succeſſion, if good, muſt be the Antiquity of it. So take Antiquity from them, and then wanting that firſt Age, they cannot be found in every Age; and not being found in every Age, eſpecially the firſt Age, then they loſe <hi>Viſibility,</hi> as themſelves propoſe it for a Mark of the Church. And for their <hi>Holineſs,</hi> I have ſpoken to that before, and ſurely it is but like their neighbours. And for their <hi>Miracles,</hi> I have given you a taſte of them from <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto:</hi> and beſide, others do claim that mark as well as they; Yea, the <hi>Turks</hi> produce Miracles; and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do the like; and others, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the like: and the <hi>Baptists</hi> can ſay of a truth, that God hath done for and amongſt them, ſome things which have <note place="margin">Willit. Synopſ. Papiſ.</note> exceeded the courſe of Nature. And ſo their Miracles will not more prove them a Church, than the Miracles of others will prove the contrary, unleſs they can prove the others to be Illuſions.</p>
                  <p>And that they have not the mark of <hi>Unity,</hi> is evident, if Hiſtory may be heeded; for, ſaith my Author, there is an hundred Sects of Monks and Fryars amongſt them, and ſome of them ſo divided, as they burnt one another for matters of Religion. And for different Opinions, there are no leſs than three hundred. See <hi>Fox Act. and Monument. p.</hi> 260. and <hi>Willit,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Tetraſtilon Papiſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know the <hi>Papists</hi> do make a great deal of noiſe about their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Succeſſion,</hi> as if they could derive it from man to man, up to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi> But I find the learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> making it a great Queſtion, whether ever <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or not. And <hi>Jerom</hi> is ſaid to have ſeen ſome old Books, which ſhew, that <note place="margin">Jerome, in ep. ad Rom.</note> 
                     <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ruled the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaluted him and his Family, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſmall contention is there likewiſe among the Learned, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Clement</hi> were the ſecond Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that this Paſtoral Succeſſion the Papiſts pretend to, meets with ſhrewd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in the very firſt and ſecond perſon of that Line.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the uninterrupted continuance of their pretended <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> many things are objected: as, That there were ſometimes <hi>three,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>two</hi> Popes, and that for more than twenty years time together; ſo that no man could tell where the true Paſtoral Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity lay. And then comes in that ſtrange diſaſter of <hi>Joan</hi> the female Pope, who for almoſt three years cut the chain of this pretended Succeſſion. This thing is famous in Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:108098:31"/>
Laſtly, Although the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could prove a continued Succeſſion of perſons claiming the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> yet this would not juſtifie them all to be the Paſtors of Chriſt's Church. For theſe two Rules are given us even by the Antients; 1. That <hi>Peter</hi> left his Innocency hereditary as well as his Seat; and that he which hath not the one as well as the other, is not <hi>Peter's Succeſſor.</hi> 2. That it is not the <hi>Chair,</hi> but the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that maketh a Biſhop. Now, 3dly, add but <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule in this matter, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1. and then I am bold to affirm, That many Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were not the true Succeſſors of <hi>Peter</hi> in Paſtoral Authority. For I find it laid to the charge of divers Popes, that they were Drunken-Whoremongers, Theeves, given more to War than Chriſt, rooted in all unſpeakable ſin; furious men, prophane Scoffers of Chriſt; Inceſtuous perſons, Murderers, Poyſoners of their own Parents and Kindred; open So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites or Buggerers; Blaſphemers, incorrigible Hereticks, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters; callers upon the Devil to help them to play at Dice; Drinkers of the Devil's Health, and Traitors to Princes. Theſe things are ſo notorious and evidently true of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that the Papiſts do not deny them. T. B. <hi>End to Controverſ.</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Seven Queries,</hi> as you may ſee in part before. Yea, <hi>Bernard</hi> was not a little moved with the wickedneſs of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he called them, <hi>Tyrants, Defrauders, Raveners, Traytors, Darkneſs of the World, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi> And, can we think that Succeſſion to be good which is derived from Devils? I need ſay no more. See, for the proof of all that I have ſaid, theſe Books; <hi>Fox Act.</hi> &amp; <hi>Monument. Willit Synopſ. Prediaux's Introduct.</hi>

                  <head>The Tenth Reaſon.</head>
                  <p>The preſent Aſſemblies of Baptized Believers, and they only, are the true viſible Church of Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore the preſent Papal Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="explanation">
                  <head>The Explanation of this Reaſon, or Argument.</head>
                  <p>THis Reaſon or Argument is not ſo to be underſtood, as if we do ſhut all men out of Heaven who are not Members of our Church. No verily: This is the expreſs Doctrine of the Papiſts: for they ſay, <hi>that out of the Church is no Salvation;</hi> and by Church they mean, only thoſe that adhere to the <hi>Papal Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> and hereupon they teach expreſly (and ſo do ſome Proteſtants alſo) <hi>That without Baptiſm, or the deſire of Baptiſm, &amp;c. none can be ſaved:</hi> And therefore it is that they give power to Midwives to baptize Children ſometimes between the Womb and the World.</p>
                  <p>That which we teach, is this, That the ordinary way appointed for men to receive Salvation in, is, <hi>The preaching of Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins to all Nations, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt; and the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 24</note> 
                     <hi>adminiſtration of Baptiſm, as a pledge thereof, to all that give accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to theſe Glad-tydings;</hi> and upon this account this Miniſtration is called, <hi>The Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And we do teach, as a moſt infallible Doctrine, <hi>That without profeſſion of Faith, manifeſtation of Repentance, and being baptized with Water in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. no perſon can be orderly admitted into the Church or Kingdom of God on Earth.</hi> And that therefore it concerns every man, living to years of underſtanding, and having the Goſpel tendred to him, only to look for Salvation this way, as he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it before the Lord, for contemning God's ordinary way, and preſuming to challenge the Grace of Eternal Life in a way of his own deviſing.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, we do not hence conclude, That all perſons ſhall be damned that ſeek not Life in this way. For, firſt, No Infant can ſeek for it in the way which the Goſpel propoſeth Life to men of years: Yet ſurely it is a moſt cruel Doctrine to ſay, that any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying in their infancy ſhall be damned in Hell, becauſe (as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108098:32"/>
one very well ſaid) God will not damn any perſons for that which they cannot help.</p>
                  <p>Again, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1ſt. and 2d. chapters, <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, That if the ſons of men act forth themſelves in a way of Love, Fear, Obedience, and Reverence to their Creator, according to the means of Light vouchſafed to them, that this ſhall be as much as ſhall be required of them, in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt (for God will not gather where he hath not ſtrewed) at which time, God will not judge them by the Law that never had it. Howbeit, let all that have it (I mean his written Law) expect to be judged by it. And therefore, though we will not preſume to judge of the final ſtate of this or that Society of men profeſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably this or that Form of Worſhip, but leave that wholly to the Lord; yet we will not ceaſe humbly to beg of all ſuch perſons in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, that they having his Law, would carefully obſerve the terms whereupon Life is held forth unto them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch glad receivers of the Word, as is mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. <hi>Then they which gladly received the Word, were baptized: and the ſame day were added to the Church about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> The Argument thus explained, I ſhall now endeavour to make it good.</p>

               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>The Tenth Argument maintained.</head>
                  <p>That the preſent Aſſemblies of Baptized Believers, and no other preſent Aſſemblies of men, are the true Church of Chriſt, I prove, thus: Either the preſent Aſſemblies of Baptized Believers, or elſe ſome other Aſſemblies now in the practice of Infant <note n="*" place="margin">Alias, Rantiſm</note> Baptiſm, muſt be the true Church of Chriſt; becauſe without Baptiſm, the Papiſts ſay (and ſay truly too) there can be no true Church of Chriſt at this day: Now theſe two wayes of Baptizing only (I mean of Water-Baptiſm) is pretended as neceſſary in order to a viſible Church-ſtate: <hi>viz.</hi> the dipping or baptizing perſons upon their perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, as the preſent Aſſemblies of the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> do practiſe; or baptizing (or rather ſprinkling) of Infants without perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, as the preſent National Churches do practiſe.</p>
                  <p>For moſt undoubtedly, the true and legitimate claim to this Title of <hi>Christ's Church,</hi> muſt be found in one of theſe two Parties: And that no National Aſſembly, gathered together by Pedo-baptiſm, can fairly claim this Title, I have ſhewed before, whither now I refer my Reader. And for the evincing yet further, that the preſent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108098:33"/>
of Baptized Believers are the true viſible Church of Chriſt, I thus argue:</p>
                  <p>They, and they only, have the true Eccleſiaſtical Marks of truly Antient Primitive or Apoſtolical Gathering, Conſtitution and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Therefore they, and they only, are the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three points, namely, <hi>Gathering, Constitution</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I take (if right) to be the infallible Marks of a true Church. And that the preſent Aſſemblies of Baptized Believers, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have them, will be evident to him that conſidereth what they were at firſt, and how they agree with what in theſe reſpects is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in the Aſſemblies of the Baptized Congregations.</p>
                  <p>The truly Antient, Primitive and Apoſtolical Gathering, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the firſt means uſed in order thereunto, was the preaching Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins, or the Goſpel <hi>unto every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and upon their conviction, to command them, as from the Lord, to be baptized, <hi>every one of them,</hi> in the Name, &amp;c. as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47, 48. And herein onely the preſent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Baptized Believers do cloſely follow Chriſt's Primitive Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>The Primative and Apoſtolical Gathering of the Church of Chriſt in reſpect of the ſubjects gathered, were only ſuch, as through the virtue and prevalency of the Word preached, or made known, did give a demonſtration of their Regeneration by the profeſſion of Faith, and manifeſtation of Repentance, and being dipped in Water in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the proof whereof I appeal to thoſe ſeveral Scriptures alledged againſt the gathering of Chriſt's Church of ſuch perſons, as of whoſe Regeneration no demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is or can be given, anſwerable to what the Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in order to perſons admiſſion into the Kingdom of God or Church on Earth. And, ſecondly, I appeal to the practice of the Apoſtles acting, in purſuance of that Commiſſion given them in that behalf. And, thirdly, I do appeal to the Churches themſelves, which were gathered by the Apoſtles, as they are deſcribed to us in theſe ſeveral Texts following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:108098:33"/>
Theſe Texts do ſhew to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader, that here is ſuch things ſpoken of this numerous Church, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their Society, as to participate of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: And the like will appear to the Scripture-ſearching Soul, in all thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches; as the reſpective places will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>

Theſe Scriptures, duely conſidered, ſhew, That all thoſe famous Churches were gathered in a way contrary to that of the National Churches, and conſonant to the way of the preſent Baptized Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And be it here obſerved, that no man ever yet could ſhew by any Record of ſuch Authority as may ſuffice to be a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith in this caſe, that by the Apoſtles any were ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church in their infancy. Wherefore look well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture, and then upon the gathering of the Churches of the <hi>Baptists,</hi> and you will find that they, and they only, have the true Antient Primitive or Apoſtolical-mark of Church-gathering.</p>

                  <p>THey onely can be truly conſtituted that are rightly gathered, which the Baptized Churches onely are. The Primitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church conſiſted principally in theſe two heads; <hi>viz.</hi> Free-fellowſhip in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40, 41, 42, 47. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 4. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.</p>
                  <p>No force of a worldly nature was uſed in the begetting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing her Fellowſhip, for it was a mutual conſent.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing pertaining to the Conſtitution, conſiſts in the diſpoſing of her Members to thoſe places to which they are fitted to ſerve in the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. with verſ. 18. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Now that the preſent Aſſemblies of the Baptized Believers, have this form of Conſtitution in both reſpects, is evident to all that will take knowledge of their Conſtitution.</p>

                  <head>Of GOVERNMENT.</head>
                  <p>THe true Ancient Primitive and Apoſtolical Government of the Church, was only Spiritual, and did recide not in the Paſtors apart from the Church, but in the Paſtors together with the Church; yet ſo, as that thoſe to whom the Church hath committed her Power, are the Inſtruments, that in the Name of Chriſt and his Church, are to exerciſe Government, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. &amp; 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>This Government conſiſteth in theſe things; Exhortations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, Reproofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all long-Suffering and Doctrine,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108098:34"/>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. And if this prevail not with the Offenders, then is the power of Excommunication to be exerciſed, to the with-holding their Priviledges in the Church, and to the delivering them up to Satan for the deſtruction of the Fleſh; and for ſaving the ſinner from his ſin. And if this prevail not, then the ſinners ſin is retained, till the day of Judgment. But if the ſinner be humbled, the ſin is by the Church to be remitted, and the Offender reſtored, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5, 11, 13. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 6, 14, 15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23.</p>
                  <p>And this Government is to be exerciſed without partiality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. and without reſpect to filthy lucre, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. and without domination or lordſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Now that this Goverment is only found in the preſent Aſſemblies of Baptized Believers, is thus proved; <hi>Out</hi> of the Church it cannot be, and <hi>in</hi> the Church it muſt be, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. till all the Saints be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and that this Society, and no other, can be the Church, I have alſo proved; and for further evidence I refer every one to the exerciſe of the preſent Churches of baptized Believers, in point of Eccleſiaſtical Government.</p>
                  <p>As for other Marks, it is needleſs to inſiſt upon them; for that Church which hath <hi>theſe,</hi> cannot be without the <hi>other,</hi> ſo far as they are neceſſary. Yea, let it be well obſerved, That that Church which hath true <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is the Church alone, which hath the Promiſe of Succeſſion, or whatſoever elſe is needful in a way of neceſſity in order to her being: And therefore, though we could not prove by Hiſtory, thoſe things which many make great boaſt of; yet, having the moſt certain Mark <hi>[Antiquity]</hi> we have the other in Promiſe, and therefore muſt believe that the Church hath not failed of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of them; for Hiſtories (ſome of them) be quite loſt; and others, partly ſilent, and partly contradictory about theſe things. Again, if Hiſtory did mention an un-interrupted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Baptized Churches, ſuch, I mean, as we contend for, yet it would be but <hi>Teſtis humano,</hi> and ſo no foundation of Faith: And beſide, it would ſuppoſe, that the Church of Chriſt is ſo beholding to humane Hiſtory, as it's impoſſible for her to prove her ſelf the Church of Chriſt without it, though ſhe have the holy Scripture. But this is ſurely to make the Church to ſtand upon too ſandy a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
