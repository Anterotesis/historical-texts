         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the following Narrative you have a Relation of the bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
committed by <hi>T. Savage,</hi> with an account of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
mercies of God to his poor ſoul after the committing ſo bloody a
ſin. To which is added a ſhort relation of the carriage and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of that vile Strumpet <hi>Hannah Blay,</hi> during the time of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Newgate to her Execution: which, though it hath nothing
in it worthy to be related, yet, ſhe being an inſtrumental cauſe of
that bloody reſolution, was thought fit to be inſerted, that ſhe may
remain as an example of ſhame to all leud women, and a ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Gods juſtice upon ſuch cruel monſters, who are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with endangering the ſoul of ſuch ignorant young men, that
have not the fear of God before their eyes, with their abominable
Whoredomes and Adulteries, but as it were to make ſure of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both body and ſoul together by adding to their former ſins the
guilt of ſhedding innocent blood: And as you have a wonderful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Gods free-grace to the ſoul of <hi>T. S.</hi> ſo the foulneſs of his
fact, the danger of damning his ſoul, and the twice ſhameful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
which he ſuffred, may be a means to preſerve all young men
and Apprentices from being guilty of the like fact. And as a help
to you herein, you are adviſed to be very careful what company you
keep. That you addict not your ſelves to drinking, or gaming, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany-keeping,
which is the ruin of many young men, who by getting
a habit of keeping company, or other Vices, are to often drawn to
purloin from their maſters, to maintain them in their extravagancies.
by which means they do not only run the hazard of expoſing their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to publique-ſhame, if they be diſcovered, to the great grief, and
even heart breaking of their friends, when they hear of their ill
courſes but the wrath of God and eternal damnation of their poor
ſouls, as you may ſee in the Narrative of <hi>T. S.</hi> who firſt began with
Company-keeping, from Company-keeping to Whoring, from Whoring
to Thieving and murther. And lastly, be careful to ſpend the Lords-day,
and all thy other ſpare time in the ſervice of God, as reading,
Praying, hearing the Word preached, which may be a means to
preſerve thee from the guilt of ſins of this nature, and other ſins
likewiſe, if thou apply thy ſelf ſeriouſly to this work. But whiles I
am adviſing of others, I my ſelf commit an error in exceeding my

            <p>BLood doth cry aloud; the blood of man, when violently ſhed by
cruel hands for private revenge or covetouſneſs, or the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of ſome ſuch baſe luſt, doth cry as far from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for vengeance: And however ſome horrible murder may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
plotted and as ſecretly effected, yet ſeldom are they long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed
even in this world, for beſides that ſometimes the guilty
accuſing conſciences of ſuch Perſons who have committed this hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
crime, do ſo inwardly laſh and torment them, that they can find
no reſt until they have made diſcovery of the Fact with their own
mouth; there is the all-ſeeing eye of ſin revenging God, which doth
find them, and a ſtrange hand of his Providence which doth often
Follow them, and entangle them in their ſteps (when they are flying
and ſeeking ſome hiding-place) which doth as it were bind them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are in chains, and deliver them before they are aware, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of Juſtice to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>But there is another blood which doth ſend forth a louder cry,
namely the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which was ſhed for the
ſins of men, which ſpeaketh better things than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi>
crying for mercy and forgiveneſs, This blood hath ſuch prevalency
and vertue, that when it is applyed by Faith unto the moſt notorious
Malefactor guilty of blood, as well as other wickedneſs: it doth
out-cry and drown the voice of blood and every other ſin, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the moſt impure Soul, dyed in ſin unto a ſcarlet and crimſon hue.
This blood we hope was ſprinkled upon the Conſcience of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
who had a little before embrued his hands in the blood of
his Fellow-ſervant: for having given ſuch evidence of his ſincere
repentance, and true faith, unto ſeveral of us Miniſters and other
Chriſtians that were with him, before and at his Execution: we
hope, though he were juſtly puniſhed with the firſt death by the hand
of man for his crime, that through infinite free Grace and Chriſts
blood, he hath eſcaped the ſecond death and wrath of God in Hell.

            <p>
               <hi>THomas Savage,</hi> born in the Pariſh of <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, he
was put out Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> Vintner at the Ship-Tavern
in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where he lived about the ſpace of one year
and three quarters: in which time he manifeſted himſelf to all
that knew him, to be a meer Monſter in ſin: in all that time he
never once knew what it was to hear one whole Sermon; but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152165:3"/>
uſed to go in at one door, and out at the other; and accounted
them fools that could ſpare ſo much time from ſin as 2 or 3 hours
on a Lords day to ſpend in the Lords ſervice. He ſpent the Sabbath
commonly at the Ale-houſe, or rather at a baſe houſe with that
vile Strumpet <hi>Hannah Blay,</hi> which was the cauſe of his ruine;
he was by a young man (now gone to Sea) firſt enticed to go
drink there, and after that he went alone, and now and then uſed
to bring her a Bottle or two of Wine which ſatisfied not her
wicked deſires; but ſhe told him, if he would frequent her houſe,
he muſt bring money with him: he told her often, he could bring
none but his Maſters, and he never wronged his Maſter of two-pence
in his life: ſtill ſhe enticed him to take it privately: He
replyed he could not do it, becauſe the Maid was always at
home with him. Hang her Jade ſaith this impudent ſlut, knock
her brains out, and I will receive the money; this ſhe many times
ſaid, and that day that he committed the murther, he was with
her in the morning, and ſhe made him drunk with burnt Brandy,
and he wanted one Groat to pay of his reckoning: ſhe then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
perſwaded him to knock the Maid on the head, and ſhe
would receive the money; he going home between twelve and
one of the clock, his Maſter ſtanding at the Street-door, did
not dare to go in that way, but climbed over a back-door,
and commeth into the Room where his Fellow-ſervants were at
Dinner: O ſaith the Maid to him, Sirrah, you have been now
at this Bawdy-Houſe, you will never leave till you are undone
by them: He was much vexed at her; and while he was at
Dinner, the Devil entered ſo ſtrong into him, that nothing would
ſatisfie him but he muſt kill her; and no other way, but with the
Hammer; to which end, when his maſter was gone with all the
reſt of his Family to Church, leaving only the maid and this boy
at home; he goeth into the Bar, fetcheth the Hammer: and
taketh the Bellows in his hand, and ſitteth down by the fire, and
there knocketh the bellows with the Hammer: the Maid ſaith to
him; <hi>Sure the boy is mad, Sirrah, what do you make this noiſe for?</hi>
He ſaid nothing, but went from the Chair, and lay along in the
Kitchin window, and knocked with the Hammer there; and
on a ſudden threw the Hammer with ſuch force at the maid;
that hitting her on the head ſhe fell down preſently, ſcreaking
out, then he taketh up the Hammer three times, and did not
dare to ſtrike her any more, at laſt the Devil was ſo great
with him, that he taketh the Hammer, and ſtriketh her many
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152165:3"/>
blows with all the force he could, and even rejoyced that he
had got the victory over her; which done, he immediately
taketh the Hammer, and with it ſtrikes at the Cupboard Door
in his maſters Chamber, which being but ſlit-Deal preſently
flew open, and thence he taketh out a Bag of Money, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it upon his arm, under his cloak, he went out at a back-door
ſtraight-way to this baſe houſe again: when he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Slut would fain have ſeen what he had under his Cloak,
and knowing what he had done, would very fain have had the
Money: he gave her half a Crown, and away he went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any remorſe for what he had done. Going over a Stile he
ſat down to reſt himſelf, and then began to think with himſelf;
<hi>Lord what have I done!</hi> and he would have given ten thouſand
worlds he could have recalled the blow. After this, he was in
ſo much horrour, that he went not one ſtep but he thought eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one he met came to take him. He got that Night to <hi>Green-wich,</hi>
and lay there; telling the people of the houſe that he was
to go down to <hi>Graveſend:</hi> that night he roſe and walked about,
and knew not what to do, Conſcience ſo flew in his face, The
Miſtreſs of the houſe percieving the Lad to have money, and
not ſealed up, ſaid, <hi>I wiſh this Lad came by this money honeſtly.</hi>
The next morning he going away towards <hi>Woolliedge,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of the houſe could not be ſatisfied, but ſent for him back,
and told him, <hi>Sweetheart, I fear you came not by this money honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Yes indeed Miſtreſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I did; for I am carrying of it
down to</hi> Graveſend <hi>to my Maſter, a Wine Cooper. VVe live upon</hi>
London-bridge, <hi>and if you pleaſe to ſend any one to my Mistreſs
I will leave my money with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So there were ſome people going to <hi>London,</hi> and he writ a
Note to ſend to his Miſtreſs, and he left the Money with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Houſe, and went his way, wandring toward <hi>VVool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liedge,</hi>
and there was in the Ship-yard; about which time news
came to <hi>Greenwich</hi> of the Murther that was committed at <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi>
by a youth, upon his Fellow-ſervant, and that a bag of
Money was taken away: the Miſtreſs of the Houſe forthwith
concluded that ſureit was the ſame Youth that was at her houſe
and that that was the Money; whereupon ſhe ſent men out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to ſeek him: who found him in an Ale-houſe, where he
had called for a pot of beer, and was laid down with his head
on the Table and fallen aſleep: one of the men calling him by
his name, <hi>Tom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Did you not live at</hi> Ratcliff? He ſaid,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152165:4"/>
               <hi>Yes, And did you not murther your fellow-ſervant?</hi> He confeſſed
it: <hi>And you took ſo much money from your Maſter?</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
all: then ſaid they, <hi>You muſt go along with us:</hi> He ſaid,
<hi>Yes, with all my heart.</hi> So they went forthwith to <hi>Greenwich,</hi>
to the houſe where he lay that night: where when he came,
he met his Maſter with ſome friends, and when his Maſter
ſpake to him of it, he was not much affected at firſt, but after
a little while burſt out into many tears: thence he was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Juſtice at <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where he fully confeſſed the Fact
again, and by him was committed cloſe Priſoner in the Gaol of
<hi>Newgate,</hi> where Mr. <hi>H. B.</hi> (who after ſome acquaintance
with him, had this preceeding Narrative from his own Mouth)
came to ſee and ſpeak with him: and he ſeemed but little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of what he had done. <hi>Are you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the perſon that
committed the murther upon the maid at</hi> Ratcliff? He ſaid, <hi>Yes:
O what think you of your condition) What do you think will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of your precious Sou? you have by this Sin not only brought
your body to the Grave, but your Soul to hell, without Gods infinite
mercy: Were you not troubled for the Fact when you did it? Not
for the preſent, Sir, ſaid he; but ſoon after I was, when I began
to think with my ſelf what I had done.</hi> The next time he asked
him, whether he were ſorry for the Fact? He ſaid, wringing
his hands, and ſtriking his breaſt, with tears in his eyes <hi>Yes,
Sir, for it cuts me to the heart to think that I ſhould take away the
life of a poor innocent Creature; and that is not all, but for any
thing I know, I have ſent her ſoul to Hell: O how can I think to
appear before God's barr, when ſhe ſhall ſtand before me, and ſay,
Lord, this wretch took away my life, and gave me not the leaſt
ſpace that I might turn to thee: he gave me no warning at all,
Lord. O then what will become of me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the impriſonment of this <hi>Thomas Savage,</hi> in <hi>New gate.</hi>
Upon the deſire of one of his Friends, Mr. <hi>R. F.</hi> and
<hi>T. V.</hi> went to him in the priſon, and had liberty, with much
readineſs, from the Keepers, to diſcourſe with him: They
asked him, if he were the perſon that had murthered the maid?
He anſwered, that he was; they did then open to him the
heinous nature of that ſin, endeavouring to ſet it home upon
his Conſcience, telling him of the expreſs Law of God, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not Kill,</hi> and the expreſs threatnings, <hi>That whoſoever ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> They ſpake to
him of the Law of the Land, and the puniſhment of Death
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152165:4"/>
which would certainly be inflicted upon him; that he had but
a few VVeeks more to live, and then he would be Tryed, and
Condemned, and Executed: but they told him, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the temporal Death was but ſmall in compariſon
with the puniſhment of eternal Death in Hell, which he had
deſerved, and was expoſed unto. They told him, that ſo
long as Death ſhould make a ſeparation between his Soul and
body, that his Soul muſt immediately appear before the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tribunal of the Sin revenging God, and there receive its
final doom, and be irreverſibly ſentenced to depart from the
preſence of the Lord, into everlaſting fire, if he were found
under the guilt of this, or any other ſin.</p>
            <p>They asked him if he knew what Hell was? telling him
what a fearful thing it would be for him to fall into the hands
of the living God; how intolerable the immediate expreſſions
of Gods Wrath would be upon his Soul, what horror and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
he would there be filled withal, and how he would be
bound up in Chains of darkneſs until the Judgment of the
great day; and then told him of the glorious appearance of
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to Judgment: that ſoul and body ſhould
be then joyned together, and condemned together, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together with ſuch exquiſite torments as never entred into
the heart of man to concieve; declaring the extremity and the
Eternity of the torments of hell, which were the juſt demerit
of his ſins. Then they asked him, whether he had any hopes
of eſcaping this dreadful puniſhment of hell? He anſwered,
that he had: they enquired into the grounds of his hopes? He
told them, that he repented of his fault, and hoped God would
have mercy on his ſoul: They asked him, whether he thought
his Repentance could procure for him a Pardon? He knew
no other way. They told him that God was juſt, and his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
muſt be ſatisfied: and there was no way for him to do
it, but by undergoing the Eternal torments of Hell: and did
he know no way of ſatisfying God's juſtice beſides? and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his anger that was kindled againſt him? No, he knew
not any, and yet did he hope to be ſaved? He anſwered, yes.
They enquired whether ever he had experience of a gracious
change wrought in him. Herein he could give no account, and
yet hoped to be ſaved. They told him his hopes were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
having no good foundation; and he would find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
diſappointed: that it was not his repentance, his tears, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152165:5"/>
prayers (though he ought to uſe them as means) that would
ſave him, if he fixed the Anchor of his hope upon them. That
if he hoped to be ſaved in the condition which for the preſent
he was in, he would certainly be damned: that he muſt caſt
away all thoſe groundleſs hopes he had conceived, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deſpair in himſelf, that being pricked and pained at
heart, through the apprehenſions of the wrath of God ready
to fall upon him, and ſeeing no poſſibility of flying and eſcape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if he looked onely to himſelf, he might cry out, <hi>VVhat
ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> and enquire after a Saviour: and then
they ſpake to him of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of
ſalvation by him, which before he was ſottiſhly ignorant of, as if
he had been brought up in a Country of Infidels, and not of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
The words ſpoken to him by theſe two Miniſters, ſeemed
to take little impreſſion upon him whilſt they were preſent; yet
after they were gon, the Lord did begin to work, and he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that two had been with him (he knew
not their names) whoſe words were like arrows ſhot into his
heart, and he did wiſh he had thoſe words in writing eſpecially
one expreſſion of <hi>T. V. That he would not be in his condition for ten
thouſand Worlds,</hi> did affect and affright him that he ſaid it made
his hair ſtand an end.</p>

                        <p>I asked him how old he was? <hi>He ſaid,</hi> ſixteen years old: I
told him, he was a young man, but an old ſinner; <hi>then I
began to ſet my ſelf to bring him to a ſenſe of his ſins, and of

that this God is true? <hi>He ſaid,</hi> Yes: <hi>and taking up the Bible,
I asked him,</hi> Doſt thou believe that this is the Word of God? <hi>He
anſwered,</hi> Yes: <hi>then I told him,</hi> according to this word he was a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152165:5"/>
damned wretch, and God had paſt a ſentence of death upon him,
and told him plainly, that he ſhould not enter into the Kingdom of
<hi>God,</hi> but be a Companion of Devils in a Lake of brimſtone to all
Eternity, (<hi>meaning without Repentance, converſion and Faith
in Chriſt.) Then I turned him to ſeveral Scriptures, and told
him,</hi> This was the word by which he muſt be judged at the barr
of <hi>God,</hi> and be damned or ſaved according as then he ſhould be
found to be, converted or unconverted: <hi>The Scriptures were as
followeth,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9. Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not
inherit the Kingdom of God? be not deceived; neither Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers
of themſelves with mankind, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. Nor Thieves, nor Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit
the Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Another Scripture I read to him, was</hi> Gal. 5. 19. Now the
works of the fleſh are manifest, <hi>which are theſe,</hi> Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Idolatry, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions,

and ſuch like, of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you
in time paſt: that they which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the

                        <p>
                           <hi>The next Scripture to the ſame purpoſe, was,</hi> Rev. 21. 8.
But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all
lyars, ſhall have there part in the Lake which burneth with fire
and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</p>
                        <p>I told him theſe were the words of the holy, true, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
God; this was the ſentence which God had paſſed upon
him, as the deſert of thoſe abominable ſins which he was guilty
of: for theſe Scriptures pointed at ſeveral of the ſins which he
confeſſed he had lived in, and had committed, as drunkenneſs,
lying, uncleanneſs, and murther. I cryed, <hi>you confeſs your ſelf
guilty of theſe ſins, and that God threatneth you with Eternal
death, with everlasting torments, and excluſion from his preſence
and Kingdom, not only Gods Juſtice but Gods Truth alſo, ſtood
betwixt him and eternal happineſs; and told him, that I ſpake it
with reverence that the Holy God muſt be a Lyar, or elſe he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the guilt of theſe ſins. muſt be certainly and eternally dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>

                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152165:6"/>
                           <hi>I asked him,</hi> what do you think? how will you eſcape the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of hell, and the great wrath that is come? You have heard
what God ſaith? what do you ſay? what courſe will you take, and
what means will you uſe, that you may not, according to God's
threatning, be caſt amongſt Devils, into Eternal devouring
flames? <hi>to this, at preſent, he made no reply, but did often
ſhake his head, and lifted up his eyes towards Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next I endeavoured to bring him to a ſight and ſenſe of the
corruption of his nature, and of the ſinfulneſs of his heart: and
told him, all thoſe ſins were in his heart, before they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
committed: and turned him to the ſaying of Chriſt,
in the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>For out of the heart proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
evil thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts,
Falſe-witneſſes, Blaſphemies,</hi> and told him, that in his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for thoſe ſins, he muſt not only lay to heart and be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the outward acts, but lament and bewail the inward
principle of corruption, whereby he was ſo ſtrongly inclined
to ſuch horrid abominations, according to the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
after his ſins of Adultery and Murther, in his confeſſion
did follow them up to the riſe and original from whence they
did ſpring, <hi>Pſal. 15. 5. Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity and in
ſin did my Mother conceive me,</hi> By this time I perceived ſome
workings of heart within him, and that he was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſenſible of his loſt eſtate, and by his deportment and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
to be caſt down, not knowing what to do; I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to leave him without ſome grounds of hope, that it may
be, he might be ſaved; that there was a poſſibility that he might
obtain pardoning mercy, and be delivered from that great
damnation that was due to him for his great tranſgreſſions, I
began to open to him the readineſs of Chriſt, the fulneſs and
ſufficiency of Chriſt to ſave the greateſt ſinners: and that God
(I hoped, in mercy to his ſoul) had ſent me, one of his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
to offer him a pardon, and Eternal life, if he were but
willing to accept of Chriſt upon the terms of the Goſpel, for
his Lord and Saviour: and did encourage and aſſure him, upon
repentance and faith in Chriſt, there was mercy yet for him,
though a Murderer, from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa. 1. 18. Come
now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be
as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; and though they be as
red as crimſon they ſhall be as wool.</hi> As I opened to him the great
mercy of God in Chriſt toward Sinners, dyed in grain, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152165:6"/>
were ſinners of a ſcarlet colour, that had committed heinous
tranſgreſſions, he brake forth into tears, and wept plentifully
at the tydings of mercy, and poſſibility that ſuch a one as he
might be ſaved. Beſides, I turned him to ſome Scripture-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
that God would certainly forgive his ſins, and ſave his
Soul, if he could repent, and get Faith in Chriſt: Such as
<hi>Prov. 28. 13. He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find
mercy: and</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
abundantly pardon.</hi> This Scripture he diligently heeded, and
turned it down in his Bible; and theſe two Scriptures (the night
before he ſuffered) amongſt others he alledged as the grounds
of his hopes of mercy.</p>
                        <p>I alſo gave him ſome Scripture inſtances of great Sinners that
had obtained mercy; turned him to the example of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. to that of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> Luke 7. 37, 38. to
that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 2. 37, 38. that were guilty of the blood
of Chriſt, that had murdered the Son of God, a greater mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than which could not be committed: and yet upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Faith many of them were pardoned and ſaved:
To that of <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16. ſhewed him how
God had ſet up <hi>Paul</hi> as a pattern of Free-grace, towards great
ſinners, for the encouragement of ſuch, that (though guilty of
great ſins) afterwards ſhould believe. To all theſe he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
very carefully, and took notice of the places of Scripture,
for his meditation after I left him.</p>
                        <p>And laſt of all, I endeavoured to ſet before him Jeſus Chriſt,
as the only Remedy and Saviour for his Soul; and ſhewed him
the inſufficiency of all his Duties, Prayers and Tears, to get off
the guilt of the leaſt ſin: that if he could ſhed a thouſand tears
of blood for any one vain thought, it would be no better than
puddle water to juſtifie or to ſave him. Much diſcourſe I had
with him at this time, beſides what is here inſerted, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other times when I went to viſit him in <hi>Newgate;</hi> which I
willingly omit, becauſe this book ſhould not ſwell to too great
a bulk.</p>
                        <p>After all, I went to prayer with him: in which Duty he
was much diſſolved into tears: he ſeemed to me, and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Friend that was moſt with him above all others, to be very
earneſt in Prayer, and with weeping eyes to beg for pardon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152165:7"/>
and for Converting Grace, and Chriſt to be his Saviour; which
was much inſiſted on in the prayer that was made for him.</p>
                        <p>After which, adviſing him to conſider of what I had ſaid,
for that time I took my leave of him.</p>
                     </div>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </p>
            <p>The next time after this Diſcourſe, that Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> came to
him, he Enquired how it was with him: he ſaid, what <hi>T. D.</hi>
had ſaid, did very much ſtartle him, that he knew not what to
reply, and cryed out very much of the heinouſneſs of his ſins,
that he ſhould commit that horrid Sin of Murder: and knew
not what to do, for that left a deep impreſſion upon his heart,
that God muſt be a Lyar, or elſe he (in that condition of im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>penitency)
muſt be damned: yet he laid hold upon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that was unfolded to him, <hi>That if a ſinner turned from his
wicked ways, God would abundantly pardon:</hi> And afterwards
read on the verſe that followed, <hi>Iſa 55. 8. For my thoughts are
not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
Upon which conſidering, ſaid <hi>Men cry out for death and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
no mercy to be had from men: but Gods thoughts to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
ſinner were life, for he delighteth not in the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About four or five days after this, he was puzled about his
performing of Duties, and reſting only upon Chriſt for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for he was tempted, if he performed duties. to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: or to let them alone, and leave them off, if he muſt
reſt only upon Chriſt. At which time. <hi>H. B.</hi> coming to him,
enquired how it was with him now? and how he hoped to be
ſaved? He anſwered by Repentance and Faith: and I could
eaſily tell you, to ſatisfie you, that I do repent, and do believe:
but truly ſo to do as I ought, I find it the hardeſt thing in the
World: I do believe, and I do not: I cannot tell how to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve
that Chriſt dyed for ſinners, ſo as to throw my ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully upon him, and to think my Tears and Prayers will
do me no good.</p>
            <p>But here, Reader, we muſt take notice of the unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the Devil, in uſing all means from time to time, to
undo, ruine, and wound the Soul of this poor Malefactor, who
would not forbear to ſolicit him to ſin, after he was caſt into
Priſon for former iniquities he had committed; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but judge that the Devil was loth to looſe ſuch a prey as
his immortal Soul; when he had brought him to the very
Mouth and Gates of Hell, to have him ſnatched out of his hands
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152165:7"/>
by the free-grace of God, the Devil did work the more (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knew his time to tempt him, was but ſhort) to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
and eclipſe the gracious work of God upon his heart, and
cloud the glory of Gods mercy, in ſaving ſuch a ſinner. He was
by ſome former acquaintance viſiting of him, (who ſhewed
their love to a death deſerving ſinner, no other way then by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for drink, and deſiring him to drink with them) overcome
therewith, and after ſome former convictions of ſin, and his
loſt eſtate, did twice relapſe into the ſin of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he cauſed many to fear, that all this while he had no more
than ſome common workings of the Spirit; and put us to ſtand,
that we knew not what would be the iſſue of theſe things: but
yet not daring to omit endeavours (if poſſible) as inſtrumenents
under God to ſave his ſoul, we did after this, viſit him again
and again, and ſet forth unto him the greatneſs of his ſin, that
he ſhould ſin yet more againſt the Lord, and in his affliction
and chains, to provoke the Lord to greater wrath againſt his
Soul; with many words to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After which, his ſoul was wounded, his heart was pierced,
he knew not what to do: he asked, <hi>May Mercy be had for a
back-ſliding ſinner?</hi> To which were given him ſome Scriptures,
where God called to back-ſliding ſinners to return, and invited
them to repent, and promiſed Mercy to them if they did, even
after they had done as wickedly as they could: and this was
much enlarged upon before him, from <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. ver. 1, to 15. verſe.
But God that had begun to awaken and to rowſe his Conſcience,
that he might ſet him up as a pattern of free-grace, would not
let the Devil go thus away with his Soul, but brought him to a
deep ſenſe of his falling into ſin, that he much lamented with
many tears the ſadneſs of his ſtate, the miſery of his ſoul, ſaying
What will become of my Soul! my Immortal Soul! I cannot
think what will become of my ſoul! I deſerve Hell ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times over; and have I now but one grain of ſand left in
the glaſs to work for Eternity? ſhall I neglect God any longer?
O, I have neglected God too long already! ſtriking his hand
upon his Breaſt, and wringing his hands, and ſhaking his head,
and weeping abundantly, ſaid, Lord, what ſhall I do? O
God, what ſhall I do? Lord, what will become of me? if
God had dealt juſtly with me, I had now been in Hell, I had
been daſhed into Hell when I murthered that poor innocent
Creature, I wonder that I am not now in Hell; that ſuch a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152165:8"/>
wretch as I, am not in Hell: God hath been pleaſed to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
more mercy to me, in ſparing of me, and affording me ſo
long time for Repentance; but I have neglected time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed
into drunkenneſs and vain talking, time after time. I
thought this place (meaning the Hole in <hi>Newgate,</hi>) Hell upon
Earth, and did account it a Heaven to be among other Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
but now God hath tryed me, whether ſin will be bitter
and diſpleaſing to me, or not; I have this day (being the
Lords day) been among the Priſoners, and they asked me to
play at Cards: but inſtead of complying with them, I reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and told them, for my part I had profaned Sabbaths
enough already, I have but a little time to work for my Soul,
and I ought not to neglect time now; that they likewiſe (he
told them) if they rightly conſidered, had ſomething elſe to
do, and ſtriking his hand upon his breaſt, with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he cryed out with tears, Now, now I find that God hath
been at work upon my Soul; he hath, I am ſure, been at
work: for now I ſee ſo much evil, and taſte ſuch bitterneſs in
ſin, that I am not ſo much troubled that I am to dye, nor ſo
much troubled that I am in danger of Hell, as to think I ſhould
ſo diſhonour God, that I ſhould ſo offend ſo gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
a God, and ſpurn againſt all his Mercies. Oh my Soul,
my Immortal Soul! I know not what will become of it to all
Eternity. it is the grief of my very Soul, that I have neglected
time as I have done: now I ſee ſo much need of a Chriſt, and
ſo much preciouſneſs and excellency in Chriſt, that if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
King in the world ſhould come and throw his Crown at my
foot, and tell me I ſhould enjoy it, and all the glory of it for
millions of years, and ſhould have my Liberty preſently, and
ſhould ſay, but it muſt be without Chriſt, I would ſooner
choſe to dye this moment; nay, to be racked to pieces by ten
thouſand deaths, or burn ten years together, ſo I may have a
Chriſt, I ſpeak freely from my heart, ſo far as I know my
heart; and now I find it is not only the Devil's tempting me,
hath brought me to this, but this curſed, wretched, deviliſh
heart of mine within. It is within me, ſo that it was in me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was committed by me: I deſerved Hell ten thouſand
times over, before I committed this horrid ſin: well, now I
am reſolved, I will pray as much as I can, and weep and wreſtle
with God, as if I were to have Heaven for it: but when I have
done all, I will deny all; for my Prayers and Tears cannot ſave
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152165:8"/>
me: and I will fully and wholly throw my ſelf at the feet of
Chriſt; and if I am damned, I will be damned there. And
more he ſpake to this purpoſe in Mr. <hi>Baker's</hi> hearing.</p>
            <p>About three days after, Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> coming to him, asked
him how it was with him. He told him, that the Devil was
very buſie with him, and did ſolicit him grievouſly with his
Temptations, perſwading him to have thoughts of eſcaping:
Theſe things (ſaid he) hindred my minding of God one part
of the day; the other part of the day the Devil fills me with
drowſineſs, that I can neither pray, nor read, nor perform
any duty, nor mind any one that prays with me. Sometimes
he tempts me to delay, telling me that it is time enough for me
to think of Repentance when I am Condemned; and, that God
is a merciful God; and ſometimes he tempted me to Deſpair,
telling me that it was impoſſible that ſo monſtrous a ſinner as I
had been, ſhould be ſaved. But bleſſed be God that he made
me to think that theſe were but the Devils Temptations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have been ſadly hurried with them for ſome days: but
that which did moſt fill me with terror, was the frequent fears
of the Devil's appearing perſonally to me; which did ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
trouble me in Prayer, ſo that I could ſay nothing
when I kneeled down, but was fain to ſet the Candle down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, and durſt not look one way nor other, for fear I
ſhould ſee him; and my thoughts have been ſo vain many times,
when you have been reading to me, that I have ſcarce heard a
word of what you ſaid.</p>

                        <p>H. B. <hi>asking him how it was with him? He replied,</hi> It is
the grief of my Soul that I ſhould be no more affected: I think I
have the moſt rocky, stony heart in the world: if ever there was
an heart of Iron, I have one, it is not fit to be called an heart.
To have others come and pray with me, and inſtruct me, and ſee
how they are affected with my condition, and yet I not at all affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with my own condition; Oh it is the grief of my ſoul to ſee it ſo!
and yet as ſoon as Miniſters and good people are gone, and I walk
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152165:9"/>
about and conſider, oh it melts me, and breaketh my heart in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to think, I can mourn for ſin, and grieve for ſin no more,
when Gods people are with me! becauſe it cauſeth them to think that
I am not ſenſible of my ſin; though bleſſed be God I am in ſome
meaſure ſenſible of the evil of my ſins; and it is the grief of my
ſoul to think how I have diſhonoured God, and abuſed his Mercy,
and ſpurned againſt his Mercy and Patience.</p>
                        <p>After this, they both ſpent ſome time in Prayer, and <hi>H. B.</hi>
asked him, how it was with him now? He ſaid, I find ſo much
ſweetneſs in prayer. although I cannot find God loveth me,
that to think I am not Curſing and ſwearing as others are, but
be confeſſing my ſin, my very tears trickle down my Cheeks
for joy: ſometimes I find my heart ſo dead and dull in duty,
that I know not what to ſay in Prayer: at other times I find my
heart ſo full, and ſo much affected in Duty, that I could wiſh
I might never riſe off my knees.</p>
                        <p>The night before the Seſſions, <hi>H. B.</hi> coming to him, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him if it was not terrible to him to think of appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Barr of men? he anſwered, methinks when I conſider
ſeriouſly of it, what a light poor thing mans Barr is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of Gods Barr, yet mans Barr is enough to daunt one,
to hear them ſay, <hi>Take him Gaoler, tye him up:</hi> but to appear
before Gods Barr, who knoweth all the ſins that ever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
he ſaw all my ſecret ſins; and for God to ſay, <hi>Take
him Gaoler,</hi> take him <hi>Devil, ſhut him up in the Dungeon of Hell:</hi>
Oh! that is enough. I believe, to make the ſtouteſt heart in
the World to tremble: for there is no recalling that ſentence;
and I believe there are many go out of this Priſon, as I ſaw for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
three that went to be hanged, and they were almoſt
drunk, and did ſing all the way they went: but oh, their note
was ſoon changed, when they came to ſtand before Gods
Barr.</p>
                        <p>The morning before he went to the Seſſions, <hi>H. B.</hi> and the
Priſoner ſpent ſome time in prayer, the Priſoner in his prayer
did earneſtly beg of God that he would keep him from thoſe
temptations he might be expoſed unto by bad company: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this he was taken down to the Seſſions houſe, but was

                        <p>At night <hi>H. B.</hi> came to him again, and asking how it was

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152165:9"/>
Chriſtian: I thought before I came to Priſon, that reading a
Chapter now and then, and ſaying the Lords Prayer, and the
Creed at night when I went to bed, would have ſaved me,
though many times I was aſleep before I had half done: but
now I find it no ſuch eaſie thing to get to Heaven; nay, I find
it the hardeſt thing in the World, for my Prayers and Tears
and Duties, if I could fall upon my knees and never riſe off from
them while I live, they would not ſave me; for all this is but
my duty: but I now know there is merit enough in the blood
of Chriſt to ſave me; and he did earneſtly beg of God in
Prayer, that God would waſh his Soul in the blood of Chriſt,
and blot out all his ſins out of the book of his remembrance,
and turn them behind his back, though I as earneſtly beg they
might be all ſpread before my face, that I might have a more
humble and throughly broken heart for them: Lord, one drop
of that blood is enough to waſh away all my ſins: And ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome conference, <hi>H. B.</hi> left him for that night, who heard
from one that was with him that night, that he ſpent that time

            <p>The ſecond morning, in the time of the Seſſions, Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
that was a careful friend for the good of his Soul, went
to the Seſſions Houſe, where he found him well, and in good
Frame, and continued with him for the ſpace of two or three
hours that morning; after which time Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> was from him
to hear the Tryal of the Perſon that was arraigned, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
executed for the Fire upon the houſe burnt down in
<hi>Mincing-Lane,</hi> for the ſpace of half an hour, or thereabout;
in which time, in company of other Priſoners, he was much
diſtempered with ſomething that he had drank amongſt them,
which did take from him his underſtanding, that he was not
his own man; we judge (that though this did caſt a blemiſh
upon the profeſſion that he had made after he came to <hi>Newgate</hi>)
it was not a voluntary act, but ſome ſurpriſal or deſign of the
other upon him; partly, becauſe the quantity was far leſs than
what at other times he could drink without any diſturbance to
his head. A Friend alſo heard <hi>Hannah</hi> the Strumpet that enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to his former wickedneſs, ſay, <hi>Others have made you
drunk to day, but I will make you drunk to morrow.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he was afraid to drink in their company, but rather
denied to take what was neceſſary for his refreſhment.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners, were much againſt his accuſing of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152165:10"/>
and did much perſwade him to take ſomething to chear
his Spirits; and when <hi>T. D.</hi> was with him on Saturday before
he dyed, he charged him with his ſin, which had cauſed ſuch
a blot upon all the Profeſſion he had made, and what great cauſe he
had to be humbled before God; and deſired him, to tell him, as a
dying man, whether it was his voluntary act and delight in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
drinking, or no? And he did proſefs, that he knew it
was not the quantity that he had drank, which was not near ſo
much as at other times he did uſe without diſtempering of himſelf</p>
            <p>However, God was pleaſed to make him taſte the bitterneſs
of that Cup in that he had given ſuch occaſion to ſinners to ſpeak
evil of the wayes of God, and beating his hands (being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to himſelf,) upon the ſtones, cryed out, <hi>Oh that I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God!</hi> And though he did much lament the ſcandal, yet he
always ſaid, that he looked not upon it as a ſin of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but a circumvention; or to uſe his own words, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was put into the drink, to diſtemper his head.</p>
            <p>On Saturday during the Seſſions, he was arraigned, and
pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> confeſſing with many tears and wringing his
hands, that he, through the inſtigation of the Devil, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement
of that wretched Creature (meaning the Harlot) had
committed that bloody fact, which was ſuch an horror to his
Conſcience, that he would not do it again for ten thouſand
Worlds: his Carriage and Confeſſion was ſuch, that he much
moved the honourable Bench and Jury, and moſt of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
            <p>On Monday next he received his Sentence of Death; after
which time he was with the other condemned Priſoners, and
did pray with them four times a day, and read to them, and
ſung Pſalms with them. After the Execution of the reſt.
he had time given or procured him by the honourable Sheriff
of <hi>London,</hi> for ſome days, which he improved to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On Friday night he uttered theſe expreſſions, in company with H. B.
being the day that the other Priſoners were Executed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find, ſaith he, ſo much ſweetneſs and delight, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in Gods ways, and ſo much folly in the ways of ſin, that
if there were no Heaven to reward, nor any Hell to puniſh, I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152165:10"/>
could not but love the ways of God, and the People of God:
Oh, it is ſo ſweet to be in company with them, praying and
converſing with them, over what is in hearing others Swear,
and Curſe, that I account it as great a mercy as any almoſt, that
I may be in their Company. O methinks it is a Heaven to me
to be with God's Miniſters and People: and Prayer now is ſo
ſweet, that I grudge the time always when I am off from my
knees, or go down to the grate. Now there is nothing in the
World I prize like Chriſt; one Chriſt above Ten thouſand
Worlds: now I do repent, and I do believe through Mercy:
it is the Lords work; but <hi>I</hi> earneſtly beg and pray for a more
humble, and a more broken heart, and a more through ſenſe
of ſin, and a greater ſorrow for it, and beg that God would
enable me to come to him, to believe in him; Lord, ſaith he,
Faith is thy work, Repentance is thy work; do thou enable
me to repent; nay, thou haſt enabled me to repent, and <hi>I</hi> do
from the very bottom of my heart, Lord, as far as <hi>I</hi> know
my own heart: <hi>I</hi> repent that <hi>I</hi> ſhould offend ſo gracious, and
ſo merciful a God as thou art, Lord; and Faith is thy work.
Lord, ſaith he, haſt thou not ſaid, No man can come to thee,
except the Father draw him. Draw me, O Lord, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall
run to thee; enable me to believe. Lord, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall believe;
nay, <hi>I</hi> do believe, Lord, that Jeſus Chriſt his blood was not
ſhed in vain. Did Chriſt die for nothing, Lord? Did he not
die to ſave all repenting and believing ſinners of whom <hi>I</hi> am
chief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On Saturday at night, in company with Mr. Baker, he Diſcourſed
thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! my dear Friend. taking me by the hand, come hither,
ſaith he, and opening the Coffin, look here is the Ship, ſaith
he, in which <hi>I</hi> muſt lanch out into the Ocean of Eternity: and
is it not a terrible thing (ſaith he) to ſee one's own Coffin and
burying-cloaths, when at the ſame time I am as well as you?
do you think it would not daunt you? to go to the gallows, to
have the Halter, and to dye there; were this for the ſake of
the Goſpel, I ſhould not care, were it ten hundred times a
worſe death: but to ſuffer this curſed death for ſuch horrid ſins,
O this is ſad! Why, ſaid I, you have a greater mercy in
ſome reſpect, than thoſe that dye in their beds; for they are
full of ſickneſs and pain, and cannot ſo well mind Repentance
as you, who are well, and have nothing elſe to mind. Ah Sir,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152165:11"/>
ſaith he, their ſins are of a far leſs nature than mine, and ſo they
do not need ſo much repentance as mine do: my dying for
ſuch horrid ſins, makes my repentance to be ſo much the more
hard. O, ſaith he, I believe it, it is a hard work to dye: I
could carry it out as bravely as any, (do you think I could not?)
but to conſider, that as I die, and am ſentenced from God's
Barr ſo I muſt be for ever, immediately either be everlaſtingly
happy, or everlaſtingly miſerable: To conſider this, would
make a ſtout heart to tremble: Thoſe poor Creatures that
were here the other night (meaning the other condemned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners)
they know now what it is to be in an eternal ſtate, and
if they are gone to Hell, O Lord, how miſerably are they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed,
who hoped for to have gone to Heaven, and are
ſent from thy Barr to endleſs burning! Lord, what a mercy
is it that I have a little time longer left, let it be improved to
thy glory and let my ſoul live, and I ſhall praiſe thee.</p>
            <p>The laſt Lords day, he lived, he deſired to be alone, and
ſpent it in wreſtling with God by prayers, and in other duties
in order to his preparation for his great change by death, that
then he expected the next day; in which duties he found ſo
much of God, that he had ſome fore-taſts of the joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and when we asked him what of God he had found that
day; he replyed, That he had ſuch pleaſure and delight in
mourning for ſin, and praying unto God, that he was loath to
come off from his knees. At night there were ſome Miniſters
that ſat up with him, and ſpent that night in prayer with him,
and for him, and in conference; on Monday morning came
<hi>T. D.</hi> to him before day (thinking it was his laſt day; for an
Order was ſent on Friday for his Execution on Monday) and
ſaid to him, <hi>Thomas,</hi> how is it with you now? your laſt day
begins to dawn. He ſaid, Bleſſed be God I am not afraid to
dye, becauſe I hope I ſhall go to Jeſus Chriſt. After ſome
time in prayer for him, we deſired him to ſpend ſome time in
that Duty! which he performed with ſo much affection, and
earneſt pleading with God, that all the company were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
melted, and their hearts beyond ordinary meaſure warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and raiſed, that the room did ring with ſighs and groans;
and there was ſuch a mighty preſence of the Spirit poured out
upon him, and on thoſe that joyned with him, that we do not
remember the time when ever we had experience of the like.
In which Prayer, after the confeſſion of his ſins, he begged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152165:11"/>
earneſtly for pardon, and for an intereſt in Chriſt; ſaying, O
Lord, wilt thou let me dye without a Chriſt? Shall I leave this
world, before thou ſmileſt upon my Soul? Thou haſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
pardon, and mercy, and ſalvation to thoſe that do repent,
and to thoſe that do believe: Lord, I do repent, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
if I know my own heart, I do repent, I do believe;
Lord I roll my ſelf upon thy Son, I caſt my ſelf at his foot for
mercy. Thou wouldſt be juſt, if thou doſt damn me; but thou
haſt pardoned others, and it will be to the praiſe of thy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to pardon me. Lord, ſhall thoſe Prayers that have been
made, and all thoſe Tears that have been ſhed for me, and all
thoſe Inſtructions which have been given me, be all in vain?
With many other Expreſſions in that Prayer, which wonderfully
affected the hearts of thoſe that were with him; that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we looked upon one another, wondring at the Grace of
God towards him, that one ſo wicked all his days, ſo young,
(being ſixteen years old) ſo lately acquainted with the ways of
God, ſhould have ſuch a Spirit of Prayer poured out upon him:
after this, he prayed with more life and fervency than before;
and the nearer he came to his end, the more we perceived God
was ripening him for Glory.</p>
            <p>After this we took our leave of him, not knowing but that
was the laſt day; for the Cart ſtood below, and the Coffin fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down, and ſome of the honourable Sheriffs of <hi>Londons</hi> men,
came into the Priſon: but the Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex</hi> having not
notice to be ready, his Execution was deferred till <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> Here take notice, that the report that the reaſon why
he was not Executed on Monday, was becauſe he was drunk, is an
abominable falſhood; for to our knowledge that were with him, he
did not eat nor drink that morning.</p>
            <p>When we went up to him again, we told him we perceived
he was not to dye that day, giving him caution, <hi>not to think
there was any pardon intended for him:</hi> and one came from the
Sheriff to acquaint him with the reaſon of the delay of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>When his Coffin was carried up to him again, one asked
what he thought, and what were the workings of his heart
when he ſaw his Coffin brought back? he ſaid he was much
troubled, and it daunted him to ſee it; for he could willingly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152165:12"/>
have dyed that day to go to Chriſt. On <hi>Monday</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
he had an exceſſive pain in his Teeth, (as we judge occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by his leaving off his Cloaths, and putting on ſome thin
Apparel to dye in) and that evening he expreſſed great willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to dye and leave the World. He ſaid, I ſee and feel ſo
much excellency in Chriſt, that he is ſo pure in Grace, pure in
Holineſs, pure in all things. Lord, I count it an Hell to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, I ſo long to be where I might enjoy thee: and he
ſpent ſome time in Prayer, (notwithſtanding his pain) with
much affection, wherein he ſaid, The pain of the Teeth was
great, but the pain of Hell was greater.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday, the day before he dyed, after ſome time ſpent
in prayer both by him and <hi>H. B.</hi> being full of joy, he expreſſed
himſelf thus: O my dear Friend, what a welcome ſhall I give
you when you come to Heaven, and ſay to you, Come ſee,
come ſee, this is the Glory that you told me of: but all that you
ever told me, was nothing to what I have found: O what a
place is this! O how ſhall we love one another then! Sure it
cannot be, but Heaven muſt be a glorious place, where God,
Chriſt, and Angels be.</p>
            <p>The night before he dyed, a Miniſter came to <hi>Thomas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi>
and after other ſerious diſcourſe, ſor ſatisfaction of a
Chriſtian Friend that had ſeen him before, he demanded of him,
what were now the grounds of his hopes of Salvation? He made
this reply, God both in infinite mercy made me deeply ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of great ſins, and not only of them, but of the vileneſs of
my heart and nature, and God hath made me to abhor my
ſelf for my ſins, and I hope truly to repent of them: for that
which hath been the delight of my ſoul, is now as bad as Hell;
and God hath given me to ſee, that all my own Prayers and
Tears, and all the Prayers of all the good people that come to
me, are not able to ſave. A Chriſt alone; I throw my ſelf at
the feet of Chriſt for mercy, and if I periſh, I will periſh there.
I feel longings and breathings after Chriſt, and love him more
than my life: I long to be with him; and I would not be to live
any longer: this World is a little Hell becauſe of ſin. I fear
not death, for <hi>I</hi> hope the ſting of it is taken out for me.</p>
            <p>This laſt night before his death, he deſired us to ſit up with
him, in order to his better preparation for the great work he
had to do the next day, that we might wreſtle with God on
his behalf, that when death approacheth ſo near unto him, he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152165:12"/>
might have ſome nearer acceſſes unto God into his Soul, that
when pale death ſtared him in the face, he might ſee Gods ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
countenance, which opportunity we readily embraced,
and ſpent the former part of the night in prayer, till two of
the Clock in the morning; about which time he deſired us to
go down into the Lodge, that he might have ſome part of the
night for prayer and meditation alone, and to diſcourſe a while
with his friend Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> to whom he moſt of all did open
his very heart, and ſpake more freely to, than to any other
(whom for that reaſon we left with him) and when we were
gone down, his Friend being with him, who told us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he fell into admiration, and ſaid, What a Prodigy am
I? What a wonder of Mercy that God ſhould encline the
hearts of his Miniſters to come and pray with me! and pour
out their ſouls in prayer thus for me! For me a Murtherer, for
me a Drunkard, for me ſo vile and ſinful! Well, I cannot but
love God; and though I go to Hell, yet I will love God for
his goodneſs and graciouſneſs to me already manifeſted in this
world: yea, though I ſhould be damned for my ſin, yet I could
and would love God. What, would they venture to come
and pray with me a Murtherer? How did they know but I
might have Murthered ſome of them? Pray for me! wreſtle
for me; Well, I know God loves; I am ſure God loves me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When he was in prayer, ſome of us heard him ſay,</hi> Now
Lord I am coming to thee, thou art mine, and Chriſt is mine; and
what need I be afraid of Death? Lord, give me ſome ſenſe and
ſome ſign of thy love, that when my ſoul ſhall be ſeparated from my
body, it may be received into glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afterwards when he looked upon his Cloaths he had put on
to dye in, ſaid,</hi> What have I got on my dying-cloaths; dying-cloaths
did I ſay? they are my living-cloaths; the cloaths out of
which I ſhall go into eternal glory; they are the beſt cloaths that ever
I put on.</p>
            <p>About four of the Clock in the morning; we went up to him
again, full of expectation what we would ſay to us, and what
we ſhould hear from him; and <hi>T. D.</hi> ſtood behind him, and
took his expreſſions as he ſpake them, from his own mouth:
and firſt, he told us, <hi>I account it a great mercy that God hath
ſhewed me the evil of ſin, before he caſt me into Hell: ſin hath not
only brought my body to the grave, but my ſoul in danger of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:152165:13"/>
The Lord will have mercy on me, I hope; I am filled with joy,
I am no more afraid to die, than to stand in this place, the Lord
make me thankful. The Lord hath been working on my ſoul, for
it was not I that could pray, nor refrain from company, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in any thing that is good: I have cauſe to bleſs God that ever
I was taken, (<hi>and this we have often heard him ſay</hi>) for if I had
eſcaped, I had gone on in my ſin, and might have loſt my ſoul for
ever.</p>
            <p>One asked him, which he thought was worſe, hell or ſin?
uſing ſome geſture of body; ſaid, Hell is very dreadful, but ſin
is worſe then hell. becauſe ſin brings mens ſouls to hell, and ſin
is that which offendeth God.</p>
            <p>One asked him what he thought of Heaven? and he with a
ſmiling countenance ſaid, Heaven! it cannot be, but heaven muſt
be an excellent place, for it is an holy place. We ſpake to him
concerning his Coffin that was by him, whether it did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and amaze him to have it in his ſight: he replyed, with all
my ſoul <hi>I</hi> coul go into my Coffin: oh! it is a comfortable place
(he ſpake it with joy) <hi>I</hi> can comfortably dye: <hi>I</hi> have found ſuch
a deal of joy and comfort, that <hi>I</hi> would not for a world have
been without it.</p>
            <p>We enquired whether death did not affright him; morning
light will preſently appear: He anſwered, Death indeed did
trouble me, but now not at all: <hi>I</hi> long for day, <hi>I</hi> am not daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at death. Dye, it is nothing: this life is nothing: but to
dye Eternally and to looſe God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, that is
Death. Hell-tormens is not ſo much, as to be ſhut from the
preſence of God. Alas! who would not dye this death to go
to Jeſus Chriſt? when my body is upon the Gibbet, my ſoul
ſhall be carried by Angels into Heaven. My heart is ſo drawn
out after God, that <hi>I</hi> could leave this world to be with him.
This world is nothing, thoſe that have the pleaſures of it, have
nothing: <hi>I</hi> deſire to dye, becauſe <hi>I</hi> long to be with Chriſt,
there I ſhall never ſin more: there is no ſin, but joy, where
I ſhall ſing <hi>hallelujahs</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> to God. We askt what he
thought of the company of Gods people; for he had now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of company good and bad: He ſaid, I had rather be
here, (meaning the Hole in <hi>Newgate</hi>) with bread and water
with ſuch company, then to have the company of wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
with the greateſt dainties. It was wicked company that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152165:13"/>
drew me away. I account it the greateſt mercy to have the
prayers of Gods people for me: had I had my deſerts, I had
been now in Hell, where I ſhould have had no prayers, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions:
God doth love me, for he hath inclined the hearts
of his people and Miniſters to pray for me, and their prayers
have prevailed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being ask'd what promiſes he found to be his ſupport againſt
the guilt of ſin, now he was to dye, he alledged theſe, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the words himſelf.</hi> Whoſoever will, let him come and drink
of the waters of Life freely: and, He that confeſſeth and for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his ſin, ſhall find mercy: and, Let the wicked for ſake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the
Lord, and he will have mercy on him: and to our God, for he
will Abundantly Pardon. <hi>This word</hi> (Abundantly Pardon) <hi>did
often refreſh his ſoul, I have ſinned abundantly, but God will
pardon abundantly. After theſe, he mentioned another,</hi> viz,
This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief: <hi>and ſaid,
I do relie and throw my ſelf upon Jeſus Chriſt: I do believe
there is merit enough in him, and all ſufficiency in him to ſave
me: it is nothing that I can do will ſave me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He complained, that it was the grief of his ſoul that he could
love God no more, and love Chriſt no more for his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, in giving him ſo much time, and ſo many helps,
in ſending ſo many Miniſters to inſtruct him; but added, <hi>when
ſeveral Miniſters had been with me, I threw of all, and returned
to ſin, and did as vainly as any: I could not have repented and
believed of my ſelf, it is the work of God.</hi> He often ſaid, I fear
not death, it was nothing with him to die and go to Chriſt.
He often ſaid, that he had rather die immediately, having an
<hi>intereſt in Chriſt</hi> than to live a thouſand years in this world, in
the enjoyment of all the pleaſures of it, without Chriſt. And
that he had found more pleaſure and delight in the Ways of
God ſince he came into Priſon, than ever he found in all the
ways of ſin.</p>
            <p>He confeſſed his ſins, ſaying, he firſt neglected and profaned
the Sabbath; and ſaid, this was the beginning of all his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that on the Sabbath morning he ſtudied what company to
go into, in what place of ſin he might ſpend the Sabbath, then to
wicked Society, then to Ale-houſes, then to Brothel-houſes, then
to Murther, then to Theft, then to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and yet at laſt he
hoped to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:152165:14"/>
He lamented, ſaying, <hi>I</hi> have ſtriven to diſhonour God, and
to run into ſin: oh that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſpend ſo much time in ſerving
of the Devil, and now have but a little moment of time to ſpend
in the ſervice of God, and to the glory of God.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe being ended, we deſired him now on his laſt
morning before he went into Eternity, to pray with us, and he
willingly conſented, and his prayer was as followeth, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from his mouth by <hi>Thomas Doe-little,</hi> that alſo took in

                           <hi>O</hi> Moſt merciful and ever bleſſed Lord God, I beſeech thee,
O Lord, look down upon me, with an eye of pity, if it be
thy bleſſed will: it is thy infinite mercy that I am on this ſide the
grave, and out of Hell: O Lord, I have deſerved to be caſt into
torments to all Eternity. How have I offended thee, and run on in
fin, and thought I could never do enough to abuſe thy mercy! pardon
the ſins that I have committed, waſh that blood from off my ſoul;
let not me periſh to Eternity. It was an horrid crime to ſhed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood; pardon that ſin; O Lord, let the blood of Chriſt cry
more for mercy than the blood of that creature cry for
for vengeance. O Lord, thou haſt been merciful to me in giving
me time to Repent; for ought I know her ſoul is undone for ever:
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, I knew not what I did. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
my Sabbath-breaking, Lying, Curſing, forgive my drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
blot them out of the book of thy remembrance, turn them away
behind thee. Lord, I have repented of them from my ſoul that ever
I ſhould offend a God ſo good, and ſo merciful, and gracious. I do
believe on thee, and do wholly throw my ſelf upon thee. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it would be juſt in thee to damn my Soul, but it will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
mercy in thee to ſave me; and what free Grace will it
be in thee to pardon me! It is dreadful to loſe the body, but
how dreadful will it be to loſe the Soul to all Eternity! Lord, let it
not be in vain that I had ſo many inſtructions: O let me not go down
to hell, let my ſoul bleſs and praiſe thy Name for ever, for what
thou haſt done for me; thou haſt been at work upon my heart, and
thou haſt helped me to Repent, the Lord be praiſed. Lord, I deſire
to be more and more humble under the ſence of my ſins, for they
are dreadful: there are many ſouls that have not committed thoſe
ſins, that are now in Hell, O what a mercy is it that I am not in
thoſe flames, in thoſe devouring flames! Lord, as thou haſt ſpared
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152165:14"/>

hence, and be ſeen no more; that I might leave ſome Teſtimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

and tell thy People what thou haſt done for my Soul. Lord, this will
not be onely for my ſatisfaction, but for thy glory: Bleſſed Lord,
pardon the ſins that I am guilty of, and take away this curſed baſe
heart of mine, break this rocky ſtony heart in pieces, theſe ſins of
Murder and Drunkenneſs, &amp;c. were in my heart before: I
thought no eye did ſee me commit thoſe ſins, but thou didſt ſee me:
Lord, turn my heart to thee, and take away this heart of ſtone, and
take away this curſed nature; for it was this curſed Nature that
brought me to theſe ſins, and to this end; and I was in danger of
looſing my ſoul to all eternity: but Lord, though I a great ſinner,
Chriſt is a great Saviour, he is able to ſave me from my ſins, though
they be never ſo great: I do believe, Lord, I ſpeak freely from my
heart, ſo far as I know my heart, I do believe: it is my grief I
can ſorrow no more for my ſins, which have been the cauſe of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thee ſo long, and ſo much. One drop of thy blood ſprinkled
upon my ſoul, will pardon all my ſins. Lord, croſs the black line of
my ſins, with the red line of thy blood: I am not able to anſwer for
one vain thought, much leſs for all my horrid crimes, Lord, ſave
my immortal ſoul: that I might ſing praiſe to thee to all eternity.
Thou hast pardoned <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> that was a great ſinner, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

then I had of her body, ſhe is undone to all Eternity: ſo that
I deſerve not only death from Men, but Damnation from God.
I would have you all that look upon me, take warning by me:
the firſt ſin I began with, was Sabbath-breaking, whereby I got

was drawn aſide I ſay, by ill company, pray take heed of that,
for it will not only bring your bodies to the grave, but your
ſoul to hell: have a care of neglecting the Sabbaths, it is that
which hath not only brought my body to the grave, but my
ſoul in danger of eternal torments. And try the ways of God,
for the Lord be praiſed I have found ſo much of excellency and

Lord, give me a new heart, and give me faith that I may lay

and thence be recieved into glory: let me not be a prey to Devils

            <p>VVhilſt he did thus pathetically expreſs himſelf to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
eſpecially to God in prayer, there was a great moving
upon the affections of thoſe who ſtood by, and many tears
were drawn from their eyes by his melting ſpeeches. All this
was the more remarkable in this young man, being under ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age when he was firſt apprehended.</p>
            <p>After he was turned off the Cart, he ſtrugled for a while,

to put him quickly out of his pain, ſtruck him with all

was perceived in him; and hanging ſome conſiderable time
after that, and as to all outward appearance dead, inſomuch as
one ſaid to another friend of his, namely Mr. <hi>B. Now he is in
Eternity;</hi> and the people beginning to move away, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
commanded him to be cut down, and being receiv'd in the
arms of ſome of his friends, he was conveyed by them into a
houſe not far diſtant from the place of Execution, where being
laid upon a Table, unto the aſtoniſhment of the beholders,
he began to ſtir and breath, and rattle in his throat, and it
was evident his life was whole in him; from the Table he was
carried to a bed in the ſame Houſe, where he breathed more
ſtrongly, and opened his eyes and his mouth (though his teeth
were ſet before) and offered to ſpeak, but could not recover
the uſe of his Tongue; but his reviving being known within
an hour the Officers came to the houſe where he was, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
him to the place of Execution again, and hung him up
again, until he was quite dead, whence he was carried by his
mourning friends to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> where he now ſleepeth in the
Bed of his Grave, until the morning of the Reſurrection, from
whence, though buried in diſhonour, he will then be raiſed in
glory.</p>
            <p>Thus you have had the Relation of one that was but young
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152165:17"/>
in years, but old in wickedneſs: you have read of his Sabbath-breaking
prophaneſs, ſwearing, lying, ſtealing, drunkenneſs,
fornication, and the like ſins, which he confeſſed himſelf fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and deeply guilty of: and to compleat and fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his ſins he added to the reſt the horrid ſin of Murther. <hi>I</hi>
believe you have ſcarcely heard of ſin grown up to ſuch matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in ſo ſhort a time as it did in him, who when he was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
was under ſixteen years of age.</p>
            <p>And what could any expect ſhould be the iſſue and product of
ſin arriv'd to ſuch perfection, but Death and wrath, and the
vengeance of eternal fire?</p>
            <p>But behold here an inſtance of Free-grace! His ſins did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
but Gods grace did ſuper abound. Sometimes God
doth ſow the ſeed of grace in the heart that is moſt unlikely to
receive it; and reapeth great glory to his Name by pardoning
great ſins.</p>
            <p>VVe read that when <hi>Ephraim</hi> was bent upon wickedneſs, ſo
that a man could hardly expect the reſtraining of <hi>Gods anger</hi>
any longer, but that it ſhould kindle in his breaſt, and break
forth in a flame, to devour a people ſo rebellious; yet the
Lord expreſſeth himſelf in a way of wonderful mercy and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing
free-grace, Hoſ. 11. 8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up,
O Ephraim? How ſhall I make thee as Admah? How ſhall I ſet
thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me:</hi> (not againſt
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> but towards him) <hi>my repentings</hi> (not mine anger)
<hi>are kindled together, I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
And the reaſon is not drawn from any thing in <hi>Ephraim</hi> to
move him, but only from himſelf, <hi>For I am God and not Man.</hi>
If one man had been ſo provoked by another, and it had lain in
the power of his hand to have avenged himſelf on his enemy,
ſurely he would not have ſpared or ſhewn any favour. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is God and not Man, whoſe thoughts are not like our
thoughts, and whoſe mercies are not like our mercies, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
removed above them, then the Heavens are removed
above the Earth: in compariſon with whoſe mercies, our moſt
tender mercies are not leſs then cruelty: therefore becauſe he is
<hi>God</hi> and not <hi>Man,</hi> and herein would act like himſelf, he hath
pity, and ſheweth favour unto <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Take another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had made God to ſerve with his ſins, and
wearied him with his iniquities, having <hi>preſſed God herewith,
as a Cart is preſſed with ſheaves,</hi> and nothing but vengeance could
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152165:17"/>
rationally be expected, and that God ſhould ſay as at another
time (for God doth not ſhew ſuch favour to all, and at all times,
that the freeneſs of it might be the more evident) <hi>Ah, I will
eaſe me of my Adverſaries, and avenge me on my Enemies, and I,
even I, am he that will make ſuch audacious ſinners ſee, and feel,
what an evil and fearful thing it is to affront and provoke me:</hi> yet
read how graciouſly God pardoned <hi>Iſrael,</hi> declaring the ground
of it to be only for the glory of his own Name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25.
<hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake,
and will not remember thy ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely no motive from this young mans perſon, or any good
previous diſpoſition (he being ſo exceeding vitiated by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing
ſins) could in the leaſt encline God to have mercy upon
him; but the motive was taken from himſelf and his own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
He had mercy on him, only becauſe he would have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and compaſſion, only becauſe he would have compaſſion.
If ſome, yea many, are paſſed by, who have eſcaped the more
groſs pollutions which are in the world, through Luſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
committed ſuch God-provoking ſins as you read in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
that he committed, but for leſſer faults are puniſhed
everlaſtingly, when <hi>God</hi> hath had mercy upon him, and thrown
the skirt of his love over him, and wrought a gracious change
in him, we muſt ſay with our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 11. 26. Even ſo
Father, becauſe it ſo ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> It is through
free grace that any are ſaved; but in the Salvation of ſuch a
one, God hath demonſtrated the exceeding riches of his grace
towards him, through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>Let not any from this example of Gods free grace, preſume
to continue and indulge themſelves in a ſinful courſe, hoping to
obtain mercy at the laſt, as he hath done, and ſo turn God's
glory into ſhame, and his grace into wantonneſs: for it is a
rare example, hardly again to be parallel'd: will a man run
himſelf through the body, becauſe ſome have been healed of
ſuch wounds? will a man drink down poyſon, becauſe ſome
by an Antidote have expelled the poyſon, and eſcaped with
life? is not Preſumption the bane and ruine of Millions of Souls?
may not God cut you off in the act of ſome of your ſins, and
not give you time for repentance? and if life doth continue,
may not he deny you the grace of repentance? doth not cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and continuance in ſin, harden your heart, and faſten you
in Satans Chains? hath not God threatned, that ſuch who cry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152165:18"/>
peace, peace, to themſelves, though they walk after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their own hearts, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt: that
he will not ſpare them, but his anger and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak
againſt them, and that he will blot out their name from under
heaven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>The great improvement which ſhould be made of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
dealings with this young man, is for all to admire God's
Free-grace; and eſpecially for poor diſtreſſed ſouls that are
upon the brink of Hell in their own apprehenſions, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to deſpair of Gods mercy becauſe of the greatneſs of their
ſins, to take encouragement from hence, and hopes that there
may be mercy in ſtore for them: they have not been murderers,
whatever their ſins have not been, and if a murderer hath been
received into favour, why may not they hope? Let ſuch think
with themſelves, that it is free grace hath ſaved him, and let
them ſue out at the Throne of Grace, for the ſame grace which
is freely tendred unto them.</p>
            <p>A Recollection out of this Narrative of thoſe paſſages; from
which in charity we do conclude that the work of grace was
really wrought in his ſoul: or the Evidences of <hi>T. S.</hi> of his
Title to eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>1. HE bitterly lamented his ſins, and loathed himſelf for them,
eſpecially as they were againſt a good and gracious God,
according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 4. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
            <p>2. He was deeply ſenſible of, and grieved for the corruption of
his heart, from whence his actual ſins did proceed, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi>
51. 5.</p>
            <p>3. He mourned over his back-ſlidings, becauſe God was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
diſhonoured.</p>
            <p>4. He found it hard to believe, yet profeſſed, he would roll him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and relie upon the merits of Chriſt alone for ſalvation; and
if he periſhed, he would periſh there.</p>
            <p>5. He was much in a little time in duty, yet did profeſs himſelf,
he ſaw the inſufficiency of them to justifie or ſave him, according
to <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>6. He made choice of Chriſt before all, before life it ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>7. He longed for the morning when he was to dye, becauſe he
deſired to be with Chriſt, according to <hi>Ph.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:152165:18"/>
8. He greatly loved God, becauſe much was forgiven him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47. And ſaid though God ſhould damn him,
yet he could and would love God.</p>
            <p>9. He loved the company of Gods People, and profeſſed he had
rather be with Gods People in Priſon with Bread and Water, than
with the ungodly with liberty and greateſt dainties, according to
1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>10. He bleſſed God that ever he was taken and impriſoned;
thinking it better to be in chains, and brought to dye, than to go on
in ſin.</p>
            <p>11. He was moſt broken and melted for his ſins, when thoſe
that came to viſit him, were gone from him, and not in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
when hypocrites mourn before others, and are leſs affected
when alone: yet this was ſometimes his trouble, lest God ſhould
loſe the glory of the work he had wrought in him. (This was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by one that was uſually with him, when others went from him.)</p>
            <p>12. He wept for joy at that time, when he could not find that
God loved him, that he was not curſing, and ſwearing, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt God as others did, and he himſelf, formerly.</p>
            <p>13. He found and taſted more ſweetneſs in the ways of God,
in praying and mourning for ſin, than ever he found in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſin.</p>
            <p>14. He accounted ſin to be worſe than hell.</p>
            <p>15. He had a ſpirit of Prayer given to him ſo plentifully, that
it was an astoniſhment to many that joyned ſometimes with him,
conſidering how ignorant he was a little before, according to <hi>Act.</hi>
9. 11. For behold he prayeth.</p>
            <p>16. He looked upon the loſs of God, more than the torments of
hell, and feared it more.</p>
            <p>17. He prized heaven, becauſe there he ſhould ſin no more.
Theſe were his own expreſſions, and what we obſerved that were
frequently with him: and Reader, do thou pray and watch, that
thou mayſt not be guilty of this young mans ſins, but pray and labour
that thou mightest obtain the like evidences for heaven.</p>

            <head>A Relation of what paſſed in the impriſonment, and at
the Execution of Hannah Blay.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>H. B.</hi> belonged to a bawdy-houſe in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where <hi>T. S.</hi>
uſed to frequent, and was always welcome ſo long as his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
laſted: his money being gone, <hi>H. B.</hi> preſently puts him upon
robbing of his maſter, which he could not eaſily accompliſh by reaſon
of the diligence of the ſervant-maid, and to murther the maid ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than fail of getting money, which he accordingly did, and
goes again to <hi>H. B.</hi> and tells her what he had done, then flies: but
the juſtice of God purſued him ſo faſt that he was ſoon apprehended,
and committed to Newgate. After he had accuſed <hi>H. B.</hi> for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him upon the murder, ſhe was apprehended and committed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
At the Seſſions ſhe was indicted and condemned for being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the murder committed by <hi>T. S.</hi> In the time of her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
ſhe was very rude, and debauched, being ſeldom ſober,
except at ſuch times when ſhe could not by no means procure drink
to be drunk withal. She often endeavoured for to make <hi>T. S.</hi>
drunk with her, which ſhe once or twice effected, and endeavoured
very much to draw him off from his Repentance, by driving his old
trade of ſin and wickedneſs, if any adviſed her to Repentance, and
to take care for the future eſtate of her ſoul, ſhe would laugh at
them, and reply in ſome ſuch language as ſhe had learned in the
devils School, with which ſhe was well ſtored. She was from that
Seſſions reprieved till the next, fully perſwading her ſelf ſhe ſhould
eſcape that bout, and ſpending her time according to her former
courſe of living, taking as little care what ſhould become of her
Soul, as though ſhe had never offended a gracious God, and as if
there was no devil to torment her, nor Hell to be tormented in: but
now Seſſions being again come, and ſhe again brought down to the
Seſſions-houſe in the <hi>Old-Baley,</hi> had ſentence to be executed at
<hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where the Fact was committed. The night before her
execution, the Ordinary of Newgate came to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to her, which ſhe refuſed, ſaying, ſhe could not dye in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with ſome, whom ſhe named, judging them the cauſe of her
ſecond judgment, and Execution. The next day, being Friday,
Feb. 26. ſhe was conveyed in a Cart from Newgate to the place of
Execution, where ſhe ended her wicked life by a ſhameful death,
without the leaſt ſign of ſorrow or repentance for her abominable
whoredoms and wickedneſs.</p>

            </list>
            <p>I ſhall name ſome of thoſe ſins which young ones are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Young people are very apt to be diſobedient to their
Parents or Maſters. O how great a rarity is it, to ſee young
people as ready to obey, as their Parents are to command!
Moſt children are children of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is, without a yoak.
Let Parents command, adviſe, nay, intreat, all's to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
How ready are they to break the bond which God and
Nature lay upon them to dutifulneſs! Though the Command of
God be plain enough; though his Threatnings are terrible;
and though this ſin ſeldom goes unpuniſhed in this life, yet Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
take little or no notice of them. One would think that
one Scripture ſhould ſcare them, Prov. 30. 17. <hi>The eye that
mocketh at his Father, and deſpiſeth to obey his Mother, the
Ravens of the Valley ſhall pick it out, and the young Eagles ſhall
eat it.</hi> What is the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of that? why, they ſhall come to
an untimely end. Have not the ſad complaints of many at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi>
ſufficiently demonſtrated this to be true? Have not many
cryed out with a Halter about their neck, Children, if you
value your lives and ſouls, take heed of diſobeying your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
That was the ſin which brought me to this untimely
and ſhameful end.</p>
            <p>2. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Lying.</hi> Poor Children quickly
learn this Leſſon of their Father the Devil. It is not without
good reaſon that the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 58. 3. gives ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of wicked Children which went aſtray from the womb,
telling lyes; and the older they grow, the more skil'd they be
in this deviliſh art: it's likely they are ignorant that it is a ſin
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152165:20"/>
that cuts the bonds of all ſociety: it may be they are told how
dear <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> paid for one lye, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. nay,
though the word of truth tell them more than once, That Lyars
muſt dwell with their Father the Devil, in that black Priſon,
<hi>Hell;</hi> though they hear of a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone that
burns for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 18. and that ſuch as they are, muſt be
caſt into it: yet for all this they'l venture ſtill.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sabbath-breaking</hi> is another youthful ſin. O how little do
moſt of the young people of this City mind the ſanctifying of the
Sabbath? Doth not the multitude of Apprentices and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that wander up and down <hi>Moorefields</hi> on the Lord's Day,
ſpeak this to be too true? they dare not make bold with their
Maſters time on the Week-days: but as for God's Day,
That they ſpend as if God had ſet apart one day in the week
for young People to ſleep, drink, and play in: they dare as
well eat a piece of their fingers almoſt, as to do that on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, which they do then; and the truth of it is, they look
upon the diſpleaſure of a dying man as terrible; but the Anger
of a holy God they make light of. O little do they think what
precious time that is! their Souls are naked, and they then
may have Cloathing; they are ſtarving, and they may then
have Food, the Market is then open, Proviſions for Eternity
may then be had. But, O prodigious Madneſs! the hearts of
moſt young ones ſpeak in this language: <hi>As for Chriſt, Heaven,
and Soul, let them go, we have better things to think on, more
weighty matters to mind.</hi> And it is true indeed, O young man:
what is the company of vain wretches, like thy ſelf; the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
embraces of a whoriſh woman, the turning off thy Cups,
and Damnation, more needful than the hearing of Sermons,
than Praying, and reading, and Salvation? Sure you ſhould
not alwaies be of that mind! O little do you imagine how dear
you ſhall pay for all the pleaſures you have on the Sabbath, out
of Gods Houſe. This, this was <hi>THE SIN</hi> which lay like a
load upon the Soul of this poor <hi>Young man, The profaning of
the Sabbath;</hi> that was the bane of him. This carried him out
of Gods way into the Devils quarters. O how bitterly did he
bemoan himſelf for this ſin, as the cauſe of all the reſt! Of
(ſaid he) <hi>when I ſhould have been begging the life of my ſoul I was
plotting the death of my ſoul and body too.</hi> Did none of you ſtand
by the Cart when he wept ſo bitterly, and cryed to the Lord to
forgive this great and dreadful ſin? Did none of you hear how
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152165:21"/>
earneſtly he begged of you to have a care of that ſin, as you
loved your lives and ſouls? <hi>O wretch</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I was? I
ſtudied how I might ſpend the Lords day in the devils wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I

                  </gap> in them
then I play'd my mad pranks. I went into the Church indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
(but I may ſpeak it with ſhame and deep ſorrow now) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard one whole Sermon all the while I was with my Maſter;
and indeed I laugh'd at thoſe that ſpent the Sabbath in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aring of

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>t fools in
the world. I was glad when the Sabbath came, that I might have
time to run to my vile comrades. I rejoyced that I could then go to
ſatisfie my curſed luſts with whoriſh women: O! tell young men
from me, That the breaking of the Sabbath is a coſtly &amp; dangerous
ſin.</hi> Sirs, the ſubſtance of this Sermon I received from his
mouth: and will you not believe a dying man? Do you think
he did but jeſt? 'Twas on the Sabbath day he went to a
Whore, 'twas on the Sabbath he robbed his Maſter, and 'twas
on the Sabbath that he killed the Maid. But becauſe this ſin
is Epidemical, I leave a ſhort ſtory with you, and deſire you
to think of it, and then if you like what follows, break the
Sabbath ſtill. The ſtory is this: A dear friend of mine was
preaching about the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, and had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to make mention of that man, that by the ſpecial command
of God was ſtoned to death for gathering ſticks upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.
Whereupon one of the Congregation ſtood up and
laughed, and made all the haſt he could out of the Church, and
went to gathering of ſticks, though he had no need of them,
but when the people came from the Sermon, they found this
man ſtark dead, with the bundle of Sticks in his arms, lying
in the Church-Porch. And yet for all this, there ſtands a
young man in that corner that makes nothing of idling away the
Sabbath: and there ſits another that minds not the Lord's Day,
except it be to get into wicked company, and take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in it. And how canſt thou endure to hear of this, without
trembling? But I fear, thy heart is ſo hard, that thou art ready
to rage againſt this reproof: well, if the caſe be ſo, I have
done with thee; but believe it, God hath not yet done with
thee, and the Devil hath not done with thee: and though thy
Conſcience ſay nothing now, yet I tell thee, That hath not
done with thee neither: let none think I am tedious upon this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152165:21"/>
head: if young men will but reform this ſin, I promiſe I will
never tell them of it more. Chriſtians, (I hope that there be
ſome ſuch here) would it not be a bleſſed ſight to ſee the Fields,
the Taverns, the Whore-houſes empty, and the Churches
full? would it not be a bleſſed Reformation? O when ſhall it
once be! which is the ſweeter Muſick, to hear the air eccho
with the confuſed hollowing and roaring of lewd young men,
playing upon the Lords day, or to hear the ſound of ſinging of
Pſalms, repeating of Sermons, Praying, reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
which is like to end beſt? <hi>Iſa. 56. 2. Amos. 8. Iſa.</hi> 58.
13. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12.</p>
            <p>4. Another youthfull ſin is <hi>Miſ-ſpending of time,</hi> Young ones
think they have time enough before them, and therefore make
nothing of trifling it away. How far are moſt from following
the Apoſtles counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>redeeming of the time?</hi> what do you
think many hours diſcourſe of filthy bawdy ſtories, is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
of time? Is ſitting up whole nights to play at Cards
and Dice redeeming of time? Is robbing your ſelves of ſleep,
to lye in the boſom of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> redeeming time? If this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
of time, then ſome of our young ones, and many of
our gallants, redeem time bravely. 'Twas a notable one,
that of <hi>Seneca;</hi> If (ſaith he) one ask me for my Purſe, I am
not very willing to give it him; If he beg my Eſtate, I think it
a mad requeſt; but if he ask me to paſs away time with him,
two or three days of time, I paſs not much upon it, but it's
eaſily granted: and thus one of the moſt precious things in the
world is vilified. O little do people think how glad they ſhall
be one day of one of thoſe hours that they ſpent in foolery
Oh call time again, will be the language of more then one, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a death-bed. Could you talk with ſome of the mad young
ones that are in Hell, that lived five or ſix years ago in as much
pleaſure as you do now, and ſpent their time like you, but it
may be little dreamed of being in Hell ſo ſoon, but might rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
of forty or fifty years to live; could you I ſay, talk with
them, and ask them what they think of time now: they would
quickly ſay, Oh a world for one praying hour. Oh where are
the people to be found that ſeriouſly conſider that there is not a
moment of Time but we muſt be accountable for. 'Twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
ſpoke of that poor young man when he was in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
amongſt the common Priſoners; one Sabbath-day they
asked him to play at Cards with them? Oh (ſaith he) you and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152165:22"/>
I have ſomething elſe to do with our time, than to play at Cards:
Is it now a time for us to be ſporting away the Sabbath, when
we have but one poor Sand left to work for Eternity?</p>
            <p>5. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Keeping bad company.</hi> Are
there not many of the Devils Emiſſaries, that make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to decoy poor young ones? O what a happineſs do they
promiſe them! a goodly happineſs indeed, to carry them to
the Devil! 'twas not without cauſe that <hi>David</hi> (in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1.)
did pronounce them bleſſed that had leaſt to do in wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
whatever deluded creatures think of their mad jovial
Company; one that is well in his wits, looks upon their ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as an emblem of Hell, Pſal. 120. The young man upon
whoſe account we are here met this day, told me, that two or
three wicked fellows firſt got him out to ſpend a penny; but
little did he think whither they were leading of him; and after
they had been at one place, they carried him to another, till at
laſt they brought him to that Houſe, out of which few go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Deaths-wound. This was the general complaint of
them that went this laſt Aſſizes to <hi>Tiburn.</hi> And yet how are
ſilly ſouls pleaſed with ſuch company, whoſe greateſt kindneſs
is to make them go merrily to Hell? And are they ſtill ſuch
ſweet natur'd creatures, that you can't love too much, who
do what they can poſſibly to deprive you of your trueſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and make you miſerable for ever? O how will your
boon Companions greet one another in Hell, nay, it may be
upon Earth too? I remember I was once with a drunkard that
lay a dying, and after I had prayed with him, in comes one
of his old Companions in ſin, and askt him how he did: at
which he was ready to gnaſh his teeth, and made this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
reflection concerning him to me, <q rend="margQuotes">O that, that was the
wicked wretch that drew me away: if it had not been for
him, I had not been in ſo lamentable a condition upon a death-bed,</q>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>6. The ſixth youthful ſin is, <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi> How
ready are young ones to learn the language of their Father? It
was not long ſince that I heard a little Boy ſwear at every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
he ſpoke. O what will ſuch be when they come to be old,
if they begin ſo ſoon? ſcarce creep on their feet, and yet run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
poſt to Hell! Oh how many are there of this daring ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that bend their tongues like bowes, and ſhoot thoſe
arrows againſt Heaven, which will fall down dipt in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152165:22"/>
poyſon of Divine Fury. It would make one's heart ake, to
hear how ſome belch out their helliſh Oaths, to hear how cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
they rake in the wounds of Chriſt, and crucifie him afreſh;
not conſidering, that at the ſame time they are butchering of
their own ſouls; and if one tell them of their ſwearing, how
ready are they to ſwear? That they did not ſwear? and turn
and laugh, as if it were a creditable thing to be like the Devil,
and an honour to make haſt to hell. O how many are there of this
black Crew, that brave it out with their Damn-me, and Sink-me,
and Oaths as if they would dare the Almighty to his very face,
and as if there were little of truth in Gods Threatnings, and his
Anger a very light matter! O ſinner! what if God ſhould take
thee at thy word, when the next Damn-me is in thy mouth? and
ſtop thy breath with an Oath in thy mouth? what if God ſhould
go to curſing too? Do you know what a dreadful
word that is, <hi>Go thou curſed!</hi> O! what if God ſhould ſwear
too. <hi>That thou ſhalt never enter into his reſt?</hi> Couldſt thou but
ſee the flaming tongues of thoſe horrid ſinners that know what
the meaning of that word Damn-me, is: couldſt thou but ſee
how they bite thoſe Tongues for madneſs, it may be it would
make thee think, that an Oath is no ſuch light matter. You
ſay, <hi>Words are but wind:</hi> but believe it, this wind will riſe to
ſuch a ſtorm as will not be allay'd without deep repentance, till
it hath blown thee into hell. Did you never read the third
of <hi>Mal. ver. 5. I will come near to Judgements and I will be a
ſwift witneſs againſt the falſe ſwearers, and ſuch as fear not me,
ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> But you'l ſay, Your tongues are your
own; who is Lord over us? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 4. You ſhall hear one
ſhortly that will anſwer that queſtion, and let you know, that
he is Lord over that, and that your own tongue ſhall be made
to condemn you. But what is it that I ſee? How does that
ſwearing Wretch ſtorm and rage there at me, for telling him of
his ſins? Come, come, ſinner if you ſpare not God, I promiſe you
I will not ſpare you, and I tell thee, what thou heareſt, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to what thou ſhalt feel.</p>
            <p>7. The next youthful luſt that I ſhall mention, is <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
Do not many (I wiſh old ones were not here too guilty)
act as if their buſineſs in this World was to eat and drink, and
take their pleaſures? The Devil bids them read that Text,
<hi>Eccleſ. 11. 9. Rejoyce O young;</hi> and they are eaſily perſwaded
to take his counſel: and ſo they drink, and roar, and conſider
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152165:23"/>
not what a reckoning will be brought at laſt: neither do they
ſtand till they have read the latter part of that verſe; <hi>but know,
that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment.</hi> Not
conſidering the meaning of that whole Scripture, which is but
this: go, young man, lye at the Taverns and Ale-houſes, do,
drink; and be drunk; but remember this, you ſhall be damn'd
for't, and God will make you take off t' other Cup, whether
you will or no, and that is a Cup ſpiced with wrath and fury.
But you ſee not, neither do you yet feel it; and therefore you
do but laugh at all this: you ſay with thoſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 19,
<hi>My Maſter delays his coming;</hi> and therefore you eat and drink
with the Drunkards, you ſay, Let him talk till his heart akes,
I will never leave my pleaſure for you; Why man! wilt thou
then be deſperate? Dare you ſay, <hi>I'le drink,</hi> though there be
<hi>Death</hi> in the Pot, though <hi>Hell</hi> be at the bottom of the Cup?
or do you think that God will be worſe than his word? and,
that though he threaten high, yet he means no ſuch matter? O
ſinner: deceive not thy ſelf; and if thou forget the reſt, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
home but that one Text, <hi>Deut. 29. 9, 10. If any one hear the
word of this courſe, and yet bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I
ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine own
heart, and add drunkenneſs to thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare him,</hi>
&amp;c. Do you read on, and read it again, and think of that
Scripture the next time that you ſit down to your Cups. Little
do poor Creatures think how dreadful a ſin <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> is, and
how many it bringeth with it. I'le tell you of one ſtory of my
own knowledge, and then I ſhall leave this. A certain Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
that I knew very well, when he was in drink, quarrelled
with his Fellow-ſervant, and after a few words, knocked him
down with his Flail, and killed him at one blow. Afterwards,
by Friends he made ſhift to eſcape the Halter, and comes home
again, and ſwears, and curſes, and drinks at as high a rate as
ever: but at laſt, when he was in the ſame yard where he did
this Murder, he dropt down dead in a moment, and I was one
of the firſt that ſaw him.</p>
            <p>8. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs.</hi> Is not <hi>England</hi>
too near a kin to <hi>France?</hi> Do not many of our young ones act
as if they took pattern by <hi>Sodom</hi> and had learned of <hi>Gomorrah?
Jeremiah</hi> made ſad complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 7. And are we leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Doth not the Scripture ſpeak plain enough againſt this ſin?
though the Pope count it a <hi>venial fault,</hi> yet thoſe that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152165:23"/>
of it, will find, that his <hi>Pardon</hi> will give them little eaſe
when they are caſt into a Bed of flames. Sure our hot young
men ſeldom read the book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> but act as if that ſimple
young man (<hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 10.) did run no great hazzard: what was
it that brought <hi>Thomas Savage</hi> to Theft and Murder? What
brought him to that ſhameful death? O how bitterly did he
take on, that he ſhould ever ſee the face of that <hi>vile woman!</hi>
O! had he but conſidered whether he was going, and that moſt
of her Gueſts go to Hell: had he but thought ſeriouſly how
bitter that ſin would prove, I believe he would have lain in
flames as ſoon as with that <hi>abominable woman.</hi> Did none of you
hear what he ſaid when he was upon the Cart? did none of
you ſee with what earneſtneſs he ſpoke? why, this was one
great thing that he begged of you young ones, as his dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
That you would have a care of this ſin.</p>
            <p>9. The next youthful ſin that I ſhall mention, is <hi>Theft,
Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> are two coſtly ſins, eſpecially
the latter, and poor Creatures are uſually ſo bewitched with
that, that Credit, Purſe, Body, Soul, and all muſt go, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that beaſtly ſin ſhould not be gratified. How many
Servants are there that wrong their Maſters, imbezil their
Goods, and ſecretly waſt them by the fore-mentioned ſin?
and I believe I need not tell you what a Tragical end <hi>Theft</hi>
hath.</p>
            <p>That Prodigy of her Sex, and diſgrace of women, could
not be ſatisfied with Wine and Good cheer; her Purſe muſt be
fed as well as her ſtinking Carcaſe: <hi>What do you come hither</hi>
(ſaid ſhe) <hi>for, without money? Why, where ſhall I have it,</hi> ſaid
he? <hi>What, hath your Maſter none?</hi> replied that Monſter, <hi>Yes,</hi>
ſaid he; <hi>but I never wronged him, neither can I. Nay,</hi> ſaid
ſhe, <hi>if you be thereabouts, come no more here.</hi> But alas! the
poor Creature is inſnared, ſo that he cannot but go to ask Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of this Daughter of the Devil, how he ſhould manage his
matters, ſo as to get that money which his Maſter had. She
makes a ready reply, and adviſeth to Murther the Maid, to
bury the theft. O that unfaithful Servants would think of theſe
things, and now and then read that Scripture, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. and
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 6.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here ſpeak ſomething of the bloody ſin of <hi>Murder;</hi>
but the word of God, The Laws of men, the Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and the ſignal Judgments of God againſt ſuch, puts me
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152165:24"/>
in ſome hope that I need not much inſiſt upon that. I ſhall add
but one ſin more.</p>
            <p>10. Another youthful ſin is, <hi>Incorrigibleneſs.</hi> How reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
do moſt young ones go on in their ſins? How hardly
brought ſo much as to debate the buſineſs ſoberly with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or others? How do they flye in the face of them which
reprove them? as if it were ten times a greater fault for to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi>
ſin, than to <hi>commit</hi> it. Nay, ſome are come to that
height, that they make but a mock of Hell and Judgment, as
well as ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 19. But theſe are ſo vile a Generation, that
I have little hopes of prevailing with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 4, 5.
<hi>Jer. 22. 21. Gen.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
            <p>II. The next thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, was, To ſhew you
what it is to flee ſin. In this I ſhall be very brief.</p>
            <p>1. Not to commit it. Take not up this Serpent, for it hath
a deadly ſting in the tail of it. Embrace not this <hi>Dalilah,</hi> for
ſhe will betray thee, haſt away, avoid it; if you do not, it
is as much as your life, the life of your ſoul, is worth, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
1. 16.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Flee,</hi> That is, avoid the very occaſions of ſin. It's ill
jeſting with edg-tools. They are ſafeſt, that are fartheſt from
it. A hundred to one but thou art caught, if thou play with
the Bait. Who, but a mad man would take ſtrong poyſon into
his mouth, and ſay that he will then ſpit it out? Who would
chooſe to ſleep upon the top of a maſt? Believe it, Sin is one of
the moſt dangerous things in the world, and he that tampers
with it, plays with Hell, and is ſporting with the Devil,
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Flee;</hi> that is, hate it with a perfect hatred. Say, <hi>what
have I to do with Idols any more? How ſhall I do this, and ſin
against God?</hi> Labour for a ſpiritual antipathy againſt ſin,
and to loath it, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, as God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
139. 23.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Flee,</hi> and perſwade others to <hi>flee:</hi> for the danger is not
unconſiderable. Tell others what ſin will prove at laſt, and
perſwade them to conſider what the wages of ſuch work will
be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 157.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:152165:24"/>III. Why ſhould we flee youthful luſts?</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe our Captain bids us <hi>flee:</hi> we have his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
nay, his abſolute command: may I not ſay, his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
too? What is the meaning of all thoſe pathetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations,
<hi>Turn, you, turn you; why will you dye?</hi> Why doth
he bid us to beſeech you to look about you? What is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of all the Scripture? Wherefore do we Preach and pray?
Methinks the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be like thoſe Angels
that warned <hi>Lot</hi> to flee out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and when he lingred,
they pulled him, and bid him haſt, and flee for his life. I
might be infinite in Scriptures for the proof of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.
11, 14.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe of the danger of not fleeing. If the wrath of
God, if Hell and Damnation, if everlaſting Miſery be to be
avoided, then Sin is: for as ſure as God is true, Sinners muſt be
damned if they flee not ſin.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe of the benefit that we ſhall have by fleeing ſin.
We ſhall be everlaſtingly ſecured. If Heaven and Glory be
worth the getting, if Happineſs and Salvation conſiderable, if
a Kingdom and Crown be worth the having, this may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by fleeing from ſin.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>IV. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</hi> Is it ſo, <hi>That it is our duty to flee youthful luſts?</hi> Then let all this Congregation of young men and women, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how well they have obyed the Command. Sirs, be faithful
to your Souls, and ask your ſelves ſpeedily, What you have
done? <hi>Young men,</hi> Are you guilty, or not guilty? It's better
you ſhould be asked this queſtion at the Bar of Conſcience, than
at the Bar of God's Judgement. Children, how ſay you, are
you as ready to obey, as your Parents are to command? Doth
not your Conſcience tell you, that you can tell a lye to cover
a fault, and yet not be much troubled? Some of you are come
here this day to hear News, more than to hear your ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
but where are you on the Sabbath-day? May not I ſee
you idling in the Streets, and ſitting at your doors? nay, may
I not ſee you in the companny of wicked creatures, in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152165:25"/>
Well, ſinner, well; the reckoning will come up by
and by. I pray tell me, How do you ſpend your time? Is it in
your Chamber upon your knees, and at your honeſt Callings, and
in Civil and Chriſtian Society? who are the perſons that you
take moſt delight in? Are they thoſe that diſcourſe of God and
their Souls, and warn one another with words of Grace?
VVhat think you of Curſing and Swearing? Do you fear an
Oath? Or do you think the deepeſt Oaths the beſt Rhetorick,
and moſt graceful, if I may ſo ſpeak, to your Diſcourſe?
VVhat language do you ſpeak, the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or the
languague of <hi>Aſhdod?</hi> Can you ſtretch your ſelves upon Beds
of Ivory, and drink VVine from morning to night, and look
upon this as the only life? Is it not a pleaſant thing to lye in the
embraces of wanton VVoman? And cannot you uſe unſeemly
dalliance, and ſay, <hi>am I not in ſport?</hi> Did you never wrong
your Maſter in your life? And dare you do ſo ſtill? And
how would you take it, if I ſhould come to you, and tell you
roundly of all your ſins? Could you bear it if I ſhould come
cloſe to you and ſet Hell and Damnation before you? <hi>Young men</hi>
I beſeech you anſwer me; I tell you again it's better for you
that I ſhould ask you this queſtion here, than God hereafter.
VVell, have you put it to your Conſcience? And are you
guilty? I muſt tell you plainly, I cannot but think that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of this Congregation are in many of theſe ſins deeply
guilty; and yet there ſtands a ſlye ſinner, no more affected then
the ground he treads on: thou think'ſt I do not know thee; but
that, if poſſible, I may ſtop thee before thou com'ſt to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and Hell, I ſhall do what I can, for my ſoul to reach
thee: wherefore give me leave, in the next place, to ſpeak
one word by way of <hi>Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Young people, I am not come this day to tell you News; my
buſineſs is not to tickle your ears, but to do what I can poſſibly
to keep you from that place of ſhame, the <hi>Gibbet;</hi> and that
place of torment, <hi>Hell.</hi> I believe here are many, that I ſhall
never ſee nor ſpeak to while the World ſtands; and that our
next meeting will be before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt: and
therefore I muſt tell you I muſt not jeſt with you. I ſpeak to
thoſe that are guilty: you know well enough who I mean. Let
me ask you ſoberly. Do you believe that there is a God? and
that he is privy to all you do? and dare you outface God with
your wickedneſs? Or do you make account his eye is nothing,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152165:25"/>
ſo man do not know: can you ſo? Believe it, ſinner, you will
ſhortly know that God, and your Conſcience are witneſſes
enough to caſt you: and is this nothing: are not the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of a God to be regarded: ſhall the Lyon roar, and will
not ſuch a beaſt as you tremble? know this, as ſtoutly as you
brave it out now, you will ſhortly quake. But you are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
come on what will, venture you will. But hold, ſinner,
I prithee let's reaſon the caſe a little; do not act like a fool and
a mad-man: Were you ever in <hi>Newgate?</hi> Do you know
what a priſon is? Are Fetters ſuch deſireable things? Hath
the Devil done you ſo much kindneſs, as that you muſt venture
your liberty for his ſake? Come tell me, ſinner, What good
did the Devil ever do for thee willingly? Is it worth thy while
to do and fuffer ſo much for one that never intended any good
to any in the world? Conſider a little, young man, is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to come gingling in your chains before an Earthly Judge?
Is the ſight of the Bench nothing? Is it nothing to have your
villany laid open before the world? How do you think you
ſhall look, when evidences comes in clear, and the Jury ſhall
caſt you? What, brave it out ſtill! But what will you ſay
when the Judge ſhall paſs ſentence upon you, <hi>to be carried from
thence to the Priſon, and from that, to the place of Execution?</hi>
Is it nothing to have Ten Thouſand Spectators, of your ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
end? But methinks I hear ſome of that helliſh rout laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſaying, <hi>It is but a ſwing or two, and then all's over,
their miſery's at an end.</hi> But hold there, ſinner, then thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
will begin; for thou ſhalt appear immediately before the
bar of God, and there receive another <hi>ſentence</hi> ten thouſand
times more dreadful than the former, VVhat, do you make
nothing of that dreadful word, <hi>Depart thou curſed?</hi> and then
immediately the Devil takes your ſoul. He waits for his
prey; and thou muſt be reſerved in chains of darkneſs, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
and unavoidable torments, to the judgment of the
great day, and then thy curſed body and ſoul ſhall meet. O
what a dreadful greeting will that be, when both body and
ſoul ſhall be caſt into everlaſting flames! VVell, young man,
now what do you ſay? Is it beſt venturing ſtill? But it may be
thou beginſt to think, what a ſtrange cenſorious man is this?
Such Preaching is enough to make one out of their wits! what,
is there no ſuch thing as Repentance? a grace, a God one may
be ſaved for all your railing. VVhat do you think of <hi>T. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage?</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:152165:26"/>
Did not he repent: I hope you will not ſay that he is
in Hell. No indeed, for I verily believe that he is a Saint in
glory: but how do you know whether God will give you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
I muſt tell you, he is a ſingular inſtance, ſuch a one
as we ſhall ſcarce hear of in an age: and I remember, <hi>that he
that is oft reproved, and hardens his heart, ſhall ſuddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and that without remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though I ſpeak thus, brethren, I hope better things of
many here, and things that do accompany ſalvation. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
here are ſome young ones that had as lief venture their
lives as indulge themſelves in the fore-mentioned youthful luſts.
I think I have ground to ſay what I do: brethren, I beſeech
you make not my boaſting void, neither let me be aſhamed of
my confidence. I am perſwaded, I ſay again, that ſome of
you now hate what ſometimes you did delight in, and though,
it may be, in the days of your darkneſs you lived in your ſins,
yet now fear to fall into them, as much as you fear Hell: Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
my brethren, go on bravely, and the Lord be with you;
you are the hopes and joy of old Chriſtians, they bleſs God
from their heart to ſee ſuch flowers in Gods Garden: hold
but out, be ſtrong, and quit you like men, and heaven ſhall
be yours, as ſure as if you were already there.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I ſhall here ſpeak ſomething by way of advice to
the Maſters of Families and Parents: it lies much in your power
to ſet a ſtop to that mighty torrent of wickedneſſe that doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
overflow this City. Remember, ſirs, what a dreadful ſin
the ſin of Murder is: what then do you think of thoſe that
murder ſouls, that ſtarves ſouls? How do you think God will
take it at your hand, that you ſhould be ſo careful that your
work be done, and never mind his at all? is it nothing to you,
that one that dwells under your your roof, muſt dwell with
<hi>everlaſting burnings?</hi> Are you ſo barbarous, as to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
whether your Servants and Children are damned or ſaved?
What can you anſwer, when thoſe of your own houſe ſhall
ſtand before the great God, and ſay, <hi>Lord if it had not been for
my Maſter, I had never ſinned againſt thee at that rate which
I did: he never told me any thing of the danger of ſin, he would
be ſure to call me up betimes to look after his buſineſs: if I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
that, I ſhould quickly hear of it: but as for the Lords day,
praying, or reading, or any thing that concerned God or my ſoul,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152165:26"/>
I never was ſo much as reproved for the neglecting of them: O!
if I had been but told of ſuch a dreadful place as this, is, and
what ſin would end in, ſure I ſhould never have ventured as I did.</hi>
Sirs, I beſeech you think how you ſhall anſwer ſuch an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the day of judgment, as ſure as you live, you will then
be ſpeechleſs. <hi>Parents</hi> me thinks <hi>you</hi> have ſomething within
you, to put you upon your duty: what? have you no love at
at all to the fruit of your bodies? is it no great matter whether
your children ſink or ſwim? would you be contented to ſee
them in a houſe that is in a flame, and do nothing to get them
out? would you have your children fire-brands of hell for ever?
will you do nothing to reſcue them from that devouring Lion
who would tear them in pieces? can you bear to hear them cry
out againſt you, and ready to fly in your faces? doth it never
trouble you to think what a greeting you ſhall have in another
world when they ſhall curſe the day that ever they ſaw you,
when they ſhall ſay, <hi>I may thank you for this dreadful miſery you
never catechis'd me, nor told me one word of this place of torment;
you never corrected me for my ſin: if you had, it may be I ſhould
not have lain under this intolerable anguiſh?</hi> What do you ſay;
ſirs, to theſe things? Methinks they call for your ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
really, if theſe be not weighty matters, I know not
what be, Let me ask you in meekneſs, whether it be not a
piece of the moſt <hi>barbarous cruelty</hi> in the world, to let your
children and ſervants run to hell, without doing what in you
lies to ſtop them? But I hope, by this time, ſome of you are
a little convinced of the dreadfulneſs of the loſs of a ſoul, and
are loth to have the guilt of the blood of ſouls to lie upon you
for ever, and therefore begin to ask. What ſhall you do that
you and yours may be ſaved, and your Servants and Children
might eſcape the Snares of Satan, and <hi>flee youthful luſts?</hi> are
you in good earneſt, friends? and will you promiſe, as in the
preſence of God, that you will do what you can poſſibly, to
diſcharge your duty, and to follow thoſe directions that I ſhall
give you? In hopes that ſome are reſolved, by the help of
God, to do what in them lies for the keeping all under their
charge from everlaſting burnings: I ſhall adviſe you.</p>
               <p>1. Be good your ſelves, and labour to be paterns of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to ſhew your Children and Servants by your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
that you your ſelves believe that there is a God, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152165:27"/>
ſoul, heaven, hell, and eternity, let your language be
ſavoury, and ſpeak you to be one that hath been with Jeſus.
Let your actions be regulated by the Word, and endeavour
to let them know, that you are not in jeſt when you ſpeak of
God and their Souls. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>2. I charge you as in the preſence of God, as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the neglect of it at the bar of that great Judge, take an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
account of your Servants how they ſpend their time, what
company they keep, what they do upon the Sabbath, and if
you would make any thing of Religion, be as careful that the
Sabbath be ſpent in Gods ſervice, as the week-days in yours.
I could tell you of a Servant that was wont many a time and
oft, to complain of his Maſter, and ſay, <hi>If my Maſter had ever
examined me the Text on the Lords day, or called me to account
where I had been, or what I had heard, I am perſwaded I ſhould
never have come to ſo ſad an end as I am now like to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Inſtruct them oft in the matters that concern their eternal
welfare. Sirs, tell them, I beſeech you, with all the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that you can for your lives, of the danger of ſin, give them
wholeſome advice; tell them of the neceſſity of Converſion:
allow them a little time to pray and read, and let them know
that you take notice of <hi>any thing</hi> that is <hi>good</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>4. Pray for them, cry to the Lord mightily, and ſay, O
that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> may live in thy ſight: Lord, haſt thou not a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
O my Father, for me and mine? O pitty, dear Lord my
children and my Servants, and let all under my roof, be of the
Houſhould of Faith, and of the Family of the Lord Jeſus.
And now once more I beg you to be in earneſt, 'twill be the

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152165:27"/>
company of vile women; this I hope ſhall be a warning unto
me as long as I live. Are you (in ſober ſadneſs) of this mind?
Oh that the Lord would keep this always upon your hearts:
O that you now may not get out into the cold world, and ſhake
of the ſenſe of theſe things. But do I not ſee ſome weeping
eyes, and aking hearts? and what doſt thou ſay, poor ſoul?
<hi>O Sir, I am the man you mean! but is it poſſible for me to eſcape
Hell? I have lived in almoſt all theſe ſins for many a year; what
ſhall I do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall anſwer this honeſt requeſt, and the God of Love and
Power ſet it home.</p>
               <p>1. Labour to be acquainted with the Principles of Religion:
be much in reading of the Scriptures; ſearch, and you will
find never a word there to encourage ſin, but all againſt it;
they will make you wiſe to ſalvation: conſult the word, and
you will eſcape the wrath to come, which ſhall ſurely fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all thoſe that live and dye in their ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9.</p>
               <p>2. Labour to underſtand wherein your happineſs lies: it
lies not in Riches, Pleaſures, and Honours, but in the Favour
of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. Seek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, and
the righteouſneſs thereof; ſet your affections on things that are
above, and not on things below.</p>
               <p>3. To be ſure, keep the Sabbath ſtrictly, and attend upon a
powerful Miniſtery. Then is the time to buy proviſions to live
upon for ever.</p>
               <p>4. Keep good Company. Get out of wicked mens ſociety.
Mark thoſe that walk ſoberly, and that mind their ſouls, and
make much of them; and beg an intereſt in their prayers and
take their advice. If you once grow weary of good company,
I ſhall have but little hopes of you, and it's a ſign God means
good to poor ſouls, when they are very deſirous to be in with
them that are dear to God. A warm Chriſtian-companion,
O Sirs, you cannot value him too highly, 2 <hi>Cor. 15. 33. 1 Pet.</hi>
4. 4 <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>5. Take heed of ſinning againſt Conſcience. Let <hi>Davids</hi>
Prayer be yours, <hi>Pſal. 19. 13. Keep back thy ſervant from
preſumptious ſins, let them not have dominion over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Take heed of putting of Repentance, remember now
your Creator, now is the acceptable time: O if you value your
lives, make haſte, and delay not an hour; but go and fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152165:28"/>
on your knees, and beg of God to give you Repentance unto
life, Give God no reſt day nor night, till he have changed your
heart, and made you to ſee your need of a Chriſt, and to give
up your ſelf to Chriſt: O cry out this night, A Chriſt, dear
Lord, a Chriſt for my poor Soul, or I am loſt for ever, <hi>Ecleſc.</hi>
12. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 62.</p>
               <p>7. Be much in conſideration; Commune now and then with
your heart, and think ſeriouſly whither you are going, and ask
your ſoul what a condition it is in, and what it hath to bear up
againſt the fear of death, and what proviſions are made for
Eternity, look into your purſe, what money haſt thou that will
go currant in another world? ſpend much time in thinking. I
askt this poor boy how he ſpent his time in priſon? he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
In praying, reading, and conſideration.</p>
               <p>8. Neglect not prayer; <hi>ask and you ſhall have; ſeek, and you
ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you:</hi> be frequent and
ſerious in this duty; forget not ſecret prayer; and look after
your Prayers, and be not content, except you here of them
again.</p>
               <p>9. Be <hi>diligent</hi> in your <hi>Callings,</hi> be not <hi>ſlothful</hi> in your <hi>worldly
buſineſs,</hi> idleneſs is the devil's ſhop, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12.</p>
               <p>10. Hold out to the end: remember what they ſhall have
that conquer, reſolve for Chriſt and Heaven upon any terms.</p>
               <p>Well Sirs now my work is done; have I been beating the
air? What ſhall become of theſe two Sermons? yeſterday you
heard one out of the Cart, and from the Gibbet, and to day from
the pulpit; and what are you reſolved to do? what, ſhall the
tears, prayers and entreaties of that dying young man, be ſo
ſoon forgotten? if they are, can the commands of the living
God be ſo eaſily contemned? Is there nothing in all that I have
been ſpeaking? what, are you ſtill of the ſame mind that you
were, or are you not) I ſay again, I muſt leave you, and a
thouſand to one whether I ſhall ever ſee you, or ſpeak to you
more: once more I charge you, as you love your own Soul, as
as you fear the wrath of God, and the flames of Hell. <hi>Flee
