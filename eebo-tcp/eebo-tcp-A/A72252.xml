            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Noble, my verie eſpeciall good Lord, I preſent nowe vnto your Lordſhip, this hiſtoricall <hi>Eſsay,</hi> in print, which I offered before in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, eyther becauſe I am vrged to this dutie by your moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble munificence toward me, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot prouide my other exerciſes written of greater and grauer matters. Yet I take the defence of mediocritie for a matter of ſome weight, both in this hiſtorie of <hi>Brute,</hi> which is made litigious, and in any other poſition of much leſſe importance, euen of haire it ſelfe; inſomuch as mediocritie cannot be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt, that ſome haue written more of <hi>Brute</hi> then behoued them, but ſome haue behaued themſelues vnkindly againſt <hi>Brutans,</hi> and done leſſe for them, then they ſhould.</p>
            <p>They are on both partes, too learned for me, I am not worthy to be their moderator, in this queſtion of <hi>Brute:</hi> howbeit, as they haue freely deliuered their opinions with out any ſtop, ſo would I ſhew the good will I beare to the one part, without any hatred to the other.

            <p>I hope, I am cleane from any abuſe in this preſent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I will euer honour ſtrangers, for their good qualities of learning and life: but I muſt not hold my hand and pen ſtill, when I ſee them too buſie, in toſſing our hiſtories and actes, at their owne pleaſure, which appertaine not vnto them: they cannot ſtay mee from my ſtudie, more then I kept them from this practiſe. I fauour the hiſtorie of <hi>Brute,</hi> without regard of their disfauour, as they diſlike it, without reſpect of other mens liking. I cannot in loyaltie defend euery <hi>Brute,</hi> but I may without any breach of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, defend this great <hi>Brute of Brutanie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I moſt humbly beſeech your moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good Lordſhip, to accept of this mightie Captaines preſent defence, euen as your worthy honour, vſeth to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the reaſonable ſutes of approued men, which are like to do God good ſeruice, and this kingdome.</p>

You and ſuch hotbraines, haue deuiſed a faction, and diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of opinions, (I dare ſay) without fruit, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, without cauſe: For my part, your deniall is not able once to moue me, and your reaſons againſt <hi>Brutes</hi> hiſtorie, ſhall neuer perſwade any ſufficient reader, to agree with you, and remoue the markes and circuites, that <hi>Geffry Monmouth</hi> hath ſet downe. Yet by reading your allegations and probations, we may beſt areede, who is moſt credible, he or you, a <hi>Monmouth</hi> or a <hi>Scot,</hi> a <hi>Moonke</hi> or a <hi>Trauailer,</hi> and if neither barrell be better her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then by their wordes they ſhalbe ſaued from blame, and by their wordes they ſhalbe damned, ſayth the wiſe Iudge: wherefore I take you of your worde, and I ſay: that</p>
            <p>We <hi>ſeeke</hi> no <hi>Noilitie,</hi> from <hi>Brute,</hi> we count not of our forefathers nobleneſſe, but of our owne. Nobilitie I can tell you, goeth not by byrth and riches in <hi>Brutany,</hi>

            <p>We cannot thinke that <hi>Brute</hi> was <hi>

I paſſe not for that he hath done aforetime <hi>in other landes,</hi> but I onely reſpect his Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this Iland. Yet, if he were in that huge and maine fault, hee may well enter into Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie, till you and yours haue proued the deede volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Miſhap is not raſhneſſe, chaunce is not counſell, there is a folly in meeting <hi>an arrowe,</hi> there is no ſinne in ſhooting it at a beaſt in the forreſt.</p>

            <p>We are not <hi>Brittons,</hi> we are <hi>Brutans:</hi> we account not <hi>Brute</hi> our <hi>authour</hi> &amp; <hi>founder,</hi> ſeeing here dwelt as Noble men afore <hi>Brute</hi> as euer ſince that time. No good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or bad, hath been without noble men from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and to let go all Hiſtories, I dare ſay this word, That nature hath made as auncient a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men vpon the earth, as of other creatures, and of chiefe men in their companies at firſt, aſwell as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chiefe creatures in their kindes and their heardes

at firſt, yea and much rather of men, becauſe of more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and order.</p>
            <p>We ſpeake not of <hi>Brutes wealth</hi> and <hi>language,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came hither, neither can you proue, that hee had not wealth inough to ſerue his vſes, or tongue enough in euery place of his trauell.

He will not aſke, what price beareth your marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe? but a <hi>Brute</hi> will haue it for taking: hee will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue your <hi>commercies,</hi> and throw you into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, if you giue him not whatſoeuer you would not, whenſoeuer he will.</p>

It is no reaſon that <hi>Brute</hi> coulde not be giuen to trauell, becauſe <hi>the Italians were not giuen to trauelling, among whome</hi> you ſay <hi>hee dwelt</hi> afore. So you may deny almoſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actors Actes, that hath liued admirably in the worlde.

            <p>Wee ſay not, that <hi>Brute walked on the Sea,</hi> or <hi>came</hi> hither <hi>by land,</hi> and therefore your <hi>Alpes,</hi> and your <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> haue no preſent vſe, but as table talke to paſſe time, and make a noyſe.

Or if <hi>Hercules</hi> muſt needes be the onely man, what a ſingle reaſon is it? that <hi>Brute</hi> might not follow him that way, becauſe <hi>Hercules</hi> onely had gone before. I had rather conclude thus: <hi>Hercules</hi> made a way through <hi>the Alpes</hi> ſo eaſily, that any hardy trauailer might followe him that way.

Remember man, I ſay, the famous and ſtrong name of <hi>Brute,</hi> and conſider the nature of warly trauailers, and neuer ſtand ſo ſtiffly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132216:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in your naked <hi>coniecture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How knoweth <hi>Buchanan,</hi> that there was <hi>no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Brute in the world before the banniſhment of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quines in Rome?</hi> might there not be another <hi>Brute <hi>500.</hi>
               </hi> yeares before this counterfeit <hi>Brute of Rome?</hi> or was there none ſuch, are you ſure, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> Hiſtorians of other nations, forſooth, haue made no ſuch record? It is no ſufficient reaſon, to carry <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> from their owne old Regiſters by the wordes and ſilence of outlandiſh writers. You knowe and I am ſure, there are no meane matters left out of prophane Hiſtories, which are in eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe allowed. The more they leaue out the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our land, the more I preſume by the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countries, that our land was enuied, becauſe it was moſt glorious. I tell you I cannot thinke it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that he which is named <hi>Brute</hi> in our Chronicle muſt bee ſo named in other Chronicles: the ſame man may haue diuers names ſeuerally ſet downe in ſeueral bookes of ſeuerall languages, and as for this moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Brute,</hi> it is like enough, he chaunged his name, as he chaunged his habitation.</p>
            <p>You may eaſily ſay, <hi>A Moonke was the deuiſer of this Brute,</hi> you will ſay, that <hi>he played the Poet,</hi> that hee carued &amp; painted him in this maner: but you cannot yet proue in this haſt, that <hi>the Moonke</hi> or ſtudent had not good proofe in his readings of this <hi>Brute,</hi> that he had not his Authour for them. It is out of queſtion, that manie books haue been written but once, and that many ſuch ſingular bookes haue been loſt for want of coppies, and it is probable, that this <hi>Moonke</hi> had ſome olde monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or booke, which may bee in <hi>Cambry</hi> to this day,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132216:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Liuy</hi> neuer heard of it, and may be as true of <hi>Brute,</hi> as their olde <hi>Scottiſh Thinges</hi> and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Decades are accounted true by their fauourers and countrimen. If <hi>the hiſtorie of Brute be not true,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not ſeene the proofe thereof, no more is their hiſtorie true, becauſe we haue not ſeene the proofe thereof, which was acted ſo many yeares ere we were borne: thus it is as lawfull to <hi>coniecture</hi> for <hi>Brute</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſeeing he is but denied onely by <hi>coniectures</hi> and probabilities.</p>
            <p>But what is this you ſay? are <hi>mens mouthes ſtopped with a</hi> maſke and <hi>ſhewe of Religion?</hi> cannot men tell what to ſay againſt <hi>A ſhewe</hi> and appearance? doe men that name the heatheniſh <hi>religion</hi> account it religion in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome? I warrant you, <hi>the Moonke</hi> was ſo far from purpoſing, <hi>to ſtop mens mouthes</hi> with <hi>the idolatry of Diana,</hi> that he neuer eſteemed halfe the tenth part ſo much of her, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> did for his profite in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and I dare ſay, that the <hi>Religious</hi> Authour thought it no <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or imagined, that the <hi>Brutanes</hi> would ſo eſteeme it, but onely named <hi>Diana,</hi> as <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> are named of <hi>S. Luke</hi> the Euangeliſt.</p>
            <p>Your Synchroniſme of <hi>Faunus,</hi> of <hi>Sybilla</hi> and <hi>Praene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> is to no purpoſe: it ſeemeth by this Hiſtory of <hi>Brute,</hi> that <hi>Dianaes Oracle was</hi> not <hi>vnknowne,</hi> as you ſeeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch. But heere you will take <hi>the Moonke</hi> at a dead lift, as you ſuppoſe, and yet I tell you me-thinkes you and very bookiſhly and literally wiſe, not reaſonably and diſcourſiuely. Muſt <hi>Diana</hi> needes <hi>ſpeake latine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Hiſtorian reporteth <hi>her Oracle in latine?</hi> Are you not aduiſed, how many things are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Greek and <hi>Latine</hi> of the Beginning of the world, though there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:132216:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were neither Greeke nor <hi>Latine <hi>2000.</hi>
               </hi> yeares and more after the Creation of heauen and earth? and ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might partly be brought againſt your ſelfe in your firſt <hi>king Ferguſius,</hi> if I would follow ſo needleſſe a cauſe, in comparing his time with the times of <hi>the latine tongue,</hi> wherein you write of him. You might haue done well, to proue that <hi>the Moonke</hi> ſaith, howe <hi>Brute</hi> receiued his anſwere of <hi>Diana,</hi> and aſked her Counſell in <hi>latine ſpeach,</hi> which becauſe you haue not proued, your <hi>Horatius</hi> and your <hi>Saliare carmen,</hi> and your <hi>Numa,</hi> and your wordes are but winde. Cannot an Hiſtorian report the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of the <hi>Germans,</hi> of the <hi>Numidians</hi> in <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> vnleſſe the <hi>Numidians</hi> &amp; <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> ſpake <hi>latine?</hi> were the Orations in your Chronicles, Maſter <hi>Buchanan,</hi> ſpoken firſt in <hi>latine?</hi> So your <hi>Penitus obliti</hi> and <hi>ne tenue quidem,</hi> and other bootleſſe words are vain and little, or nought worth in this preſent queſtion. Tis not euer true that hath a <hi>quidem.</hi> I cannot certainly ſay, that <hi>the Brutans language</hi> was <hi>vſed in Italy in the dayes of Brute:</hi> but I may well ſay, notwithſtanding your trifling <hi>mycteriſme,</hi> that if the Oracles and men had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, they had been neuer the worſe, nor <hi>the language</hi> neuer the better. But you were in a running thought and ſuppoſed your ſelfe ſubtle enough, when you had brought your inuention to a diſiunctiue propoſition, with much effect, I promiſe you, when it tendeth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, euen to proue, that <hi>the Brutan ſpeach then was not the ſame our Brutans vſe</hi> now in <hi>Cambry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet by your leaue, <hi>Buchanan,</hi> it is no proofe againſt <hi>this language,</hi> in that <hi>many tongues appeare in it</hi> in your time, ſeeing <hi>Brutaniſme</hi> might at firſt bee as full of diuerſe <hi>tongues</hi> by reaſon of much trauell as it is nowe, and then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:132216:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your argument hath nor vſe nor force in your queſtion: and in trueth, though <hi>Scots</hi> be called generally falſe, yet <hi>Buchanan</hi> may be true: ſo <hi>Moonks</hi> may <hi>dreame dreames,</hi> and yet <hi>Geffry Monmouth</hi> write a trueth. Why ſhould not a <hi>Moonke</hi> be as credible as a <hi>Paedanty?</hi> or a ſolitarie ſtudent vnderſtand that he readeth as much as a buſie ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter? or a <hi>Cambrian</hi> read Chronicles which a <hi>Scot</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw? or <hi>Geffry</hi> be as plaine and verifiable as <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> being not ſo deep ouer head and eares in verſes and <hi>Poetry</hi> as he? yet now at laſt the <hi>George</hi> confeſſeth, that his owne <hi>reaſons</hi> are but <hi>minims,</hi> and minute perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſlender thinges, and is faine to ſay, that <hi>the Moonke</hi> himſelfe <hi>ſeemeth to acknowledge his fiction,</hi> though it appeareth not ſo by <hi>the Moonkes</hi> wordes. Thus it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued euidently, that <hi>the hiſtory of Brute is a</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and <hi>poeticall narration,</hi> vnleſſe it be firſt proued, that there were no more Intelligences and Regiſters in the life of <hi>Geffrey</hi> then of <hi>George,</hi> and that <hi>Geffrey</hi> had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours for his defence, becauſe <hi>George</hi> cannot knowe them. If nothing be true in one country which <hi>hath not ſuffragees from another Countrey,</hi> I cannot tell what hiſtorie may ſtand irrefragably by this determination, no not when we read the auncienteſt partes and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue recordes of beſt hiſtoriographers. Was there not an Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> becauſe <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> name none ſuch? much <hi>Iuſtine</hi> teach the <hi>Iewes</hi> howe to thinke of the deliuery of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> But I omit thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which might be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt you, becauſe in a queſtion I regard the argument more then the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and ſo ſhould you too by your leaue, for all your <hi>24. yeares trauell.</hi>

            <p>Are they <hi>malè callidi,</hi> and is <hi>vanitie</hi> in them that call

I pray, when you in your Pſalmes, as they call them yours, deuiſe the <hi>moſt kindes of verſes</hi> that you can, do you confeſſe, that <hi>Dauid</hi> made them at firſt in <hi>ſo many ſortes of verſes</hi> as you haue written them? ſurely you will denie it. Iwis, it is not neceſſarie, that <hi>Brute</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould <hi>ſpeake verſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Geffry Monmouth recordeth their wordes in verſes.</hi> But, let be, ſuppoſe they did <hi>ſpeake</hi> in theſe or in other <hi>verſes,</hi> then he, doubtleſſe, or ſome other for him tranſlated their words into hexameters and pentameters, as you ſee. What <hi>vanitie</hi> or <hi>falſhood</hi> is on either ſide? neuer thinke to carry it away with threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare wordes, or to leade your Readers where you liſt.</p>
            <p>A wiſe perſwader are you: is <hi>Diana called Loxias</hi> in your bookes? or if <hi>Apollo</hi> be <hi>oblique</hi> and <hi>crooked,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate</hi> in his anſweres, muſt <hi>Diana</hi> needes be ſo? or if <hi>Dianaes Prieſt</hi> be commonly <hi>obſcure</hi> &amp; <hi>foulded vp</hi> in ſpeach, cannot it be, that hee ſhould be perſpicuous at anie one time? are you to appoint him how to ſpeake ſo manie yeares after his death? I pray, if <hi>Pythia be euer doubtfull,</hi> and <hi>oblique,</hi> becauſe ſhee is ſo for the moſt part, what <hi>doubtfulneſſe</hi> or <hi>obliquitie</hi> is in this aunſwere? <hi>You are come to my rich temples, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> beloued of God and of all that inhabite the heauenly houſes, I am in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould call thee a mon or a God, but I much rather beleeue, that thou art a God, <hi>Lycurgus,</hi>

            <p>As for your <hi>Opinor,</hi> this may bee well anſwered in your verball manner, <hi>O pinor narras? non rectè accipis:</hi> you know the maker <hi>Terentius.</hi> I that am young may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well beſtowe my labour to anſwere you, as you being olde may obiect ſo vnfruitfully. Howe is that proued <hi>a manifeſt fiction that this Iland at Brutes comming was a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> being yet ſo this daie ſtill in manie places? Can <hi>two Gyantes</hi> and their two families, or ſo manie <hi>Giantes</hi> as make an Armie, ſo fill this countrie, that it ſhall not rightly be called <hi>a deſart?</hi> when they are all in one ſhire, the other ſhires are verie <hi>deſarts:</hi> when they being ſo few, are ſcattered into ſo manie ſhires betweene the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the <hi>Ile of Wight,</hi> how can they ſo fill it, that it may not be well <hi>named of Diana a deſart?</hi> in compariſon of the Cities and Kingdomes in other landes, where ſhe abode moſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>name of Gogmagog</hi> is no more <hi>monſtrous</hi> then the name of <hi>Onoſconcoleros,</hi> nor <hi>Tentagol</hi> more <hi>vaſt</hi> and <hi>ſtrange</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus I may verie iuſtly and reaſonably maintaine and vphold <hi>the hiſtorie of Brute,</hi> for anie thing that maſter <hi>Buchanan</hi> hath ſaid againſt it. Concerning <hi>Diocleſian and his daughters,</hi> I haue willingly loſt all that delight of reading and anſwering, although I ſee euidently, that <hi>this Hiſtorie</hi> which you account <hi>a tale</hi> may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ought you haue alledged. Yet maſter <hi>Buchanan</hi> taketh much vpon him and chargeth ſome bodie with <hi>impudencie and a lye,</hi> and plaieth the Terrible ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and yet when he hath done his beſt and his worſt, it is not proued, that <hi>24.</hi> yeares were not <hi>ſufficient</hi> for <hi>Brutes</hi> retinue, and the inhabitantes of this land, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other of their kindred that reſorted hither and remained here, <hi>to repleniſh the Country</hi> with men of War, <hi>to erect three kingdomes, to accompliſh great Actes</hi> by ſea and land. Let him looke into the <hi>kingdomes</hi> of <hi>Grecia</hi> in olde time, and he ſhall finde fewer men in a kingdome then <hi>Brute</hi> alone with his companie might raiſe in <hi>24. <hi>yeares:</hi>
               </hi> let him remember the huge <hi>kingdomes</hi> of three men, <hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet:</hi> let him conſider, that mightie <hi>Actions</hi> are not done by <hi>money and number,</hi> but by induſtry and vertue: let him proue, eyther that <hi>this Generation of Brute cannot</hi> poſſibly <hi>be true,</hi> or elſe ceaſe to ſpend his time with <hi>opinions</hi> and likelihoodes, that may be repelled with the like againe: ruſty <hi>Antiquities</hi> more reuerend then ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Nouelties. Yet, <hi>we</hi> are not <hi>deſirous,</hi> that <hi>Brute</hi> ſhould be <hi>our Conquerour, we wiſh</hi> not ſubiection to him, or anie other outlandiſh Nobleman: we had rather winne the land that this <hi>Brute</hi> came from, and ſubdue it vnder
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132216:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our feete: but when <hi>Brutans</hi> haue publiſhed <hi>an Hiſtorie</hi> and allowed it a long time, we would not haue a <hi>Scot</hi> ſo preſumptuous, as to <hi>controll</hi> it, much leſſe to <hi>reiect</hi> it, as this one <hi>Scot</hi> hath done very rawly and vnaduiſedly.</p>

               <p>Then <hi>Cheryn</hi> fed all the mad fellowes humours in the realme that he could heare of, and by voices got the kingdome.</p>
               <p>

the ſecond, &amp; make a line of ſucceſſion rather then of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy. Yet wee may call this a politicke genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rightly in the whole body of the realme, though it be not a naturall generation in theyr owne proper bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes from <hi>Morgan</hi> to <hi>Pirrhy.</hi> All men haue not the gift of children: of all theſe Rulers here are but two ſons, and their two fathers, the other ſeeme to haue left no ſeede behinde them. Sometime the imperfection is in the wife, ſometime in the huſband: there are watry loynes, and rotten thighes in both ſexes. Some men are barren naturally, ſome are barren artificially, ſome are barren by olde age, ſome make themſelues barren with preternaturall dyet, ſome are made of other men by chirurgicall inciſions. Or if they had children and were not barren, the more vnhappy they that coulde not continue as they began. Some families are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by ſickneſſe, ſome by wars, ſome by miſchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in theyr dyet and exerciſe, ſome are put from theyr owne, and are euer in thraldome, and are neuer againe heard of in the worlde. God almighty knoweth all thinges from the firſt to the laſt: but if a man ſhoulde ſucke the ſtars, or be ſucked himſelfe as they ſay, of the king of Fayries, he ſhould not finde a perfite Hiſtory of this time of theſe Kinges.

               <p>Now I diuine modeſtly, heere were actors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recorders of their actions, patrons of learning, but no learned men: or, they were of both ſortes, but their ſtudies came to no effect, by ſome force: or, they were very old when they came to the Crown, and could do nothing: or, the furies and helhoundes raged ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely, that the Muſes and Graces coulde not bee quiet for them: or, their actes were wrought in needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke onely, and ſo worne out: or, the ſenſes, and ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe deſires ſo ruled them, that theyr liues were not ſo ſhort as their actes: or, the Hiſtories were written in ſome ſtrange kind of polygraphy and ſteganography, and coulde neuer yet be read, but remaine in ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place: or, they made little account of writers, and theſe ſet as light by them: or, they that take moſt pains at their booke, were not moſt regarded: and thereupon ſtudied to themſelues: or, ſome infortunate and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolent configuration of mouable ſkies and ſtarres, and ſpirites remoued all Hiſtories out of the way: or, the Kinges and People agreed among themſelues, to bee remembred by being not remembred, wiſhing to haue their time called <hi>The vnknowe Regiment,</hi> adiudging ſecrecie greateſt wiſedome: or, our Countrimen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened ſo much after other Noble Actors in the earth, that they had no leiſure, to doe any thing themſelues: or, they diſdained to haue them theyr iudges after their death, whom they would ſcorne to haue their iudges in their life: or, ſome outlandiſh enuy deſtroyed the rowles and regiſters of our Hiſtories, to make vs ſeem barbarous: or, the Vniuerſitie men of <hi>Stamford</hi> had by

ſome Priuiledge got them wiues, and ſo forth: and had no leiſure to do any thing but liue: or, before the kings were crowned, they were worthy men, and after theyr coronations they fell to make books of nothing: or they could tell, how to get a Soueraigntie, but they knewe not, how to keepe it: or, they writ their Chronicle hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphically, and ſet the pictures of other creatures in the places of their kinges, and by the ignorance of ſome careleſſe men were eſteemed as gaies, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe regarded: or, it was not thus, or ſo: perhaps, neither this, nor that, but ſome other way, I cannot tell howe, nor I care not greatly, for feare I may bee thought neither idle, nor well occupied. Now, good Reader, albeit I ioyne a morall genealogy with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and ſeeme to breake the ſtile of hiſtory, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe affections rule otherwhile aſmuch as kinges, I may truely ſay, my deuiſe is allowable in itſelfe. Where iſſue wanteth in the Prince, there the iſſue of the people is conſidered, ſeeing ſome Princes are begotten of the people, as ſome are of their parents: theſe are heires by the law of particular nature, and they by the reaſon of vniuerſall nature and of grace. As for the other partes of this third Offſpring, I hope, they are ſeemely and fit enough for this place. It is lawfull to make the beſt vſe and moſt gaine that wee can honeſtly, of anie thing that we read or write: probable additions, and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable collections are neuer amiſſe: it is better, of the two extreames, to make more then wee neede of our Countreimen, rather than make leſſe of them then wee ſhould: ſuperfluitie is not beſt, nor ſcarcitie: that hiſtory is moſt worth which doth a man moſt good.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Nobleman or Captaine of men deſpiſeth common matters in his own perſon: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to find in himſelfe the commendable ſingularities of ſingular men in all ages: he would be loquent as <hi>Mithridates,</hi> that could ſpeake <hi>22.</hi> languages: he would be eloquent as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that could perſwade the Diuels and men as he liſted: hee would be logicall as <hi>Ramus,</hi> that coulde iudge euerie mans writings and not be deluded by any writer: he would be arithmeticall as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the knowledge of Numbers: he would be geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall as <hi>Arithimedes</hi> that compaſſed many great matters by the miſterie of proportions: he would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologicall in all queſtions, as <hi>Stoflerinus</hi> was in one, who foreſaw and foretold the fall of monaſteries: hee would be effectually muſicall, as <hi>Timotheus</hi> that coulde either inflame, or quench <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſpirites with hys melody: in a word, he would be a right noble Artiſt in all theſe ſeuen Arts, or in ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Now I am ſure, that all the hiſtoricall Recordes, which I haue yet ſeene, and I beleeue are commonly to be ſeene of <hi>Mithridates, Orpheus, Ramus, Pythagoras, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimedes,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:132216:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Stoflerinus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> are not able by the hundred part to make any ſtudent as renowned an Artiſt as they were, though the be read and peruſed moſt exquiſitly.</p>
               <p>Another Nobleman or Captaine of men, deſireth to be Honourable by Nauigation as <hi>Veſpuſius</hi> was: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to ſearch the ſecretes of warfare as <hi>Hanniball</hi> did: wiſheth to riſe from an obſcure Countrey life, to a Princely ſeat as <hi>Numa</hi> did: could be glad of ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal facultie as <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> had in raiſing a dead man to life: he wiſheth to himſelf the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> in making lawes and working myracles: in a word, He ſtudieth to purchaſe himſelfe a glorious Name, both for his life time, and after his death, as theſe men haue done afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
               <p>Now I dare ſay vppon ſufficient reading, that the Hiſtories which are written of <hi>Veſpuſius, Hanniball, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> are not able to beget ſuch a man, as euery of them was in his kind, neither can the cauſes that ſerued them, according to their regiſters, ſerue other men for effecting of like actions.</p>
               <p>I cannot of a Man be made a Bee, and gather hony out of all ſweet flowers and herbes, but if God will I may be a Collector of the wiſdome of all ancient books, &amp; make <hi>Ambroſia</hi> rather then hony out of them. I haue need of theſe men once, to ſee what they did, as young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings do: and againe I read them, to ſee if their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can inſtruct me to do the like: and now I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vppon the proofe of other Artes, then are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in Hiſtories: theſe giue but a light in the way, which I would walke in: I muſt haue eyes in my head ere I come to that way, and feete and ſtrength to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:132216:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beare me through it: els the way is not for me, but for them that can go in it, what make I there? I heare much of it, and when I would go in it, I want eyes and feet to bring me thither, and am driuen to ſay, That God which giueth eyes to the blind, and walkes to the lame, had neede giue me more then Hiſtories haue in them, or els I ſhal neuer be that I would be in one Art or other. Then ſeeing Hiſtories breed onely deſires and wiſhes and expectations in the hearts of ſtudents &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but affections, ſeeing they neuer create any habit or perfection in them: I omit the verball and talkatiue vſes of hiſtories, which other men ſtand vpon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in my mind this <hi>Idaea</hi> of one that would be a man of men, as God is named the Lord of Lords.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man that is borne of healthful and ſtrong pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that are vnder thirtie years and aboue twentie, is commonly in good health, and of great ſtrength: for ſound timber muſt needes make a ſtrong building, if aduiſed workemen haue the framing of it.</p>
               <p>He that is brought vp in all kindes of labour from his childhood will indure any paines in his manhood: for cuſtome is a ſecond nature, as thoſe armes of an oke or other tree, are ſtrongeſt ordinarily which are toward the North.</p>
               <p>A man will not feed aboundantly for pleaſure, but neceſſarily for health: for he hath ſeene, that a body nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full nor empty is ſeldome or neuer diſtempered and ſicke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:132216:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>He will not be idle at any time, but either ſtudying, or practiſing great and ſmall matters for himſelfe and his friendes continually: for the more good we thinke and do, the neerer we are to God almightie.</p>
               <p>A man wil not reiect the ſpeech and face of any man on the earth, but he will onely haue vſe of them that are like himſelfe in diſpoſition and action: for the hatred of any man is hurtfull, and where all agree in one, there is happieſt ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>He doth not reſpect, how they liued and apparelled and emploied themſelues that are dead, but what good ſoeuer he can do, he doth it with all his minde &amp; might, and neuer ceaſeth from his work till it be finiſhed in the beſt maner: for commonly men may doe greater actes then they doe, if they meaſure not themſelues by other men, ſeeing he that trieth his owne parts moſt, is euer moſt glorious.</p>
               <p>A man will be ſkilfull in all thinges which prolong life or ſhorten it, that hee may preſerue himſelfe and hys friends, and deſtroy his and their enemies: for in death al Noble Acts are cut off, and the ouerthrow of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is the generation of concord, and multiplication of conſent.</p>
               <p>He will beleeue that he knoweth himſelf by triall, he hath an eye in his hand and heart that neuer ſleepeth: for he that truſteth other mens words and deeds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe of them, is carried euery way with euery fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fiction of the world.</p>
               <p>A man will ſo arme his body with moderate anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, that no poyſon ſhall eaſily ouercome him: for hee prouideth for the worſt, and remembreth withall, that the beſt can ſaue it ſelfe.</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:132216:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>He is prepared for all changes and chances that may come vpon him in this life, &amp; conſidereth rather what may happen vnto him then peruſe the fortunes of other men. Thus I haue written generally, but I may not tell my tale and idee particularly in euery poynt, till I be a few yeares elder.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo noblemen that partly by nature, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by art, could make their bodies indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for euery attempt and exploit agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues to try, whether books of hiſtorie, or deuiſes of their own would make the more braue man. He that followed books, deſired onely to be like the beſt Worthies of other ages: he that relyed vpon his owne deuiſe was not content with the examples of bookes, but inuented the means to excel the beſt that euer was: the bookman putting his felicitie in imitation, came ſhort of thoſe patterns, and yet was glad whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came neere them: the deuiſer ſetting his mind on emulation, ſearched the cauſes of auncient excellencies, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cauſes added to the effectes, and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them all in what caſe he would. The bookman ſaith, giue me the life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the life of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the life of <hi>Sanderbeg,</hi> and then thinketh he hath gotten the ſpoyles of the Eaſt and Weſt, and all patterns of glory that may be gotten: the deuiſer ſaith, let me ſee the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that made thoſe three men ſo eminent aboue other men: ſo I ſhall perceiue a defect of theſe cauſes in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians: then I muſt ſupply them, and excell thoſe

three in mine own perſon, or in ruling others: the moſt od and ſpeciall acts that euer they did, may not onely be matched, ſaith he, but alſo ouermatched wel enough, I beleeue, and to be plaine, I ſee nothing euen in <hi>Vliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or <hi>Achilles,</hi> but it may be ſeen, I hope, in another, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe books will giue me leaue to trie, whether I may ſurmount their Nobilities, I will be ſo bold in reaſon as to ſay, that books were made to keep men vnder a certain height, and within a certain compaſſe, and to make men half the men that they might be, and as it were very woodcocks in compariſon of that they ſhould proue, by trying all and truſting none, but which they find certainly, and experimentally true. Thus the bookman is a gallant man with an eare mark and chains of bondage about his necke, but the deuiſer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is a ſoueraigne authour of manhood, hauing no cogniſance of ſubiection about him beſides the mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his fleſh, which notwithſtanding he maketh in ſome ſort immortall, eyther in leauing the life therof in his ſucceſſion, or in ſpending the might of it in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue aſſaults and atchiuements: for ſtudy ſpendeth the outward man more then action. The Deuiſer ſaith, that men of chiefeſt note haue euer been of his mind: they haue not beleeued that old bookiſh rule, <hi>Oporter diſcentem credere,</hi> for then they had neuer been better then other mens ſchollers, whereas by the meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid they are become captaines in their kind: yet if they had neuer been borne I am ſure, ſaith he, that I had been of this mind, <hi>Mundus eſt omnes libri,</hi> this rule is manly, <hi>Oporter diſcentem dubitare,</hi> vnleſſe he will be deceiued, and runne on the head halfe his life time: in a word, it appeareth plainly, that many men which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:132216:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
read in bookes vſe daily the ſame or better meanes to try out mayſteries then the graundeſt bookmen: if my iudgement be an error, I would know, from what cauſe the firſt Doctors had their Artes before bookes were made: the ſworde makes not the warrior: no help is equall with the principall: nature is mightier then Art: the actor more worthy man then his ſcribe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in reſpect of the premiſes, and ſuch other conſiderations, I haue rather taken an Eſſay in our <hi>Brutan</hi> hiſtory, then made a Worke. If I be faultie in writing too much, I confeſſe I knowe no method of writing briefly: If I be blamed in writing too litle, I wil not deny, that the old <hi>Brutans</hi> deſerue a large Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle: if I haue kept in the midſt of both, it agreeth moſt with my deſire. But why ſhould I doubt of this or that? of friend or foe? Let euery one ſpeake and write freely, not licentiouſly, in honour of his owne Countrey, that is, not againſt his kindred and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which are partes thereof. It is a dangerous poſition to refuſe the offſpring of <hi>Brute,</hi> both in regard of all reuerend antiquities of hiſtorie, and in reſpect of our owne Countreimen and neighbours, to whome I wiſhe all concord and agreement among themſelues and againſt their enemies for euer.</p>
