         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Antiochus</hi> his persecution continued three yeares and a halfe precisely, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Now <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a Type of Satan.

                  <p>That the seventy weekes are not to bee understood <hi>precisely,</hi> but by a <hi>synecdoche,</hi> is thus proved. <hi>Seventy weekes are determined upon thy People,</hi> saith <hi>Gabriel, Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 24.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14730:12"/>
That these are whole and full so many, is proved by their partition. For there are seven weekes from the going forth of the Commandement, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. and sixty three weekes when the street and wall shall be builded; and againe, after threescore and two weekes, <hi>Christ</hi> shall be slaine.

Where it is sayd, <hi>And he shall confirme the Covenant with money for one weeke: and in the Middle of the weeke he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease.</hi> Then thus the Reason stands:</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Christ</hi> dyed in the middest of the last weeke; then from the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> are not precisely 490. yeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but 486. and a halfe. The reason of the consequence is plaine: For if <hi>Christ</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middest of the last weeke, <hi>i.e.</hi> the seventieth week, then to the death of <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Cyrus</hi> the first, are but sixty nine weeks and a halfe. Now sixty nine weekes <hi>cum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midio,</hi> make but foure hundred eighty six yeares <hi>cum dimidio</hi>; whereas seventy whole weekes make foure hundred ninety yeares.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Christ</hi> dyed in the middest of the last weeke. This is manifest: For <hi>Christ</hi> then dyed, when sacrifice and oblation ceased. This is proved by the ninth and tenth to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> But sacrifice and oblation ceased in the middest of the last weeke. This <hi>Daniel</hi> expressely saith, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Therefore from the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> are not foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety yeares precisely: And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,

                     <hi>Christ</hi> was baptized about three yeares and a halfe before he dyed, and then (saith <hi>Funccius</hi>) was sacrifice &amp; oblation abolished out of the place. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.

               <p n="4">4 Besides, after <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was gone they had some Prophets; as <hi>Haggai, Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachy.</hi> I confesse that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by office and commission ended in <hi>Malachy,</hi> Yet <note n="y" place="margin">Drus. 2.

only by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> I know there was a great sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Prophets after <hi>Malachy,</hi> to prepare the people for to expect the coming of that great <hi>Prophet.</hi> For though it were <hi>vox popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> and a tradition among the Priests <note n="z" place="margin">Iohn. 1.20.21. &amp; 7.40.41.</note> and Levites, that the great Prophet was one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the Christ the <hi>Messias:</hi> yet I doubt not, but the Church did understand <hi>Moses</hi> the great <hi>Prophet</hi> prophecyed of, to be no other than the expected <hi>Messias</hi>: And therefore the dampe that was of Prophets after <hi>Malachy,</hi> turned to the good of the godly. It taught them, that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> was now at hand. And upon his comming, we finde that the <hi>Lord</hi> stirred up two <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> in a line, <note n="a" place="margin">Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. in Ioh. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Zacharie</hi> the <hi>father,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> his <hi>sonne,</hi> to point out him; <hi>Prophets</hi> by grace, rather than by office. And so I may say, that the want of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> did teach the <hi>Church,</hi> that they were shortly now to expect the true <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Christ Iesus,</hi> the <hi>high Priest</hi> of their profession. And besides, it should have taught them to cleave the more to the written <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Ieremy</hi> seemes to mee to shew in the losse of the <hi>Arke:</hi> viz. That that losse should be no losse. The people of <hi>God</hi> should not care to looke after the <hi>Arke</hi> any more: but set their hearts on the true Arke <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the Arke of Arkes. This then the Church got by it: That by the want of <hi>Vrim</hi> they learned, that the Ceremonies were in going, and the <hi>Messias</hi> in comming; that salvation was not to be placed in the ordinances of <hi>Moses,</hi> since <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:14730:21"/>
it selfe was utterly gone.</p>
               <p>Lastly, wee see that the <hi>Church</hi> did stand and was the <hi>pillar of truth</hi> without <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> The <note n="b" place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pontif. lib. 3. cap. 4 §. quartà probatur.</note> Argument is loose, that is made to prove the infallibility of the great <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> from the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> of the high Priest: For beside that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may follow from the <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 4.14. &amp; 8.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Leviticall high Priest</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>high Priest,</hi> of whom that <hi>high Priest</hi> was a <hi>Type,</hi> and not of the <hi>Pope</hi>; yet we see that the <hi>Church</hi> stood to the <hi>word,</hi> when there was no <hi>Vrim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> from the taking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to the comming of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>; for in that <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> the <hi>high Priest</hi> had no <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim.</hi> And for that slender voyce called <hi>Bath-col,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Tremelius</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 12.22. which <hi>Henry</hi>

                  <hi>Ainsworth</hi> would have to make some supply for the defect of <hi>Vrim</hi>; it hath no ground: and is to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe to the foolish <hi>Rabbins</hi> from whom it came. And therefore the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> was the <hi>standard,</hi> and not the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> I doubt not but the people had by some meanes perfect notice of the <hi>Revelation</hi> made to the <hi>Priest,</hi> and they were absolutely to stand to the <hi>Oracles</hi> given by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> from the mouth of <hi>God:</hi> Yet me thinkes, 'tis hard to prove that the <hi>Priest</hi> did use it for matters of <hi>Religion</hi> and doctrine, and not onely for matters of fact and event: Next, that the <hi>Priest</hi> had answere when he would, though he himselfe were never so wicked: or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the sinnes of the people did not hinder the giving of the <hi>Oracle</hi> sometime.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14730:21"/>
'Tis enough that for some 550. yeares the <hi>high Priest</hi> was destitute of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>; and yet I hope the <hi>Lord</hi> did not leave his people without a sure and certaine rule of faith and direction of life, which is the holy <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Malachy</hi> doth tell us, that though <hi>the Priests lips</hi> by that place and office should haue <hi>preserved knowledge</hi>; yet often they did not: And though, while <hi>Vrim</hi> lasted, it never gave any false or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious answers; yet many times, what for the sinnes of the Priest, and what for the sinnes of the people, the Lord refused to give any answer at all; and the answers that were given, were rather in matters of <note n="e" place="margin">Numb. 17.21. 1. Sam. 23.11, 12. &amp; 30.7, 8.</note> fact than of doctrine and of faith.</p>
               <p>The argument is too weake, that the Cardinall doth draw from the Iewish Church, to prove that the Pope hath the deciding Spirit and Voyce in matters of Faith; sith from the destruction of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to <hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince (a space of some 550. yeares) there was no Oracle by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> no <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 74.9. <hi>Wee see not our signes: there is no more any Prophet.</hi>

In a word, the losse of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> the Arke, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14730:22"/>
other Ceremonials, taught them to looke off from the shadowes, and to looke for the Truth, the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi>

hee may come to the certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; which sometimes is, to the third and fourth generation. Now if he bee not humble and take them to heart, there is a secret consent; because he doth not by this act of humbling shew his dissent: And had such a childe the occasions and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his forefathers had; he would doe as they did. And thus he sets his fathers sins on his score; and makes them his owne. According to that of <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Belshazzar, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est all this.</hi> viz. <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> sinne and punishment. In the Legall Covenant of workes, the guilt, together with the fault and corruption, did convey it selfe to the Posterity. Originall sinne descends by force of that Covenant: And that Commination to visit the sins of the Fathers, hath an eye to the Covenant of the Law. But now in the <hi>Evangelicall Covenant of grace,</hi> the sinne, and the wrath of God, goes no further than the very persons offending: Only God doth sometimes make the fathers sinnes an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, never a cause of punishing the child with some greater measure of punishment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should personall sins in the guilt, descend from fathers to the children: wee should have more Originall sinnes than one.</p>

               <p>It appeares by <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.15. and <hi>Nohem.</hi> 2.1. that the Temple was built before the walls of the Citie. The wals of the Citie were first broken downe, and last built up; and that 14. yeares after the Temple. And one reason hereof is given: for that before in all the former edicts made in behalfe of the <hi>Iewes</hi> by <hi>Cyrus</hi> or any other, there was no word as touching the reedifying of the City, but onely to build againe the Temple. <hi>Paraeus</hi> rather is in the truth, who holds, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> did by edict give leave to build the Citie: <hi>Orat. de</hi> 70. <hi>hebdom.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14730:25"/>
by reason of so great resistance, they could doe little or nothing to the Citie. And therefore <hi>Nehemiah</hi> gets Letters Patents to build the Citie, and the wals of the Citie. And the truth is; That the <hi>Iewes</hi> after their returne, grew secure and carelesse, fell to <note n="r" place="margin">Vid.

That all the 7. dayes, day after day, the Booke of the Law of God was read, and they had Congregations to that purpose each day, and then they had a solemne As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly on the 8. day according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:14730:35"/>The matter wee looke after is, That by this of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> wee see, that it was not held by him a lawfull thing for them then to worke; or for him to suffer them to worke on the Sabbath in times of harvest. Their treading of wine-presses doth evince, that the time was harvest time; in that the worke was an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest worke. A custome they had got to keepe a sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, a faire on that day, and to labour at their harvest. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> saw that <hi>Religion</hi> would soone die, if thus they might goe on. And therefore he gave not over, till hee had made them give over. Authority in the hands of a resolute man is of great force and use.</p>
               <p>As touching harvest-worke, in my minde, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion were at an end, if we did but distinguish betwixt ordinary and usuall Cases; (and then, as wee have most reason to serve God in harvest, and most need of rest, wee and our people, when we use to labour most; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding will grant, that then there lies a <hi>probition</hi> against labour.)</p>
               <p>And extraordinary and unusuall occasions. And so who doubts, but it is lawfull then to labour? Indeed when the case stands in <hi>aequilibrio</hi>; and one is as like as the other; and no man can say, but the pretious fruits of the earth are as like to be saved as spoyled: here my opinion is, That wee are to put the matter into the hands of God. But when the case stands so, that either wee must worke, or there is a morall certainty, that the fruits of the harvest will receive a sensible hurt, to the prejudice of our life or livelihood; here I conceive it to be a dutie to worke: Here, I say, wee breake the Sabbath, except wee breake it. <hi>Christ</hi> saith, That the Priests labouring in the Temple,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.5.</note> did profane the Sabbath: <note n="m" place="margin">Marc. 2.27 Vid. Maldonat.</note> and yet were guiltlesse. How so? pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and yet guiltlesse? Because those their Temple-workes (had it not beene on such occasions) would have beene a profanation of the Sabbath. The sense
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14730:36"/>
of a Law, is the Law: and in the sense of the Law, the labour of the Priests was an hallowing of the Sabbath: But in the meere Letter; (which the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> with whom <hi>Christ</hi> did dispute, did follow) it was, to see to, a profanation of the Sabbath: but in the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they did sanctifie, and not profane it. Right so: In case of necessity, wee profane the Sabbath, except wee profane it: wee perish, except wee perish. For <hi>necessity</hi> herein hath no law: and it doth adde a new relation to the worke wee doe; no new <hi>Ens,</hi> but a <hi>Modus Entis.</hi> And there is not the greatest toyle in the world; but in this sense, it is a keeping of the <note n="n" place="margin">Vid. Bound. lib. 1. pag. 217. Walae. de 4. praecept. p. 129.</note> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath holy. For the Sabbath was made for man (<hi>i. e.</hi>) not onely for the very being of Man; but for his wel-being. And therefore whatsoever by <hi>necessity,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraud or covin, is to be done on that day for the comfort of man, that now is turned into a very Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-worke. I binde not man in a <hi>Mathematicall</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to poynts of <hi>Physicall</hi> necessity. And therefore, if it stand for the conveniencie of Man, and there were nothing to the <note n="o" place="margin">

So</hi> Zauch. in 4. praec.</note> contrary (<hi>à parte ante,</hi> nor <hi>à parte post,</hi>) I meane, that it might not have beene done as well before, or deferred till after the Sabbath: so I call it a <hi>necessary Worke. Christ</hi> cured some upon the <note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 12.1. <hi>It appeares by</hi> Luc. 6.1. <hi>that it was the</hi> 7. <hi>day of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread: which was a Ceremoniall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: But yet by Christs justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of them from the Priests profaning the weekely Sabbath guiltlessely, it is plaine, that the reason of both sorts of Sabbaths in this was alike. Luk.</hi> 13.15.</note> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, whose life lay not upon it, but that they might have stayed till the morrow: And the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in that of plucking the Eares of Corne (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are justified by <hi>Christ</hi>) were not in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, but they might have put it off, till they came to Towne: and therefore they were to doe many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall workes on the Sabbath, and were yet guiltlesse; nay guilty even of breaking the Sabbath, except they did doe them.</p>

And therefore when the creature, that is, a necessary creature, is in danger of receiving any notorious dammage, that may make it unserviceable for man, did they break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath if they did worke to save it? No, The Sabbath was broken, except they did worke: Neither is it any thing to say, we must rather let our hay and corne fall into, and lye in the suddes, and accept therein the chastisement of our sinnes. What? and perhaps fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish? And must wee suffer our Oxe to sticke in the mire, as a rod from God? What? not lift the poore Oxe out?

Nothing is to be concluded against what I have said, out of that in <hi>Exodus,</hi> That in harvest, they were to cease on the seventh day.

But
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14730:37"/>
what needes this, sith a reconciliation is at hand; that this prohibition is to be construed with the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on still of <hi>necessity</hi>? <note n="s" place="margin">Tremel. in Mark. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Tremellius,</hi> a Iew by nature, is of the mind, that by very <hi>Talmud,</hi> dangers of life, though not evident, were cause enough for a Iew to worke vpon the Sabbath day. And <note n="t" place="margin">Lyra in Exod. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Lyra</hi> another Christian of the same Nation, writing on the very words of the Law, is plaine, that for all the words of the Law, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe those workes which could not well be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the next day, nor done the day before.

               <p>A maine observation out of the words of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is, touching the persons with whom <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is sayd here to contest. Our last and best Translation reads it, <hi>Nobles</hi>: I have read, that it were fitter to translate it, <hi>Freemen.</hi> And this is, to beare out an Opinion, that even among the Iewes a servant did not sinne in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the Sabbath day, in case his Master command him: As though <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had contested with all and with onely Freemen: and that therefore the servants were in no blame. <note n="x" place="margin">Manual. cap. 13. n. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Navarrus</hi> to helpe this his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, puts in two Clauses of exception: One is, That the servant is to heare one <hi>Masse</hi>: the other; that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster doe not enjoyne him worke on the holy day in contempt: If hee doe, then the servant is rather to dye the death, than to worke at his Masters command.</p>

               <p>A word of the Argument, and then more at large of the proofe of the Argument. Say, the word did signifie Masters (which it doth not;) yet I deny the Argument: He contested with the Masters; therefore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14730:37"/>
the Masters onely were in fault. And the reason why I deny it; because I find it granted, that the servants would have rested with thankes, if they had not beene constrained to worke. What needs then to urge the servants to doe that, which of themselves they would faine doe? The Masters were chiefe in fault: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee contests with them. The Masters had in their power to reforme all: therefore <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> like a wise and just Prince deales with them. Hee was a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and his businesse being not for correction of what was done, but for reformation, that they might doe so no more; whom in reason should hee speake unto, but the Superiours? mend them, mend all. The servants would come in of themselves: if they would not, the Masters had power to force them to it whether they would or not. Mee thinkes then, it is an argument to be pitied, to fall from the penne of any learned man, and from this to conclude, That the Servants did not sinne, because in that <hi>sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> reformation <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did contest with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> and not with them by name. But what if wee prove out of this very Chapter, That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did contest with all, Servants and all? Looke but into the 15. <hi>verse,</hi> and there wee reade, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> saw some treading wine-presses on the Sabbath day (and these are confessed to be Servants) and bringing in sheaves, and lading Asses, as also wine, grapes, and figges, and all manner of burdens which they brought into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the Sabbath day. All these, or the most of these, I am sure, were Servants: For who used to beare burdens, but the Servants? And were not these in fault? Else, why did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> contest with them? Hee was to deale wisely and justly. The Text saith, That hee testified against them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely the worke was done by them; but a <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>There was not only</hi> Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas facti, sed peccati.</note> sinne was committed by them. As good an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14730:38"/>
as the former might have arose to inferre, That onely Servants were in the sinne, because he testified againsts the Servants, and not the Masters by name. But the thing wee looke is not to be denied: and that is, Because here, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> testified against the Servants that did beare burdens, that therefore <hi>They</hi> did sinne. For wee have it confessed, that they would not have troden the wine-presses, nor carried the burdens, except their Masters had commanded them. And therefore, albeit their Masters did charge them to doe it: just and wise <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did testifie against those Servants, for those workes on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; which workes they did in obedience to their Masters. And out of this, hee that hath halfe an eye may see, that the Servants did sinne. Hee did look besides the Booke then, who did and durst write, That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not reprove the Servants, by whose employment and labour these things were done: For, the Text is expresse, That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did testifie first against them; The Servants that did tread the Presses, and beare the Burdens, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and then the Nobles, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Once more from the very Text in hand, I prove That <hi>Servants,</hi> as servants, were in the same sinne with their <hi>Masters</hi>; though not in the same point and degree of sinning. I say in the sinne as sinne, to shut out all cavill. For 'tis a very riddle to mee in a matter so expresse and evident, a servant should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the fact, and not to the fault. I meane so farre as to make them guilty as well as the <hi>master,</hi> though not so much as the <hi>Master.</hi> Thus I argue.</p>
               <p>Those, whom <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did contest against, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. were in a sinne (else hee dealt, nor justly, nor wisely to contend with them.)</p>
               <p>But besides the <hi>Merchants,</hi> those were sellers of all kinds of ware: I thinke, the most of them, I am
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14730:38"/>
sure many, were servants. For who be they that in all trades, places, markets, faires, sell? What? Not the servants as well as the <hi>Master</hi>? Therefore they did sinne.</p>
               <p>Againe, Those whom <hi>Nehemiah</hi> threatned to lay hands on, were in a sinne in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> opinion; else neither his wisedome, nor justice would, that hee should lay them up. But hee sayd, hee would lay hands on the sellers of all kinds of ware, who lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about the Walls of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And amongst these sellers, there must needs be many servants. Neither doth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> threaten some, but all (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely) the Sellers: for sellers of all kindes of ware, is all one with all sellers of wares. The termes are <hi>aequipollent</hi>: And therefore servants were in fault.</p>
               <p>Now how poore and weake this kinde of disputing is, wee will shew out of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7. There <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> is said to rebuke the <note n="z" place="margin">

                  <hi>Rulers.</hi> Did none refuse to pay their portions but the <hi>Rulers</hi>? Yes, the whole body of the people: The corruption was generall. The <hi>Levites</hi> and the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> were made to fight so low, that they were fled: the exigent was such, that they must flye or famish.

[All Iudah.]</hi> Out of the text it selfe I prove, that such a conclusion as this holds not. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reproved the <hi>Rulers</hi> onely; therefore the <hi>Rulers</hi> onely were in transgression: For the words, as they lye, shew us that all <hi>Iudah</hi> offended: And yet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cals onely the <hi>Magistrates</hi> to <hi>coram</hi>: And why? they had power in their hands to reforme this in all. So here he contended with the <hi>Nobles.</hi> I say then, as the truth is, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> dealt onely with the great Ones, because they were chiefe in the sinne to suffer it; and it was in their power and place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it: That so he and they joyning together to bring about the full reformation, the Lord might have his Sabbaths againe. Having cleered, as I take it, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Argument, wee are now to shew, that the proofe is of no force.</p>
