            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Propounded to the Rulers, Teachers, and People of the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> for them ſingly to anſwer in their hearts and conſciences, in the fear and dread of the mighty God of Heaven and Earth, whoſe mighty arm of power is ſtretched out in this Nation, firſt to overturn what ſtands in his way, and then to eſtabliſh (in the place thereof) what he hath purpoſed in his heart. And this is the thing which the Lord hath determined to do, both particularly in perſons, and generally throughout the earth; namely to pull down the Mighty from their Seats, and to exalt the humble and meek, (who are made ſuch by the preſence and power of his life in them) that he alone may be exalted in the ſpirits of his People, and throughout the earth. And this work hath the Lord begun already; for his great and notable day hath appeared, and breaketh forth apace, though the eye which is cloſed cannot ſee it, nor the benummed ſenſe feel it. But he that hath an ear, let him hear the ſound of the Lords Trumpet, which ſaith in the mighty breath of his ſpirit of life, A wake ye dead, and ſtand up to judgement; for the day of Recompence is come, the day of the eternal vengeance of our God, and the day of his everlaſting mercy and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful redemption. The Queſtion is as followeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VVHen this Nation was rent from Popery</hi> (in part I mean, for wholly it was never rent, but did ſtill retain the ſame ſpirit, though by the Magiſtrates Sword it was forced from that Form and way of Worſhip, which the <hi>Pope</hi> had eſtabliſhed) <hi>did it wait on the Lord for the guidance of his Spirit and power, thereby to build up a true Church and habitation for God in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48856:2"/>
ſpirit? Or did it take ſuch materials as were ready at hand, and frame up a building as well as it could, wherewith the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of many (that were tender hearted towards God) were even then diſatisfyed, and felt, in the eternal life of God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation not to be right in its beginning?</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <p>This is a weighty Queſtion: for an errour at firſt, an errour in the foundation is great, and the cauſe of many following er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. If the Spirit of God was not then conſulted with, and waited upon, if he did not raiſe the fabrick, ſurely the building was not right. It was the Spirit of God which rent men from Popery (ſo far as they were acted upon pure &amp; honeſt principles) ſhewing the blackneſs and darkneſs thereof, and kindling deſires in men after a more inward and ſpiritual way of Worſhip; Thus far was of him. But if men did then conſult with their own wiſdom, for the ordering and carrying on of the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo upon politick grounds and reaſons, did raiſe up a building, and not wait on the Lord for his light and power to build with; then ſurely that building was not of God, nor could he be honoured thereby, nor his truth preſerved, nor the integrity and conſcientiouſneſs of his peoples hearts towards him cheriſhed: but all this would ſuffer, and be in danger by this building, and a contrary ſpirit be pleaſed with it, and thrive under it. And hath it not been ſo? were not the non-conformiſts to it (though known to be pretious perſons in the ſavour and life of God) looked upon and dealt with as enemies, while ſuch conformiſts as were known to be looſe and ſcandalous, yet could flouriſh wel enough, &amp; make a fair ſhew in this National Church, and be zealous contenders for the way of Worſhip and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it? Yea, thoſe that have been ſtrict in their lives and converſations, and truly zealous towards God, in their ſouls and Spirits, preſſing after righteouſneſs and purity; ſuch as theſe though they might conform, yet were they not hated, nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, in ſcorn called Puritans, and ſnares laid for them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them? And how could it be otherwiſe? For <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was not right, if the conſtitution and Government of this Church was not of God, then it could not favour and cheriſh that which was of God, then it could not nouriſh or be pleaſed with obedience to his pure life and Spirit, but rather with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to its carnall form. For ſo it is in truth and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48856:2"/>
reality before God, This Church with its whole conſtitution, Government, Order, and way of Worſhip was either of Gods Spirit, and ſo ſpiritual, or of mans wiſdome, and ſo carnal. If of Gods Spirit, then it wil be a friend to that which is ſpiritual, and an enemy to that which is carnal: if of mans wiſdome, then it will be a friend to that which is carnal, and an enemy to that which is ſpiritual. And this is a true mark of the true Church, and of the true Church power and Government, it begets and perſerves that which is ſpiritual, it beats down the carnal; whereas that Church power and Government which is carnall, preſerves that which is carnal (a carnal unity, a carnal unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in worſhip <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> but checks, ſnibbs, ſmites, and perſecutes that which is ſpiritual: and ſuch a kind of power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſet up, the carnal part in every man contends and cries out for. And ſo long as there is any change made in this Church by the ſame wiſdome it will never be otherwiſe, it will be but from carnal to carnal, and ſo ſtill againſt that which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. Therefore look back ſingly, and conſider what the building was, and how it was reared up; and ſee whether it was of God, or no? Or whether it was built up in the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mans ſpirit, by carnal reaſonings and conſultings, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating things to the preſent ſtate of the Nation, and not to the plain and clear meaſure of Gods truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, See what the materials were whereof this Church was built. Were they materials fit to make up a true Church of? Was it built up of a people truly converted to God? Of perſons changed in heart? Of perſons ſenſible of the fore going idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and turned in their ſouls, minds, and ſpirits from dead Idols towards the living God? Or was not rather the heart of the Nation ſtill inclined towards Popery, even while it was turning into a Proteſtant Church? And was it not cheifly made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church by the force of the civil power, which wound in by degrees a Proteſtant intereſt, the heart of the people ſtill remaining unchanged, and hankering after Popery, but at length, in tract of time, ſeeing they knew not how to help it, won over to Proteſtaniſm with the ſame heart and ſpirit, that they came out of Popery with? Conſider ſeriouſly in the ſight of God (who looketh both forward and backward upon things with a true eye) whether it hath been thus or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48856:3"/>
Secondly, See what kind of Miniſtry was then ſet up. Was it a new Miniſtry (as <hi>John Huſs</hi> that famous <hi>Bohemian</hi> Martyr propheſied ſhould ariſe, and as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaw the necceſſity of, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaiming the deriving of orders from Popiſh Biſhops) or was it the ſame Miniſtry which was derived from <hi>Rome?</hi> It is a ſore ſtreſſe the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> have been put to, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to plead for the truth of the Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that thereby they might defend their own. Now mark this thing following, There aroſe falſe Apoſtles, falſe Prophets, falſe Teachers in the Apoſtle daies, whom Satan clothed like true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, like true Prophets, like <hi>Miniſters of righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus they appeared, thus they ſeemed to be, but they were not of God, but Satan; not ſent of God, not inſpired by God, but inſpired and ſent by Satan. Theſe falſe Apoſtles, theſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets fought againſt the true Church, and true Miniſtry of Chriſt. And though they were oftentimes diſcovered, by the Spirit of Chriſt in his Church, and the Church preſerved from them, yet we find related in Scripture, that at length they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, inſomuch as the third part of the true Miniſters was ſhaken, and ſwept down from their place and ſtanding by them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4. yea and at length the Church her ſelf (as to the truth of her outward ſtate) overcome, and fled into the wilderneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. &amp; 14. and a falſe Church got up in her ſtead, which hath a cup of fornication to make people ſpiritually drunk, and to bewitch them from the true worſhip of God, into imitations and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 4. and thoſe who will not acknowledge her like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes &amp; imitations to be the truth, but in the word of the Lambs Teſtimony witneſs againſt them, ſhe drinks their blood, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Now can any man of any manner of ſeriouſneſs and ſobriety of Spirit, (who is not drunk &amp; overcome with this Whores wine) beleive, that after falſe Porphets had got the day, and ſet up the falſe Church, that they would ſetup the true Miniſtry in it? O how blind have men been, that they ſhould go about, and take ſuch pains to derive a ſucceſſion of the true Miniſtry, from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Prophets of the falſe Church!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What kind of maintenance was ſet up for this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? Was it a Goſpel maintenance? Was it that they ſhould live of the Goſpel, which cannot but open mens ſpirits to the true Miniſters thereof? Or was it a maintenance forced from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48856:3"/>
the people, by that outward power which ſet up the Church? And was this maintenance like unto, or the ſame with the maintenance which the Popiſh Miniſtry had before in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for their idolatrous ſervice?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What kind of Worſhip was it, which was ſet up? Was it the worſhip of the Goſpel, which is in ſpirit and truth? Or was it a form of worſhip invented by man, and ſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the preſent temper of the Nation, that they might with the more eaſe and willingneſs ſtep out of Popery into it, becauſe of its nearneſs and likeneſs thereto?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, What kind of Church Government was ſet up? Was it a pure ſpiritual Government? Was it put into the hands of the ſpirit? (For nothing is to govern, or can rightly govern o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſpirits of Chriſts people in ſpiritual things, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt.) Or did men frame up a Church Government by their wiſdome, and put it into the hands of ſuch, as might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it without, yea and againſt the Spirit?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, What kind of order was ſet up in this Church? Was it the true Goſpel order? Was it the order of Chriſts Spirit, whereby the carnal wiſdome of man might be quenched, and his ſpirit have ſcope? Or was it a carnal order, whereby the carnal wiſdome, learning, knowledge, and arts of man might have ſcope, and the ſpirit in its motions be quenched?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, By what wiſdome was the Common Prayer Book compiled and ſet up, and ſurplices, croſſes, and other cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies injoyned? Was it by the wiſdome of Gods Spirit, for the building up of the ſpirits of his people in the faith? Or was it for the pleaſing and ſatisfying of the carnal part in people? And what ſort of perſons were they who did moſt contend for, and were moſt pleaſed with theſe? Were they, for the generality, the ſtricter, or the looſer ſort?</p>
               <p>Eightly, How came it about, that the ſupream Magiſtrate of this Nation, was made cheif head and governor of this Church under Chriſt? Was this from Chriſts inſtitution, or of mans wiſdome and invention? If of mans inventing wiſdome, then againſt Chriſt, then of Antichriſts ſpirit, who exalteth that which is not of Chriſt, to ſit and govern in his temple.</p>
               <p>O weigh theſe things, look about thee, O <hi>England:</hi> O Rulers, Teachers, and People look about you? And if it plainly,
<pb facs="tcp:48856:4"/>
upon a naked ſearch appear, that there was at the very firſt a foundation laid of ſuppreſſing the true worſhip, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to it, do not ſhut your eyes. Have not the people of God ſtill been miſ-repreſented, had reproachful names caſt upon them, and in ſome degree or other been perſecuted from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the reformation? And though names change, and Rulers change, and the teachers change, and the people alſo change in their religion and worſhips, yet is not the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit ſtill the ſame, and the perſecuted Spirit ſtill the ſame alſo. The perſecuting Spirit changeth its cover often, but ſtill retains its nature, hunting after the life and pure pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit, in the Children which are begotten of God. Are not the people of God in every change a deſpiſed people, and their integrity towards God ſtill ſtruck at? When the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to wipe off the reproach from them, at the beginning of theſe troubles, and the perſecuting Spirit could not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently hunt them any longer under the name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> then other names were invented for them, whereby the ſame ſpirit ſought to make them appear odious again, under a new reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful title, that ſo it might be perſecuting the ſame thing afreſh? O how mightily hath the Lord ſtriven to keep the Powers and people of this Nation from falling upon his people! and yet ſtill ſo ſoon as they come to any peace, and feeling of power, they are at it again. O <hi>England,</hi> thy perſiſting in this, cannot but bring wrath upon thee. What wouldſt thou have of us? Shall we not fear the Lord? Shall we not obey the Lord? Shall we not worſhip the Lord our God, who hath redeemed, and is redeeming our ſouls from death? Shall we not be <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in truth and uprightneſs of heart before the Lord? Shall we not teſtifie againſt the Popiſh Spirit, and Popiſh practiſes, and all new inventions of the ſame ſpirit (though they get never ſo fine a covering) in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as againſt them in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The Lord is our witneſs, we would not offend thee, O <hi>England,</hi> no not the meaneſt perſons of the whole Nation: but from out of <hi>Popery</hi> are we called (and from what ever elſe the ſame nature and Spirit may take up in the ſtead of it) to follow the Lord our God towards the land of the living; and follow him we muſt, however thou deal with us. O <hi>England,</hi> If it had been ſo, that thy Rulers had built up a
<pb facs="tcp:48856:4"/>
true Church, yet the evil Spirit, the unclean Spirit would have endeavoured to pollute it, to provoke the Lor<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

O when wilt thou have an ear to hear, that the Lords wrath may aſſwage towards thee, which kindleth more and more, and is entring a pace within thy bowels! This, this is the Lords charge againſt thee, <hi>Thou art for the Proteſtant name</hi> (it is now become thy intereſt, and a goodly covering in thy eyes) <hi>but againſt the Proteſtant Spirit,</hi> which the Lord calleth to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him further and further from all the things of Popery, and from all the things like Popery. And the Lord will put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Proteſtant Name, and the Proteſtant Spirit: between them that ſerve him in the fear which he begets in the heart, and them that ſet up that kind of fear wich is taught by the precepts of men. O <hi>England,</hi> we are now ſeemingly in thy hands (who haſt long handled us very roughly) and we have no ſtrength againſt thee, nor no hope of deliverance from thee, but in the Lord our God, and there we are at reſt, waiting upon him in the innocency, and integrity which he hath begotten in our hearts, until he plead our cauſe. And in that day, thou wilt ſee that we have not been thine enemies, and then thou wilt mourn over that miſt of darkneſs, which hath with-held thine eye from diſcerning what true friends we have been to thee, and how we have endeavoured, and ſought with our hearts to prevent thy drinking of that bitter cup, which is to go round the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And if thine ear could have been opened, thou mighteſt have been ſpared.</p>
