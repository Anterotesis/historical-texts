            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SERMON PREACHED
before the Honorable Houſe of
Commons, at their late ſolemne
monethly Faſt, <date>March 26.
1645.</date>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSAL. 82. 1.</bibl>
               <q>He judgeth among the Gods.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here needs no Apology for the choyce
of this <hi>Text</hi> at this time, when thoſe
who are called Gods are met in the
ſolemn aſſembly to judge themſelves
before him, <hi>who ſtands</hi> daily <hi>in the
aſſembly of the mighty and iudgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It requires as little labour to make
out the context and coherence of the words; they lye in
the very threſhold or enterance of the Pſalme: and the
<hi>Pſalmes</hi> are as ſo many Ilands that have no continuitie or
neighbourhood with their fellow Pſalmes.</p>
            <p>And if you read but a little forward on in the Pſalme, you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112955:4"/>
may as quickly diſcerne whither they tend, and what is
their ſcope: and therein alſo ſpye ſomething that will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them both ſutable to the Congregation, and ſeaſonable
for the day; for that which is contained in the following
verſes is the uſe and application of the Doctrine that is held
forth in this verſe.</p>
            <p>A twofold doctrine; the one of Gods preſence, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Gods preſidence among the Gods: the latter of the
two is the ſubject of my Text. <hi>He iudgeth among the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three <hi>Myſteries</hi> folded together in it; there is
<hi>one God,</hi> and there be <hi>Gods many:</hi> and there is <hi>one Act,</hi> both
<hi>his and theirs;</hi> or rather <hi>his amongſt them.</hi> We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
who <hi>He is,</hi> who <hi>they are;</hi> and what it is which <hi>He
doth among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, who <hi>He</hi> is; we may ſee him in the firſt word of
the Pſalme, for he that ſtandeth in the aſſembly of the
mighty, is He that judgeth among the <hi>Gods, God</hi> is He.</p>
            <p>The Pronoune <hi>He</hi> doth not ſtand by it ſelfe in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
as in the Tranſlation, but is involved in the Verbe;
yet ſo he is not hidden but proclaimed, it ſpeakes him that
he may be ſeene, for Gods workes are his Name: and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
it might be ſo ordered on purpoſe, that an hint might
be given to them over whom the Name of God is called,
to count it more honour to be knowne by the worke which
they doe, and the uſe they are of, then by the office they
are in, or the titles that they beare.</p>
            <p>Our Engliſh idiome or manner of ſpeaking, doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
require a more expreſſe ſpecification of <hi>Him,</hi> and a
fitter terme to decipher him could not be found: for being
the <hi>prime Active Being, He</hi> cannot be defined by any thing
but <hi>himſelfe:</hi> and therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> asked him his
Name,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> he gave it him thus: <hi>I am, that I am,</hi> and bad him tell
the children of <hi>Iſrael, I am</hi> had ſent him, and ſpeakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Eſa. 48. 12.</note> in theſe termes, <hi>I am He:</hi> yet if any
man hath a thought that this is too low and unbecoming an
expreſſion of the <hi>Divine Maieſtis;</hi> and it had beene better
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112955:4"/>
to have mentioned Him by ſome more excellent Name, or
glorious Attributes; let him thinke this rather, that if the
Holy Ghoſt moved holy men to ſpeake thus homely of <hi>the
Lord of glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>the God of glory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 2.</note> it may well beſeeme thoſe
who are but called <hi>Gods</hi> to account it no diſparagement, if
they be either ſpoken to, or ſpoken of, though every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be not larded with the repetition of <hi>Titles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, who <hi>They</hi> are. The Gods are All that deale

I know not whether we may reject the other two; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe we may often obſerve the Holy Ghoſt chooſing
words not of ambiguous, but of manifold ſignification to
make the ſenſe not more doubtfull, but more comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive:
Yet I chooſe to embrace the firſt, becauſe it ſeemes
to be the moſt naturall and Grammaticall, as the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and familiar ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Having thus made out the expoſition of the words, and
thereby the interpretation of the Text, we may the better
take our aime and make our obſervations.</p>
            <p>The three parts of the Text (for ſo it naturally divideth
it ſelfe) <hi>Who, What,</hi> and <hi>Among whom,</hi> afford us three
points of doctrine.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The firſt is this, That God is the firſt, the chiefe, the
onely univerſall Iudge, and abſolute Monarch: He is</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> The
God of Gods,<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 16.</note> the King of Kings,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 8.</note> the Lord of Lords,<note place="margin">Jude 4. 1 Tim. 6. 15.</note> Higher
then the Higheſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 83. 18.</note> the onely Lord, the onely Potentate; onely
the moſt Higheſt.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond is this,<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 17.</note> That the judgement is the Lords,
and he is with men in the judgement;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 19. 6.</note> or as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi>
22. 28.<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 28.</note> 
               <hi>The kingdome is the Lords: and he governeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third is this, That thoſe perſons who have the
honour to have the power to exerciſe Authoritie amongſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112955:5"/>
men, are greater in dignitie and neerer to God in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
then other men.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of the three, that is drawn from that golden
tache which couples the two extreames of the propoſition,
hath in it the marrow of all the Text, and is the life of the
<hi>Law</hi> in the whole Pſalme, for ſo our Saviour cals it, when
he cites a part of it,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 34. and therefore I ſhall pitch
onely upon that at this time.</p>
            <p>I propounded it in the words of the Scripture, and may
therefore ſpare the labour of citing thoſe places for proofe.
In other termes take it thus. In the delegating of power,
and ſubſtituting of men to beare rule amongſt men, <hi>He</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deveſts himſelfe of any piece of his Soveraigne Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
nor after the manner of Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their Kingdomes,
appoints the office, aſſignes the honour, limits the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
preſcribes the rule, gives the countenance, concurs
ſometimes to helpe, and ſometimes cals to account, and
otherwiſe withdraw himſelfe from the worke, and take
his pleaſure; but is an immediate Agent in the judgement
all along, from the firſt ordaining the power through the
ordering of every matter, to the over ruling and diſpoſing
of the laſt iſſues and events thereof.</p>
            <p>There is the ſame influence of God into Government,
and all that beare rule, or ſerve in it; and that which is done
by them, though they goe by their owne principles to their
owne ends, that there is in the generall adminiſtration of
providence through the world, the various occurrences
therein,<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 17.</note> and the motions of thoſe inanimate and irrationall
creatures who are acted and over-ruled to their ends by a
Power without themſelves:<note place="margin">Quamdiu cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atura eſt, tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu creatur a Deo.</note> ſo as it may be truly ſaid of the
ordering of the concernments of men, by the Lord; and in
the ſame ſenſe as our Saviour ſpake, by the upholding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things by the word of his Power;<note place="margin">Idem eſſe quod ab in itio a Deo acceperunt ab eodem continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accipiunt.</note> 
               <hi>My Father worketh
hitherto, and I worke.</hi> He worketh in the conſervation of
the matter and being of things: for by the continuall flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of the ſame. Power upon them which gave them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112955:6"/>
their firſt exiſtence, they continually receive their ſubſiſtance,
as by a continuation of creation:<note place="margin">Eſa. 44. 24.</note> 
               <hi>He maketh all things, He
ſtretcheth forth the heavens, He ſpreadeth abroad the earth
by himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He worketh in the holding up of the frame of heaven and
earth, and all things in them; for they abide not together as
a building compact by joynts and bands; but as a chaine of
rings by the vertue of the Loadſtone, as many pieces in the
hollow of a mans hand, which if drawne away they fall in
ſunder.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>All things conſiſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He worketh in the movings of all the creatures,<note place="margin">Vid. Pſal. 104. &amp; Hoſ. 2. 21, 22.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their natures, and the order for them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<hi>He bringeth out their hoſt by number,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Intelligamus vocem Dei effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricem eſſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>he calleth them
all by names, by the greatneſſe of his might, for that He
is ſtrong in power, not one faileth.</hi> Every wheele in the great
Engine of Creation, turne that the voyce and by the Spirit

            </p>
            <p>In like manner God is operative in the bringing in of
Government; the upholding of Authoritie; the placing or
diſplacing of Perſons; the inclining of their ſpirits; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
or confounding of their counſels; the exerting of
their power, and the bringing about of the ſeverall effects of
all theſe things.<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note>

               <hi>And though men ſeeke the favour of the Ruler, yet every

evill that is in the Land, He doth it.<note n="h" place="margin">Eſa. 45. 7.</note> 
               <hi>He makes peace, He
creates evill: the Lord doth all theſe things.</hi> So that we may
boldly ſay, there is no power in the world, no perſon is in
place, or hath abilitie to exerciſe authoritie, or hath it not;
there is not a deviſe in any mans heart, not a deſigne in any
Councel, not a Law made or executed, not an Action un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112955:6"/>
not an alteration in any State, but <hi>the Hand of the
Lord worketh all theſe things:</hi> for the judgement is his, and
men accompliſh his pleaſure though they doe not know
him, as <hi>Cyrus, Eſa.</hi> 44. 45. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. they fulfill his
charge when they drive on their owne deſignes, as the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian,
Eſa.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. they bring about his purpoſes when
they pleaſe their owne humours; as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and his
Counſellors, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. They execute his judgements,
when they ſerve their owne luſts; as <hi>Baaſha,</hi> and <hi>Jehu,
1 King. 16. 7. Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4. They doe his worke when they
goe againſt his word; as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
and the <hi>Jewes, Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28. with their wicked wills they
effect his good will, as thoſe that crucified the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, <hi>Acts 2. 28. Him being delivered by the determinate
counſell and foreknowledge of God ye have taken, and by wicked
hands have crucified and ſlaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this truth and prevent objections we muſt know,
Firſt, that the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh can flow in upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the ſpirits of men both <hi>imperceivably,</hi> without obſervation,
as the ſoul acts in the body: or as the light entreth the aire,
or the ſhadow paſſeth on the dyall without any noiſe, and
<hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> in a way congruous to their nature, without any
violence to the liberty of the will in any particular action or
election; as a wiſe man can make the winde which bloweth
where it liſteth, to convey his ſhip, or grinde his corne; or
uſe the ſagacity of the dog to ſeek what he hath loſt, or fetch
what he hath caſt aſide. And this is the excellency of his
wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider that God and man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in the ſame actions, and neither his holineſſe have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
with their wickedneſſe, nor their injuſtice be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by his righteouſneſſe: God and man work upon differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
principles, in divers wayes to ſeverall ends each his own,
and in ſuch a caſe every mans reaſon will tell him the ſame
action receives not the ſame cenſure or judgement.<note place="margin">Idem quum duo faciunt, non eſt idem.</note> The

heart, but brings to light and brings to judgement what is in
man, ordering well what they do ill, as in the hardning of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart he offereth occaſions which may as well be
tak<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n by the right ear as the left, withholdeth the grace
which he is not bound to give, excites and confirms that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity
which is naturall,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21. 28.</note> gives them up to a minde void of
judgement, to do things which are not convenient, who
have pleaſure in unrighteouſnes,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 10. 11. 12.</note> that they may be filled with
the fruit of their own doings, which is juſt, &amp; all this while,
as Chriſt ſaith by the devils when they ſpeak a lie,<note place="margin">Nec enim lex aequior ulla &amp;c.</note> ſo it muſt
be ſaid of the children of wickednes when they do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>They do it of their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His working is not confounded with theirs, and therefore
his purity not blended with their ungodlineſſe, nor their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
blanched by his juſtice, more then the beams
of the ſunne and the ſteame and ſtinch of the dunghill in the
exhalation.<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>His work is perfect, for all his wayes are Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
A God of truth and without iniquity, iuſt and right is he.
They have currupted themſelves.</hi> And this is the glory of his
holineſſe.</p>
            <p>And in this caſe the manner and courſe of government in
the kingdomes of the Earth may not unfitly be compared to
the muſick of an Organ, where the men like the pipes yeeld
the ſound, the inſpiration of the almighty, like the winde in
the ſound-board, gives the life, or the activity, and the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or the beauty of the order is by his diſpoſing, and if there
be a falſe or an harſh note, the fault is in the pipe, and not in
him who ſets and playes.</p>
            <p>And even theſe diſorders in goverment like ſome diſcords
in muſick, are by him ordered well, and for good.</p>
            <p>For though we ſometimes imagine that things would be
better if God were in the judgement, yet the contrary
would be confeſſed if either we did not of ignorance or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſſe
miſtake evil for good, and good for evil, we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weight at the common beam of opinion, and ſee with eyes
of fleſh as man ſeeth, whereas if we went into the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112955:7"/>
and meaſured all things by their conformity to the will of
God,<note place="margin">Etiam hoc bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Domine, quicquid divina majeſtas effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit id rectius et melius.</note> and judged of them by their referrence to his ends, in
ſtead of quarrelling and complaining we would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that every thing in providence were good, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be better, but whatſoever God doth is beſt.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, if we had the patience to waite the end of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Lord, or tarry till the fift <hi>Act</hi> and a Scene or two paſſe in that,
when things begin to concenter towards their iſſues; would
not ye condemn him of folly that upon the firſt motion of a
buſineſſe, or catching at ſome paſſage in a debate, ſhould go
away, and cenſure your proceedings before the matter were
ripe for the queſtion, why? ſo is he that judgeth before the
time.</p>
            <p>Surely if we underſtood the purpoſe of the onely wiſe
God, or could behold things in their tendency thitherward,
whereas now in our haſt we are apt to charge God with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 17.</note> and ſay to him, What doeſt thou? we would condemn
our ſelves or brutiſh fooliſhneſſe and adore the depths of that
wiſdom,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> and thoſe wayes that we are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
            <p>Or thirdly, if we had the largeneſſe of heart to behold in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
one view the whole ſyſteme of government, or if like <hi>Lucian</hi>
his <hi>Icaromenippus</hi> we could get on high and have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the whole ſeries of order all together; poſſibly now
while we look upon ſome one particular man or ſome one
cauſe, and ſome few providences about thoſe, abſtracted or
divided from the reſt, we may think it were better for them
if it were otherwiſe with them, but if we knew all or could
conſider that which is done in the reference to the whole,<note place="margin">Propter ordinem univerſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

we would diſcern and agree that the preſent ſtate were the
beſt;<note place="margin">Read 1 Cor. 12. verſe 4 and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> it might be better for every common ſouldier as to his
individuall, if he were a Commander, but it cannot be ſo for
the Army, for as in the naturall body, ſo in the body politique,
if the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing, &amp;c.
there muſt be diſproportion &amp; inequality, &amp; difference of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations,

commandeth in chief, and him that hath but a particular
charge. He that compoſeth a ſong of many parts, muſt not
carry on the muſick ſo full in every part as he that ſets but for
one voyce; if a gardener had but the care of ſome one plant
to husband it to perfection, he were bound to tend it for the
fulleſt advantage of its growth, but when he hath the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a garden or an orchard, he muſt ſlip and prune and cut
ſome plants, and foſter and manure, and ſuffer others to luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate
and run out as much as they can, that there may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Or laſtly, if we would diſtinguiſh of times. Before the ſin
and fall of man, while there was no breach between God and
our firſt parents, there was a quiet uniformity in all the world
like the glory of Heaven ſhadowed in the ſerenity of the
upper region of the Air; and if men had continued in their
innocency, there would have been in all the World as there
was in Paradiſe, a very heaven upon earth; but now ſince
the curſe, the whole Creation being ſubjected to vanity, and
travailing in pain together, till it be delivered from the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of corruption, no wonder if it be ill with men, and they be
made to groane under much miſery, when all the diſorder
that is in the World is for their ſinne and for their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Numb. 23. 21.</note> when <hi>God beholds no iniquitie in a Land, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe

and every man may ſit quietly under his Vine and

againſt him, and vexe his holy Spirit, and he become their
enemy,</hi> who ſhall be offended; If He breake the Tables, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Glory, call them forth to Iudgement, and put the
Staffe, or the Sword of his indignation into the hands of
men, and give them a charge to doe execution upon one
another; eſpecially if the Gods will judge unjuſtly, and will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112955:8"/>
not underſtand, but walke on in darkneſſe, leſſe cannot be
expected, but that God ſhould ariſe to judge the earth, and
all things with good juſtice on his part be turned out of
courſe. Even amongſt men, when a Kingdome is divided
within it ſelfe by the wickedneſſe of evill Counſellors, and
the madneſſe of a diſtempered people; a Parliament may
doe many things in maintaining a warre, impoſing of taxes,
impriſoning of perſons, and ſequeſting of eſtates, in that
juncture of time excuſable, nay juſtifiable, by the ſupreame
Law, which at another time all the world, even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
would condemne as moſt unjuſt. Doe but take this
into the Mount of transfiguration, and we ſhall inſtantly lay
our hands upon our mouthes, and glorifie God and be
thankfull: whereas now we murmur and complaine there
is ſo much diſorder; we may ſtand amazed, and bleſſe God
there is ſo little.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> But I need not plead for God, nor give
in evidence for the Iudge of all the earth; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is a conſcience in man, both him that offendeth,
and him that is offended at it, which condemnes the guilty,
and juſtifieth God when he is judged.</p>
            <p>There is but another difficulty that lies in our way to
hinder our paſſage, and that is a conceit of the impoſſibility
of this thing, becauſe of the multiplicitie of operations, and
diverſities of adminiſtrations in a world of places, in every
moment of time. The Anſwer is, that if the occaſions be
various and manifold, ſuppoſe them infinite; God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
alſo; and there is the ſame proportion of infinite to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
that there is of one to one: if one man can doe one
worke, and ye being many, may be held ſufficient for the
many concernments of the numerous people of the whole
Land; perhaps of the three Kingdomes, where the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of perſons are thouſands, many ten thouſands more
then your ſelves, why ſhould it be marvell in our eyes that
one God of <hi>immenſe being,</hi> whoſe perfections are his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſhould be able every where, among all men, <hi>to worke
all in all:</hi> Doth not Nature teach us that the Sunne hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112955:9"/>
upon all creatures within the Firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and is a concurrent cauſe to their being and activitie;
now if this may be affirmed of the creature, how much
more may the other be beleeved of the <hi>Almightie Creator?</hi>
and this is the praiſe of his <hi>All ſufficiencie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the imagination of ſome men, who meaſuring
the glory of God, by the vanitie of man, doe therefore
judge it unworthy of ſuch a <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to ſtoope beneath the
decreeing in the counſell of his owne will, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
of ſuch things by his word, to the working and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of every or <hi>ſome</hi> particulars by his owne hand; it is
ſcarce worth the mentioning, for men but make a vertue of

            <p>Having thus ſpread and opened the Doctrine, and made
the light of it cleare and evident, we may now goe on to
the confirmation and demonſtration of the truth thereof;
for which purpoſe if any further proofe be required then
what hath already been alledged occaſionally,</p>
            <p>1. We may ſee it very plainely in that emblematicall
Viſion repreſented in the firſt of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> where <hi>the living
creatures</hi> that ſtood by wheeles, and were commanded by
the voyce, and moved by the Spirit of him that ſate upon

               <hi>had the likeneſſe of a man, and they had the hands
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112955:9"/>
of a man under their wings on their foure ſides, and they foure
had the face of a man;</hi> as of other creatures, to ſignifie this;
that the ordering of humane affaires is a great part, the
greateſt part of God in the adminiſtrations of providence;
and if this thing had not beene comprehended in it, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had not ſerved for that end for which it was exhibited,
<hi>viz.</hi> the confirming of the faith, and corroborating of the
ſpirit of the Prophet, that he might preach the things to
be revealed to him, with the greater confidence, and more
full aſſurance; becauſe the accompliſhment and effecting
of them depended much upon the managing, and the iſſues
of government among men.</p>
            <p>2. We may read it at large in many particular inſtances,
<hi>Iob 12. verſ.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Job 12. 16.</note> and from the ſixteenth verſ. to the end of
the Chapter: Who knoweth not in all theſe, that the hand
of the Lord hath wrought this? <hi>with him is ſtrength and
wiſdome, the deceiver and the deceived are his; he leadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Counſellors ſpoiled, and maketh the Iudges fooles; he
looſeth the bond of Kings, and girdeth their loines with a
girdle; he leadeth away Princes ſpoiled, and overthroweth the
mighty: he removeth away the ſpeech of the truſty, and taketh
away the underſtanding of the aged; he poureth contempt upon
Princes, and weakeneth the ſtrength of the mighty; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth
deep things out of darkneſſe, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> The rule, and
the power, and the skill of government is of the Lord;
and there happeneth nothing, whether among the wiſe
and prudent, but even the wicked and crafty, and ſuch are
ſeduced by their evill counſels, or over-reached by their
wiles; ſo that nothing is done but he reſtraines it within
certaine bounds, and reduceth it to his ends according to
his moſt juſt and holy will. But there needs no Paraphraſe,

               </note> Whence els
was it, that their Lawgivers pretended to have received all
their rules of Government out of ſome divine hand? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
there was ſome religion in their ſuperſtition, and ſome
truth in their very fables. Heare one of them ſpeake for all
the reſt, what their faith of this was: <hi>Flatter we our ſelves
as much as we pleaſe, yet we have not overcome the</hi> Spaniards
<hi>by number; nor the</hi> French <hi>by ſtrength; nor the</hi> Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<hi>by craft; nor the</hi> Greeks <hi>by wiles; but by Piety and
Religion: and by this onely wiſdome, that we have diſcerned,
and doe acknowledge that all things are governed by the power
of Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a law of nature concerning it, and men
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112955:11"/>
ſhew their workes of that law written in their hearts by
an univerſall abhorrencie of Anarchie, and ſubmitting
themſelves to Authoritie, rather Tyranny we ſay then
Anarchy; Better live where nothing is lawfull, then where
every thing; neither have there any where, or at any time,
beene found ſuch ſonnes of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> as have deſire to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
without a Ruler among them. In the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
and Rebellions, nothing more hath beene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
then a change of Government; the very <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
themſelves erected a government among themſelves, and
made themſelves a King. Thus the currencie of it through
the world ſheweth ſomething more then Gods Image and
ſuperſcription upon it; for though poſſibly the baſeneſſe
of ſome people may have given occaſion to ſome perſons
to put a yoake upon them; or ambition of ſome <hi>Nimrod</hi>
may have incited him to uſurpe Authoritie over others; the
arts and inſinuations of crafty men may have introduced it
in ſome places; the pompe and luſtre of Magiſtracie may
have ſet it up in other; and the benefit thereof by a
benigne and prudent adminiſtration of it, may have made
many willing to beare the burthens of it; yet conſidering
what an humour of libertie and Independencie; what an
itch of being Gods to themſelves runs in the corrupt bloud
of all man-kinde by nature, it is impoſſible to imagine that
all Nations from the beginning; nay all men in all their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
ſhould of themſelves ſtoope to government, and
yeeld it honour and ſubjection, unleſſe God were in the
judgement. It is an Argument like that of the Apoſtle, for
the greatneſſe of the myſterie of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>without controverſie,</hi> or by univerſall conſent, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that diverſe kinde or degree of honour which
waits upon men in authority, according as they uſe it well
or ill, ſpeakes ſomething to this purpoſe; Honour goeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
along with Power, as the ſhadow followeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but evil men that tranſgreſſe in the judgement, receive it
blended with contempt or hatred, or baſe fear, or flattery,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112955:12"/>
and with much diminution, but ſuch as are good and do good
have it caſt upon them with love and reverence, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of affection. Wicked Magiſtrates and corrupt Officers
are worſhipped, as the devil by the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> that they
may not doe them miſchief; but the juſt and godly men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gods own heart, are clothed upon with ſome of the raies
of Gods own Majeſty. Certainly the hearts of men would
never after this manner be drawne to or from them that
judge in the earth, unleſſe he that ſitteth in the Heavens did
judge amongſt them, more then the needle in the compaſſe
would turn to or from a piece of Iron, if it did not act by the
vertue of the Loadſtone that had toucht it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this is yet made more manifeſt (as the heat of
the Sunn in the reflection) by the difference of the ſpirits of
publique perſons and private men, in the ſame men, in the
place of Power and out of that relation. Private perſons are
ſelf centered like clods of the earth, and their providence is
like that of the Piſmire, a wiſe and induſtrious creature for it
ſelf, but many times miſchievous to the garden or orchard
where it is harbored: but publique perſons are turned <hi>into
other men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 6.</note> and have a publique ſpirit, as <hi>Saul</hi> when he was
anointed to be King; and the ſeventy Elders called to aſſiſt
<hi>Moſes</hi> to the government. I appeal to your ſelves, had you
ſuch thoughts, ſuch cares, ſuch deſignes, your mindes ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
ſo reſolved, ſo prepared, ſo fixed before you were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to be <hi>Truſters</hi> for your Countries, as ſince you came to
ſit in Parliament? I do not ſay every man is thus affected, the
more is the pity, but this I ſay, commonly and for the more
part there is an affection ſutable to the relation. And this alſo
ſheweth God amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the raiſing or ſinking, the enlarging or ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their hearts according to the work of God in hand,
or about to be done, doth as manifeſtly argue the working of
God in them, as the uneve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe of activity in the limbs doth
prove the animating and the moving of the body by the ſoul,
or the inequality of valour and ſtrength in <hi>Shamgar, Gideon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:112955:12"/>
Samſon</hi> and other the Iudges and Worthies of old did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that the <hi>Spirit of God came upon them, and did move
them at times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, there is ſome further evidence and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this in the libertie, the confidence, the peace, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
the heaven on the one hand, and again on the other the
pendulouſneſſe, the fears, the jealouſies, the very hell that is
in mens conſciences as they leſſe or more conſcienciouſly or
as I may ſo ſpeak, with the minde that is in God, ſerve their
generations, or do for, or againſt him, or the dictates of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
with them, <hi>The righteous is bold as the Lion, but the
wicked flies when no man purſues.</hi> But I ſhall not need to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
Scripture or give an inſtance for this,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>when every mans
conſcience beares witneſſe to it, their thoughts accuſing or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, It may be perceived by the ſlumbering or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening
of an expectation in men generally, and chiefly by
the inclination or diſpoſition of the hearts of the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers
towards God in prayer, according as any great
change is to be made in the kingdomes of the World.</p>
            <p>When things are to continue in one ſtay, there is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
any unuſuall ſtirring in mens ſpirits; but when the
Lord is about to take up a controverſie, and enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with a Nation, then mens hearts begin to fail them for
feare, and their ſpirits ſhrink up and ſtart back with miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and preſagings of evil to come, and if the time of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
be not yet, there is an indiſpoſition to, and heartleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even ſuch as wait for the viſion withhold
prayer,<note place="margin">Job 15. 4.</note> not of hypocriſie or ſelf-guiltineſſe, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Job,</hi> but as by a reſtraint upon their ſpirits by ſomething
from without, as if the Lord were forbidding them to pray.
But if the ſalvation be drawing nigh, though there be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it, nor can one diſern any probability of ſuch a
thing in the ſignes of the times, yet there is a ſpirit of grace
and ſupplication poured out upon them, and their ſoules are
drawne forth as to meet the Lord, and ſalute, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112955:13"/>
their mercies; and they reach forth their hearts in an
earneſt expectation of ſome good; <hi>and ſpeake one to another.</hi>
And if God be carrying on a worke in favour of his Church,
though many croſſe providences intervene, yet they ſend
up <hi>fervent effectuall</hi> prayers; they multiply prayers as the
Cocks crow thick towards the morning, and they follow
on to ſeek the Lord, and give him no reſt till he heare them;
as we read in the ſtories of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah.</hi>
I doubt not but many of us can remember ſome
yeares ſince, when men bare rule over us at their pleaſures,
and the meaſure of their iniquity was not yet full, and the
judgement was ſtill in brewing; with what an Aſinine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
we bore all oppreſſions, and couched downe like
<hi>Iſſachar</hi> betweene the burdens, and thought that reſt was
good, and had no heart to lift up a prayer: but a little before
the wheele began to turn, and ſince the Lord remembred
mercy in wrath, and revived his worke, and made us ſee
our tokens again, who hath not found himſelf as going
bound in the ſpirit to take hold upon the Name of the Lord,
to wreſtle with him by prayer and ſupplication? and who
may not have obſerved the alterations in affairs to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
very apparently this diſpoſition of heart towards
God? Now what ever other men think of theſe things, it
plainly ſeems to me, that as the flying of the fowle, and the
going of the cattell into their ſhelters before a ſtorme; and
their coming forth again about the breaking of it away,<note place="margin">Job 36.</note> 
               <hi>doth
ſhew concerning the vapour;</hi> ſo this different frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of ſpirit in men about ſuch ſeaſons, and in ſuch junctures
of times, doth declare concerning that Divine influence
whereof we are now ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Eightly, though we cannot make obſervation of the time
and way of Gods illapſe upon men and their actions, yet
there is ſomething obſervable in the manner of the bringing
in and carrying on of things that ſhew an higher hand then
mans in the work. I mean the many various accidentall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
of providences, very chances as men term them,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112955:13"/>
that create ſeaſons and advantages for ſeverall purpoſes and
ſtart occaſions, and miniſter opportunities for Counſells, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the admirable ballancing of affaires, caſting of
the ſcales, now on this ſide, then on that, ſometimes interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
confounding, preventing, diſappointing, and tumbling
of Counſells headlong; at other times reviving, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
incouraging and proſpering of parties and cauſes that
any man may ſee it is done on purpoſe, that there may be
time and place for ſuch judgements as none but God can do,
that he may get him a Name. Now though we doe not
much mark theſe things in the inſtant of time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
yet if we caſt our thoughts backe, and bring times paſt
into obſervation, we muſt needs make this judgement, that
the things which God firſt cauſeth to come to paſſe, do offer
the thoughts, and uſher in the devices, and lead on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of men all along in all their windings from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the ending: and conſequently be convinced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>this,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> was for himſelfe when the ſignes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 6, 7.</note> whereof the <hi>Seer</hi> had foretold him, <hi>That God
was with him, and the Spirit of God was come upon him, and
directed him to doe as the occaſion ſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, This <hi>inviſible working power and Godhead of
God is made very viſible,</hi> and may be clearly ſeen in the iſſues
and events of mens counſells and actions; compare them
with their next cauſes, the inſtruments and meanes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the worke, and they will be found many times ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
to them, ſo utterly unlike, ſo farre ſhort or
beyond, ſo much beſide or contrary to the intentions of the
actors, and the expectation of all men, many of them ſuch
marvellous works, ſo <hi>fearefully and wonderfully done,</hi> as it is
very hard to diſcerne whence they aroſe, or how they came
to paſſe. We cannot think ſeriouſly of ſome of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
admiration,<note place="margin">Pſa. 126. 1, 2, 3.</note> as the people when the captivity of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

was turned; and the very enemies are ſometimes forced to

               <hi>The Lord fighteth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112955:14"/>
for them.</hi> Might I but have the libertie to preach as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did of old, or to make a rehearſall of the great workes
of God done of late amongſt our ſelves,<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 2.</note> as ſometimes <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Joſhua</hi> did before the people.<note place="margin">Ioſhua 24.</note> Nothing were more
eaſie then to line this as all the reſt of the obſervations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned with examples out of our owne Storie.
When the Service booke was firſt impoſed upon our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the firſt reading thereof was ſo
violently oppoſed by the rude multitude; did either partie
ſo much as foreſee or forethinke, what hath followed upon
it ever ſince? Who put it into the minds of thoſe Souldiers
who were firſt raiſed for the North, at the ſame time in
every corner of the Land to make an attempt, and give
the firſt overture of a Reformation? How came the wheele
to be turned in this Kingdome, as in the beginning of this
Parliament, when no one man was removed out of place
or favour? when the Kings Councell adviſed him to call a
Parliament, had they contrived the remedy of ſo many
grievances, the making of ſuch Acts and Ordinances, the
diſcovery of ſuch deeds of darkeneſſe, the promoving of a
Reformation thus far, with many other happy births of the
preſent Parliament. When they counſeld him to come into
the Houſe, and demand the Honourable Members of it, to
ſet up his Standard and levie warre againſt his own people,
and to publiſh ſuch Declarations as have been ſent abroad in
the world, did they purpoſe the ſecurity of the Parliament,
the alienating of the hearts of the people from their faction,
the loſſe of the lives of ſo many great perſons of their owne
partie, the ingaging of the two Kingdomes, in a ſolemne
League and Covenant, the provoking and incouraging of the
City of <hi>London,</hi> and other aſſociated Counties to unite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves for their owne ſafety and the reliefe of
others, had they plotted theſe or almoſt any other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of thoſe deſperate counſels. When Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
went to <hi>York</hi> and marched out again to <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> did
he intend the Routing and Ruining of his own Army, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112955:14"/>
thoſe that he had drawne forth to joyne with him, that the
City of <hi>Yorke</hi> might be the ſooner ſurrendred, and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
reduced, and the ſtrength of the King be broken in
thoſe Northerne parts for ſo much advantage to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Doubtleſſe your thoughts cannot but outrun me, and
prevent me the naming of a world of other things that have
happened both in counſell and in warre, both within your
owne walles, and in every corner of the Kingdome, which
if they be layd by their occaſions, or by the men and means
whereby they have beene done, will either be ſuch as they
that had to doe about them, will bee unwilling to heare of
them, aſhamed to own them, or elſe too great, too high to
be aſcribed to the policy or the power of men. Now ſuch
occurrences as theſe,<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 4.</note> are <hi>bright beames out of his hand, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of his power,</hi> the ſparklings and ſhinings forth of the
Majeſty of God, accommodated to our capacity, that by
occaſion of ſuch unlikely and unlooked for events, our eyes
may be drawne upwards to take notice of his glory in the
governing of the world. They are like to wonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
in other Providences, and have the ſame uſe. We may
read it,<note place="margin">Iſai. 41. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Iſai. 41. 18, 19, 20. I will open rivers in high places,

pooles of water, or ſee trees that need much moyſture,
to grow in a dry and ſandy deſert; but I will ſtep out of the
common round, ſaith God, and doe ſome things unuſuall,
<hi>That they may ſee and know and conſider and underſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

ſuch an agreement of them with the rule, the prophecies,
the promiſes, and the threatnings in the Scriptures; ſuch a
correſpondency with the wayes of God of old, the paths of
mercy and truth wherein he was wont to be ſeen to walk,
ſuch an analogy with the Nature and Attributes of the Lord,
ſuch praeludes and praeſages of his judgement to come,
as though <hi>a brutiſh man will not know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 6.</note> 
               <hi>nor a fool underſtand
this,</hi> yet, <hi>whoſo is wiſe and will obſerve theſe things,</hi> he will
fall down and give the glory to God, and acknowledge that
God is among the gods. Verily there is a God that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            </p>
            <p>I will adde but two or three more, which are very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
though we ſeldome take any notice of them; they are
theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the concurrence of many cauſes to one effect. There
is not any thing done amongſt men but if we were ſo eagle-eyed
as to ſee farre, and eſpye quickly, and look ſteadily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us, but we might diſcern a fore-preparation and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
of things to it, a complication, and combination
of multitudes of men and meanes without any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
of Counſells working about it; but in ſome things it
is more remarkable then others, as the bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
down into <hi>Egypt;</hi> the avenging of the quarrell of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
upon his own people by carrying them away into
<hi>Babylon;</hi> the deſtruction of that Monarchy; the turning of
the captivity: and in leſſe generall matters, the chaſtiſing of
<hi>David</hi> for the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> the reſcuing of <hi>Mordecai</hi>
and the people from the bloody plot of <hi>Haman,</hi> &amp; what not?
Now doe but ponder theſe things adviſedly, and all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Poets and the fables of the Legend may be
ſooner beleeved then that theſe things come to paſſe by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
without the texture of a Divine hand working ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
in the weaving of every web. When many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112955:15"/>
go out ſeverall wayes, no one of them haply privy to
anothers thoughts, and doe after a while meet together in
one place and time about one and the ſame errand, it cannot
be otherwiſe thought but that ſome one hand had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over them all, and directed the whole buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the order and peace that ſometimes hath been
in the earth, and may yet poſſibly be again. Peace is the
tranquillity of Order; that there ſhould be Order amongſt
ſuch multitudes of perſons, is more then a Miracle: There are
(it may be) ſo many millions of men in a Nation, all of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
opinions &amp; affections, acting by different principles to ſelf
ends, moſt of them ignorant and unskilfull, nay wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſſe

            <p>We may looſe our ſelves in the multiplying of arguments
of this nature; I have named a few amongſt an infinitie, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
many others far more pregnant and pertinent may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themſelves to your thoughts; the multitude of them
makes the choyce difficult to me, nothing is harder then
when one walkes on the beache by the ſea ſide to finde the
faireſt ſhore. Take all or any of them, and there is enough to
convince an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> not onely that there is a God, but that
<hi>He iudgeth among the Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ye now require the ground of this diſpenſation, <hi>viz:</hi>
Why the Lord ſhould rule in and by men, rather then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his own throne and judge in his own Majeſtie alone by
himſelf, like that Miracle of Nature which doth more by the
Iron wherewith it is armed, then by its own body without
it; The reaſon is, not any neceſſity of Nature, or defect of
power in God, as in Princes; but meerly the good pleaſure
of his will, the ſuperabundance of his goodneſſe in favour
and condeſcenſion to man.</p>
            <p>If God ſhould judge immediately, the judgement would
be more dreadfull and terrible, we could not bear the glory,
we ſhould be ſwallowed up of the Majeſty: we may gueſſe
as much by ſome paſſages in ſtory of old, when God kept
the matter of government more in his own hand then now,
particularly by that which we read in the 19 of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 16.</note> and
5 of <hi>Deut.</hi> when He gave the Law on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> there
were <hi>thundrings and lightnings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 24. 25.</note> 
               <hi>and a thick cloud and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the whole mount did quake and burn with fire, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the people trembled, and the Elders drew neer to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and ſaid, Behold, the Lord our God hath ſhewed us his glory
and his greatneſſe, this great fire will conſume us: If we hear
the voyce of the Lord our God any more, then ſhall we die. And
ſo terrible was the ſight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 21.</note> 
               <hi>as Moſes ſaid, I quake and fear.</hi> Now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112955:16"/>
if the pomp of the promulgation of the Law was ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
(and leſſe it could not be conſidering the Majeſty of
the <hi>King, the Law-giver and the Judge)</hi> what may we
think would be the terrours of the <hi>Aſſiſes</hi> and <hi>Seſſions,</hi> while
God ſhould frequently ariſe to judgement and execution?</p>
            <p>If God ſhould not judge by men, there could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that connivence and moderation in the judgement,
that now is by the indulgence of men of like paſſions and
compaſſions towards one another; and I think the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks ſomething to this purpoſe in that paſſage in
<hi>Exodus 33. 3. I will ſend an Angel before thee, but I will not
go up in the midſt of thee, for thou art a ſtiff-neeked people, leſt
I deſtroy thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly the Government thus carried is much more
convenient and accommoded to our preſent condition and
relations: we could not meet, and cloſe, and paſſe, and part
on all occaſions with ſo little diſadvantage to our nature and
ſociety; if they that bear rule, and they that are in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were not all of a kinde, as the greater and leſſer wheels in

               </note> whereas now the communion is
is ſmoothed and ſweetned, and love and charity the eaſier

unto which they are obliged and ingaged by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer in the clearing and confirming of
the doctrine, both becauſe it is ſcarcely beleeved, or but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regarded, though commonly confeſſed, and almoſt hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpoken of, and becauſe there is hardly another truth in all
the Bible of more common concernment, or more generall
uſe, while we live in this world, then this of my Text.</p>
            <p>Like a picture drawn to the life, it caſts an eye every way
upon every perſon in any relation, and almoſt upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
and buſineſſe; And it is very big and full of matter,
<hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

            </p>
            <p>Among other things it layes a ſure foundation for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

and power of Magiſtracy, even in the matters of God,
and plainely holds forth as ſacred and divine, and not to be

               <hi>ſenſuall, not having the

manifeſtly doe the workes of the fleſh: They plead for
libertie, but it is licentiouſneſſe; libertie of conſcience they
terme it, but it is libertie of practiſe, that every man may do
what is good and right in his owne eyes: They pretend to
nothing but pietie and godlines, and ſeeme as if they would
be content if they might but have a bare ſubſiſtence in the
profeſſion of it. So did the Ieſuites to learning when they
they firſt appeared upon the ſtage, but when they had once
inſinuated themſelves into the good opinion of Princes and
States, how well they anſwered the expectations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
the kindneſſe of thoſe who nurſed them up, all the
Chriſtian world ſees and feels to their coſt at this day. They
aske but connivence and toleration, but if they once meet in
a confluence, and finde themſelves ſtrong enough to run in a
ſtreame; let but a damme be pitcht downe to reſtraine or
oppoſe their madneſſe, or men follow not on to indulge and
gratifie their humour, it would ſoon appear whether or no
they would rage and ſwell and get over, or beare downe
afore them all that ſhould ſtand in their way. They did ſeem
a while to cry up the <hi>Order of Parliaments,</hi> and of the <hi>civill
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112955:17"/>
Magiſtrate,</hi> and have their perſons in admiration, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for advantage, that ſo they may get above all <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Authority;</hi> and when they are once up to their height,
what they will doe with the ladder, the hope to climbe and
aſcend by, is not hard to conjecture; they reckon themſelves
the wheat in the field, and when once they are ripe, they
will eaſily be content to have all that threſhed off, by which
they received their growth. Yee have heard of the fable of
the ſnake and the countryman that brought it unto the fire.
I ſhall not need to apply it, already they begin to remove the
old land-markes and ſtraiten their bounds, they deny your
claime up to a high water marke, and make their bankes, and
incloſe for themſelves to the very channell ſide: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be holden fit or ſeaſonable that theſe Libertines be
decried; for my part I cannot yet diſcover by any activeneſſe
to ſuppreſſe them: Onely ſeeing the evill and fore-ſeeing

to an extreame hazard or diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>But the time admoniſheth mee to ſet aſide many things
that might be inferred out of this text by way of application,
&amp; betake my ſelf only to the work of the day, to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of repentance and amendment of life. That ſuch uſe
may be made of this doctrine, is more then manifeſt. Hee
that runnes may read it, in the following part of the Pſalm.
And though I may not take the boldnes to divide this porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

you, within you, if upon occaſion of any thing that

I profeſſe in the preſence of God, whoſe meſſenger you

not forbeare that libertie. Yee have given mee no cauſe to

railing accuſations, if not againſt your ſelves and <hi>your owne

command are ſubſervient and aſſiſtant to you in adviſe, and
the parties, and their fautors, making their libertie a cloake
of maliciouſneſſe, out-dare complaints, and think to out-face
juſtice, by fore arraigning it under the term of Perſecution:
But I abhorre their impudence, and cannot praiſe your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence.
My conſcience would flie in my face, if I ſhould

ye need not after ſo many Sermons, ſo many moneths and
yeares of faſting and prayer, that one teach you again which
be the firſt rudiments and elements of this holy Ordinance
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112955:18"/>
of God. I know <hi>ye all have knowledge.</hi> I beſeech you onely
ſuffer a word of Exhortation, not ſo much to the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the worke of God in governing the Kingdomes of
the world, (though that alſo be a dutie the Text leads to, and
indeed the matter is fitter for contemplation then diſcourſe)
as to the acknowledgement of the hand of God in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate of affairs in this Kingdome, and the humbling and
applying of our ſelves unto him, as his word directs in like
caſes:<note place="margin">Mala ultoria Tertul.</note> 
               <hi>For if hee iudgeth among the Gods,</hi> then both the <hi>good</hi>

And as if there were order and peace, wee were to reckon
them his bleſſings, and offer the ſacrifices of praiſe, which is
the work of a day of Thankſgiving; ſo when there is warre
in the gates, and confuſion and every evill worke, it muſt be
confeſſed <hi>the iudgement of God,</hi> and we muſt come, <hi>and ſit
trembling before him, and ſearch out the provocation, lay our
hands upon &amp; confeſſe the treſpas over the head of the ſacrifice,
pray in his pardon and break off our ſins by righteouſneſſe, that
there may be atonement,</hi> which is the buſineſſe and end of a
day of Humiliation; and this is that which I principally aime
at in the Application of this doctrine at this time.</p>
            <p>Wee need not one to come and tell us, <hi>There is wrath
gone out from the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 21. 25.</note> 
               <hi>the plague is begun, hee hath powred
out upon us the fury of his anger and the ſtrength of the battell,
and it hath ſet us on fire round about.</hi> Onely, wee have not
regarded it nor laid it to heart. <hi>A ſword, a ſword is ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and alſo furbiſhed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The point of it is ſet againſt the gates,
and the ruines are multiplyed.</hi> But I ſhall not ſpread the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of our Story before you, doubtleſſe the roule like that
of the Prophet <hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               <hi>written within and without,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 21.</note> 
               <hi>lumentations,
mourning and woe,</hi> hath beene often read in your eares, and
ye ought to know the ſtate of the land, and the Church of
God therein, and without queſtion ye doe know it, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and the cry from all quarters comming firſt to your
Cognizance, allow mee but to ſay this <hi>(that I may ſtirre up
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112955:19"/>
your minds by way of remembrance)</hi> that the ſorrows <hi>of a
travelling woman are yet upon us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and we ſtay ſtill in the place
of the breaking forth of children:</hi> what ever Balme or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
there may be amongſt us, the health of the Nation is
not recovered; and whether the wound and the bruiſe be
incurable as refuſing to be healed, God knoweth. Though
the Lord hath revived his worke of late very miraculouſly
beyond all expectation, and from the beginning hitherto
hath mingled mercy with judgement; yet one cannot
fore-ſee any thing in the ſignes of the times whereby we
may be able to fore-tell the end of the Lord; at leaſt as to
the ſeaſon and manner of it. The cloud ſtill hangs and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
rather then waſteth; and there is a ſound of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of wrath: it is not an eaſie thing to diſcerne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord <hi>will debate with us in the ſending forth of the
rod or ſword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and ſtay the rough wind in the day of the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind:</hi>
that is, chaſtiſe in meaſure, moderate the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not coming to a rigorous account, but uſe the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Father, not of a Iudge, and give us repentance and
remiſſion of ſinnes: or whether he hath decreed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and will bring an overflowing ſcourge, and his
eye not pity nor ſpare, but deſtroy us til there be no remnant
nor eſcaping: Whether he be ſtriving with us, as with the
old world before the generall Deluge; or carrying on his
worke as with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, preparing a mercy
for poſteritie after us, the meane while reſolved to fill all
the earth with his glory in the deſtruction of the preſent
generation that ſee his wonders, yet tempt him daily, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
againſt him, grieve his Spirit, and harden their
hearts through unbelief; or whether he wil yet have mercy
upon <hi>England,</hi> and redeeme us through his greatneſſe, for
his owne Names ſake: If we looke upwards, we may ſee
a filthy ſteame of noyſome ſinnes going up unto heaven, as
the ſmoake over ſome great Citie, and we may behold the
<hi>hand of the Lord ſtretched out ſtill:</hi> if downward, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
is not abated, but multiplied and aggravated: we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112955:19"/>
are like the <hi>pot whoſe ſcumme is in it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 6. 13</note> 
               <hi>whoſe ſcumme is not
gone out of it; there is lewdneſſe in the filthineſſe of the Land.
Becauſe God hath purged it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and it is not purged; he hath
ſmitten it, and they have not grieved; he hath conſumed them,
but they have refuſed to receive correction, and to returne.</hi>
We are growne deafe at the terrours of Gods judgements,
and ſleep under the ſparklings of his fury. The providences
of God are wreſted, though they be not very hard to be
underſtood, and many abuſe them, as they doe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
to the deſtruction of themſelves and others; the
grace of God is received in vaine, or rather turned into
wantonneſſe; the yoake of Ceremonies, and the tyrannie
of Prelacy hath beene removed, and it is free to preach and
profeſſe according to the Goſpel; and this libertie is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to looſeneſſe, profaneneſſe, and inſolencie; that which
is, or ſhould be the better part of the Land, that pretends
to religion, and hath the face or name of the Church, it is
like a piece of ground that hath beene ſtirred by the Plough,
and the tils-man doth not follow on to give it more earths
in due ſeaſon; it runs out in weeds and baggage: or as a
field which is driven, and the heart of it worne out, what
ever ſeed is caſt in, it returnes nothing but Carlock,
and ſuch like raffe; all manner Sectaries creepe forth, and
multiplie, as frogs, and flies, and vermine in the Spring;
and there <hi>is variance, hatred, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hereſies, envyings, revilings, and the like.</hi> Every where
there is mingled a perverſeneſſe of ſpirit, like the Prophets
bottles,<note place="margin">Jer. 13. 13.</note> 
               <hi>we are filled with drunkenneſſe, and daſh one againſt
another:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 22.</note> lying ſpirits goe forth to deceive and prevaile,
and make us mad upon our owne deſtruction. As to the
civill warre; it is juſt now as of old, in the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> where families were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and brother fought againſt brother, and father againſt
ſonne; every man cryed out of the unnaturalneſſe of the
thing, but every man went on ſtill to doe it.</p>
            <p>As to the differences and diviſions about matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112955:20"/>
they are raiſed, and fomented, and maintained with
great animoſitie, and of boaſting of new light, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but with little or no charitie, or meekneſſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
they that pretend for conſcience ſake to ſeparate
from our ordinarie aſſemblies, and keepe their diſtance
from their members, yet will not be perſwaded to divide
themſelves, and ſtand aſide, from thoſe routs of Libertines,
whom they cannot but condemne in their judgements, or
declare diſtinctly &amp; openly, wherin they diſſent from them
as from others: but all meete in one third, and militate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one <hi>colours,</hi> moſt apparently ſtriving for victorie, not
for truth; and driving a deſigne by party and faction, while
they would be thought to ſet up the Kingdome of Chriſt:
the meane while they give overt ſcandall and offence to
them that are without, and divide the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
within it ſelfe: and as the Congregations of naughty
men of old:<note place="margin">Pſal. 83.</note> 
               <hi>the Tabernacles of Edom and the Iſhmaelites
of Moab and the Haggarens, Gebal and Ammon, and Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi>
they have holpen the common Adverſarie, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and retarded the Reformation. <hi>Alas for the day,</hi> for
the diſtemper and the diſtraction is great; and there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
either power, or wiſdome, or will to remedie or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
theſe miſchefes, and their fautors. Now though we
can tell where the fault lieth, and whence all this evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth;
as we may ſometimes ſee from what dunghill, or
low mooriſh ground the vapour aſcends, which afterwards
becomes a miſt, a fogge, or a cloud, and is diſſolved in a
ſtorme; though we ſee not the influence of heaven, in the
exhalation; yet becauſe by faith we underſtand that <hi>this
cometh of the Lord, that he may be known by the iudgements
which he executeth.</hi> We muſt therefore make our peace
with God, and returne unto the Lord, and heare what he
ſpeakes by his former Prophets, and follow the light and
direction of his word, if ever we will have helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
or be hid in the times of trouble.</p>
            <p>Let us then leave quarelling, and judging, and cenſuring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112955:20"/>
one another; this is our folly, our diſeaſe, our miſchiefe: let
us look up to God, and judge our ſelves, and make haſt, and
delay not to turne our feete into the waies of his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
We have many baſe feares, and cares, and projects
wherewith we diſquiet our ſelves; it were our wiſdome,
and would be our ſafetie, to ceaſe from men, and feare the
Lord, and betake our ſelves to him. While the State is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in finding out the troublers of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delinquents to puniſhment, let us ſearch our owne
hearts and lives, and make enquiry after our owne iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
accuſe, arraigne, condemne our ſelves, and caſt out the
abominable thing; Impenitencie is the greateſt malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and the moſt dangerous. We are often very buſie and
inquiſitive about ſome perſons that doe not appeare over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active:
let every man firſt pluck the beame out of his
owne eye, and with the diſciples, ſuſpect himſelfe, <hi>Maſter,
Is it I?</hi> and aske as the Publicanes, and the Souldiers that
came out to heare <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: What ſhall we doe?
they that are much abroad, are little at home; thoſe that are
curious about others, are commonly careleſſe and negligent
about themſelves: we waſt our ſpirits in froward paſſions;
it were better we ſpent them in afflicting our ſoules, that
ſo much water may not runne by waſt and grinde nothing.
We know well enough there can never be a generall or
particular ſafety for all, or any, when there hath been ſuch
diſorders as of late, unleſſe there be a pardon, and an Act of
oblivion; therefore in all Pacifications that is one Article;
let us transferre the wiſdome hither, and ſeeke forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God firſt,<note place="margin">Jona. 3. 8, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>and cry mightily to the Lord; Who can tell,
if God will turne, and repent, and turne away from his fierce
anger, that we periſh not?</hi> There is much talke, and much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
about the new Modell. Oh that there were an heart in
every of us to get new hearts and right ſpirits; <hi>to put off the
old man, concerning the former converſation, which is corrupt
according to the deceitfull luſts, and be renewed in the ſpirit
of our minds; and put on the new man, which after God is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112955:21"/>
created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> It is held the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of a State when they are about an accommodation,
to take care for the ſecuring of ſuch perſons as they have
in jealouſie and may be dangerous, leſt they kindle the fire
anew, and it breake out againe to more miſchiefe: Let us
alſo be carefull to ſecure our owne deceitfull hearts, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
deceitfull, and wicked above meaſure; ſet a watch
over them, that we may be ſafe from their treacherie: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all keepings, keepe the heart; out of it come murders,
&amp;c. For that purpoſe let us bring them againe under new
engagements; let us renew our Covenants this day: we
had need doe it oft, and be oft put in mind to doe it; and to
keepe it when we have done. It is not yet time out of
mind of man, ſince a ſolemne Oath and Covenant was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and urged with much zeale upon all over whom there
was power; I doubt not but ye remember the grounds
and reaſons, with the manner of the carriage of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
I have heard ſome ſpeake as if they repented it, and
changed their judgements about the buſineſſe of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and there hath beene talke and hope of a forbearing
to preſſe it any more upon any new occaſions, or a conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence
at the refuſers, amounting to an inlargement from it:
reade the preface to it and wonder how ſuch dreames
ſhould come in any mans head. By what ill dint hath it
been ſo blaſted, as to have loſt its vertue or neceſſitie? or
upon what pretence can any amongſt us imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or be thought by others ſo formidable, or ſo confiding
as they muſt therefore for the ſake of libertie of conſcience
be left at large, or be looſed from it? if there be a realitie in
ſuch a fancie, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us:</hi> how ſhall the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
guilty of ſuch levitie ever anſwer it to God or the
world, or their owne conſciences; or the parties who have
beene already yoaked by it? one thing I am ſure of, that
whatſoever in it may be repented of, yet there is no ſhadow
or colour of cauſe to depart from this clauſe and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it: <hi>And becauſe theſe Kingdomes are guilty of many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112955:21"/>
ſinnes and provocations againſt God and his Sonne Ieſus
Chriſt, as is too manifeſt by our preſent diſtreſſes and dangers,
the fruits thereof: we profeſſe and declare before God and the
world, our unfained deſire to be humbled for our owne ſinnes,
and for the ſins of theſe Kingdomes—. And our true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
purpoſe, deſire, and endeavour for our ſelves, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
under our charge and power, both in publique and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
in all duties we owe to God and man, to amend our lives,
and each one to goe before another in the example of a reall
Reformation:</hi> It were wickedneſſe to decline ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and a ſnare after ſuch a vow to make enquirie. Let
every man therefore fortifie his purpoſes, his duty in this,
by entring bond anew this day: But remember what the
Preacher ſaith,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, deferre
not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in fooles: pay that which
thou haſt vowed, ſuffer not thy mouth to ſinne, neither ſay
thou before the Angel, It was an errour, wherefore ſhould
God be angry at thy voyce, and deſtroy the worke of thine
hands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may the better prevent a generall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding,
and promove an univerſall amendment, let us unite
and aſſociate (we that dwell in aſſociated Counties can
ſpeake of the benefit of Aſſociations by experience, and
therefore hope and pray the continuance thereof) that we
may ſo be mutually helpfull, and exhort one another daily,
may watch over each other, conſider one another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
to love and good works, and by good example may
light and lead on others; and ſo make the Reformation
more generall and more laſting.</p>
            <p>Thinke on theſe things; and if there be any other thing
which God cals us to in ſuch a ſeaſon as this; let us heare it
and know it for our ſelves: as Souldiers receive the word
of Command every man for himſelfe, not to jangle with
his fellow. Let us heare and doe it while it is called to
day. Let us ariſe and be doing.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially ye Honourable and beloved, for this matter
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112955:22"/>
belongeth unto you; we alſo will be with you; conſider
it and doe it.</p>
            <p>For firſt, were ye all in your owne perſons as free from
the offence as <hi>Moſes;</hi> could ye apologiſe for your ſelves
with <hi>Samuel;</hi> or waſh your hands in innocencie with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
yet when wrath is upon the Congregation, or the
ſtorme may be foreſeene in the vapour, the puniſhment in
the ſinne; you ought to rent your garments, and ſit downe
aſtoniſhed with <hi>Ezra,</hi> and deprecate the judgement with
<hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Ye know the Law in the caſe of uncertaine
murder, <hi>Deut. 21. 1, 2. If a man be found ſlain in the land, and
it be not known who hath ſlaine him, then thine Elders and thy
Judges ſhall come forth, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaith not the Elders of the
next Citie, as afterwards, ver. 3. but <hi>thine Elders,</hi> the generall
States of the Land, ſome of the high Court at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi>
the equitie and morall of it reacheth you: by vertue of your
middle ſtation and relation betweene God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the care of making the expiation and atonement lyeth
upon you; and ye are the men whom God ſeeketh to ſtep
into the gap to make interceſſion. The reproaches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they reproach him, ſhould fall on you, and ye ſhould
be aſhamed and confounded in the ſtead of the people: and
who knows if ye had throughly afflicted you ſoules in the
dayes of humiliation;<note place="margin">Jer. 7. 5.</note> if ye had throughly amended your
wayes and your doings; if ye had throughly executed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and juſtice, but the plague had ceaſed before this
time?</p>
            <p>Secondly, in generall judgements where the Phiall in
the pouring out beſpatters all, it may well be ſuppoſed that
all have ſinned, and muſt all together bring the ſacrifice.
<hi>Sanctifie ye a Faſt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>call a ſolemne Aſſembly: gather the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and all the inhabitants of the land into the houſe of the
Lord your God, and cry unto the Lord.</hi> Without queſtion
ye are involved in the common calamitie as well as others;
the rod laſheth you and you feele it, the moſt of you, who
have any thing in the enemies quarters: I beſeech you heare
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112955:22"/>
the voyce of it, and him that brings it. Though ye have the
priviledge of blowing of the Trumpet, for the gathering of
the people, and give law for time and place, yet ye are not
thereby priviledged from the faſting, the weeping, the
mourning, the crying, or praying, and the turning with all
your hearts together with others: lay your hands therefore
upon your hearts, and let them ſmite you for your own ſins,
and your fellowſhip with other mens:<note place="margin">Levit. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>If the Congregation
ſinne, the Elders muſt lay their hands upon the head of the
ſacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is ſomething very remarkeable in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
judgement that pulleth by the Eare,<note place="margin">Aurem vellit, &amp; admonuit.</note> thoſe among
whom he judgeth, rather then other men. And though all
men every where be admoniſhed to repent, yet more
eſpecially you <hi>Honourable and Beloved.</hi> The Lord ſeemeth
to have purpoſed it,<note place="margin">Eſai. 23. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to ſtaine the pride of all Glorie,</hi> Majeſty,
Authority and Greatneſſe, <hi>and to bring into contempt all the
Honourable of the earth:</hi> for the very <hi>foundations are ſhaken,</hi>
law and order is ſlighted and violated, and all eſtates diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
to the diſhonour and reproach of them that ſhould bear
up the pillars of it,<note place="margin">Arcana imperii.</note> the ſecrets and myſteries of State which
all policie hath ever kept vailed to preſerve them venerable
and reverend, are now made common and expoſed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eye, the originals and fundamentals of Empire and power
are ſearched into, and debated and judged, every man takes
libertie to talke, and write, and print of them with all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and confidence, the skirts of Majeſtie are uncovered,
and men ſee the nakedneſſe of it, even Government it ſelfe
hath loſt its reverence, as well as its pomp and luſtre; every
where men rather doubt, and diſpute, and interpret, then
obey; contempt is poured, and dung is caſt upon the faces of
Princes and Nobles and the Iudges of the earth; <hi>The childe
behaveth himſelfe proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe
againſt the Honourable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſai. 3. 5.</note> Eſai 3. 5. And if ye mark the courſe
and rage of the warre, <hi>it is the ſword of the great men which
are ſlains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 22. 14.</note> Ezek. 21. 14. the furie of the battell hath fallen
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112955:23"/>
much upon the Nobilitie and Gentrie. Conſider this alſo,
the viall hath beene poured out for many yeeres upon Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they have been ſhattered and broken, their juſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
violated, their members baffled and impriſoned, the
loynes of Parliaments have been girded with a girdle, and it
wanted little but they had been made ſlaves and bawdes to
the luſts and deſignes of private Iunctoes and Cabinets, yea,
they have been buried under ſcorne and reproach, and it was
a crime to wiſh or make mention of them.</p>
            <p>And even this preſent Parliament (though bleſſed be God
for it) in ſome reſpects it hath had the advantage of other
Parliaments, and the Lord hath honoured it above them all,
by putting into its hand a greater work to doe for himſelfe
and his Church, and opened to it a wider dore and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,
though there be many adverſaries, and crowned it
with more admirable ſucceſſes and providences, and brought
it on and followed it with more deſires and prayers, then
ever any Parliament had before it: yet in ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
it lieth under a cloud, and is more ſhaken. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of it is queſtioned, quarrelled, denied and oppoſed, the
power of it ſtraitned and bounded that it cannot reach all
the Kingdome through, proclaimed Rebels at home, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by many of your owne, and what you ſuffer abroad God
knoweth: the wheeles have moved ſlowly and driven hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,
not without diſturbance and diſtraction, your Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Orders are not ſo chearfully and univerſally received
and obeyed as haply ye thinke.</p>
            <p>I but offer theſe things under the notion and reſpect of
a judgement of God upon authoritie, and thoſe that deale
in it, that yee may take notice of the hand of the Lord, and
be awakened to judge your ſelves and ſinne no more, leſt a
worſe thing yet befall us: for yee cannot but judge this, that
(the cloud being ballanced by the hand of the Lord) where
the dint of the ſtorme falls moſt, thence aroſe much of the
vapour, and there the tempeſt will be moſt violent &amp; deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
if it be not prevented by timely &amp; ſerious repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:112955:23"/>
Fourthly, and I will adde no more. Something may be read
to this purpoſe, in the manner &amp; way of the bringing on, and
executing of this judgement; if ye have obſerved it, it hath
been brewed, and wrought, and tunned, and broached, and
drawn by the wickednes or the weakneſſe of thoſe <hi>among
whom God iudgeth;</hi> by the folly or miſcarriage of governors
and government, whether in the Church or State; the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we complain of was firſt begotten between the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great men, &amp; the unfaithfulnes of counſellors of State,
brought forth by the unrighteouſneſſe and baſeneſſe of the
Iudges, nurſed up and gotten ſtrength by the pride and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
of the Praelacie and Praelaticall Clergie, and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe
of many of the Nobilitie and Gentry comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſubſerving. And now it walks abroad through the
Land by the ſame meanes by which it hath come thus far;
and <hi>He that iudgeth among you</hi> either hides away wiſdome,

            <p>Now <hi>let God be righteous, and every man a ſinner;</hi> it hath
been commonly ſaid, and there is a truth in it, <hi>The King can
doe no wrong:</hi> it is not for me to tell you the meaning of it,
you give us the proverb and the interpretation thereof, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you make the application of it alſo: Conſider with
your ſelves, would the God of order thus tumble all things
headlong, turn every thing upſide down, or ſuffer this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
if he were not mightily provoked to it? It is his <hi>ſtrange
work:</hi> he delighteth not in it, we have given the cauſe,
our deſtruction is of our ſelves; our own wayes and our
doings have procured theſe things to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>For certainly what ever may be ſaid of the corrections
wherewith the Lord chaſtiſeth a particular man, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied but that a generall viſitation of a Nation is
the puniſhment of their ſinne. Now if we were to make a
diſcovery by Lots, wherein, and whoſe the ſinne hath been,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112955:24"/>
and all the chiefe of the Kingdom were to ſtand on the one
ſide, and the body of the people on the other ſide, as when

            <p>Now what is to be done in this caſe? the ſtory that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
will tell us, even by the light of the next verſe, we may
read that the hand of the Princes and the Rulers, (though
they had no hand in the treſpaſſe) muſt be chiefe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

prerogative was maintained, and the puntillo's of mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Chriſt uſurped upon, the morality of his Law diſproved and
decried, and his Sabbaths even proſtituted to profanation;

            <p>Goe yee neerer home, conſider your ſelves the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Mightie, generally as a body, particularly every

in the pulling downe of the Order and Government of the
Church, the ſuppreſſing of Sects and Hereſies (which are
the bane of the Church) as in the rooting out of Epiſcopacie?
as zealous in the keeping, as ye were in the making of the
Covenant? How faithfully and in the feare of God with a
perfect heart, have yee every man walked between Law
and Commandment, Statute and Iudgement, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
and Difficulties which have come before you?
Could I tell how to ſpeak ſo as to point every man into his

or particularize in this great and mixt Aſſembly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
uncovering the nakedneſſe of any before the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I might cut out much of your worke for you this day;
whereas now I can onely humbly offer a few enquiries, to
lead on your thoughts to ſome other particulars: but though
I am bounded, yee are at large; though the Miniſter muſt
deale in generalls this day, and tenderly in publique; yet I
beſeech you, doe not you with your ſelves in private; for
yee ought to ſanctifie the day, and keepe the Faſt in private,
as in publique; in your families apart, as in the Church; alone
by your ſelves, as with company.</p>
            <p>When therefore yee are in your Cloſets thinke on theſe

with peace. So much as in you is, both in your own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
&amp; in all the quarters of the kingdom procure a more
ſolemne ſanctification of the Faſt dayes. It is a great griefe
of heart to all godly men, to ſee how negligently the worke
of the Lord is done on that day every where, how formally
and ſlightly, if it be not wholly omitted, while your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
goe forth to compell the unwilling to come in under
no other penaltie, but a threat of the returne of their names.
I beſeech you therefore revive, and double your care for the
generall and more orderly keeping of that day, and promove
and expedite the ſo long expected, and ſo much longed for
<hi>Reformation.</hi> And becauſe ye ſee many ſeek out interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of evaſions &amp; inlargements from their covenants, and
begin to play faſt and looſe with that moſt ſolemne Oath and
Obligation; I beſeech you in the name and feare of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
renew the Covenant with aſmuch ſeveritie as <hi>Aſa</hi> did
that in his time, then let it fall or die away, remembring to
go before others in the example of all due reverence and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of that great ingagement, the Oath of God, and let
there be care taken that the Name of the Lord our God be
not taken in vaine: for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe
that taketh his Name in vaine.</p>
            <p>But not to inſtance any further in particulars, the ſumme
of all is this. Its fully manifeſt by the light of that principle
which this Text holds forth, <hi>the influence of God into govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that as well the diſorderly as the orderly managing of

The Lord cryeth as well by his judgements as by his

them into judgement, and who ſo is wiſe will ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

is pleading with his people, and it is our dutie, eſpecially of
thoſe who are betweene him and the people, as well in the
Magiſtracie as in the Miniſterie, to ſtep in to heale up the
breach, and make the atonement. There need no other
words to be ſought out by the Preacher as goads and nailes
for the faſtning of all this, but thoſe of the Prophet <hi>Amos:
Can a bird fall upon the earth where no gin is for him?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Shal one

and it hath been condemned as unſound, and unſafe by many
godly wiſe men; we have more ſure words of Scripture, out
of which we draw the doctrine of the Magiſtrates power &amp;
duty in the matters of God &amp; religion, then the looſe ſpeech
of ſuch a Neutraliſt and time-ſerving Politician as <hi>Gamaliel</hi>
was. Go on therefore, I beſeech you, as ye began; take us the
little Foxes as well as the ravening Wolves; provide againſt
the inſolencie of Libertiniſme as the tyranny of Epiſcopacie:
ye have done ſomething againſt <hi>Idolatry, ſwearing, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

lets that ye ſhould not doe the like againſt <hi>Errours, Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,

left out of protection more then the other three of the firſt
Table?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>to iudge as God iudgeth,</hi> to exerciſe authoritie
as God doth, with the minde that is in God, in his way, or
according to the rule of his word, and unto his ends.</p>
            <p>Firſt, with the minde that is in God, without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112955:30"/>
unbyaſed, unprejudiced ſpirit, ſuch libertie and courage from
a principle within, not popular arguments from without.
Authoritie is a ray or beame of divine Maieſtie, and ſhines
beſt when it is leaſt blended with any luſt or paſſion of man:
ye know what God ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> when hee firſt called him,
to ſet him over the people;<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note>

imagine it ſpoken to your ſelves: It is <hi>his iudgement.</hi>
Rulers are but the channels, the pipes thorow which it
flowes and is conveyed; its their dutie to let it runne as little
royled as may be. Set him therefore before you as your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, according to his word. His law is a glaſſe into
which is ſhed the image or ſpecies of his righteouſneſſe,
imitable and practicable, as well by Rulers in their Spheres,
as other people in theirs. If ye looke into that glaſſe, ye may
ſee how to dreſſe your ſelves, and how ye ought to be, and do
in place and exerciſe of power, only goe not away, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
ſtraightwayes, what manner perſons ye are or ſhould

               <hi>The law</hi> of God is your rule;

It is your guide alſo for the adminiſtration of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and all the Bible, eſpecially the Hiſtoricall part, is the
exemplification of that law, lining the rule with examples:
if yee exerciſe your ſelves to the reading of it, as <hi>David the

you, that though you have power to give law to others over

in the <hi>Legiſlative power,</hi> ye are not ſo bound up, by, or to the
lawes of the land already preſcribed, as inferiour officers in
courts of judicature, &amp;c. But as to Gods law ye are no more
at libertie to goe from, or ſtep beſide the Morall equitie and
juſtice of it, then he that comes forth to ſing a Song ſet to
his hand, may varie from the Notes or Dittie in the booke,
onely he may order his voice for the better grace of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and that muſt be his care, and therein lies his skill.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, all muſt be directed to Gods ends.
Firſt, <hi>his glorie, the dignitie and peace of his Crowne;</hi> that they
which live under your power, may <hi>fall downe and glorifie
God, and ſay, God is amongſt you of a truth.</hi> Secondly, <hi>the

all advantage may ſeeme to flow unto you, yet yee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſame, but as the ſea doth the waters, to convey and
tranſmit all back for the benefit of the land.</p>
            <p>Now that we may draw to a concluſion both of this uſe
and of the Sermon: For helps to the better practiſe of theſe
things, and that Magiſtracie may reach theſe great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is concerned in the Government, and the
manner of the carriage thereof by men: <hi>What is done by
them among whom be iudgeth, is to the glory or diſhonour of
his name who iudgeth among them.</hi> If good motions ſhould be
ſmothered or diverted, the weighty and neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Church or the Common-wealth be neglected,
or retarded, matters in debate carried by party and affection,
not by judgement and reaſon, if the juſt complaint and
cry of the poore ſhould not be heard, if juſtice ſhould not be
done, or there be unrighteouſneſſe in the non-diſcharging
of debts, or unfaithfulneſſe in the deceiving of truſt, or any
ſuch like, which God forbid, the damage indeed will be to
the Publike, or to this or that man; but the ſinne is againſt
God, and his Name is polluted thereby: the reproaches that
fall on them that doe ſuch things, fall alſo upon him, in whoſe
ſtead and place they are which doe them: through them he
is evil ſpoken of:<note place="margin">2 Chro. 19. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed therefore what ye doe; for ye

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vid. ſup. pag. 4.</note> There is another argument may be found in
the various reading of the Text, <hi>He will iudge the Gods open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>

when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him? Be wiſe now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O ye Kings; be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth: ſerve
the Lord with fear, reioyce with trembling. Kiſſe the Sonne, leſt
he be angry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
but a little: Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may yet eſpy one Motive more in the laſt verſe of the
Pſalm. <hi>Ariſe O God &amp; iudge the earth.</hi> There are prayers for,
or complaints of you daily ſent up to heaven, and theſe like
the vapour that aſcends, will be diſſolved, either in a ſhower,
or a ſtorm, will bleſſe or blaſt their perſons and their wayes,
for, or againſt whom they are directed. How lightly ſo ever
men regard prayers, or appeales, when God maketh inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
he remembreth them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 17.</note> and forgetteth not the cry of
the poore. He that prepareth the heart of men to pray, will
cauſe his own eare to hear, and that with the ſaving ſtrength
of his right hand.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that every one may have ſomething to carry home
with him, let us cloſe upall in a further and more generall
uſe of the doctrine. Since <hi>God iudgeth among the Gods;</hi> let
us improve the knowledge of it, both for the publique and
our owne private a double way.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the time paſt, and for all the evill which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne
us by any errour or diſorder in government, or by any
miſcarriage, in any undertaking by the one ſide or the other;
(for the ſad thoughts of thoſe judgements are more proper
for the day;) let us be ſilent becauſe the Lord hath done its
Refraine from froward quarrelſome complaining and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
and give glory to God: ſnarle not at the ſtone, but
acknowledge him that caſt it; It is of God, hee hath done
what ſeemed him good.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto
God, I have borne chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more;
That which I ſee not teach thou me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 34. 32.</note> 
               <hi>if I have done iniquitie I
will doe no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the time to come, let us ingage God by prayer.
<hi>In nothing be carefull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> 
               <hi>but in all things, let your requeſts be

Had we never ſo ſure a word of Prophecie or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
by which we might determine the time, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the nature of the iſſue of all theſe judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

as <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eze. 36. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1. There is a rule for it: <hi>I the Lord
have ſpoken, and I will doe it, I will yet for this be enquired of
by the Houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> Be the matter never
ſo perplexed, and ſeemingly impoſſible, Prayer is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
can help at a dead lift; Prayer will draw downe from
heaven the influence of God upon Parliament, Aſſembly,
Commitees, Armies, Navies, and all that ſerve in them, and
is done by them, that they may doe the work of God, and
proſper. If a man ſhould buſie himſelf in turning the leſſer
wheeles of his Watch with his finger, how long and how
evenly ſhould he make it goe? but let him winde up the
ſpring and it will keep its courſe, and meaſure the time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.
Neglect this and we labour in vaine, our confidences
will diſtreſs us and not help us: but if once we can prevaile
with God, to plead our cauſe with them that ſtrive againſt
us, to ſtand up for our help, and lay his hand upon the hand of
thoſe who are the inſtruments of the preſervation of the
Land, and the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church, that which they
adviſe and doe, will be <hi>the Arrow of the Lords deliverance;</hi>
