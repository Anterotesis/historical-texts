            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But to growe briefe in this matter alledged, and to ſet foorth ſome reſolutions in ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as may ariſe heerin.

Heerevnto we ſaye, and will amende his account in this manner: That if the ſaid marchante haue three bagges <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:9261:19"/>
of Nutmegs of ſome 600. waight, firſt ſuppoſe that all the rompes bee taken out, and that the reſt doo way 400. waight, being made into one ſort, worth to be ſold at v. ſhillings the pound, it ariſeth to the ſomme of 100. pounde, the which if afterwardes they bee deuided into caſe and baile, the caſe dooth ariſe to 250 pound <note place="margin">The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant doth not knowe many times what hee dooth ſell.</note>waight, beeing worth ſix ſhillings the pounde, amounteth to 75. pound, and 150. waight of baile remaining, being worth iiii. ſhillings the pound, ariſeth to 30. pound, the whole ſumme being 105. pound. So that it appeareth, that the Marchants gaine is greater by theſe deuiſions, then by one ſort.

Theſe three men can draw thoſe into that ſort in half a day, and do receiue xviii. pence for their labour, ſo his gaine is cleer xiiii. ſhillings vi. pence, the which if they were dulie garbelled would aske three daies worke, the labour whereof ariſeth to nine. s. wherein it plainelie appeareth, that by paſſing this 600. waight into one ſort, he gaineth xiiii. ſhillings ſix pence, in halfe a day, and by keeping the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <note place="margin">The good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is the lawe of true gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling.</note>deuiſions, he gaineth but ſix ſhil. in three daies, the which is the cauſe of his expedition: without care either to the welfare of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, retaylor, or to the people into whoſe hands the ſame doo paſſe. But wee referre it to your Honourable conſideration, to iudge what gaine this expedition bringeth in ſix daies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath xiiii. ſhillings ſix pence, in a forenoon.

                  <p>Is a drugge that is much vſed for many purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, this commoditie had aſmuch need of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full garbeller as the Nutmegs, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects more needfull, for Nutmegs are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by hand vppon a table, and doo require but a little labour in reſpect of harde working,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9261:26"/>
only this, there is great iudgement and skill to be vſed in their deuiſions: for wormeſeed after that it is ſifted, is to be made cleane by fanning, and that by much labour and paines taking. Of all commodities that are to bee garbelled, the workman deſerueth not his money better then in this, if he garbell as hee ought to doo. That garbeller that ſhall handle this drug ought to be skilfull and iuſt, otherwiſe the marchants, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and people ſhall bee all deceiued, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in reſpect of the good ſeedes lefte among the bad; and the grocer &amp; the reſt, by the garbel which they buy among the good. But to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the ſame, it lieth in the power of a skilfull garbeller to remedy at his pleaſure, if hee may haue tooles and fee anſwerable to his skill and paines. And heere is a thing to be remembred, to the ſaide workemen and others, that wheras there is alwaies as much and more good ſeedes left in the garbell of wormſeeds then bad ſeeds <note place="margin">More good ſeedes left in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bad ſeedes in the good.</note>in the good, and yet many times there are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the fourth part garbel, when they haue doone with the beſt in ſuch caſes as this is: wee wiſhe with all our harts, that the marchant might haue the garbell which we receiue among the good, and we the good ſeeds which are to bee found among the garbell, the which miſcheefe muſte be auoided as is before ſaid, and not elſe.</p>

They are to bee garbelled in all fidelitie for the auoiding of deceit.

               <p>Therefore, and to auoid all ſurmiſes by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Grocers, wee haue further thought it good, to accept it by an oath from the Lorde maior, if theſe our requeſts be allowed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by authoritie.
