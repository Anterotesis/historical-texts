            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Aſſertions concerning the Principle and Way of Life.</head>
            <p>THat it is a great and hard matter to come into a capacity of knowing and receiving the Truth. It is no hard matter to take up any Religion that a man finds in the World. To reade Scriptures, to believe what a man finds related there, according to his underſtanding of them; yea, to believe that he hath the Light and help of the Spirit in his reading and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to apply himſelf alſo to practiſe and obſerve what he finds therein required, and to aime at Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is no hard matter, every man that is ſerious, and ſeeks religion of any kind but in the weight of a mans ſpirit, may go thus far. But all this adminiſters not the true capacity, but he that meets with it, muſt go further then thus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which gives the true capacity is a Principle of Life from God, and there alone and no where elſe can man meet with it and receive it. This principle is the Seed of the Kingdom or Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Leaven, with which the mind muſt be in ſome meaſure leavened, ere it can come into a true capacity of underſtanding and receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth. And in this Leaven muſt it abide and grow up, if it abide and grow in the true knowledg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That from this principle and in this principle, not only the true Light and Knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and all Spiritual things is given and received, but alſo the true Faith, the true Love, the true Sanctification, the true Juſtification, the true Peace, the true Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what of theſe is not received and held here, is not of the Truth, but a garment of mens own forming and not the covering of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Spirit himſelf ſows this principle, and is received in this principle. And he that receives this principle and is born of this principle, receives and is born of the Spirit; and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it not, nor is born of it, neither hath received nor is born of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52307:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Spirit, but is but in the imagination and ſelf-conceit about the things of God, but is not in the truth, as it is in Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That in this Principle the new Covenant is made with the ſoul and entred into; and he that receives this principle from the hand of God, receives Life and enters into the Covenant of Life, and feels the pure fear, wherein God cleanſeth the heart, and whereby he keeps the heart clean, and feels the Laws of God daily writing there by the finger of Gods Spirit, and feels the power and ſence of the Spirit to teach and cauſe obedience; ſo that the yoke, which is hard to the tranſgreſſing nature (alienated from the Life and Power) is eaſy (and as I may ſay natural) to him that is born of this nature. For being dead with Chriſt, and riſen with Chriſt, and changed into the nature of Chriſt, by the principle which is of him, through the Power and Spirit of Chriſt which worketh therein, he can ſay as Chriſt did, when the Lord cals him to any thing, Loe I come, tis my meat and drink, yea my great delight to do thy will O God, yea thy Law is written in the midſt of my bowels.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Among thoſe who are gathered into this Principle, and abide in the Sence, Light and Life of this Principle, there is great love and unity. They are of one mind, of one heart, of one ſoul, of one ſpirit, of one life, gathered into one demonſtration of truth, and there is no jarriug, no doubting, no diſſenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this is out, in the world, in the earthly wiſdom, in the earthly profeſſions and walkings, but it is excluded the Principle of Truth, and them that are gathered into and abide therin.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That all that are not gathered into, nor walk nor live in this Principle, they are yet in the darkneſs and error from the pure pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and ſtand and walk in ſlippery places: and though their way may ſeem very right, and their eſtate and condition ſure (as to God-wards) in their own eyes and judgment, yet is not really ſo; but they are but in a dream concerning the Truth, not in the Truth it ſelf, which (how ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem to them at preſent to be affirmed concerning them) yet they ſhall certainly feel to be ſo, when the Lord by his powerful voice and bright appearance of his Spirit awaketh them. For many things go for truth now with men in the dark, which will vaniſh like ſmoak before the light of the day, and then that only which is Truth indeed ſhall have the glory and praiſe of being accounted ſo; and then what will become of thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52307:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who have miſtook about Truth, and are not clothed with the pure Wedding-Garment (the ſpotleſs life and righteouſneſs of the Son) but only with that which they have accounted ſo.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That to thoſe that ſee in the light of this Principle, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords houſe is diſcovered, and thoſe that abide and grow up therein, they know and experience it eſtabliſhed above all Mountains and exalted abve all Hils; all earthly Knowledg, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religions, earthly Ways, earthly Worſhips, earthly Spirits and Minds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their greateſt exaltations and glory, being far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it. And here the feaſt of fat things, and Wines on the lees well refined, even the fruit of the Vine which gladdeth and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the very heart of God, is fed and partaked of by thoſe that dwel here. For the Father and the Son and the Spirit is here revealed, in the holy Houſe and Tabernacles which are built here: and here they make their feaſt, bringing forth the riches of their Nature, Spirit and pretious Life, on which they feed with the ſoul, and give unto the ſoul favour and ability to feed with them; in which food there is the life, ſtrength, righteouſneſs and joy of the Kingdome given forth and received.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That in the heart which diſcovers iniquity, reproveth it, witneſſeth againſt it, &amp; ſtriveth with the mind to turn it from it, and to wait for life and power from on high, that is this very principle. In that is the Divine Nature, even the nature of Gods Spirit, which was always againſt ſin and ever will ſo be, and in all its appearances teſtifieth againſt it, and in love to the creature ſtriveth with the creature to convince it of that in it which is contrary to God, and to draw it to that ſtrength and divine vertue which ſtoppeth it, beateth it back, and worketh it out of the mind and nature of the creature, as it can get entrance, and is harkned and ſubjected to. For there is no Salvation, but by the Croſs and Yoke of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: for in that is the power to crucifie the affections and luſts, which lead into ſin and death, and will not ceaſe to tempt and lead aſide, till the ſoul be gathered into unity with that, and become ſubject to that which is contrary to them. So that this is the main thing in Religion, even to know Chriſt revealed in the ſoul as a Standard againſt corruption, and to be gathered under his Banner, which is the Croſs, or that living Principle in the heart, which reſiſteth the corrupt principle: and he that is gathered hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52307:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and continueth faithfully fighting here, ſhall receive mercy help and ſtrength from on high, in every time of need.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That the true and certain way of knowledg of the things of God, is in the faith and obedience of this Principle. It is not by reaſoning &amp; conſidering things in the mind (after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of men) that a man comes to know ſpiritual things: but they are ſpiritually revealed by God, after a ſpiritual manner, to the Believer, to the Obeyer; and they are revealed to him in his believing, in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, in his waiting, in his holy fearing, in his diſtruſting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and feeling his own inſufficiency, either to attain them or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, but as the Lord God makes them manifeſt in him, and preſerves him in the ſenſe of them. <hi>He that doth my Will, ſhall know of my Doctrine,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. This is the way. Wouldſt thou know what God requires of thee, what this or that is which appears in this or that ſort as Truth, whether it be ſo or no? Mind this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in thee, mind the pure, the holy Light, inward touches and leadings of this pure Divine Principle: that will make manifeſt to thee whatever is fit for thee in thy preſent ſtate to know; and thou art not to deſire more, but as a child to reſt contented with that proportion of knowledge and ſtrength, which the wiſe and tender Father judgeth fit for thee: and as thy ſtate groweth capable of more, he will not fail to adminiſter to thee. And what he giveth thee is good, ſeaſonable and proper for thee, which thou mayeſt ſafely feed upon and enjoy in the ſenſe and fear of him. But if thou preſs after what he would not as yet have thee know, thou entreſt into the will and wiſdom of the fleſh, and there are the diſputes, diſcontents, murmurings and ill tempers and diſpoſitions of the mind, which there will increaſe and grow upon thee to thy hurt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That the mind that is gathered here, will find great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, both within and without, inſomuch as he ſhall not eaſily paſs from out of the kingdom of darkneſs, into the Kingdom of the dear Son, but through many tryals, temptations, oppoſitions and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers many wayes, for turning the back on the kingdom of darkneſs, by joyning to the Principle of Life, in hearkning and ſubjecting to the light thereof; hereupon the powers of darkneſs both within and without beſtir themſelves to hinder the ſouls progreſs, and to bring it back again into ſubjection under the will and wiſdom of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52307:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
O how doth the will and wiſdom ſtrive within in a mans own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome! What riſings of the Impure are felt againſt the Pure! What ſecret and ſubtil reaſonings to enſnare and entangle the mind! and if they cannot draw the ſoul back from the Lord and the Living-Path, then they ſtrive to vex, afflict and torment it! There is none knows what is felt inwardly by the followers of the Lamb but thoſe that travel with him in the Living-Path; they are often ſenſible of what they meet with in their travels, and how hard it is to abide in the path of Salvation, inſomuch as they underſtand the truth of that ſaying, <hi>If the Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved.</hi> It is <hi>ſcarcely</hi> indeed, ſo ſubtile, ſo ſtrong, ſuch a many holds, ſo many ſtratagems hath the ſubtile, twining, crooked, piercing <hi>Leviathan,</hi> to enſnare, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, over-run and entangle them with. And then outwardly, the ſame fleſh, the ſame earthly ſpirit and wiſdom, the ſame crooked, helliſh will is ſtriving in men without alſo, to bear down and ſubject the pure Principle in them who are born of God, to their devices and inſtitutions, decrees, wayes, cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are of the will and wiſdom of the fleſh. So that, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>through much tribulation is the entrance of the ſoul into the heavenly Kingdom;</hi> and there is no avoiding the many tribulations, but by turning aſide out of the way (which though thereby the fleſh get eaſe for a time, it will be to the greater loſs and ſorrow in the end:) For the ſpirit of the world, the wiſdom of the world, the nature, religion, worſhip and whole courſe of the world, is contrary to the way of the pure Wiſdom and Spirit of God, and uſeth it as its enemy, where ever it findeth it: and they that will not bow to the ſpirit, wiſdom and way of the world, muſt feel the force of its beaſtly claws. For is it not a beaſtly thing (even far beneath the nature of a man) to perſecute that which is good, to hurt, reproach, and purſue the innocent life of the Lamb? and yet this is that which the ſpirit of the world (which is not of God, but wiſe and ſeemingly juſt and righteous in another wiſdom, nature and principle) always hath done, ſtill doth and will do to the end.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That there is a glorious Crown prepared for all thoſe, who are gathered to the Lamb in this Principle, and abide with him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therein to the end, hearing his Voice, believing the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Spirit, obeying him in all his motions and requirings, undergoing every yoke (which is appointed by him to yoke down
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52307:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fleſhly nature and mind) and taking up every Croſſe of every kind in meekneſs, patience and fear. And there is not only a Crown laid up for them at laſt, but the Power of the Lord God is nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to work all in them, to bear them up through and over all, and to keep them to and in that Principle, whereby and whereinto his tender Mercy and powerful Arm gathered them. For, as the Power of the Lord began the work: for there could never any heart be gathered from under the power of darkneſs to the Light which leads out of it, but by the Power of the Lord: for the powers of darkneſs ſtand between, and would hold and keep their own, did not a greater Power appear and put forth it ſelf for the ſoul againſt them. I ſay, as the Power of the Lord began the work, ſo the ſame Power alone is able to go on with it and perfect it; and it will go with it and perfect it upon the ſame terms it began, and no other. How were the terms at firſt but on a giving up of the ſoul in the faith to the Lord, in the ſenſe of his love and goodneſs and mercy, touching and drawing and making willing? And how is the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in the ſame giving up ſtill, in abiding with the Lord, in hearkning to the voice of the Lord, in waiting for the wiſdom and counſel of the Lord? But if any man draw back from this, if he deſpiſe the Spirit and his motions and counſels, and hearken to the voice of a contrary ſpirit, believing and following it, like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell, he departeth from his place and habitation, which he had in the drawings, life and power of God, and is not to God what he was before, nor is God to him what he was before: but the Lord who loved him before, and delighted in him to do him good, hath now no pleaſure in him, he being turned from that which the Lord loveth, and in which he hath determined and appointed to chuſe, love, and own the children of men: who as they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thither, are his children; as they are gathered from thence, into a contrary principle, are the children of the wicked one.</p>
            <p>And now what is of man in all this? where is the man that can boaſt before the Lord, who is thus ſaved? He hath all from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, yea he is gathered into, preſerved in, and abideth in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by the Power, goodneſs and mercy of the Lord. The Power begins the work in him, the Power accompanies him; the Power carries him through, or he falls and miſcarries. There is no man can ſtand any longer here, than he ſubmits to and is upheld by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52307:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor act nor ſuffer, but as the Power acts in him and helps him to ſuffer. Let the man that boaſteth, bring forth ſomewhat of his own, if he can, here. Is the will at any time his own? Doth not he that is ſpiritual and in the true ſence, always finde God to work in him to will, when ever he willeth rightly and holily? and if he cannot will of himſelf, can he do any thing of himſelf? can he beleive of himſelf, pray of himſelf, wait of himſelf, reſiſt enemies and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of himſelf, nay, ſo much as give a look to the Lord at any time of himſelf? Indeed in the grace of the Lord, and principle of his Life there is ſufficiency, and therein he that is joyned to the Lord and become one Spirit with him, what can he not do here? but that is, as he is new-made in Chriſt, and as Chriſt ariſeth, lives and acts in him, which he that is in the true ſence and feeling will ſtill acknowledg, not only in his words to men, but in his heart and ſpirit before the Lord.</p>

So that he that hath not this knowledge of him, hath not the true knowledg; nor he that doth not ſo beleive in him, doth not rightly beleive; nor he that doth not ſo hope in him, doth not rightly hope: and without the true Knowledg, the right Faith and Hope, how can any man be ſaved?</p>
               <p>Therefore awake, awake, O weary, thirſty ſouls, Come to the ſpring of Life, come to the living Waters. Become little, that ye may learn of Chriſt; wait to have your eyes anointed, that ye may ſee him, and your hearts opened; that ye may know and receive him. O wait for the manifeſtation of this Seed in you, be abaſed before him, joyn to him, receive his checks, receive mourning and repentance from him; wait for the Light and Faith that he gives, and the Power that iſſues from his Throne, and ye ſhall find him the bruiſer of the Serpent head (which none elſe is able to do) and the breaker of the bond of Iniquity, which keeps down the Juſt and lets the Unjuſt at liberty, till he diſſolve it. And this is ſufficient to manifeſt againſt all the diſputes of the mind, that this is He and no other, by his doing that which none elſe can do. This demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration he gave to the <hi>Jews in fleſh,</hi> in his appearance in fleſh: and this demonſtration he giveth now to the <hi>Jews in Spirit,</hi> in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in Spirit, whereby he ſatiſfieth their hearts, and putteth them out of doubt that it is he. And we muſt profeſs to the world (as our hearts are drawn and guided by the Lord, to give forth the teſtimony we have received of him) that we look not, yea we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look for another.

We look for indeed more of the ſame, and the more univerſal and powerful breaking of it forth, but another thing, another Chriſt, another Life, Spirit, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we cannot look for. And this we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtifie, that whoever receives this Teſtimony in the truth and uprightneſs of his heart, waiting on that which diſcovers ſin to him, and in ſimplicity joyning and giving up thereto, and walking

with him in forſaking the evil and cleaving to the good, in the faith of him and of his power, he ſhall witneſs the ſame thing with us, and all the reaſonings, imaginations and ſtrong holds of his mind ſhall be battered down and come to nothing, before the vertue, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and life of him who thus is pleaſed to appear and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after the Apoſtacy, even as he did before, even in an inward Principle, an inward Seed, an inward Light, an inward Life, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Word, an inward Power. And Friends and People, mark (in your minds, and learn to put a right difference betwen) that which ſtumbles you, and that which draws and convinces you. What makes any of you own Truth at any time? is it not an inward, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, powerful touch and demonſtration of Gods Spirit? what makes you afterwards doubt and queſtion? is it not another thing, of a different nature from this? is it not a ſubtil reaſoning, whereby the enemy twines into your ſpirits, and begets firſt a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, then a prejudice, and at laſt a great ſtrength againſt that, which before ye had ſome ſence of and ſome unity with, in the teachings and quickenings of the Spirit of the Lord. And what ſpirit is it in you, that thus worketh in your minds? and whither doth he lead you by theſe workings and ſubtile reaſonings? Oh that ye might ſee! Oh that ye might feel the ſnare, and know with us the Preſerver there-from: for we have met with much of this; and had we not been helped by the Lord, and given up to him, we had been entangled to this very day, as ye are. And he that hath helped us, waits to be gracious to you: and O that you would not reject his help, that he might deliver you alſo, that ye alſo might bleſs his Name, in feeling the benefit and joy of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. And this is written in true bowels and tender yearning love, that ye might be a little ſtirred up to wait to know the Fathers houſe, and might feed on the bread which abounds therein, and drink of the waters which makes freſh and living to God, and be clothed with the raiment which the Maſter of the family gives to his Spouſe, Children and Servants.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>CHRIST</hi> came (and is manifeſted in the hearts of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him) to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and to ſet the ſoul free from ſin: and whom he maketh free, are free indeed. Is the Liberty which the Son giveth, inferiour in this Life, in its kind, to the captivity and bondage of the Enemy, in its kind? Which of them is ſtronger? the Enemy to enthrall, or the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſet free from his Thraldom? Yes; the Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the Captain of our Salvation, the mighty Saviour (who is more able to ſave, than the Enemy to deſtroy) delivereth his <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the hands of their Enemies, and ſo mightily and powerfully delivereth them, that they are able (in the power of his Might) to ſerve him, without fear of them any more, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of their life.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is a ſtate of darkneſs, ſin and death, wherein Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan reigns: and there is a ſtate of weakneſs, wherein Satan much prevails, if the watch be not ſtrictly kept to him, who is the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtrength; and there is a ſtate of fighting and groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the body of ſin and death, and crying out who ſhall deliver from it! But there is alſo a ſtate of growth in the Life, and of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory (through the Life) over that which captiv'd and cauſed to cry out. There is a treading down of Satan under the feet by the God of Peace, inſomuch as not only the Elders, but the very young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Chriſt overcome and triumph over him, feeling the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance miniſtred to them abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom, into which no unclean thing can enter.

Chriſt ſaves only thoſe that come unto him, and believe in him, and ſo are born of his Spirit, &amp; by the faith and through the ſtrength and vertue of his Spirit overcome the wicked one, his works, ſnares and temptations in their hearts. And theſe feel in themſelves the Root of his Life, the holy Seed of his Kingdom ſpringing up in them, into which they are ingrafted and become one with him, and ſo bringing forth the holy Fruit, the living Grapes, the new and righteous Converſation, wherein the Life of God ſhines and is glorified. Now it is not knowing, or believing, or receiving any thing into the old underſtanding, that avails with God, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which is there wrought, but the New Creature alone, created of God in Chriſt Jeſus. This is born of God, this lives in him, this is cloathed with him. This puts off the old man with his deeds, and puts on the newneſs of the Nature and Spirit of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> ſo that this man is as really in Chriſt, in the Spirit, in the new <hi>Adam,</hi> found in him, formed in him, covered with him, as the firſt man or nature is in the old <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore this is the main thing in Religion, to mind the Seed of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Leaven of the Kingdom, its growth in the mind, foul and ſpirit, and the minds, ſouls and ſpirits gathering into and growth in it. And here is Faith, the true Faith, the true Love, the true Hope, the true Meekneſs and Patience; the true Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification felt, and not elſewhere: but thoſe that are out of this, out of Chriſt the Seed, out of Chriſt the Word, out of Chriſt the VViſdom, Righteouſneſs and Power of the Father, are only in a dream concerning theſe things, but know not the truth and real nature of them, as they are felt in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by thoſe who are truly ingrafted into Him, and livingly grow up in him.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>VVHat is juſtifying or Juſtification with God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is God's owning the ſtate, works or actions of a creature, either inwardly in his own mind, or manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them. This is God's juſtifying of them, or his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: his diſowning or diſallowing them, is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. As for inſtance, God's owning <hi>Adam</hi> in the upright eſtate of his Innocency, wherein God created him; and any thing he did in that ſtate and ſpirit, was his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him and his works. Gods diſowning and diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his hearkning to his Wife and the Serpent, and his eating the forbidden fruit, upon their temptation, was his condemnation thereof.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is it God juſtifies, and what is it he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which God juſtifieth is the Spirit of his Son, the Life of his Son, the Nature of his Son brought forth in any creature; the Faith which is in him, and ſo the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it is in the Obedience which is of him, and the works that are wrought in him: but the fallen eſtate of Man from him, and all that is done by Man out of him, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>How is Juſtification received, kept and grown up in; and what is the Preſervation out of Condemnation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Juſtification is only received by receiving him,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52307:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who is the righteouſneſs and juſtification, and only kept by abiding in him, and only increaſed by growing up in him. For as every one that is found in him, is juſtified: ſo he that hath more of him, more of his Life, more of his Faith, more of his Nature, more of his Spirit, more of the pure Obedience, more of the Garment of Righteouſneſs and Salvation drawn over him, he is more juſtified. For there are degrees of Juſtification, as the ſoul that is really in the thing, and is acquainted with the true nature and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of it from God, feels and knows. A father is more or leſs pleaſed with his children, yea with the ſame child ſometimes, which is a true figure to man who is come under Gods Teachings. And the preſervation out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, is, by being preſerved out of that, which God condemns: for no man upon the earth, that hath the true ſence and feeling, ſhall ever find the Holy and Juſt One juſtifying him in his ſins, but as the heart is turned from them, and by the power of Life kept out of them. He that will be kept in the Juſtification, muſt be kept out of that which the Juſtification is not to: for there he is not Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but in his being drawn again out of it, and turning again from it, his Juſtification in the tender Mercy of the Lord is renewed. Juſtification under the Law, was according to that Covenant: and Juſtification under the Goſpel, is according to that Covenant. He that walkes with God in that Covenant, he that walks in and after the Spirit of Chriſt, he is therein juſtified: but he that walks after the fleſh, and doth any thing that is fleſhly; that is not juſtified with God, nor he in that: but in the Faith which cleanſeth and giveth victory over it, in that is the Juſtification from it, and the pure Heavenly peace with the Lord God of Life witneſſed.</p>

He that is in Chriſt, and receiveth his knowledge from Chriſt, and is kept in the pure fear and ſenſe of him, he underſtandeth the truth of theſe things: but he that is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſpirit, and holds but up a literal knowledge (though from, or at leaſt accompanied with ſome remembrance of former feeling and experiences) he errs about theſe things alſo, and deceit and a lie hath prevailed over him, as he will find, when the Lord confounds his wiſdom and preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things, by awakening his Witneſs in him. For Religion, the true Religion is a Myſtery, Life a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Chriſt is a Myſtery, the Spirit is a Myſtery, Faith is a Myſtery, Obedience (the <hi>pure Obedience)</hi> is a Myſtery, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (the <hi>Spiritual Worſhip</hi> in and according to the New-Covenant) is a Myſtery, hid from the eyes of all the wiſe ſearchers of the World, but revealed to the leaſt Babe that is of God, and abideth in the quickned Life of his Son. But many that are out of the Myſtery of Truth, are in the Myſtery of Deceit, and have a knowledge or profeſſion concerning Chriſt, his Spirit, Faith, Obedience, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> in that Myſtery of Deceit, which they for the preſent account the true, and by it venture to judg, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow and condemn the Truth it ſelf: but that is not at all to the hurt of the Truth, or ſuch as are in it, but rather to their own hurt and great danger. For the ſparks which man kindles, will never light him to God; the garments of man's righteouſneſs (either according to his apprehenſions or the letter of the Law, or letter of the Goſpel) will never cloath him; but for all that, he muſt lie down in ſhame and ſorrow, when the Truth of God appears in his conſcience, and all his ſhadows and deceits flee away.</p>
               <p>Therefore hearken to the Teſtimony from theſe, whom the Lord hath awakened, whom the Lord hath quickned,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52307:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom the Lord hath led out of the darkneſs of the night, into the light and brightneſs of the day; who have ſeen Jeſus, and teſtifie what they have ſeen, heard, felt and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of that eternal Word, which was from the beginning, which appeared in fleſh, and afterwards in Spirit before the Apoſtacy, and hath again appeared (ſince the Apoſtacy) as a Shepherd, as a Gatherer, as a Seeker-out and Preſerver of his wandring Sheep, who were driven from Him in the cloudy and dark day. And if ye would hearken aright, breath to the Lord, in that which deſires and longs after him, that he would circumciſe the heart, and open the right ear in you, that the ear may hear his witneſs in you, that ſo ye may indeed know the voice of the Shepherd, and in true underſtanding, ſenſe and conſtant experience bear witneſs to that true Teſtimony, which Chriſt ſpake in the dayes of his fleſh; <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and follow me; but a ſtranger they will not follow: for they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</hi>
