            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>A New Commandment I give unto you,

            <p>THE Design of this Meeting of the <hi>Sons of
the Clergy</hi> being to promote Love and
Amity among our selves, and to exercise
Christian Charity, I think <hi>these</hi> Words
are no improper Subject to be discoursed on upon this
Occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A New Commandment I give unto you, That ye love
one another.</hi> A <hi>New</hi> Commandment! Was Love to each
other no Duty before the coming of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
Was it never injoyned under the Old Law?
Our Lord himself assures us of the contrary, <hi>Mark</hi>
12. 31. As in the foregoing Verse, he saith, that the
Love of <hi>God</hi> comprehends the whole <hi>first</hi> Table, so in
<hi>this,</hi> that the Love of our <hi>Neighbour</hi> is the Sum and
Substance of the <hi>Second: The Second is like, namely
this, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> And
we find the Duty of loving our Neighbour, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and inculcated in the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>The New Commandment therefore was not, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95574:4"/>
we should merely <hi>Love one another,</hi> but that we
should <hi>Love one another, as Christ hath loved us. A
New Commandment I give unto you, That ye love one
another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one
another.</hi> We have in the Words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A Duty enjoyned, <hi>viz. Loving one another.</hi>
            </p>

<hi>Love</hi> signifies either <hi>Complacency,</hi> or <hi>Benevolence</hi> and
<hi>Good Will.</hi> And it is our Duty to <hi>Love one another,</hi>
according to <hi>both</hi> these Acceptations of the Word,
though not every individual Person, according to both
<hi>Some</hi> we are obliged to Love Complacentially, to take
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95574:4"/>
Delight and Pleasure in them; but there are <hi>others,</hi>
whom we are not bound so to Love; nay whom we
are bound <hi>not</hi> so to Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> we can not so Love though we <hi>would;</hi> and
there are <hi>others</hi> whom we <hi>may</hi> not so Love, though
we <hi>could.</hi> For instance, <hi>Churlish Nabals, People</hi> of
<hi>Sour, Morose,</hi> or <hi>Captious</hi> Tempers, to whom scarce a
free Word can be spoken, without danger of Offence:
We <hi>cannot</hi> Love these with a Love of <hi>Delight,</hi> though
we would never so fain. To whom may be added
<hi>Narrow-soul'd</hi> People, who have no Concern for <hi>any</hi>
but their own dear Selves; and much more such as
make no Conscience of <hi>injuring</hi> others to serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
As Good natur'd People can take no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in such as <hi>these,</hi> so can hardly any of these, be
pleased with the Society of <hi>one another:</hi> Especially,
<hi>Proud,</hi> or <hi>Envious,</hi> or <hi>Churlish,</hi> or <hi>Testy</hi> and <hi>Waspish</hi>
People, are no Company for <hi>one another;</hi> and much
less for those, who are of <hi>contrary</hi> Qualities; Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
being the Foundation of all Love of Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Tho' where there is Similitude there may be no such
Love, <hi>viz.</hi> when it lyeth in unlovely and troublesome
Qualities; yet wheresoever there is such a Love, there
must be more or less Similitude: And according to
the <hi>degree</hi> of Similitude, will be the degree of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential
Love.</p>
            <p>Again, if such a Person be sensible, that such a one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95574:5"/>
               <hi>Hates</hi> him, and watcheth all Occasions to do him
Mischief, he cannot have this kind of Love for <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when I say that <hi>some</hi> we <hi>can</hi> take no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in, I suppose that therefore we are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to it. <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impossibile.</hi> Nor is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the Divine Goodness, to impose unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things on Men.</p>
            <p>There are again <hi>Others,</hi> whom we <hi>may</hi> not Love
with this Love of Delight, though we <hi>could:</hi> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Prophane</hi> or <hi>Debauched</hi> People; those, who tho'
they may have the <hi>Form</hi> of Godliness, deny in their
Practice the <hi>Power</hi> thereof. The Apostle admonisheth
his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>withdraw himself</hi> from such as
<hi>these.</hi> To be pleased with the Conversations of such
People, is to express a liking of their Ways; at least
it argues a very Luke-warm Temper, and a great
Unconcernedness for the Honour of God, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Religion.</p>
            <p>But no Man can be of so Unlovely a Temper, or
so wicked a Wretch, as that it should not be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to love him, in the <hi>Second</hi> Sense of the Word, <hi>viz.</hi>
to <hi>wish well</hi> to him, and endeavour, as we have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
his Welfare and Happiness. Which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
I need not say, a Change of his Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which he cannot be capable of Happiness. And
therefore this Change of his Nature is in the first
place to be desired and endeavoured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95574:5"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Loving each other;
there is no Duty more plainly enjoyned, or more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
urged in the Holy Scriptures: Especially by
our Blessed Saviour and his Holy Apostles. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those who are better acquainted with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, than with the Spirits and Behaviour
of those who profess it, may think it needless to spend
any time, upon <hi>this</hi> Argument. But because the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of too too many who are called Christians, and
<hi>that</hi> Religion which our Saviour brought into the
World, are very unlike, it will not be amiss to give
a short Account what <hi>this</hi> is, in reference to the Point
before us.</p>
            <p>As our Blessed Lord calls it His <hi>New Commandment,
That we Love one another as He hath Loved us;</hi> so in
the Words following, he makes <hi>this</hi> the <hi>distinguishing</hi>
Character of his Disciples. <hi>By this,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall
all men know that you are my Disciples, if ye have Love
one to another.</hi> And so desirous was he that they should
not be defective in Love, that above all the excellent
Petitions he puts up for them <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. this of Love
is the only Grace, he particularly prays for in their
behalf, <hi>viz. ver. 21. That they all may be one as thou
Father art in me and I in thee;</hi> that they may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
in Love, have one Heart, and one Soul. And
the Reason for which he thus prayeth, doth mightily
Commend this Grace, <hi>viz. That the World may believe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95574:6"/>
that thou hast sen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me.</hi> Which is as much as to say,
that Christian ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ing in the Grace of Love, will
be a great Conviction to the World, of the Execllen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and therefore of the <hi>Truth,</hi> of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And again Verse the last, <hi>I have declared,</hi> saith
he, <hi>to them thy Name, and will declare it, that the
Love wherewith thou hast Loved me, may be in them.</hi>
And his Beloved Disciple S. <hi>Iohn</hi> thought, he could
never enough extol this Grace. He makes Love the
very Essence of the Deity, 1 <hi>Ep. 4. 16. God is Love;</hi>
and adds, that <hi>he who dwelleth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Love, dwelleth in
God and God in him.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 7. he saith, that <hi>Love
is of God, and every one that Loveth is born of God,
and knoweth God.</hi> Knoweth him practically and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally.
And <hi>Ch. 3. 14. We know,</hi> saith he, that,
<hi>we have passed from Death to Life, because we love the
Brethren:</hi> We know that we are Regenerate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
by our Love and Charity. <hi>He that loveth not
his Brother abideth in Death.</hi> He is certainly an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
Man, a wicked Creature. And <hi>ver. 15.
Whosoever hateth his Brother is a Murtherer, and ye
know that no Murther hath Eternal Life abiding in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is S. <hi>Paul</hi> wanting in Recommending and
pressing <hi>this</hi> Duty. <hi>Owe,</hi> saith he, <hi>no man any thing
but to love one another; for he that loveth another, hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the Law.</hi> Or <hi>this</hi> is the Christian Perfection of the
Law, as it relates to our Neighbour. And in what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95574:6"/>
follows he sheweth, that the whole second Table is
herein implyed. And in short, this great Apostle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
Charity before all other Endowments and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments:
Before the <hi>speaking with the Tongues
of Men or Angels,</hi> before <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>all Mysteries,</hi> before  all Kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>all Faith</hi> too, even the <hi>Faith of Miracles;</hi> nay before
the greatest <hi>Zeal,</hi> nay such a zeal as will make men
<hi>give their Bodies to be burnt, 1 Cor. 13 chapter.</hi> He
there tells us, that Charity is so much above all <hi>these,</hi>
that they are none of them worth any thing without
Charity. Much more may be said to sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w, what a
mighty Figure, this Duty of Loving each other makes,
in the Religion of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I come to shew how <hi>far</hi> this duty of <hi>loving
one another</hi> is to extend; or what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by <hi>one another</hi> in the Text. In a word, it takes
<hi>in all Men whatsoever:</hi> Not only our Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
Not only our own Party, and those that
say as <hi>we</hi> say, and think as <hi>we</hi> think: Not only those
that oblige us and do us good turns; but all the World,
all that partake of the same common Nature with our
selves, be they <hi>who</hi> or <hi>what</hi> they will.</p>
            <p>1. This is apparent from the <hi>Text. A new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
I give unto you, That you love one another, as
I have loved you.</hi> Now the Love of Christ was <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,</hi>
He dyed for all mankind. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95574:7"/>
               <hi>He is the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</hi>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him, <hi>The Saviour of all Men:</hi> That is,
so their Saviour as to exclude none from Salvation,
who will comply with the Terms on which He offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it. He hath shut out none from having benefit,
by what he did and suffered in the behalf of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
nor ever <hi>will</hi> he any, who shall not <hi>reject the
Counsel of God against themselves.</hi> And lest we should
think that by the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>whole World,</hi> and
<hi>all Men,</hi> we are only to understand <hi>some of all sorts,</hi>
this same Apostle assures us, that this Phrase <hi>all
Men</hi> is to be taken in the same Latitude, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Remedy brought by <hi>Christ,</hi> that 'tis to
be taken in, in reference to the Mischief done by <hi>Adam.
Therefore as by the offence of one,</hi> saith he, <hi>judgment
came upon all men to Condemnation, even so by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of One, the free-gift came upon all men to Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Life; viz.</hi> the gift of the new Gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 2. 9.
tells us, that Christ <hi>tasted death for every man.</hi> Now
if our Saviour loved <hi>all men,</hi> loved <hi>all</hi> so as to put
them into a Reconcilable state; so that it must be their
own Personal fault, and long of their Wilfulness and
Obstinacy, if the <hi>worst</hi> of Sinners be not actually <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi>
to God; then, since he hath commanded us
to love <hi>others</hi> as <hi>He</hi> hath loved them, our Love is
to extend to <hi>all</hi> without exception. And well might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95574:7"/>
our Lord call this a <hi>New</hi> Commandment, for no such
is to be found in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>This farther appears from those</hi> other <hi>words of
our Saviour,</hi> Mark. 12. 31. Thou shalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self. <hi>You may say, the word</hi> Neighbour
<hi>seems to be Limiting and Confining. But we must
understand this word, as our Lord himself hath Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
it,</hi> Luke 10. 29. <hi>Here is a Question put by a
Lawyer to Him,</hi> Who is my Neighbour? <hi>Now see</hi>
His <hi>Answer in the following words:</hi> A Certain man
went down from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> and fell among
thieves, who stripped him of his Rayment, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, leaving him half dead; and by chance there
came a certain Priest that way, and when he saw him, he
passed by on the other side; and likewise a Levite, when
he was at the place, came, and looked on him, and passed
by on the other side: But a certain Samaritan, as he
journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had
Compassion on him, <hi>&amp;c. Now saith our Saviour,</hi> v. 36.
Which of these three, thinkest thou, was Neighbour to him
that fell among thieves? <hi>And the Lawyer answering,</hi>
He that shewed mercy on him; <hi>Our Lord replyed,</hi> Go
thou and do likewise. <hi>Which is as if he had said, Thou
hast now answered thy self; every Person that</hi> needs
<hi>thy relief, tho' he be unto thee as</hi> Iews <hi>and</hi> Samaritans
<hi>are to one another; tho' he be of a different Religion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95574:8"/>
from thee, nay tho' he be thine</hi> Enemy, <hi>as the</hi> Iews
<hi>and</hi> Samaritans <hi>were to each other, he is thy</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<hi>and therefore thou art obliged to</hi> love him as
thy self; <hi>to do to</hi> him, <hi>when in an afflicted state, as</hi>
thou <hi>wouldst be done unto in the like Condition.
Again 'tis Evident,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That we are not to confine our Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to some particular Persons, in that we are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
required by our Saviour, to imitate our</hi> Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fathers <hi>Love and Charity.</hi> Be Perfect, <hi>saith he,</hi>
as your Heavenly Father is perfect, Mat. 5. 48. <hi>That
is, as appears from what goes before, let the exercise
of</hi> your <hi>Charity extend as far as</hi> God'<hi>s extendeth,
For, as it follows</hi> v. 45. He maketh His Sun to rise
on the Evil and on the Good, and sendeth Rain on the
Iust and on the Vnjust: <hi>And, as the</hi> Psalmist <hi>declareth,</hi>
His mereys are over all his works: The Lord is good
to all, and His tender mercys are over all His works.
<hi>But,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Express</hi> Texts enjoyn <hi>this.</hi> If any are to be
excluded from our Love, they must be our Enemies;
but what saith our Lord of <hi>these, Mat.</hi> 5. 44? But <hi>I
say unto you Love your Enemies, bless them that curse
you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
you, that you may be the Children of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven.</hi> And v. 46. <hi>If you love them
which love you, what Reward have you? Do not even the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95574:8"/>
Publicans the same? And if you Salute, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
your Bretheren only, what do you more than others?</hi>
Or, what Excellent thing do you? <hi>Do not even the
Publicans the same?</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. The Apostle
saith, <hi>Let us do good unto all men;</hi> and the next
words shew, that tho' we ought to love <hi>all</hi> without
exception, as that word signifies <hi>Benevolence,</hi> yet we
are not to shew neither <hi>this</hi> kind of love to all <hi>alike:</hi>
For it follows, <hi>Especially to them who are of the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of Faith. That</hi> which makes our Brother a
Member of Christ's Church, doth give him a Title
to our greater Affection in both the foresaid Senses.
And here let me mind you, that we ought to have
a higher degree of love, for all that own Christ for
their Lord and Saviour, than for Infidels, and such
as are Enemies to his Religion; and those that own
him most in their <hi>Practice,</hi> we are obliged to have a
greater love for, than for mere <hi>Professors</hi> of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or such as whose lives are <hi>less</hi> Conformable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
'Tis highly Reasonable, that the most Lovely
Persons should have <hi>most</hi> of our love. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so Amiable as true Goodness, and according
to the <hi>degree</hi> thereof in any Person; should be the
degree of our Love to him. <hi>God</hi> is to be the Object of
our Highest Love, because <hi>He</hi> is Perfectly and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
Good; and according as Men are more or
less like to God, the greater or less Complacency
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95574:9"/>
ought we to take in them; and more or less ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to Desire and Endeavour their Wellfare. The
true Christian Love doth chiefly consist in loving <hi>His</hi>
Image from whom we are call'd Christians: And
where there is <hi>most</hi> of that, whether the Persons are
in all things of our minds or no, we do not Love
as becomes <hi>Christians,</hi> if <hi>there</hi> we do not <hi>most</hi> love.</p>
            <p>I speak now of <hi>Christian</hi> Love, as I said, such a
love as is the effect of our own <hi>choice,</hi> directed and
Governed by our Saviour's Laws. I speak not of a
<hi>Natural</hi> Love, which is <hi>necessary,</hi> and not the effect
of Choice. This love do we what we can, will ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
flow most freely towards our <hi>Yoke-Fellows;
Children, Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> as being parts of our
selves. And so for those that are Naturalized to us
by a long Acquaintance, we cannot in <hi>that</hi> respect
but love them better, than such as are less known to
us; and those that have greatly <hi>obliged</hi> us, we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
love with a greater Passion, than those to
whom we are <hi>not at all,</hi> or <hi>less</hi> beholden.</p>
            <p>But tho' <hi>Scripture, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> do enjoyn
us to love one another with a different kind and
degree of love, yet it hath been fully made to appear,
that 'tis our duty to extend our love to <hi>all;</hi> to wish
well to, and desire and endeavour (as we are able
and have opportunity) the happiness of every man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I proceed to shew, what <hi>Qualifications</hi> our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95574:9"/>
love to each other ought to have. Our Text tells us,
that we ought <hi>to love one another as Christ hath loved
us;</hi> and the other Text in S. <hi>Mark,</hi> that we are to
<hi>love our Neighbour as our selves.</hi> And that is,</p>
            <p>1. Most <hi>Heartily</hi> and <hi>Sincerely. My little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
saith S. <hi>Iohn, Let us not love in word, neither
in tongue, but in Deed and in Truth. Let love be
without dissimulation,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> I need not say
that <hi>Christ</hi>'s love to us was most hearty, nor that
our love to <hi>our selves</hi> is so. Indeed, if our Love be
not hearty, as we love not like <hi>Christians,</hi> so we do
not love <hi>at all.</hi> Love is seated in the Heart only,
so that <hi>Professions</hi> of love, and <hi>love it self</hi> are no
more the same thing, than are Shadows and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
Realities and mere Appearances.</p>
            <p>2. We ought to love <hi>Ingenuously</hi> as well as Hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
To love Men Ingenuously, is to delight in them,
or wish well to them, for their <hi>own</hi> sakes, without
respect to our <hi>own</hi> Interest. So, you need not
be told, our <hi>Saviour</hi> loved Mankind; next to the
Glory of God, and the Advancement of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Universal Goodness in the World, He was
acted by a vehement desire of <hi>Our</hi> happiness. He
did not <hi>Love Men,</hi> as men love their <hi>Horses,</hi> and too
commonly their <hi>Servants,</hi> only or mostly for his own
Advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, as I said that to</hi> Pretend to love, is not to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95574:10"/>
love, <hi>so to love others merely with respect to our</hi>
own <hi>good, is rather mere</hi> self-<hi>love, than a love of</hi>
them. <hi>And to love others</hi> principally <hi>for our</hi> own
<hi>sakes, is</hi> more <hi>to love</hi> our selves <hi>than</hi> them. <hi>And that
such a love is far from deserving to be called</hi> Christian
<hi>Love, will appear by what a</hi> Pagan <hi>saith of it.</hi> Tully
<hi>tells us in his</hi> Laelius, <hi>that</hi> Ipse se quisque deligit non
ut aliquam a seipso mercedem exigat Charitatis suae, sed
quod perse sibi quisque Charus est, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every man loves
himself, not that be may obtain a reward from himself
for so doing, but because he is, for his own sake, dear
to himself: And except <hi>(as he proceeds)</hi> men so love
one another, they cannot be true Friends. And this
<hi>(saith he farther)</hi> is seen in the very Brutes, how much
more then ought it to be found among Men. But many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
desire that others should be such Friends to them,
as they will be to none; and expect that love from others,
which they will not bestow on others. <hi>That is, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that others should love them purely upon their</hi>
own <hi>account, and not that their love to them, should
Ultimately Terminate in</hi> themselves. <hi>And as the
Example of our</hi> Saviour, <hi>so that of</hi> God the Father <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
us</hi> thus <hi>to love one another. For</hi> Man cannot be
profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable
to himself. Is it any Pleasure, <hi>or Courtesy,</hi> to the
Almighty, that thou art Righteous? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iob 22. 2, 3.
<hi>And therefore he cannot desire, that</hi> Sinners should turn
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95574:10"/>
from their Wickedness and live, <hi>for any gain to himself.
If therefore we would be the Children of God, we must
love each other not only sincerely, but generously and
ingenuously.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, if we consider the Nature of Mankind,
we shall find that <hi>this,</hi> as well as the Commands of
God and our Saviour, doth oblige us to such a love of
all Men. And this, indeed, is the reason why they
have obliged us hereunto by their Commands. They
Command it because it is fittest in it <hi>self</hi> and best. And
therefore are we required to love and wish well to all
for their <hi>own</hi> sakes, because every man is in himself
considered, and as abstracted from Vicious Habits, and
from what is Preternatural, an Excellent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Lovely Creature. Every man, as to his pure
Naturals, bears God's Image; and consequently 'tis
most reasonable to love every man, and desire his
greatest happiness, for his <hi>own</hi> sake.</p>
            <p>Nay, we ought to bear such a sort of Good-will
to God's whole Creation; thus to love Brutes as well as
Men, tho' in a far lower degree, and to desire for them
all that Happiness their Natures are Capable of, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
as well as <hi>with</hi> respect to our own Advantage, and
the service they may do <hi>us.</hi> I say we ought to desire
the well-being of all Creatures whatsoever, for
their <hi>own</hi> sakes (I mean so far as it is consistent with
the Well-being of Men) because all God's Works
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95574:11"/>
are <hi>good,</hi> and whatsoever is <hi>so</hi> hath a <hi>Right</hi> to our
Benevolence as <hi>such. A mercifull man,</hi> saith K. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Is merciful to his Beast:</hi> And not only is he
so, because by his ill usage of his Beast, he will
disable him from being <hi>serviceable</hi> (for <hi>this</hi>
would not speak one a <hi>Merciful</hi> Man, but a
Man that considers his own interest) but because
the poor Creature has a <hi>Right</hi> to good Usage.
And if such a Love as this be due to Beasts, much
more is it so to Man-kind.</p>
            <p>By the way, what an ill-natured Principle is <hi>that</hi>
of the <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Philosopher, <hi>viz. That our Need
of each other, is the only Cause of our entring into
Societys, and the Ground of all Friendship.</hi> He might
judge so by <hi>himself,</hi> but every one whose Nature
is not miserably <hi>depraved,</hi> knows by but reflecting
on <hi>himself,</hi> that <hi>this</hi> is wretched Doctrine.</p>
            <p>3. We are obliged to have such a degree of Love
for one another, as will make us most Prompt and
Ready to the Performance of all Offices of <hi>Mercy</hi>
and <hi>Kindness,</hi> as shall be shewn presently: And so
to love the <hi>Souls</hi> of our Brethren, as to be willing
even to lay down our <hi>Lives</hi> for the procuring of
their Eternal Happiness, if it be <hi>necessary. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
saith S. <hi>Iohn, Perceive we the Love of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He laid down his Life for us, and we ought to
lay down our lives for the Brethren.</hi> And thus <hi>to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95574:11"/>
love one another as Christ hath loved us,</hi> is not only
o love our Neighbour <hi>as</hi> our selves, but even <hi>better</hi>
than our Selves, that is, than <hi>one</hi> part of our selves,
our <hi>viler</hi> part. And as <hi>severe</hi> as this may seem,
nothing is more highly Reasonable, than that we
should prefer our Brethrens <hi>Souls</hi> before our own
<hi>Bodies;</hi> than that we should be more solicitous for
their <hi>Eternal,</hi> than for our own <hi>Temporal</hi> life. This
appears <hi>so</hi> Reasonable at first sight, that such a
Man as <hi>Tully,</hi> had it come into his Mind, would
certainly have asserted it to be our duty. This Love
I might shew, S. <hi>Paul</hi> professed to have for his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Country-Men, and he gave the greatest
Demonstrations of the sincerity of that his Profession;
and so did the <hi>other</hi> Apostles too of the <hi>like</hi> Love.
And the <hi>same</hi> ought we <hi>all</hi> to aspire after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I come, in the last place, to shew in what
<hi>Instances</hi> our Love to one another ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Many I might lay before you, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
insist on above <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It ought to be Exprest by Sympathizing with
each other in Afflictions, and Rejoicing in each others
Prosperity. <hi>Rejoice,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>with them that
Rejoice, and Weep with them that Weep.</hi> And <hi>look
not every man on his own things, but every man also
on the things of others.</hi> Not that he would have
us be Busy-bodies in other folks matters; <hi>this</hi> we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95574:12"/>
are <hi>elsewhere</hi> Cautioned against by the <hi>same</hi> Apostle:
But he would have us enquire after, and be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, the State of others; if it be <hi>good</hi> not to
Envy them, but to be Glad for their sakes; and if
<hi>bad</hi> to Compassionate them. <hi>This</hi> was the Temper
of our Blessed Lord, when on Earth. We again and
again read, that upon the sight of People in Calamity
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>His Bowels yerned towards</hi> them.
And <hi>this</hi> we must have a special care to be <hi>like</hi> Him
in, as we profess to be His Followers. <hi>Love as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Peter) be pitiful.</hi> But then,</p>
            <p>2. To our Affecting Sense of the Condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we must add our Relief of all Objects of Pity,
according to our Ability. And our Nature is indued
with such a Passion as this of <hi>Pity,</hi> for this
reason only, that we may be the more strongly
thereby excited to <hi>Relieve</hi> our Afflicted Brethren;
so that 'tis for <hi>this</hi> end that we ought to cherish this
Affection. And to be affected with the sufferings
of others, without administring what help we can,
is so poor and low an expression of love, as to be of
no Account <hi>at all</hi> with God. If a Brother or Sister
(saith S. <hi>Iames) be Naked and destitute of daily Food,
and one of you say unto them, Depart in Peace, be ye
warmed or filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those
things which are needful for the Body; what doth it
profit?</hi> That is, if you be so little Affected with the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95574:12"/>
Condition of your poor Indigent Brethren and Sisters,
as only to bestow good <hi>Wishes</hi> on them, it will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profit <hi>them</hi> nor <hi>your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will present you with <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Texts, which
if we will Consider, we cannot think our selves
sincere Christians, while we live in the neglect of
this duty of Charity. The <hi>first</hi> shall be that of S.
<hi>Iohn, Whoso hath this Worlds Goods, and seeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 1 Iohn</hi>
3. 17. He hath no more love for God, than he hath
for his Brother. The <hi>second</hi> shall be that of S. <hi>Iames,
Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father
is this, to visit the Fatherless and Widows in their
Affliction; and to keep ones self unspotted from the
World, Iames,</hi> 1. 27. The <hi>third</hi> shall be that of
the Prophet <hi>Micah, He hath shewed thee O man, what
is Good; and what doth the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly, to love Mercy, and to walk Humbly
with thy God? Mich.</hi> 6. 8. And so great a number of
Texts of the like nature, may be produced, as you
must needs be satisfied are more than enough, to
overthrow all the Hopes of a Covetous Hard-hearted
Professour of Christianity, let him have built his
hopes upon never so many-<hi>other</hi> Evidences.</p>
            <p>3. Another Expression of Love to each other,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95574:13"/>
should be wholesome Advice and Counsel. <hi>As Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Perfume</hi> (says the Wise Man) <hi>rejoice
the heart, so does the sweetness of a mans Friend by
hearty Counsel.</hi> And if in our <hi>Temporal</hi> Concerns,
the good Advice of a Friend is to be valued, How
highly valuable is it in our <hi>Spiritual!</hi> And therefore,
How much <hi>more</hi> should our Love prompt us to give
it in <hi>such</hi> Concerns! <hi>Exhort one another daily,</hi> says
the Apostle, <hi>While it is called to day, left any of you
be hardned through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> And <hi>let us
consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good
works.</hi> Can I be a Friend to any man, and not be so to
his <hi>better</hi> Part, his <hi>Soul?</hi> And can I be Friend to
his <hi>Soul,</hi> and decline giving him that <hi>Advice</hi> which
I am sensible he <hi>needs,</hi> either for the Taking him
off from some sinful Course, or prevention of his
falling into some Sin, or of his Continuance in the
neglect of some necessary duty? And to encourage us
to this great Instance of Friendship, let us consider
those words with which S. <hi>Iames</hi> concludeth his
Epistle, <hi>Brethren, if any of you do Err from the truth,
and one Convert him; let him know that he who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
a sinner from the Errour of his way, shall save a
Soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of Sins.</hi>
Or, this will be a prevailing Motive with God to
pardon his <hi>own</hi> many sins.</p>
            <p>But yet, as Noble and necessary an instance of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95574:13"/>
Charity as <hi>this</hi> is, and as great a Reward as is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to it, there is no duty more neglected in this
<hi>Luke-warm,</hi> nay most <hi>Prophane</hi> Age; in which <hi>such</hi>
an Expression of Friendship, too generally passeth
for a Piece of <hi>Fanaticism.</hi> But Honest <hi>Heathens</hi>
have had a much more honourable Opinion of it.
And I will conclude <hi>this</hi> Argument with <hi>this</hi> saying
of <hi>Cicero: Consilia, Sermones, Cohortationes, Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,
interdum etiam Objurgationes, in Amicis vigent
maxime. Good Counsel, wholesome Admonitions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and Consolations, and severe Reproofs too,
when there is Occasion for them, do most take place
in Friendship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I might proceed to</hi> other <hi>Instances of Love, to
which we are necessarily obliged; As a</hi> Readiness
to forgive offences: <hi>A</hi> Forwardness to make up diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
Putting the most Candid interpretations we
reasonably can, upon each others Actions: Concealing
each others Faults, except when it is necessary to make
them Publick: And Condescention to each others infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
<hi>But I may not do more than Mention</hi> these,
<hi>lest I trespass too much upon your Patience.</hi>

               <head>The Application.</head>
               <p>NOw what remaineth, but that we put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
with all our might, this Great, this New
Commandment of <hi>loving one another, as Christ hath
loved us.</hi> And we of <hi>this Society,</hi> who are many of us
<hi>Clergy-men,</hi> and all <hi>Sons</hi> of the Clergy, are in these
respects under a special Obligation, of Excelling in
<hi>this,</hi> with all <hi>other</hi> Christian Virtues.</p>
               <p>Those of us who are <hi>Clergy-men</hi> are strictly bound,
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, in the Person of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to be
<hi>Examples to the Flock;</hi> and so to demean our selves,
in all respects, as to be able to say as <hi>that</hi> Apostle
did, <hi>Walk as ye have us for an Example.</hi> As it is
our great Business to Teach others their duty, and
to press them thereto by the most persuasive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
so must we make great Conscience of it
our selves, as we would not <hi>lose</hi> our labour; nay as we
would not do more <hi>hurt</hi> than <hi>good.</hi> And those ought
to Expect, at <hi>least</hi> to have their labour lost upon
their People, whose Examples do not back and inforce
their Doctrine. If we are not such <hi>our selves,</hi> as
we tell <hi>them,</hi> as they hope to be saved, <hi>they</hi> must
be, each of them will be ready to make this shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Reflexion, upon our Sermons and good Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Cur verba audio, cum facta</hi> non <hi>videam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95574:14"/>And particularly, as to this duty of <hi>loving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>
it will be in vain to use Arguments with
our Flocks to stir them up hereunto, while they
perceive us wanting in any of the Necessary instances
and Expressions of Love: I mean <hi>such</hi> as are within
our own power.</p>
               <p>And I say <hi>this,</hi> because a Multitude of our Clergy are,
God knows, in very sorry Circumstances to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,
in that great Expression of Love, <hi>Alms-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
I much doubt, that the far <hi>greater</hi> Part have
not wherewith to be so. Nay 'twould pity any
good Man to see, how many of them are reduced
to such Streights (especially of late years) as to
want a Competent Subsistence for themselves and
Families. And 'tis very sad to Observe what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
is by this means brought upon their Holy,
their Honourable Function. <hi>Necessitas cogit ad turpia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this puts me in mind to wish, that the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Clergy were better Considered, in the
<hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>other</hi> impositions, than it lately hath
been.</p>
               <p>What I have now suggested, I am too well Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the belief of, by the sad Informations I
have received, and Observations I have made, up
and down in my own <hi>Diocese:</hi> Which yet, I think,
is not the poorest in the Nation.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I would mind you, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95574:15"/>
not only that the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
of all Persons, to be Exemplary in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>all other,</hi> but the <hi>Sons</hi> too of the
Clergy are in an Especial manner obliged here to, upon
the account of their coming out of the Loyns of
<hi>such Parents,</hi> and their having generally had so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Educations, as they are to be supposed to have.</p>
               <p>Next to the Faults of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> those of their
<hi>Children</hi> are exceeding Scandalous; Nothing being
more common, than for Prophane People, and such
as catch at all Opportunities, to cast Dirt upon
our Excellent Religion and Church, to charge the
Sins of such upon their Parents <hi>loose</hi> Education of
them. Nor is any thing more Ordinary, than for
People to Encourage themselves to do Evil, by the
bad Examples of the <hi>Children</hi> of their Teachers, as
well as of their Teachers themselves. These <hi>two</hi>
things, it is likely, the Apostle had a Special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to, in making it a necessary Qualification of
an Elder, to have <hi>faithful Children, not accused of
Riot, or unruly,</hi> as well as to be <hi>blameless himself,</hi> and
the <hi>Husband of one Wife;</hi> Titus 1. 6.</p>
               <p>But in reference to this duty of <hi>Love,</hi> I will repeat
what I now said, <hi>viz.</hi> What remains, but that we
Endeavour to practise it with all our might. That
<hi>All bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
evil-speaking, be put away from us, with all malice.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95574:15"/>
And <hi>that we be kind one to another, tender-hearted,
forgiving one another; Even as God for Christ</hi>'s <hi>sake
hath forgiven us:</hi> According to the earnest Advice of
the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31, 32. That <hi>we be kindly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned
one to another,</hi> notwithstanding any differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Opinion, <hi>with Brotherly love in Honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
one another;</hi> As the same Apostle Exhorts,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10. Oh how many pressing and powerful
Motives to this duty of <hi>Love, Vniversal Love, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Charity,</hi> doth the New Testament, and Natural
Reason too, present us with!</p>
               <p>But I will <hi>now</hi> onely Observe to you, that
what <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Sinues,</hi> are to our <hi>Natural</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that is <hi>Love</hi> in all Bodies <hi>Politick,</hi> 'Tis
<hi>Love,</hi> above all things, which Cements and
holds together Societies and Communities. And
therefore <hi>another</hi> short and sad Digression is here too
Seasonable, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis a Wonderfull thing, that this
Church and Kingdom should not long since have
been utterly Broken to pieces, as they hath <hi>both</hi> been
miserably shattered, by means of our most <hi>Vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
and indeed <hi>Inhumane</hi> Breaches; by means of
our having so banished Love: Not onely <hi>Christian,</hi>
but <hi>Natural</hi> Love, in a very great measure: Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Vniversal</hi> Love, but Love to <hi>one another,</hi> taking
that Phrase in the most <hi>restrained</hi> Sense. We should
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95574:16"/>
before <hi>now</hi> have been Wofull Examples of the Truth
of that observation of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>A City or
Kingdom, divided against it self cannot stand, but is
brought to Desolation,</hi> had it not been prevented by
a <hi>Series,</hi> a long <hi>Train</hi> of such Providences, as have
scarcely been <hi>much</hi> short of Miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Desolation</hi> is the Natural Consequent of great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
of Divisions not <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>Ours</hi> have long
been. If <hi>ye bite and devour each other, take heed ye
be not Consumed one of another,</hi> said S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
divided <hi>Galatians,</hi> ch. 5. 15. But especially is it so,
as Divisions give a mighty Advantage to a <hi>Common</hi>
Enemy. And therefore nothing can hinder their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing
this Effect, but a <gap reason="foreign">

Oh what a History of <hi>such</hi> Interpositions have these

Dangerous Condition are <hi>those</hi> People in, who have
<hi>little</hi> to Encourage their hopes with, but the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi>
of Extraordinary Providences! And especially
when they have no other Reason still to Expect them,
but because they have had so <hi>many</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>But, alass, <hi>we</hi> of <hi>all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> People have the <hi>least</hi> cause still
to depend upon them, because no <hi>Visible</hi> good Effect
upon us, hath been produced by them; We <hi>will</hi> not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95574:16"/>
be Reformed in any <hi>One</hi> instance. And <hi>particularly,</hi>
we <hi>will</hi> still Obstinately persevere in our Old <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to one another,</hi> which daily <hi>Encreaseth</hi> too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>abating,</hi> Let <hi>God Almighty</hi> do what He <hi>will,</hi>
and a <hi>Formidable Enemy</hi> do what he <hi>can,</hi> to make us
Friends. But I must not lengthen out any father so
Melancholy a Digression, since we are now met up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so Pleasant an Occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore I add, that</hi> Love <hi>is the main thing,
that makes such</hi> Meetings as these, <hi>and our</hi> Eating
and Drinking together, <hi>a true Pleasure.</hi> Better, <hi>saith
King</hi> Solomon, <hi>is</hi> a Dinner of green Herbs, where love
is, than a Stalled Ox, and Hatred therewith.</p>
               <p>And as Love makes Meetings of this nature, very
pleasant Diversions, so the professed Design of them
being to <hi>Encrease</hi> Friendship, and to Express Love by
shewing <hi>Mercy,</hi> it makes them highly <hi>Commendable</hi>
and <hi>Praise-worthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of <hi>All</hi> Works of Mercy there is no one more
Acceptable to our Heavenly Father and Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as is Evident from what hath been said, than that
of Comforting <hi>distressed Widows,</hi> and <hi>making their
Hearts to sing for joy;</hi> and Taking Care of poor <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,</hi>
and Enabling them to live Comfortably and
usefully in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95574:17"/>And the Relief of the poor Widows of <hi>Clergy men;</hi>
and providing for their helpless Children, being the
onely Design of our being <hi>Incorporated,</hi> let <hi>their</hi>

of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Latter</hi> of these Charities, <hi>viz.</hi> That
which relates to the poor <hi>Children</hi> of deceased Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
being the Special Design of these Annual As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
may <hi>This</hi> at least <hi>Equalize</hi> each of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
ones, in this Excellent Work!</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Courts of Assistants,</hi> and <hi>Stewards of these

of Abundance of our Clergy, by the Vast
Number of their Widows and Children, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Condition is, year after year, laid before
them. And tho' the Bounty which Worthy persons
have from time to time deposited in our <hi>Treasurers</hi>
hands, be very Considerable, yet 'tis grievous to see
how <hi>little</hi> falls to the Share of particular Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
by reason of their Excessive Number.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>Parade,</hi> which makes such a noble
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95574:17"/>
shew on <hi>these days,</hi> in our Streets, any Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
what I have sadly observed to you; since it
would be very strange, if so many Thousands of
Ministers as our Church consists of, should not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi>
produce a very great Number, whose Natural
parts, and Liberal Educations, have Enabled them,
to improve the Advantages put into their hands by
the Good providence of God, to the Arriving at ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plentifull Fortunes. And, upon a just Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I doubt not but it will be found, That there
are Extremely Few of the Sons of the Clergy,
whose large Circumstances in the World are owing
to their <hi>Patrimony,</hi> in Comparison of <hi>those</hi> who are
inriched, by the Blessing of God, upon their <hi>own</hi>
Industry.</p>
               <p>I hope I need not tell <hi>such,</hi> how much they are
Obliged in Gratitude to their Great Benefactor,
for making such a difference between <hi>them,</hi> and
<hi>most</hi> of their Brethren, To be Liberal in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
towards the Relief of the <hi>Necessitous</hi> part of
them.</p>
               <p>And this is the most Effectual Course you can
possibly take, to secure Gods Blessing to <hi>your</hi> Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and to prevent their Ever Coming into the
Number of Petitioners for Charity.</p>

                  <hi>And, which is a far greater Consideration, being
Compassionate towards</hi> Widows <hi>and the</hi> Fatherless is
<hi>such a sort of Charity, as will make those who are
in love with it, the Happy Objects of Gods Special
Love.</hi> Be as a Father to the Fatherless, saith the Son
of <hi>Syrach,</hi> and instead of an Husband unto their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so shalt thou be as the Son of the most High,
and He shall love thee more than thy Mother doth.</p>
