         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

within a bow-draught or

where the Botes arriue, direct

steip Rock, whose fore-front ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so oppen to the Sea, and opposite to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is so beatten therewith, as that his superficiall
parts are become so friable, and as it were rotten to

            <p>All this whole craig from the top to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
is so seamed, and as it wer embroydered with
a number of whyte veines much resembling a soft

            <p>This faire Spring (albeit but laitlie knowne) is
approved by the people which drink thereof, to be
one of the most rare remedies for the <hi>Stomach</hi> in
the world, gives a good appetit to meate, maketh
one that loaths of his meate to be hungrie, and is
the onlie remedie for <hi>Chronick,</hi> &amp; lingring disseases,
specialie in those who having spoilled their stomach
by superfluous drying of Cuppes.</p>
            <p>It is a most confortable &amp; refreshing drink in all

abounds.</p>
            <p>It refresheth and cooleth a hott distemper of ye

making them to discend without paine.</p>
            <p>To some it louseth the belly verie freelie, but not

            <p>I haue knowne some vomit therewith, but that

            <p>These bee the Physical properties of this faire

the desire of my freinds and acquaintence, &amp;
partlie to content my owne curiositie in naturall
things, wherunto from my youth I haue euer bein

my opinioun without contentioun, reserving the
resolution thereof to my most learned colleagues,
much more judicious than my selfe.</p>
            <p>I, at the first, as also many others, thought it but
ane idle toy, &amp; a conceit of the people, and as some
think it yet. Others, thought it a trick devysed by the
Ferriers onlie for gaine. But seeing the fame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
incresse and that not by the meanest, but euen
of those of best credit, who long disseased, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
recovered their vnexpected health in their
owne persons. At length I begoud to think that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it was no vncouth thing in others countreyes
to haue such minerall waters, yet rare &amp; but of laite
knowne amongst vs. And althogh I call this a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb facs="tcp:15695:5"/>
water: yet my meaning is not to conclude that
it proceedeth of metall alone: for that as appeareth is
very poore in this craige: Notwithstanding that al
those riches of goulde and silver which are come
into <hi>Spaine</hi> since the west <hi>Indies</hi> were discovered,
haue beine drawne out of such barrane places which
are full beare and fruitles, as this rotten rock seims
to bee. Yea all the ponderous spar inclyneth rather
towards the bottome, a signe doutles which argueth
no rich metall.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph Acesta</hi> Hist. natur. and Moral. <hi>Lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>For it is found be experience that where
minerals are most ryfe, the higher the veines bee to
the superfice of the earth, the more rich they find it,
and the deiper it goeth, the poorer it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, if this water produce such Physicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
be reason of metals, Then all springs taking
their course through the richest metals should far
excell this, which runneth but through a verie poor
metall by appearence: yea that wholsome &amp; cauld
spring of the brayes of <hi>Arthrey,</hi> perteining to the
right honourable The Earle of <hi>Montrose</hi> should far
excell this of <hi>Kinghorne.</hi> I haue drunk of both wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters,
and in my opinion the one, might by the like
tryall prove as good as the other, &amp; perhaps better.</p>
            <p>For there, (no doubt) is a riche metall whose
seame and greate bodie reacheth directlie vpward
to the superfice of the mountaine, and there visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
vncovers it selfe towards the South, the seame
whereof is neere a foot and ane halfe in breadth, &amp;
consisteth in my judgement of <hi>Iron, Copper,</hi> and
<hi>Vitrioll,</hi> and no doubt of some <hi>Silver,</hi> accompanied
<pb facs="tcp:15695:6"/>
also with aboundance of a weghtie whyte spar, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidder
with that glancing and emplastie stone cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Gypsum,</hi> verie vsuall amongst the learned for
externall ruptures: which minerall spring (for no
doubt it is one amongst diverse others in this land)
if it ran as pleasandlie from the Rock as that of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghorne,</hi>
would be in as great request ere it were long.</p>
            <p>I must confesse that all springs having their course
through sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie grounds and rocks, minerals &amp; privie
veines of the earth, cannot but contract &amp; participat
of one Phisicall qualitie or other, resembling the
nature of the mettall through which it runneth.</p>
            <p>Neither needeth any man of solid judgement to
doubt, but that all springs of water taking their ishue
and race through a hard rock, are to be preferred to
any other water, taking way throgh a muddie earth:
so consequentlie all springs passing through a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Rock, (by reason) must farre excell that of no
minerall, I meane for curing of disseases: for such
waters are no wayes fit for dressing of meates, much
lesse to bee mixed with wine, because no minerall
water feedeth the bodie.</p>
            <p>Now that mettals haue beene of old used for phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
&amp; yet are wonderfull in curing disseases, is no
new thing, as lykewise the infinite works of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

what shall wee thinck of the best sort of these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

to the best? but also excelleth so far footth

            <p>But to returne to our purpose concerning <hi>Niter.</hi>
Who then thincks that these <hi>Nitrous</hi> qualities, for
the most part doe not agree competentli with this
faire Spring; hath not well remarcked the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of the disseased: for how oppenlie is it known
to expell sand, and bring doune small stones both

aggree with <hi>Niter.</hi> It helpeth the dolour of the head
drawen vp as an <hi>Errhin</hi> at the nose, &amp; clengeth the

faire and cleene, healeth a reiffie and leprouse skine,
and in a word, maketh even Ladyes faire.</p>
            <p>Why may not then, I say, such detersiue and scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
qualities appeare rather to proceed of a drying
and saltish <hi>Nitrositie,</hi> than of any apparent mettall
in that place; in respect it not onlie purgeth, and
clengeth the bodie, as well inward as outward, but
also clengeth and purgeth tasches and spottes, both
from linning &amp; wollen, and which detersive power
doeth more agree with the vse of <hi>Niter,</hi> than with

            <p>And hath it constipat some, and loosed others?
No wonder, for the Spring is possessed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

for if it did not bind, it could not helpe the lask &amp;
<hi>Dysenterie:</hi> And if it did not loose, it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue

Now because that some may object: if this water
had any <hi>Nitrous</hi> qualitie, it wold (no dout) bewray
it self, either in taist, colour, or savour? to which
I answer, that Physicall waters possesse either spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
qualities, or substantiall quantities, &amp; as there
bee diverse kynds of Salt, so are they diverse kynds
of saltish waters, which differ in their qualities by
degreis. For some be stronger, others mylder, some
sharper, and some sweeter, &amp; others so insipide that
skairslie are they felt on the tongue. And least I
shuld seeme to bee alone of this opinion without
warrand of the learned,<note place="margin">Cap. 9. de Therm. atque Metallis.</note> Heare what <hi>Fallopius</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of this same subject: <hi>Nitrum quidem ipsum, gustu
cognoscitur: difficile tamen est ex gustu discernere, an
aqua habeat in se Nitrum, quia Nitri sapor in ejusmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
aquis frigidis, non discernitur. Item visu nec olfactu

            <p>To bee short then let none think, but Springs of
waters may bee indued with diverse Physicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
minerall or semi-minerall qualities, althogh
they nether bewray them selfes in taist, colour, nor
savour.</p>
            <p>But how the, say others, can waters possessed
<pb facs="tcp:15695:16"/>
with saltish and <hi>Nitrous</hi> faculties, refresh, moysten,
and coole? I answer that a thousand effects in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causes, may also proceed of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie qualities:
for there be many exceptions even in naturall rules,
so that sometymes wee see by experience subtile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so to ouerreach and surpasse the skill of arte
in these kynds of mixtures, that simples, natuallie
hote &amp; dry of them selfes, by the companie of others
which coole and refresh, are sensiblie felt to excute
colde ffects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi> a worthie and judicious Spanyard
in his naturall and morall historie which he writeth
of the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 11, Natur Hist.</note> discoursing vpon the
naturall qualitie of the Sea, writteth in these termes:
Althogh, sayeth hee, the water bee salt, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
water, whose nature is ever to coole, and it
is a remarkable thing in nature, that in the midst
of the deepe of the Oceane, the water is not made
hote, by the violent heat of the Sunne, as in rivers:
even as <hi>Salpeter</hi> (sayeth hee) althogh it bee natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
salt) hath a propertie to coole water, even so
wee see by experience, that in some ports and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
the salt water refresheth, which wee haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in that of <hi>Callao</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> whereas they put
the water or wyne which they drinck into the Sea
in flaggons to bee refreshed, whereby wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie
beleeue, that the Ocean hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie,
to temper and moderat the excessiue heate:
for this cause wee find greater heat at land then at
sea, (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie countryes lying

neere the Sea, ar colder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those that ar foorther off.</p>
