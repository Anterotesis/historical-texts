         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Confeſſe all Travellers are not

themſelves in contemplation of the

affected with.</p>
            <p>As to my ſelf, although during
the ſpace of 16 yeaves travel, I
might have inlarged, according to
the curioſitie and opportunitie I have
had in the rehearſal of many rare
and exquiſite things verie obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
yet my chiefe aime was to make
ſuch remarks, as might moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the common good of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57018:6"/>
ſociety and Civil life, in taking
notice of the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
of the ſeveral <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
where I have been, viz. The

Sweden,</hi> and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
whoſe natural temper and
diſpoſition ſeemed to me moſt to
ſympathiſe with our <hi>English nation,</hi>
and thereby have an occaſion to do
ſome good to my own countrie.
Expect not <hi>Reader</hi> alike punctualnes,
as to all the forementioned places,
becauſe verie many things which I
might have obſerved, are much
agreeing, and ſo may be referred,
to what ſhal be ſpoken of the <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
and <hi>Goverment</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi>
which, for reaſons I ſhal by and by
hint at, is the Chieſe End I aimed
at in this treatiſe.</p>
            <p>We wil begin then in the firſt
place with the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and Dominions of the
<hi>States General</hi> which for ſome yeares
hath bin in a declining condition,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57018:7"/>
and their forces exceedingly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned,
by reaſon of that fatal war
it managed againſt <hi>England, France</hi>
and the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> unto
which if we ad the Inteſtime diviſions
of thoſe two factions, the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Loveſtein,</hi> that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
body</hi> was ſo tottered and torn,
as did threaten its utter and total
ruine.</p>
            <p>But as bodies whither <hi>natural</hi> or
<hi>Politick,</hi> after that a violent fit hath
ſore ſhaken, diſſipated and exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
their ſpirits, may recover vigor
and look-lively again, if ſo be the
radical conſtitution and natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
be not wholie changed and
depraved: even ſo This <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
of <hi>Holland</hi> hath viſibly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ſtrength again, and probaly
may attain to its former <hi>force</hi> and
<hi>Luſtre,</hi> except ſom depravation in its
vital humous ſhould ſtil keep it
languiſhing, and obſtruct its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
cure.</p>
            <p>We wil therefore make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57018:7"/>
as to the defects and faylings
(obſerved not onely by me but alſo
by others) which that famous <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi>
hath of late yeares bin
guiltie of: which I ſhal doe not out
of any malice or diſigne of reflection,
the intention of writing this treatiſe
being ſimplie to inſert thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults,
which the wiſeſt of Authors
have alwayes Judged neceſſarie not
onely for the reformation of this,
but of all <hi>ſtates</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi>
hath worthily bin the wonder of all
Europe during this laſt age, and
perhaps not to be paralled in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of former tymes: for if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how many yeares it was aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the then moſt <hi>Potent Prince</hi>
of <hi>Europe,</hi> who aſpired to no les then
the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Empire,</hi> and that how
formidable ſoever he were, yet they
not onely maintained their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but with uninterrupted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie
and ſuccesfulneſſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
their trade, and ſpread their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57018:8"/>
conqueſts in all the foure parts of the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf though moſt famous
and victorious, yet could not, as
is believed, in ſo ſhort a time do,
what by this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> hath
bin effected. In <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Affrica</hi>
they ſoon forced the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and
<hi>Portugeſes</hi> to yeeld to them moſt of
their trade and poſeſſions. And tho
<hi>England</hi> put in for a ſhare, yet they
were a long while vigourouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to this
hour have enough to do, to keep
what they have gotten: ſo that in
leſſe then an hundred years this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi>
by their induſtrie and art
in trading, are becom ſo exceſſive
rich and potent that they began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
and would needs be Arbitraters
to their neighbouring <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>States,</hi> and encroach upon their
<hi>Territories</hi> and <hi>Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This drew upon them that fatal
war before mentioned, by which they
were ſorely weakned and brought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57018:8"/>
ſo low, that except God by a more
then ordinarie <hi>Providence</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
and appeared for them, they
had certainly bin ruinated and never
able to recover themſelves again,
however their pride hereby was much
abated: And as Luxurie and laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes

            <p>That this Commonwealth hath
much recovered its ſtrength, may
clearly appeare, if we conſider what
great things they have effected, ſince
the little time they have enjoyed
peace: They have in leſſe then 7 yeares
built about 40 gallant ſhips of war;
They have laid out vaſt ſums of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in refortifying <hi>Narden, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,
Breda,</hi> the <hi>Grave</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places: They have payd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57018:9"/>
vaſt ſums of money to their Allies
for their auxiliarie troopes, as alſo
200000 pound ſterling to the King
of England to Enjoy their peace
with him. And beſides all this
their Encreaſe in Riches and power
may be gueſt at, by the many ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
houſes built within theſe 5 years
in Amſterdam, Rotterdam and
other places; to all which we may
ad, to what exceſſive hight the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indie</hi>
Companie are riſen, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
from the Sates are ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as to ſecuritie, that they Can
get as much money as they pleaſe
at 2 <hi>Per cent:</hi> not to ſpeak, of the
Exceeding encreaſe of their ſubjects,
occaſioned by the <hi>French Kings</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
againſt the diſtreſſed <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
in <hi>France, Alſace</hi> and other

we ſpeak of other ſignes of the
encreaſe of this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as
not Judging it convenient to commit
them to paper, but wil now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57018:9"/>
to ſhew the Method of Living
and travelling in the Dominions and
places of the <hi>States,</hi> which if you do
wel conſider you May ſee, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
and eaſie the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
is, above that of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brill</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> is the Uſual
place where the <hi>Packet</hi> and Kings
<hi>pleaſure boats</hi> bring on ſuch as come
for to ſee the United Provinces:
here be ſure to furniſh your ſelf wel
with money. From hence you take a
boat to <hi>Maſeland Sluce</hi> or <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
which if you goe in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
with others, wil only coſt you
5 ſtivers: but if you take one for
your ſelf, wil coſt 25. ſtivers for
<hi>Maſeland Sluce,</hi> and a <hi>Ducaton</hi> to
<hi>Rotterdam.</hi> The Fifth part of which
goes to the <hi>States</hi> for a tax, they call
<hi>Paſſagie Gelt:</hi> and the other 4 parts
are for the boat Men or Shippers,
who alſo out of their gaines muſt Pay
a <hi>tax</hi> to the <hi>States,</hi> ſo that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
you pay a fift pennie to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57018:10"/>
               <hi>States</hi> for your travelling either in
boats by water, or in waggons by
land.</p>
            <p>As you paſſe by <hi>Maſeland Sluce</hi>
you'l ſee a verie faire fiſhing village,
to which belong near two hundred
<hi>Herring Buiſſes,</hi> but if you goe by
the way of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> you ſail by
two old Townes Called <hi>Flardin</hi> and
<hi>Schiedam:</hi> yet let me adviſe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you depart from the <hi>Bril,</hi> to
take a ſerious view of it, as beeing
the citie which in <hi>Queen Eliſabeths</hi>
time was one of the <hi>Cautionarie
Townes</hi> pawned to <hi>England.</hi> The
<hi>Brill</hi> had a voyce among the <hi>States,</hi>
but by reaſon <hi>Rotterdam</hi> hath got
away their Trade, by which having
loſt its former luſtre, is now become
afiſhing town onely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rotterdam</hi> is the ſecond Citie
for trade in <hi>Holland</hi> and by ſome is
caled <hi>little London,</hi> as having vaſt
traffick with <hi>England,</hi> in ſo much
that many of the citiſens ſpeak good
Engliſh. There are in this citie two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57018:10"/>
conſiderable Churches of Engliſh
and Scotch: and how great a
trade they drive with the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Englands</hi> ſubjects is evident, for
in the yeare 1674 at the opening of
the waters after a great froſt, there
departed out of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> 300 Sail
of Engleſh, Scotch and Iriſh Ships
at once with an Eaſterly wind: And
if a reaſon ſhould be demanded how
it coms to paſſe, that ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Ships ſhould frequently com
to that haven? It is eaſilie anſwered,
becauſe they can ordinarily Load
and unload, and make returns to
England from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> before
a Ship can get clear from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
and the <hi>Texel:</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Engliſh Merchants find it
Cheaper and more commodious for
trade, that after their goods are
arrived at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> to ſend their
goods in boats Landward in, to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This citie is famous as beeing the
place where Great <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57018:11"/>
born, whoſe Statue of Braſſe ſtands
erected in the Market place; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the buldings here are not ſo
ſuperb as thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam, Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
or <hi>Harlem,</hi> yet the places worth
the ſeeing, are, firſt the <hi>Great Church</hi>
where Several <hi>Admirals</hi> Lay State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Entombed, here you ſee their
<hi>Admiralitie, Eaſt Indie,</hi> and <hi>Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi>
together with that caled, <hi>het
Gemeen Lands Huis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> you may for 5
ſtrivers have a boat to bring you to
Delph, but before you com thither
you paſſe thro a faire village called
<hi>Overſchie,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>English</hi> youths are trayned up in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terautre,
as to the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
tongue, <hi>Booke keeping,</hi> &amp;c: from
thence in the ſame boat you com to
<hi>Delph</hi> which is famous for making
of Porceline to that degree, that it
much reſembles the China, but
onely it is not tranſparent.</p>
            <p>In Delph is the great <hi>Magaſin</hi> of
<hi>Arms</hi> for the whole <hi>Province</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57018:11"/>
               <hi>Holland:</hi> Their churches are verie
large, in one of which are <hi>Tombs</hi> of
the <hi>Princes of Orange, Admiral
Tromp</hi> and General Morgans Ladie,
and in the Cloyſter over againſt the
Church you have an Inſcription in a
Pillar of Braſſe, ſhewing after what
manner <hi>William</hi> the 1, that famous
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Shot to death
by a miſcreant <hi>Jeſuiſt,</hi> with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delph</hi> hath the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> voyce in the
<hi>States of Holland,</hi> and ſends its
Deputies unto the Colledge of the
<hi>States General,</hi> and to all other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> They
have alſo a Chamber in the <hi>Eaſt-Indie
Companie,</hi> as ſhal be more
largely ſpoken to, when we ſhal com
to treat of the State of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Delph</hi> you may by boat be
brought to the <hi>Hague</hi> for 2 Stivers
and an halfe: Which is accounted
the faireſt Village in the world, both
for Pompous buildings and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57018:12"/>
thereof; Here the <hi>Princes of
Orange</hi> hold their Reſidence: as
alſo the <hi>States General</hi> and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of State,</hi> Here you have the
<hi>Courts of Juſtice, Chancerie,</hi> and
other <hi>Courts of Law.</hi> Here you
ſee that <hi>Great Hall,</hi> in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hundreds of coulers are hung
up in <hi>Trophie,</hi> taken from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
Spaniard</hi> and other <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi>
with whom they have waged
war. There <hi>Councel Chambers</hi> are
admired by all that ſee them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
faire <hi>Libraries</hi> they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to particular men. The
<hi>Princes Pallace</hi> is a moſt ſuperb
building, And there are many coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Gardins adjoyning to the <hi>Hague,</hi>
together with that to the <hi>Princes
houſe</hi> in the <hi>Woad,</hi> in which houſe
are in a large Hall the moſt rare and
coſtly Pictures of Europe, there alſo
are thoſe magnificent and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gardins of the Heer <hi>Bentham,</hi>
of <hi>Ameſland</hi> and others. I might here
ſpeak of the ſplendor of the <hi>Prince</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57018:12"/>
of <hi>Orange</hi> his <hi>Court,</hi> of his noble
virtues and valour, of the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Beautiful Princeſſe his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
conſort, but I dare not, leaſt I
ſhould infinitely fal ſhort of what
ought to be, and which others
have alreadie don before me: and
therfore leaving the <hi>Hague,</hi> I ſhal
onely tel you that from thence
you may for 7 Stivers have a boat
to bring you to <hi>Leyden. Leyden</hi>
is a faire and great citie, and the
Univerſitie is verie famous, beeing
frequented by 1000 of Students from
all parts, as <hi>Hungarie, Poland,
Germanie,</hi> yea from the <hi>Ottomans
Empire</hi> it ſelf, who pretend to be
grecians, beſides the Engliſh, Scots
and Iriſh, who this years were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to be above 80.</p>
            <p>The moſt remarkable things here
to be ſeen, I ſhal ſummarilie ſet
down: As the place called the <hi>Bergh,</hi>
formerly a <hi>Caſtle</hi> belonging to the
Prince of <hi>Liege</hi> in <hi>Flanders:</hi> The
<hi>Stathowſe,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie</hi> Schooles,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57018:13"/>
ſpecially that of the <hi>Anatomie,</hi>
which excels all the <hi>Anatomie</hi>
Schooles in the world, a Book of the
rarities whereof you may have for 6
Stivers, their <hi>Phyſick Garden,</hi> and
the Profeſſors <hi>Cloſet</hi> are al raviſhing
in rare Curioſities. But as to their
<hi>Colledges,</hi> they are but two and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſmall, not to be compared with
the ſmalleſt <hi>Hals</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have they any endowments,
their maintenance being onely from
the charitable collections of the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> neyther
are any Students to remain longer
there, then til they attain the degree
of <hi>Batchelers</hi> of <hi>Art:</hi> One of the
Curators beeing demaunded by me,
why ſo rich a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> as
<hi>Holland</hi> is, did not build and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<hi>Colledges</hi> after the manner of
<hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> anſwered
they had not ſo many able and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
ſpirited men as are in <hi>England,</hi>
and to deal plainly with you, ſaid
he, had we ſuch <hi>Colledges,</hi> our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57018:13"/>
               <hi>Burgemaſters</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>
would fil them with their own and
their friends ſons, who by leading
a lazie and idle life would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
capable to ſerve the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and therefore he judged it
much better to put them to Penſion
in Burgers howſes, leaveing them
to the care of the Profeſſors, who
are verie diligent in keeping the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
at their exerciſes, both at
Publick lectures and in their private
howſes alſo, where they cauſe them
Punctually at their appointed houres
to come to their examinations and
lectures, beſides thoſe they have in
Publick. Their churches are rare,
ſo are the walks round the citie, and
the fortifications verie pleaſing to
behold. Here you have the <hi>River
Rhine</hi> running through the citie and
falling into it from <hi>Catwyckop Zee.
Leyden</hi> is verie famous in hiſtorie,
for the long Siege it held out againſt
the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> From hence for twelve
ſtivers and an half you are brought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57018:14"/>
to <hi>Harlem</hi> by water, being twelve
Engliſh miles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harlem</hi> is famous in that <hi>Coſtor</hi>
one of their Burgers, firſt invented
the <hi>Art of Printing.</hi> This <hi>Coſtor</hi>
beeing ſuſpected to be a Conjurer,
was fain to flee from <hi>Harlem</hi> to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and there Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
his Invention, having in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
onely found out the way of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on one ſide of the Paper. The
firſt book he ever printed is kept in
the <hi>Stathouſe,</hi> for thoſe that are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to ſee it. Here is one of the
faireſt and largeſt Churches of the 17
Provinces, in the wals whereof there
remain to this day ſticking <hi>canon
Bullets,</hi> ſhot by the Spaniards du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Siege thereof. In this
Church are three <hi>Organs,</hi> as alſo
the model of the three Ships, that
ſayled from <hi>Harlem</hi> to. <hi>Damiater,</hi>
ſeaſing the Caſtle in which the Earl
of <hi>Holland</hi> was kept priſoner, and
brought him away to <hi>Holland:</hi> In
the <hi>Tower</hi> of this Church hang two

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s which they alſo brought
from thence, and now ring them
everie night at nine a clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harlem</hi> is renowned for making
the fineſt linnen cloth, Tyfinies
Dammasks and ſilk Stufs; alſo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and Tapes; They have Mils
by which they can weave fortie and
50 Pieces at a time, they make the
fineſt white thread and Tapes for
lace in the whole world, there <hi>Blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries</hi>
ſurpas al other whatſoever,
their waters whitening cloath better
then any in the ſeventeen Provinces:
They have a moſt pleaſant grove like
a little <hi>Wood,</hi> divided into Walks
where on Sondays and holly dayes
the Citiſens of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and other
places come to take their pleaſure.
<hi>Harlem</hi> is the ſecond citie of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and ſends in <hi>Deputies</hi> unto all
the <hi>Colledges</hi> of the <hi>Gouvernment.</hi>
From hence you have a paſſage by
boat to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for ſix ſtivers,
but when you are come half way you
muſt ſtep out of one boat to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57018:15"/>
another, where you ſee a Stately
<hi>Pallace,</hi> where the Lords, called
<hi>Dykgraves</hi> ſit, Everie one of theſe
Lords hath his <hi>Apartment</hi> when he
coms for the concerns of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dykes,
and bancks: here are alſo
2 large <hi>Sluces</hi> having gates to let in
or out water from the <hi>Harlemmer
Meer.</hi> Near this place about Ano:
1672 a part of the Seabanck was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a ſtrong Northweſt wind,
drowning all the land betwixt <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
and <hi>Harlem,</hi> which coſt an
incredible vaſt ſum to have it repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
They ſunck in this breach 400
ſmal veſſels fild with earth and ſtones
for a foundation to rebuild the wel
upon, and by unſpeakable induſtrie
and charges at laſt repaired the Banck.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſpeak of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
which having bin the place of
my abode for ſeveral years, I ſhal
give a more large and punctual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof then I doe of other
places; It is eſteemed by Intelligent
men the ſecond citie in the world for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57018:15"/>
trade, and not inferiour to any in
wealth. Certainly <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is one
of the beautifulleſt cities in the
world, their buildings are large,
their ſtreets for the moſt part plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
planted with trees &amp; paved ſo
neatly, as is to be found no where els
in any other Countrie, ſave in ſome
of the 17 Provinces. And although,
as I have alreadie ſaid, <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
may Juſtly be taken for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
or third citie after <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Paris,</hi> yet it hath neither <hi>Courtnor
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie,</hi> as they have. And
now in treating of all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and virtues of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I
ſhal not hyperboliſe, or flatter: for
before I have don you ſhal ſee, I
ſhal alſo faithfully declaime againſt
the evils, miſtakes and vices in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſtands upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Morgans</hi> of Land, encompaſſed
with a verie ſtrong wal and <hi>Baſtions</hi>
moſt pleaſant to behold, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
large <hi>Burgaval</hi> or <hi>Gracht</hi> as they
cal it, for the defence of three parts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57018:16"/>
of the citie, the fourth being ſecured
by the ſea or <hi>Ty.</hi> There are 13
Churches in this citie for thoſe of
the reformed religion (called dutch
<hi>Presbiterians)</hi> to meet and worſhip
in, with two <hi>Frencb,</hi> one <hi>Highdutch</hi>
and one Engliſh, all <hi>Presbiterian</hi>
Churches, who onely are alowed
<hi>Bels,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> are
maintayned by the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> All
theſe Churches or congregations
make up onely a third part of the
Inhabitants of the citie: The <hi>Papiſts</hi>
who have eightie five howſes or
Chappels to meet in for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
make another third part, and
have a long ſquare of howſes for
their Nuns to live in, who are not
ſhut up in Cloyſters, as in Papiſts
countries they are wont to doe, but
may goe in and out at their pleaſure,
yea and marrie alſo if they grow
wearie of a <hi>Nunniſh</hi> life: Theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Papiſts have no bels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, beeing lookt upon as
conventicles, and are many times
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57018:16"/>
ſhut up, and again opened at the
<hi>Scouts</hi> pleaſure. The other third part
of the citie is made up by <hi>Jewes,
Lutherans, Arminians, Browniſts</hi>
or Engliſh <hi>Independents,</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
and the <hi>Quakers:</hi> None of which,
as was alſo ſaid of the Papiſts, have
bels allowed them, but are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Conventicles:</hi> and all that marie
amongſt them, muſt firſt be maried
by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and then if
they peaſe among themſelves in their
own aſſemblies, neyther are any of
them admitted unto any Office in
the Government, but onely ſuch
as are of the <hi>reformed</hi> or <hi>Preſbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> who are verie conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in the trade of this citie have
two <hi>Synagogues,</hi> one whereof is the

            <p>
               <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for the wiſe <hi>Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
it hath produced, is ſaid to be a
ſecond <hi>Athens:</hi> others make it the
<hi>Storehowſe</hi> or Magaſin of <hi>Europe,</hi>
for that it hath ſuch great ſtore of
Corne, wherewith it furniſhes
many other nations. And ſecondly
for the exceeding great <hi>Magaſin</hi>
of Spices, which in antient times
the <hi>Venetians</hi> brought by land, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but now
is don by the <hi>Eaſt-Indie</hi> Companie
which not onely ſupplyes <hi>Europe</hi>
therewith, but many places in the
Indies alſo. Thirdly it hath incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
ſtore of al manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for war, In ſo much that
<hi>England</hi> and divers other nations
ſend to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to buy <hi>Arms,
Bufcoats, Belts, Match &amp;c:</hi> yea
here are ſeveral <hi>Shopkeepers</hi> who can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57018:17"/>
deliver <hi>Armes</hi> for 4000 or 5000
men, and at a cheaper rate then
can be got any where elſe, and this
they can doe by reaſon of their great
Induſtry in the Ingroſſing moſt of
the Iron workes on the <hi>Rhine</hi> and
other Rivers which run into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Forthly <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath more
ſtore of ſawed and prepared Tymber
for ſhipping then can be found in any
one Nation in the world, and this is
the reaſon why her Neighbour town
<hi>Sardam</hi> is made capable of Building
ſhips 20 per cent cheaper then they
can doe in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France:</hi> So
that both <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> do
many times buy them in <hi>Holland:</hi> as
lately the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> bought 10
Capital Ships of the two Brothers the

<hi>Amſterdam</hi> is the ſtaple where the

to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to uſe in his mines

<hi>Amſtrerdam</hi> furniſheth not only

            <p>Sixtly <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>
where the <hi>French King</hi> bought
his Marble for <hi>Verſellis Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre,</hi>
and other of his <hi>Palaces</hi> in
<hi>France:</hi> There are ſuch Vaſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſins</hi>
in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> that a man
would think, that ſees them, there
were Quaries of <hi>Marble</hi> neare the
City Gates. Seaventhly <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
hath the moſt conſiderable
<hi>Bank</hi> that now is in the whole

both their <hi>Banks</hi> write not of ſo
much money in two dayes as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
doth in one: further I have
compared the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> with
<hi>Hamburg</hi> and find both thoſe <hi>Banks</hi>
fall very much ſhort with the bank
of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> There are many
other particulars I could name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as Arguments to prove the great
Riches &amp; Trade of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
as thoſe vaſt Quantities of Wynes,

I will ſay no more of her ſtores &amp;
Magazins, but ſhall in the next
place ſay ſome thing of her Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
&amp; Charitie to the Poore. I will
not ſpeake much of her Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
but only that they are in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
large and well built: In one
of them the <hi>States</hi> have Spared no
coſt to exceed the whole world in
3 things (Viz) an Organ with
ſets of Pipes that counterfit a Corus
of Voyces, it hath 52 whole ſtops
beſides halfe ſtops, &amp; hath 2 rowes
of Keyes for the feet, and three
rowes of Keyes for the Hands; I have
had people of Quality to heare it
play, who could not believe but
that there were men or Women
above ſinging in the Organ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57018:19"/>
they were convinced by goeing
up into the Organ Roome. The
ſecond is ſuch a large Carved Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
&amp; Canapie as cannot be found
elſewhere in the world; The
third is a Screene of braſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stathouſe</hi> in this Citty is a
wonderfull ſuperb Building, on
the uppermoſt part of which is a
large <hi>Magazin</hi> of <hi>Armes.</hi> The <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Statues</hi> that ſtand on top of the
<hi>Stathouſe</hi> are very large &amp; peeces
Exellently caſt, Eſpecially that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Atlas,</hi> who hath a <hi>Globe</hi> of the
world on his back that will hold 30
Barels of water, for me to ſpeake
of the ſeveral rarityes of <hi>Pictures,</hi>
Carved works &amp; marble in this Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
&amp; of the <hi>Globes Celeſtiall</hi> &amp;
<hi>Terreſtriall</hi> that are on the floor of
the <hi>great Hall,</hi> would make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Booke
of it ſelfe; I therefore will ſpeake
of their <hi>Almeshouſes</hi> &amp; of the
Government of the poore, of their
Priſons &amp; houſes of Correction.
This Citty is ſaid to have 20000
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57018:19"/>
poore Every day at Bed &amp; board.
The Almeshouſes are many &amp; look
more like <hi>Princes Palaces</hi> then Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
for poore people; Firſt there
are houſes for poor <hi>Ouldmen</hi> &amp;
<hi>Women,</hi> then a large ſquare <hi>Palace</hi>
for 300 Widdowes, then there
are <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> for Boyes &amp; Girles,
for Burgers Children &amp; for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Children, or thoſe cald <hi>Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
all theſe boyes &amp; girles have
Every ſonday &amp; other dayes of
Worſhip 2 doites given them by
the Fathers of theſe Houſes, the
which the Children put into the
Deacons ſack when they gather
for the Poore in the Churches;
Then there is an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for fooles,
&amp; a <hi>Bedlam:</hi> There are Houſes where
Common Beggers &amp; Gameſters &amp;
frequenters of <hi>Taphcuſes</hi> are Kept
hard at work: There is alſo a Houſe
called the Raſphouſe where petty
Theeues &amp; ſuch as flaſh one another
with Knives, ſuch as beg with
cheating deviſes, women with fained
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57018:20"/>
great Bellyes, men pretending to have
been taken by the Turk, others
that pretend wrack at ſea, &amp; ſuch as
beg with a Clapper or a Bell, as if
they could not ſpeake or heare,
ſuch as theſe are kept hard at work,
Raſping Every day 50 pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
2 of them, or Elſe are beaten
with a Bulls Piſſel, &amp; if yet thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
&amp; wont work, they are ſet in a
Tub where if they doe not pump the
water will ſwell over their heads;
Then there is a Houſe where whores
are Kept to worke, as alſo diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
Children who live Idle &amp;
take no courſe to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
likewiſe Women commonly
drinking themſelves drunck, and
ſcolds; Al theſe ſorts of <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> &amp;
<hi>Almeshouſes</hi> are Stately Buildings
richly adorned with Pictures &amp; their
Lodgings very neat &amp; cleane. In
ſome of the Boyes &amp; Girles <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
there are 1500, in ſome 800 &amp;
in ſome 500 in a Houſe; Then they
have Houſes where a man or a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57018:20"/>
Woman may have their Dyet, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; Lodging for his life,
giving a ſmall ſumme of money:
Theſe are called <hi>Brouders</hi> houſes,
the Almes Children of this citie are
held in ſuch Veneration &amp; reſpect
that a man had as good ſtrike a
<hi>Burgemaſters</hi> Child as one of them.
Theſe Children are permitted to
travel in any of the <hi>Treckſcuts</hi> freely
without money; Theſe Hoſpitals
are Governed by Men &amp; women,
as are of an unſpotted life &amp; repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be rich, devout &amp; pious,
it is very obſervable that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Governe their Women Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
better then the men do theirs
yea it is a General obſervation in this
Country, that where the Women
have the direction of the purſe &amp;
Trade, the husband ſeldom prove
Bankrupts, it being the propertie of
a true borne Hollands-wife preſently
after marriage to apply her ſelfe
wholly to her Buſineſs; but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to ſay any more of the Duch
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57018:21"/>
Houswives, for feare of diſpleaſing
our Engliſh Dames, not ſo much
addicted, at leaſt not ſo Generally
bred up to Induſtry; but to returne
to the Acts of Charitie of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam;</hi>
the which is ſo Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
that they ſurpas al other
Cittyes in the World, for they are
dayly &amp; houerly giveing to the
poore, Every Houſe in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
hath a Box hanging in a
Chaine on which is written <hi>Think
on the Poore,</hi> ſo that when any
merchant ſels Goods they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
conclude no bargain, but
more or leſs is put in the <hi>Poores
Box;</hi> Theſe Boxes art Lockt up
by the <hi>Deacons,</hi> who once a quarter
goe round the Citty &amp; take the
Money out of the Boxes. Then
twice a week there are men belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the Hoſpitals that goe round
the Citty &amp; ring a bell at every Houſe
to Know what the Maſter or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris
of the Houſe will give to the
Box, who Generally give not leſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57018:21"/>
then 2 ſtivers. Then every firſt We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densday
of the moneth the <hi>Deacons</hi>
in their turne goe round the Citty
from Houſe to Houſe to receive
what every houſe Keeper will give
to the Poore, Then on the week
before the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is given, a
<hi>Miniſter</hi> with an <hi>Elder</hi> goes round
the City to every Houſe where any
members of the <hi>Presbiterian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
live, &amp; there ask if any Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
be in the familie, offering
their ſervice to reconcile them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe
to Inſtruct &amp; prepare ſuch as
are to receive the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> At
this tyme a <hi>Miniſter</hi> may be ſeen to
goe into a <hi>Taphouſe</hi> or <hi>Taverne</hi> for
which at another tyme he would be
counted a <hi>wyne biber</hi> &amp; the worſt
of <hi>Reprobates;</hi> At this tyme while
theſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Elders</hi> goe about
the City on their <hi>Viſiations</hi> the
people take an Occaſion to give to
the Poore. And here I ought not
to omit telling you of their great
Charitie to the diſtreſſed <hi>French
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57018:22"/>
Proseſtants,</hi> who are here in great
Numbers. They maintaine no leſs
then 60 <hi>French Miniſters,</hi> &amp; unto
many handicraft Tradeſmen and
makers of ſtuffs, &amp; Cloath, they
lend ſums of Money without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt
to buy Working Tooles &amp;
materials for their work, but this
is no other then they formerly did
to the Poore diſtreſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
of <hi>Ireland</hi> &amp; <hi>Piemont,</hi> &amp; their
Charitie was not a littel that they
gave to <hi>Geneve</hi> towards the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their <hi>Fortifications;</hi> And here
give me leave to tell you what <hi>King
Charles</hi> the ſecond ſaid of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when the <hi>Duke
of Lotherdal</hi> heareing that the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Oranges</hi> Armie was not
able to oppoſe the french from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanting
ſo neare to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the
Duke Jeareingly ſaid that Oranges
would be very ſcarſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſhould fall into the
french hands to plunder, to which
his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> ſaid that he was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57018:22"/>
that God would preſerve <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
from being deſtroyed if it
were only for the great charitie they
have for the Poore, the which put
the Duke out of Countenance; I
will ſay no more of their Charitie,
only this that they leave no ſtone
unturned to bring moneyes into
the Poores ſtock, they make the
ſtage players pay 80000 Gilders a
yeare to the Poore: thert is not a
<hi>Ropedancer, puppetplayer</hi> or any
of that ſort of unneceſſary <hi>Vermin</hi>
which frequent faires, but pay the
3d penny to the Poore, which is
carefully looked after by placeing an
<hi>Almesman</hi> at the doore of the
Booths, to ſee that they cheat not
the Poore of their ſhare; I ſhall
now in the next place ſay ſome thing
of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> I meane thoſe called
the <hi>States Clergie,</hi> for the <hi>States</hi>
are abſolutely head of their <hi>Church,</hi>
&amp; when any ſynod of Divines meet,
two of the <hi>States,</hi> are alwayes preſent
to heare that they debate nothing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57018:23"/>
relating or Reflecting on the
Government, or Governers, if
they doe, preſently the <hi>States</hi> cry ho

thing relating to the Goverment in
their Pulpits they ſend them a briefe

are reſpected by the people as Gods
upon earth; They have a forme of

pray for the <hi>States</hi> &amp; <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
nor muſt they meddell with
any other Religion in the Country,
becauſe all ſorts are Tollerated, at

All thoſe called the <hi>Presbeterian</hi>
Miniſters or <hi>States</hi> Clergie are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
under a forfiture to have done
preaching &amp; praying by eleven of the
Clock in the forenoone on Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
becauſe then the <hi>Schepens</hi> goe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57018:23"/>
to the <hi>Stathouſe,</hi> to marry the <hi>Jewes
Papiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; others that
may not mary after the <hi>Calviniſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
forme, &amp; the reaſon why the
<hi>States</hi> thus marry them firſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to law, is to render their
Children Legitimate, but they may
marry againe afterward as they pleaſe
themſelves: none may marry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they have made their appearence
at the <hi>Stathouſe</hi> before the Lords,
where if the parties be agreed, the
Preachers marry the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> &amp;
the <hi>Schepens</hi> marry all the reſt, who
differ from the Religion eſtabliſhed
by Law.</p>
            <p>When one dyes the friends dare
not burry the Corps until it hath
lain three dayes open in the Coffen,
that the friends &amp; relations of the
deceaſed may be ſatisfied that the
party hath not been murdered or
reported to be dead when alive,
after 3 dayes the corps muſt be
brought to the church before the
Delceaſeth tolling, which is at two
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57018:24"/>
for if you Keepe the body untill
half three then the Church dores are
lockt &amp; for the firſt halfe houre
muſt be payd 25 Gilders, &amp; for the
ſecond 50, &amp; ſo untill ſix, then they
may amers you as much as they
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>There are many rich people who
make that default on purpoſe, that
they may have ſolemn occaſion of
giveing to the Poore, as I Knew
once an English merchant did.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall ſpeake of is
the method which the <hi>States</hi> obſerve
in ordering their Maritim affairs,
one of the greateſt myſteryes in
their Goverment; The States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
divide their <hi>Admiralty</hi> into five
Courts, which they call <hi>Chambers:</hi>
The firſt is <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (which is the
chamber called the <hi>Maſe)</hi> which
hath the <hi>Admirals</hi> Flagg.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Amſterdam</hi> which hath the
<hi>Vice-Admirals</hi> Flagg, &amp; <hi>Zealand</hi>
hath the <hi>reare Admiral</hi> Flagg, the
other two Chambers are thoſe in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57018:24"/>
               <hi>North Holland</hi> &amp; <hi>Frieſland:</hi> Each
of theſe five Chambers have their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals,</hi>
Vice <hi>Admirals</hi> &amp; reare <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals</hi>
apart from the <hi>States</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
Flaggs, ſo that when the
<hi>States</hi> have occaſion to ſet out a fleet
of an 100 Shipps more or leſs, every
<hi>Chamber</hi> Knowes the number they
muſt provide for their proportion,
tho in regard of its Opulencye <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
frequently helps her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
&amp; ads two or more Shipps then
their ſhare comes to; Theſe <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
have lately built 36 men of
war, &amp; now are building of 7 more
and all this is done without noiſe,
every one building their proportion,
&amp; they have admirable methods in
preſerving their Shipps when Built,
&amp; their Magazins are in good order
every Shipp haveing an <hi>appartment</hi>
to lay up all its <hi>Equipage</hi> in, &amp;
on the Top of their <hi>Magazins</hi>
are Vaſt <hi>Ciſterns,</hi> which are Kept
conſtantly full of water which have
<hi>pipes</hi> into every <hi>appartment</hi> to let
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57018:25"/>
down water upon any accident of
Fire, &amp; there is in their <hi>Magazins</hi> a
Nurſery Roome, where a Woman
keeps an Office to feed at certaine
houres of the day a great number
of Cats, which afterward hunt
among the ſtores for Mice &amp;
Ratts; This great <hi>Magazine</hi> in
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> was built in the tyme of
<hi>Cromwell</hi> in the ſpace of 9 moneths
&amp; 14 dayes, in which tyme the <hi>Lords</hi>
of the <hi>Admiraltie</hi> gave the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>drinkgelt</hi> as they call it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to work more then at
an ordinary rate. At this tyme the
biggeſt man of war the States had
was the <hi>Amelia,</hi> in which the famous
<hi>Amiral Trump</hi> was Kild, ſhee
was a Ship of no more then 56
Guns, afterward made a <hi>fire Ship.</hi>
But the <hi>States</hi> quickly diſcovered
their want of great Shipps, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
built the ſame yeare 20 men
of war, from 50 to 80 Gunns. But
the great Shipps built at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had like to have proved of no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57018:25"/>
uſe, had not theingenious <hi>Penſionarie</hi>
de <hi>Wit</hi> found out a deviſe to carry
them over the <hi>Pampus,</hi> betwixt
thoſe they call Water Shipps;</p>
            <p>The <hi>Admiralty</hi> have an Exellent
Method in ſetting out their Fleets,
they neither preſſe ſoldiers nor ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
all goe Voluntarie at the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of à Drumb, each Captain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
men &amp; Proviſions for his
Shipp, who after they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
orders from the Lords to the
<hi>Equipagemaſter</hi> to <hi>Equipe</hi> out
their Shipps, &amp; receive the Povi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of war, then the <hi>States</hi> ſend a
board each Shipp a <hi>Chaplin,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Check Maſter,</hi> who take care of
the proviſion of war, &amp; ſee that the
ſeamen have the <hi>States</hi> allowance &amp;
wholeſome food, &amp; great care is
taken by the <hi>Lords</hi> that both <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
&amp; <hi>Seamen</hi> receive their pay
punctually for the tyme they are in
the <hi>States</hi> ſervice, &amp; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
their ſeamen there is plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
on a Board hanging by the

foremaſt, the ſeveral rewards to
ſuch as either take or fire a <hi>Flagſhipp</hi>

&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſame methodes which the
<hi>States General</hi> obſerve, as to their
land obligations, &amp; goe throw this
great charge by the good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Credit, for tho it
be true that they are indebted great
ſummes of money, yet they never
want a ſupply, nay, Moneyes are
often forced upon them by rich
Merchants, who ſend in their,
moneys and only take the <hi>Admyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes</hi>
obligations, with which they
afterward pay their Cuſtomes, when
their Shipps arive, at which tyme the
<hi>Admiralty</hi> allowes them Intreſt for
the tyme they have had their money,
&amp; this is it that makes the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltyes</hi>
Obligations more valued then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57018:26"/>
ready money, for it ſaves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of telling, &amp; ſuch is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> that when they
have occaſion for any Goods, the
people ſtrive to furniſh them, &amp;
rather take their Obligations then
money, becauſe they get Intreſt;
&amp; all other aſſignments upon the
<hi>Admiralty</hi> are very punctually payd,
&amp; without Exchequer Fees, no they
are ſworne Officers who are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to receive any moneyes for fees,
being contented with the ſallary,
they have <hi>of the States.</hi> And their
Methodes uſed at the <hi>Cuſtome Houſe</hi>
for loading or unloading Shipps are
very eaſy, in ſo much that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Generally have the chargeing
&amp; diſchargeing the Shipps at the
<hi>Cuſtome Houſe,</hi> which is a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in the <hi>States</hi> to make Trade
eaſy for the Incouragement of the
Merchants; And the <hi>Admiralty</hi> are
very Gratefull &amp; Generous unto
their Commanders, if any of their
<hi>Admiralls,</hi> or <hi>Captains</hi> are Kild at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57018:27"/>
ſea &amp; have dove any Conſiderable

&amp; Children of thoſe as have
ſerved them faithfully &amp; Valiantly
in the wars, whilſt the Treacherous
&amp; Cowards meet with the ſeverity
they deſerve; I might here in the
next place in large &amp; tel you of the
Exellent methodes they have in
building &amp; preſerveing their Shipps
when built, but I ſhall refer you to
that Exellent peece written by the
<hi>Heer Witſen</hi> on that ſubject. And
ſhall now in the next place ſay ſome
thing of their famous Company
called the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company of
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> This <hi>Company</hi>
is ſaid to be a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> within
a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> &amp; it is true if you
conſider the Soveraigne Power &amp;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57018:27"/>
Priviledges they have granted them
by the <hi>States</hi> General, &amp; likewiſe
conſider their riches &amp; Vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſubjects, &amp; the many Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
&amp; <hi>Colonies</hi> they poſſeſs in
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> they are ſaid to have
30000 men in conſtant pay, &amp;
above 200 Capital <hi>Shipps,</hi> beſides
<hi>Sloopes, Catches,</hi> &amp; <hi>Yachts.</hi> This
<hi>Company</hi> hath by their Politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
&amp; ſedulons Induſtry poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of many <hi>Colonies</hi>
formerly belonging unto the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; <hi>Portugeeſes,</hi> &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<hi>Indian Princes,</hi> &amp; as good
Chriſtians have been at great Charge
in Planting the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
many parts there, Printing in the
Indian Language Bibles, &amp; Prayer
Bookes &amp; Catechiſmes, for the
Inſtruction of the <hi>Indians,</hi> mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineing
<hi>Miniſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
to inform thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith; And
now becauſe I have ſaid that this
<hi>Company</hi> is ſo conſiderable &amp; as it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57018:28"/>
were a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> apart, I will
demonſtrate it to be ſo, firſt by
their power, Riches &amp; ſtrength in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſecondly what figure
they make in <hi>Europe,</hi> &amp; this verie
briefly, for if I ſhould ſpeake of
every particular as to their poſeſſions
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> it would ſwell into
many Volumes, But I will only
begin with them at the <hi>Cape of de
Bonne Eſperance</hi> where they have
built a Royall Fort, in which they
maintaine a <hi>Garriſon</hi> of ſouldiers to
defend their Shipps which come
there to take in freſh Water; from
thence let us take a view of them
in the Iland of <hi>Java</hi> where they
have built a faire City called <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia</hi>
&amp; fortified it with <hi>Baſtions</hi>
after the Mode of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> This
City is the place of Reſidence of
their grand <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> called
the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> he hath
allowed him 6 <hi>Privie Councellers</hi> in
Ordinary &amp; 2 extraordinary, Theſe
governe the concernes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57018:28"/>
throughout the Indies, &amp;
They make peace &amp; war, ſend
ther Ambaſſadors to all parts thereof,
as occaſion requireth. This <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
hath his Guards of <hi>Horſe</hi> &amp;
<hi>Foot</hi> &amp; all ſorts of Officers &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
as if he were a ſoveraigne
<hi>Prince,</hi> the whole Expence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is defraied out of the Companys
ſtock. This <hi>General</hi> hath much
of the Direction of <hi>Bantam</hi> and
other parts of the Iland of <hi>Java:</hi>
From whence let us take a view of
them, in their great poſſeſſions in
the <hi>Moluceas</hi> Ilands &amp; thoſe of
<hi>Banda</hi> where they are become ſo
formidable that they looke as if
they aimed at the ſoveraingtye of
the <hi>Southſeas:</hi> They have alſo a
great Trade in <hi>China</hi> &amp; <hi>Japan,</hi>
from whence let us return to the
Ilands of <hi>Sumatra</hi> &amp; on the coaſt
of <hi>Bengale,</hi> where they have ſeveral
Lodges; In Perſia they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
great Commerce &amp; are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
that they wage war with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57018:29"/>
that mighty <hi>Monarch</hi> if he wrongs
them in their trade. They alſo have
ſeveral <hi>Colonies</hi> &amp; <hi>Lodges</hi> on the coaſt
of <hi>Malabar</hi> &amp; <hi>Cormandel,</hi> &amp; in
the Country of the Great <hi>Magul,</hi>
&amp; King of <hi>Galcanda,</hi> But princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
let us behold them in the rich
Iland of <hi>Zylon</hi> where they are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the plaine Country, ſo that
the <hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>King</hi> of that Iland
is forced to live in the Mountains
whilſt this Company poſſeſs the
City of Colomba &amp; other the moſt
conſiderable Garriſons of that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
It is ſaid that the Company
hath there in their pav 3600 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
&amp; at leaſt 300 Gunus plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their <hi>Forts</hi> &amp; <hi>Garriſons.</hi> In
a word they are not only maſters of
the <hi>Cinamon,</hi> but of all other <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
except <hi>Pepper</hi> &amp; that they would
alſo have, had it bin for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt
to Ingroſſe, but they wiſely
fore ſaw that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be a
Block in their way, therefore they
contented themſelves to be maſters
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57018:29"/>
the <hi>Mace, Cynamon, Cloves</hi> and
<hi>Nutmegs</hi> with which they not only
ſerve <hi>Europe,</hi> but many places in
the <hi>Indies;</hi> I will ſay no more of
them in the <hi>Indies,</hi> But let us
ſee what figure they make in <hi>Europe.</hi>
And firſt to begin with them in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
where they have two large
<hi>Stately Palaces,</hi> one being in the
ould part of the City, and the other
in the new; In that of the ould part
of the City they keep their Court,
and there ſits the Reſident Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittie
of the Company, where alſoe
they make the ſales of the Company
goods. There for ſix yeares the grand
Councel or aſſembly of the 17 doe
meet, and after ſix yeares are expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the grand Councel of the 17
doe aſſemble at <hi>Middelburg</hi> in Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
for two yeares, and then againe
returne to <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> The other
leſſer Chambers of <hi>Delph, Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
Horne</hi> and <hi>Enchuſen</hi> never
haveing the aſſembly of the 17 in
their Chambers, ſo that only <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57018:30"/>
and <hi>Zealand</hi> have the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of that <hi>grand Councel.</hi> I will
therefore crave leave to deſcribe
unto you the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
it being the moſt Conſiderable
of the Chambers, belonging to this
famous Company; In there houſe
or Palace within the ould City are
many large Offices or appartments,
as firſt on the Lower Floor is their
<hi>Parlement</hi> Chamber, where the 17
doe ſit: Next to this Chamber are
ſeveral faire Chambers for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes
to ſit in. They have alſo a
Chamber of Audience, where they
do receive <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,</hi>
or other great men as have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſpeak with them. In one
of theſe Chambers are the Armes
of ſeveral <hi>Indian Princes</hi> they have
Conquered. On the ſame Floor is
their <hi>Treſury Office,</hi> where their
Receivers ſit and receive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and pay out the orders or
aſſignments of the Company, Neer

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that Chamber ſits their grand
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57018:30"/>
Miniſter the Heer <hi>Peter van Dam,</hi>
who is ſaid to be a Second <hi>John de
Wit</hi> for parts, but he hath not one
drop of <hi>John de Wits</hi> or <hi>Loveſtine</hi>
bloud, againſt the good <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Orange;</hi> This great miniſter is a
man of Indefaigable Induſtry and
labor night and day in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes
ſervice; He reads over
twice the great Journal Bookes which
come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and out of
them makes minets to prepare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of concerne neceſſary to be
conſidered by the grand Councel of
the 17, and by the Inferiour <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes</hi>
of the Company, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
Inſtructions and orders to be
ſent to their <hi>Chief Miniſters</hi> in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> I could ſay many more things
of his great <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>Virtues,</hi> but
ſhall forbeare leaſt I ſhould be Judged
a flatterer: Overagainſt this great
Miniſters <hi>Office</hi> ſitt in a Chamber
many Clarkes or under Secretaryes,
who receive from this Miniſter their
Ordrs of diſpatches in the affaires of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57018:31"/>
Company, and next to this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is a <hi>Regiſter Office</hi> where are
kept the Journal bookes of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
where you may ſee the names
of al the men, and women that
have ever ſerved the Company in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> with the tyme of their
death, or departing the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
ſervice; Then next to that is
a Councel Chamber where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
Chamber or Committe of the
Company alwayes ſitts Then aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up ſtaires, there ſitt their Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
who keepe the accounts of
all the Tranſactions of thoſe that
buy or ſel actions of the Company,
and over againſt this office ſitts the
<hi>Heer Gerbrand Elias</hi> who is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Advocate of the Company: On
this floore are ſeveral large Roomes
in which are great ſtores of Packt
Goods, and alſo a Roome with all
ſorts of <hi>Drugs, Tee,</hi> and <hi>Wax,
Ambergreace,</hi> and <hi>Musk,</hi> and on
the ſame floore is a Chamber where
the <hi>Commisſiners</hi> ſitt who governe,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57018:31"/>
the <hi>Packhouſes;</hi> And next to them
ſitt their Clarks who keepe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters
of the ſales of the Company
Goods; And on the ſame Gallery
or Floore is a Chamber where are
kept the ſeverall Bookes of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
printed in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language
that are ſent to the ſeveral <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</hi>
of the Company: And at the
end of this Gallery is a <hi>Magazine</hi>
full of <hi>Medicaments</hi> and <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for Barber Chirurgions
Cheſts, to furniſh the Companyes
<hi>Shipps</hi> and <hi>Garriſons</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
Then aſſending up another paire
of ſtaires, there are ſeveral large
<hi>Magazins</hi> of <hi>Nutmegs, Cloves,
Mace</hi> and <hi>Sinamond,</hi> and in a
long Gallery are many men at
work ſorting of <hi>Spices</hi> fitt for
ſale. Then aſcending up another
paire of ſtaires there are many
Roomes full of <hi>Spices,</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſending
into the Court-yard there
is a <hi>Guard Chamber</hi> where every
night the houſe keeper hath a <hi>Watch,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57018:32"/>
and on the other ſide of the Gate
there is the <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> who with
his men prepares <hi>Medicaments</hi>
for the <hi>Indies;</hi> Adjoyning to
this Court-yard is their <hi>Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi>
and <hi>Packhouſe</hi> for <hi>Pepper</hi> and
Groſſe <hi>Goods;</hi> But before I leave
this houſe in the ould part of the
City, I muſt ſay ſome thing of the
maner or method uſed in the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions</hi>
of the Jewes and others, who
make a Trade of buyng and ſelling
the <hi>Actions</hi> of the Company, the
which is a great myſtery of <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
and where it inricheth one man,
it ruins an hundred. The <hi>Jewes</hi> are
the chiefe in that Trade, and are ſaid
to negotiate 17 parts of 20 in the
Company; Theſe Actions are bought
and ſhould 4 tymes a day, at 8 in
the morning in the Jewes ſtreet, at
a 11 on the <hi>Dam,</hi> at twelve and at
one a Clock upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and
at ſix in the evening on the <hi>Dam,</hi> and
in the <hi>Coledges</hi> or <hi>Clubs</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi>
until 12 at midnight, where many
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57018:32"/>
tymes the Crafty Jewes, and others
have Contrived to Coine bad newes
to make the Actions fall, and good
newes to raiſe them, the which craft
of doing at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is not taken
notice of, which is much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at, in ſuch a wiſe Goverment
as <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is, for it is a certaine
trueth they many times ſpread ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
reports touching the affaires
of <hi>State,</hi> which paſſe amongſt the
Ignorant for truth; I ſhall now in
the next place ſay ſome thing of their
<hi>Pallace</hi> or Magazine in the new part
of the City the which may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called an <hi>Arſenal;</hi> It is a
building ſo ſuperb that it lookes
more like a Kings Pallace, then a
<hi>Magazin</hi> for <hi>Merchants;</hi> I have
meaſured the Ground on which this
<hi>Arſenal</hi> ſtands which I find to be
2000 foot, and ſquare every way,
reckoning the <hi>Motes,</hi> or <hi>Burgals,</hi>
about it; I remember the Ingenious
Sr. <hi>Joſeph Williamſen</hi> meaſured the
two <hi>Rope-allies</hi> by telling the ſtone
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57018:33"/>
figures in the wal, &amp; found them
to be 1800 foot long, the like
whereof is not to be ſeene in the
world. On the backſide of this <hi>Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie</hi>
lyes a ſtore of 500 Large <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors</hi>
beſides ſmall ones; In this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal</hi>
they build the Ships belonging
to this Chamber: and here are al
ſorts of worke houſes for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers</hi>
that ſerve the Company.
And in a Chamber next to the
Joyners Office, is a model of a
<hi>Ship,</hi> they now build their <hi>Ships</hi>
by, which coſt 6000 Gilders. When
a man beholds the great ſtores of
<hi>Tymber, Cordage,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi>
of war in their <hi>Magazin,</hi> a
man would think there were enough
to furniſh a whole <hi>Nation;</hi> In
this <hi>Arſenal</hi> the <hi>Ships</hi> unload their
Goods layd up in ſeveral apartments
in the grand <hi>Magazin,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is removed to the houſe in the
ould part of the City, as their is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for <hi>ſale:</hi> In the upper part of
this large <hi>Pallace</hi> ſit the ſaile Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57018:33"/>
at worke, but on the Lower part
of this houſe is an appartment
where the <hi>Bewinthebbers</hi> aſſemble
upon occaſion of Buſineſſe; This
<hi>Arſenal</hi> is not to be ſeen by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
without a Ticket from the
<hi>Bewinthebbers;</hi> Now al what I have
ſpoaken of theſe two houſes, or
<hi>Magazins</hi> doth only belong unto
the Chamber of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> There
are yet other <hi>Chambers</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who according to their
Quota, or ſtock in the Company,
have the like houſes and <hi>Magazins,</hi>
as the Chambers of <hi>Zealand, Delph
Rotterdam, Horne</hi> and <hi>Enkuſen.</hi> And
now I have named the ſix Chambers
of which the Company is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
I ſhall ſay ſome thing of their
conſtitution, which is from an
<hi>Octroy,</hi> or Act of the <hi>States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi>
by which they have ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power over their ſervants in
the Indies, yea their Authoritie
reacheth their ſervants in al Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes
of the States General Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57018:34"/>
It is Death for any of the
States ſubjects to be Interlopers
againſt this Company, nor may any
of what nation ſoever that lives in
any of the Companyes Territories
as Burgers or ſervants, returne into
Europe without leave from the
Company, only thoſe called <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
may depart without askeing
leave to remove; The Grand
Councel of this Company is the
Aſſembly of the <hi>Seventeen,</hi> which
are Elected out of the ſeveral
Chambers before named, that is,
eight from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and four
from <hi>Zealand: Delph, Rotterdam,
Horne</hi> and <hi>Enkuſen</hi> ſend one a peece,
which makes ſixteen, and the
five leſſer Chambers by turns choſe
the ſeventeenth. In the Chamber of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> there are 20 <hi>Bewint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hebbers</hi>
in ordinary, who are for
life, and have 1000 Ducatones a
yeare and ſpices at Chriſtmas, and
their travelling charges, when they
goe upon the Companyes ſervice.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57018:34"/>
The next Chamber is <hi>Zealand</hi>
which hath twelve <hi>Bewinthebbers,</hi>
who have about 250 L. a yeare and
travelling Charges, and Spices at
Chriſtmas; The next is <hi>Delph</hi> which
hath ſeven <hi>Bewinthebbers,</hi> who
have only 120 L. a yeare and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
Charges and Spices at
<hi>Chriſtmas:</hi> The other Chambers of
<hi>Rotterdam, Horne</hi> and <hi>Enkhuſen</hi>
have ſeven <hi>Bewinthebbers</hi> a peece,
and the like ſallarie, with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
Charges and <hi>Spices</hi> at
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as the Chamber of <hi>Delph</hi>
hath. Theſe <hi>Bewinthebbers</hi> are
Elected or choſen out of thoſe <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venterers</hi>
called the high <hi>Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panten</hi>
of the Company; They
generally choſe ſuch as are rich
and men of parts, and wiſdome,
moſt of them being of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratie</hi>
of the Country. No man is
capable of being Elected a <hi>Bewint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hebber</hi>
who hath not a 1000 L. ſtock
in the Company. In a word this
grand <hi>Councel</hi> of the Seventeen
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57018:35"/>
make lawes for the governing the
Company, both in <hi>India</hi> and
<hi>Europe.</hi> It is they that appoint the
dayes of <hi>Sale</hi> and what number of
<hi>Ships</hi> each Chamber muſt ſend to
the <hi>Indies:</hi> and likewiſe order the
building of <hi>Ships,</hi> and all other
grand concernes. This <hi>Company</hi> is
worthily Eſteemed a wiſe, <hi>Politique,</hi>
deſerving <hi>Company,</hi> ſpareing no coſt
to get good Intelligence of affaires,
ſending <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Expreſſes</hi>
over land to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> They
have their <hi>Spies</hi> and <hi>Correſpondents</hi>
in all the conſiderable Trading parts
of the <hi>world;</hi> They have been ſo
induſtrious as to gaine the <hi>Spice</hi>
Trade, not only from the <hi>Venetians,
Spaniards, Portugueſes, French,
Danes</hi> and other <hi>Europian nations,</hi>
but have alſo Ingroſſed all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſo that, as I tould you before,
they ſell ſpices to the <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
but this I muſt ſay for them
that they are a Generous <hi>Company</hi>
and gratefully paying reſpects where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57018:35"/>
it is due, as lately they have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented
his <hi>Royall highneſs the
Prince of Orange</hi> with an Annuall
ſumme out of the profits of their
<hi>Company,</hi> to make him their,
friend and <hi>Protector.</hi> Neyther are
they backward in beſtowing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
upon ſtrangers that have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them, as I could inſtance in
ſome of our own <hi>Nation:</hi> They
are alſo very charitable to the <hi>Poore</hi>
giveing them the 1000th Gilder of
all the goods they ſell; And to all the
<hi>reformed Miniſters</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
they ſend <hi>Spices</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> to
pray every Sonday for the welfare
and proſperitye of the <hi>Company.</hi> To
conclude this <hi>Companie</hi> is a <hi>Buckler</hi>
and defence for the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>
upon all urgent occaſions: and truly
our <hi>English Eaſt-India Company</hi>
might be the ſame to our <hi>King,</hi> if
the Differences between the two <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes</hi>
were compoſed: Eſpecially
now they have ſuch a great <hi>King</hi> to
protect them, and that the <hi>Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57018:36"/>
are diſtroyed. And now it is
high tyme I ſhould tell you the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodes
a ſtranger muſt take if he hath
occaſion to Keep houſe in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
If a man will hyer an houſe,
he muſt take a leaſe upon ſeald pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
for which you muſt pay a <hi>Tax</hi>
to the <hi>States,</hi> and pay the <hi>Broaker</hi>
that makes the bargen, but before
you can buy a houſe you muſt be
in a capacitie to be made a <hi>Burger.</hi>
To this purpoſe it is uſuall to take
with you to the <hi>Stathouſe</hi> your
<hi>Broaker</hi> or any two <hi>Securityes,</hi> and
there before the <hi>Burgemaſters</hi> take
the oath of <hi>Burgerſchap,</hi> which is to
be faithfull to the <hi>City,</hi> to the
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Goverment</hi> &amp;c.
but if you buy either <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and lodge privately you will
find your caſe much worſe, Then
you muſt pay a <hi>Legion</hi> of <hi>Taxes</hi> to
the <hi>mils</hi> that draine your <hi>Lands,</hi>
and for maintaining the <hi>Banks</hi> and
<hi>Sluces,</hi> and if the <hi>States</hi> have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57018:36"/>
to build a <hi>Fortification</hi> on
your <hi>Lands,</hi> or to drownd them in
the tyme of <hi>warre,</hi> you muſt be
contented with the <hi>States</hi> Termes,
and if your houſe or houſes ſtand
Empty without Tenents, yet you
muſt pay the <hi>States Taxes</hi> on that
houſe or houſes; Thus much for
the method how you are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced

            <p>For a Coach if you keepe one
75 Gilders a yeare.</p>

The like for ſalt:</p>
            <p>For wyne as your Qualitie is:</p>
            <p>To the Rattel watch as your houſe

            <p>To the Lanthornes as the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

            <p>For Butter every 20 pound ſeven

            <p>For Beens halfe as much as you

            <p>For Turff every Tun five ſtivers.</p>

ſix Gilders.</p>
            <p>For Fleſh the <hi>Tax</hi> often changeth:</p>
            <p>There is alſo a <hi>Tax</hi> on the Bread.</p>
            <p>Then there is a <hi>Tax</hi> called the
200ſte penny, and a <hi>Tax</hi> called the
8th: then there are many Taxes in
Trade, as that no man can weigh
or meaſure out his owne Goods if
ſould in groſſe, but the <hi>States
Officers</hi> muſt doe it, Then the
<hi>States</hi> have a <hi>Tax</hi> called the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi>
on all <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi>
in their <hi>Dominions;</hi> Then they have
a <hi>Tax</hi> on ſeald paper, and a <hi>Tax</hi> for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57018:37"/>
Regiſtering Lands or houſes, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a <hi>Tax</hi> on <hi>Cowes, Horſes,
Calues,</hi> and all ſort of <hi>Fruit.</hi> There
are many other <hi>Taxes</hi> I could
name, as a ſtiver for every man
that goes out or into any <hi>City</hi> after
the houer of ſhutting the Ports,
alſo you pay for going over
ſom <hi>Bridges,</hi> and paſſing thro
<hi>Gates</hi> called <hi>Tolhek,</hi> a ſtiver for
every perſons, but <hi>Coaches, Wagons</hi>
or <hi>Horſes</hi> pay more; Theſe I have
already named; you will ſay, are
to many, yet I may not forget to
tell you, that <hi>Milke</hi> firſt payes as
<hi>Milke,</hi> and again if it be made <hi>Butter</hi>
yea the <hi>Buttermilke,</hi> and <hi>whay</hi> payes
a <hi>Tax</hi> likewiſe, for all which a man
would think that a <hi>people</hi> that ſtand
ſo much upon maintaining of their
liberty ſhould <hi>mutinie</hi> and refuſe
payment. But this ſeldome happens,
and if it doth the <hi>States</hi> puniſh them
very ſeverely. I remember that in
my tyme there was a mutinie at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
about paying a new <hi>Tax,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57018:38"/>
whereupon the <hi>States</hi> ſent a <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of their <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and ſealed
the heads of the <hi>Mutiniers</hi> and
hanged up 5 or ſix of them at the
Townes end, and ſeverely whipt
8 under the <hi>Gallowes;</hi> And in the
rich City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to pay their <hi>Tax,</hi> the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
ſend their Officer to pull of
their <hi>Dores,</hi> and if they remaine
long obſtinate, they ſend and
fetch away the lower <hi>Windowes</hi> of
their houſe, and they dare not put
up others, until they have payd the
Taxes; Howerer this is obſervable
that if any man will ſweare he is not
worth what he is taxed at, then he
is free: but there are many ſo proud,
that they will not let the world Know
their Condition, I Knew a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
named Ornia, who payd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the war for his 200ſte penny
and other Taxes for his and his wives
Children, (haveing had two rich
wives) 14000 pound ſterlyng: I alſo
knew an Engliſh Anabaptiſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57018:38"/>
who tould Mr. Envoye Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in my preſence, that he had
payd neare 4000 L. ſterlyng to the
war, and yet the ſame man did Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to pay his Majeſties <hi>Conſul</hi> a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfull
fee or Conſulat money on
his Ships: the reaſon whereof I
once asked him, who anſwered me
that the King could not raiſe a penny
in England without his Parlement,
and therefore much leſs, could he
doe it in the <hi>States</hi> Country: Thus
theſe Phanaticks had rather make
bricks without ſtraw, then pay the
leaſt tribut to their Naturall Princes
Officer: ſhould wee in England be
obliged to pay the Taxes that are
here impoſed, there would be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
upon Rebellion: and yet
after all that is here payd no man
may bake his owne bread, or grind
his owne corne, or brew his beere,
nor dare any man keepe in his houſe
a hand Mil, althought it be but to
grind Muſtard or Coffy. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
one Mis Guyn a Coffy woman
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57018:39"/>
at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> had like to have been
ruined for grinding hir owne <hi>Coffy,</hi>
had not <hi>Sir Lyonel Jenkins</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his Secretary <hi>Doctor Wyn</hi> to
intreat the <hi>States</hi> on her behalfe,
and it was reckoned a grand favor
that ſhee was only find, and not
baniſhed the <hi>City,</hi> and forfiture
made of all her Goods; I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
alſo a Landlord of mine in Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
bought a live <hi>Pig</hi> in the market
and Innocently brough it home, and
Kild it, for which he had like to
have been ruinated, becauſe he did
not friſt ſend to the acciſemen to
acciſe it, and alſo let the <hi>Viſitors</hi> ſee
that the <hi>Pig</hi> was free from <hi>deſeaſes.</hi>
At an other time a wyne Merchant
comeing to give me a Viſit, tould
me that he had the rareſt Rhiniſh
in the City, and that if I would
ſend my maid to his Cellar with ſix
Bottels they ſhould be fild: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I ſent the maid only with
two bottels, and charged her to
hide them under her apron, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57018:39"/>
ſuch was her misfortune that the
Scouts Dienaers met her and ſeized
her and her bottels, and caryed
her to Priſon, which coſt the Wyne
Merchant 1500 Gilders, and had it
not bin for the ſtrongeſt ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made by us, he had bin ruined:
ſo ſacred are Taxes here and muſt ſo
exactly be payd. And were they
not here ſo preciſe, it were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for ſo ſmal a Country to
ſubſiſt: And therefore you may
heare the Inhabitants generally
ſay, that what they ſuffer is for
their <hi>Vaderland,</hi> hence the meaneſt
among them are content to pay
what is layd on them, for they ſay
all what is the <hi>Vaderlands</hi> is ours
the men of war are theirs, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
Magazins, <hi>Bridges</hi> and every
thing what is the <hi>Vaderlands.</hi> And
indeed in a ſenſe it is ſo for they have
this to Comfort them, that if it
pleaſe God to Viſit them with
Poverty, they and their Children
have the publick purſe to maintaine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57018:40"/>
them, and this is one maine reaſon
why they ſo willingly pay their Taxes
as they doe, for theres not a ſoule
borne in the <hi>States Dominions</hi> that
wants warme <hi>Cloathes</hi> and <hi>Dyet;</hi>
and good lodging, if they make
their caſe knowne to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates;</hi>
and for the <hi>Vagabonds</hi> that
rove up and downe the ſtreets, they
are either <hi>Walons</hi> or other ſtrangers
as pretend to have bin ruinated by
the late wars. I ſhall now in the next
place let you know how Exellently
the laws are here executed againſt
<hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>periury,</hi> and the Intention
of <hi>Murders,</hi> which lawes were once
much uſed in England, as you ſhall
heare hereafter when I ſpeake of the
<hi>Duke of Brandenburgs</hi> Court. I ſhall
here Inſtance a few particullars that
hapened in my tyme: There was a
Spark that made falſe aſſignments on
the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> who tho related to
many of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
had his head cut of; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
who was a Clark in the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57018:40"/>
bank,</hi> who made falſe poſts in
their Bookes, and had his head alſo
cut of, and all the Portions he had
given with his Daughters, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
were forced to pay back, and
all his houſes and Goods were ſould
at his dore in the open ſtreets; I
knew a french <hi>Marquis</hi> who ſwore
his Regiment was Compleat, and
when the <hi>States</hi> knew that he had not
halfe his <hi>Regiment,</hi> he likewiſe had
his head cut of in the Priſon in the
<hi>Hague.</hi> I alſo knew a french <hi>Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>
a <hi>Runagado</hi> Monk who
deſigned to have murdred his maſter
Major <hi>Cavellio,</hi> and his two pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils
young Children of the Majors,
and afterward to ſet the houſe a fire
to couler the murder, he had his
head Cut of and ſet upon a Poſt with
his body on a <hi>Wheele</hi> neare the
<hi>Hague;</hi> I could name you two others
Cheaters, who were ſeverely whipt
under the <hi>Gallowes:</hi> and two under
<hi>Farmers</hi> who deſigned to run
away with the <hi>States</hi> money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57018:41"/>
The Cheat of breakeing with a
full hand is not ſo frequent in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as in <hi>England</hi> (whereſome uſe
it as a way to Slip out of Buſineſs
and then to live conveniently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
upon the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of other men)
becauſe in <hi>Holland</hi> they are more
ſeverely puniſhed when diſcovered,
then in <hi>England:</hi> as on the contraty
thoſe that fall to decay throw <hi>loſſes</hi>
and unavoidable <hi>accidents</hi> which
they could not prevent, find a more
ſpeedy and eaſie way of Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and finiſhing matters with their
<hi>Creditours</hi> if they be over ſtrickt,
then the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> or <hi>law</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
doth aford, for the ſuing
out of <hi>Statuts</hi> of <hi>Bankrupts</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> doth prouve many tymes
ſo pernitious both to <hi>Creditour</hi> and
<hi>Debtor</hi> throw the tediouſnes of the
proceedings and the expenſivenes
of Executing the <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> that
what by <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> fees, <hi>Treatiſes</hi>
and other incident charges, the
<hi>Creditours</hi> are put to ſuch Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57018:41"/>
as to be uterly diſappointed of
their <hi>Debt,</hi> and the Poore <hi>Debtors</hi>
for ever ruinated and undone; I
ſhall therefore in this place give a
ſhort relation of the method uſed
in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupts,</hi>
which perhaps may be taken
notice of by our King and Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the preventing diſorders
and ſad abuſes that dayly hapen in
Executing the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Bankrupts;</hi>
The Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
everie yeare name Commiſſioners
for <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> out of thoſe that
make up a <hi>Judicature,</hi> like to our
courts of <hi>Aldermen</hi> in <hi>London;</hi>
Theſe meet certaine dayes in the
weeke in a diſtinct Chamber in the
<hi>Stathouſe</hi> over whoſe doore is cut in
marble the Emblem of <hi>Fortune</hi>
flying away with wings, and round
<hi>cheſts</hi> turnd up ſide down, with mice
and Ratts eateing the money <hi>Baggs,
Pens, Inkhornes</hi> and <hi>Paperbookes.</hi>
There they receive Petitions from
<hi>Debtors</hi> and <hi>Creditours,</hi> and as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57018:42"/>
requireth ſummon the partyes
to appeare before them, and to lay
open the true State of the matter:
This done they either by authoritie
ſeaze the <hi>Bankrupts</hi> Books and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi>
or Elſe without any ſtir and
noiſe leave all remaining in the
<hi>Debtors</hi> houſes, and ſend thither
two Committes to examine the
Bookes, and make an inventorie of
the Eſtate; with power to compoſe
the matter, without giveing much
trouble to the parties. If the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi>
find that the <hi>Debtor</hi> is
come to decay by unexpected loſſes
and unavoidable accidents, to which
he did not at all contribute, it is
their uſuall way to propoſe to the
Creditour ſuch amicable and eaſy
termes, as the poore man may be
able to performe, alotting ſome
tymes the halſe of the Eſtate left to
the <hi>Debtor,</hi> ſome tymes a third
part, and ſome tymes perſwading the
<hi>Crediteurs</hi> to advance to the poore
man a ſum of mony to help him up
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57018:42"/>
againe in Trade, upon condition
that he do oblige himſelfe to pay the
Creditours all he oweth them, when
<hi>God</hi> ſhall be pleaſed to make him
able; but on the Contrary if the
<hi>Commiſſioners</hi> find that a Trader
hath dealt <hi>Knavishly</hi> and broaken
with a deſigne to defraud and cheat
his <hi>Creditours,</hi> as if it appeare that
a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> hath kept falſe bookes,
and counterfitted bills of <hi>Exchange,</hi>
Bills of <hi>Loading,</hi> or pretended
Commiſſions from forraigne parts;
In ſuch a caſe they are very ſevere
and not only ſeaze all the Bookes
and Effects of the <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> but alſo
Impriſon him, and alſo puniſh
him <hi>Corporally,</hi> and if the cheat be
of an haynous nature, ſentence him
ſomtime to death, whereas if the
<hi>Debtor</hi> be only unfortunate and no
wayes knaveiſh, then the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
uſe all the Power they have
to force the <hi>Creditours</hi> to accept
the Poore mans termes, the which
is better for the <hi>Creditours</hi> then to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57018:43"/>
uſe the Rigor of the law, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Poore man to <hi>Priſon,</hi>
ſeeing in that caſe the <hi>Creditours</hi>
muſt maintaine him in <hi>Priſon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <hi>Priſoner</hi> hath an Eſtate, then the

            <p>The <hi>States</hi> haveing admitted a

ſuch an Oath before them, were

admoniſhed the <hi>Jew</hi> to take

cauſed the oath and the Law to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead unto him, nevertheleſs the
<hi>Jew</hi> oftered to take the oath, but
the Lords not ſuffering him to
ſweare, becauſe then he muſt dye by
Law, cauſed him to be taken out
into another room and ſearched,
where they found about him the
<hi>Ducats</hi> and <hi>Diamonts:</hi> this being
tould the <hi>Lords</hi> they ſent for him
in, and then Sentenced him to have
60 laſhes under the <hi>Gallowes</hi> and
to be baniſhed the <hi>Country,</hi> yet
becauſe the <hi>Jew</hi> had many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they gave a 3d part of what
was taken about him to his wife
and Children, and a third to
the Poore, and the other 3d to the
<hi>Creditours,</hi> which was enough to
pay them their Debt; Theſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiorers</hi>
are payd by the <hi>States</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57018:44"/>
have not a doit from <hi>Debtors,</hi> or
<hi>Creditours</hi> for all what they doe.
Theſe <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> are alſo much
to be commended for their ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to doe good Offices to thoſe
Poore Merchants, Who haveing
lived honeſtly, are brought to
decay by loſles and Croſſes in their
Trade: who when they find any ſuch
ſo Poore that they can neither pay
their <hi>Creditours,</hi> nor maintaine
the charge of their <hi>Families,</hi> it is
their conſtant Cuſtome, to take
their Children from them, and
maintaine and bring them up in their

the <hi>Burgemaſters</hi> on their behalfe
to beſtow ſome ſmal Office upon
them for their <hi>Reliefe,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;</hi>
And here I muſt not omitt
to aquaint you, that as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of matters in <hi>Holland</hi>
betwixt Debtor and Creditour ſo
as hath been ſaid, is very eaſy and
equitable, ſo is alſo their way or
method of ſueing for <hi>Debts</hi> very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57018:44"/>
favorable, which is after this maner,
In the firſt place a note or ſummons
is left at the <hi>Debtors</hi> houſe, and if
he nectlect to appeare, a ſecond ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
is ſent, but then if he neither
appeare himſelfe, or ſend his <hi>Proctor,</hi>
the ſheriffs order an arreſt againſt
him, and at laſt when he it brought
before them, if the matter be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
it is referred to two or three
<hi>Goodmen</hi> of the City, and tyme given
him, but if the plaintiff make Oath
that he apprehends the <hi>Debtor</hi> hath
a deſigne to run away, then muſt
the <hi>Priſoner</hi> either give baile or
return to <hi>Priſon.</hi> It is a remark
that I have made in my Travells,
that excepting <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi>
I never ſaw in any <hi>Priſon</hi> above
<hi>40 Priſoners</hi> for debt at one tyme,
and in ſome great <hi>Townes</hi> as in
<hi>Harlem</hi> and other, ſome tymes not
one; And the reaſon hereof is
plaine, for you cannot lay a man in
<hi>Priſon</hi> for an <hi>Action</hi> or debt, ſmall,
or great, but you muſt maintaine
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57018:45"/>
the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> ſo that many tymes
the charges exceed the principall
Debt, and after all the <hi>Priſoner</hi>
can free himſelfe; Whereas the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
in <hi>England</hi> encouraged by
thoſe Varlets the <hi>Pettyfogers</hi> and
Catchpoles of turning a man into
<hi>Priſon</hi> for a <hi>Crowne,</hi> or it may be
for nothing at all, if he connot find
<hi>Bail,</hi> he may lye and ſtarve there,
is an abominable abuſe, as alſo that
of ſuborning falſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> to
much in uſe in <hi>England,</hi> which is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
cried out againſt <hi>Beyond
ſea.</hi> And now becauſe I am Speakeing
of <hi>Pettyfogers,</hi> give me leave to tell
you a ſtory I mett with when I
lived in <hi>Rome,</hi> goeing with a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
to ſee ſome <hi>Antiquityes,</hi> he
ſhewed me a Chapell dedicated to
one St <hi>Evona</hi> a Lawyer of <hi>Brittanie</hi>
who he ſaid came to <hi>Rome</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the <hi>Pope</hi> to give the <hi>Lawyers</hi>
of <hi>Brittanie</hi> a <hi>Patron,</hi> to which the
Pope replyed that he knew of no
<hi>Saint</hi> but what was diſpoſed of to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57018:45"/>
other Profeſſions, at which <hi>Evona</hi>
was very ſad and earneſtly begd of the
<hi>Pope</hi> to think of one for them:
At the laſt the <hi>Pope</hi> propoſed to St
<hi>Evona</hi> that he ſhould goe round the
Church of St. <hi>John</hi> de <hi>Latera</hi> blind
fould, and after he had ſaid ſo many
Ave <hi>Marias,</hi> that the firſt <hi>Saint</hi> he
layd hold of, ſhould be his <hi>Patron,</hi>
which the good old <hi>Lawyer</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
undertook, and at the end
of his Ave Maryes, he ſtopt at St.
<hi>Michels Altar,</hi> where he layd hold
of the <hi>Divell,</hi> under St. Michels
feet, and cryd out, this is our Saint,
let him be our <hi>Patron,</hi> ſo beeing
unblindfolded and ſeeing what a
<hi>Patron</hi> he had choſen, he went to
his Lodgings ſo dejected, that in
few moneths after he die'd and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>heavens Gates</hi> knockt hard,
whereupon St <hi>Peoter</hi> asked who it was
that knockt ſo bouldly, he replyed,
that he was St. <hi>Evona</hi> the <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
Away, away ſaid St. <hi>Peter</hi>

witty Poet writ upon St. <hi>Evonas</hi>
Tomb theſe words: St. <hi>Evona</hi> us
<hi>Briton, Advocat non Larron, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluiah.</hi>
This Story put me in mind
of Ben: <hi>Johnſon</hi> goeing throw a
Church in <hi>Surry,</hi> ſeeing Poore
people weeping over a <hi>Grave,</hi> asked
one of the women why they wept,
Oh ſaid ſhee, we have loſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<hi>Lawyer,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Randall,</hi> he
kept us all in peace, and always
was ſo good as to keep us from
goeing to law, the beſt man ever
lived, well ſaid <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> I will
ſend you an <hi>Epitaph</hi> to write upon
his <hi>Tomb,</hi> which was,
<q>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:57018:46"/>
                  <l>God works wonders now and
than,</l>
                  <l>Here lyes a Lawyer an honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And trully <hi>old Ben:</hi> was in the
right, for in my tyme I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome Gentlemen of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
that have not Acted like
St. <hi>Evona,</hi> or Juſtice <hi>Randal,</hi> I wil
ſay no more of them, but wiſh
them as great fees, and as much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
as the <hi>Lawyers</hi> have
in <hi>Switſerland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to ſpeake ſome thing
of the three Taxes I mentioned in the
former part of my remarques on
<hi>Taxes,</hi> of which the firſt ought
rather to be called an uſefull and
publique invention, like to that of
the Inſurance Office in <hi>London,</hi>
then a publick Tax, ſeeing no man
needs contribute to it unleſs they
pleaſe, and find his profit by it,
but the other may be called Taxes
becauſe the ſubjects are obliged to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57018:47"/>
ſubmit to them, but then they are
ſo eaſy, that what the Publick
gets thereby not only leſſons Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſubſidies, which many
tymes occaſions clamour, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their raritie and the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie
of occaſions, they muſt needs
be great.</p>
            <p>Yet it is ſufficently compenſated
by the advantage and ſecuritie in
the Eſtates which private perſons,
who are obliged to pay it, reape
thereby dayly; I am confident that
if the King and Parlement thought
fit to introduce ſome or all three
of theſe taxes into <hi>England,</hi> the
publick charge of Goverment might
be defrayed with more eaſe and
with leſs repining and clamour, then
when it muſt be done by new and
high Impoſitions, how ever our
Governers are the proper Judges of
that.</p>
            <p>The firſt then is an <hi>Houſe</hi> called
the merchants Bank which is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by diverſe Commiſſioners,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57018:47"/>
Clarks and Booke keepers, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a <hi>Eſſaymaſter</hi> who Judgeth of
the Gould and Silver, that at any
tyme is brought into the Bank un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyned,
the ſecurity given for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
thereof, are the <hi>States</hi> and
Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Now
if you have a mind to put money
into the Bank, ſuppoſe a 1000 L. leſs
or more, you muſt goe to the Clarks
and ask a folio for your name, and
then pay in your money at three or
foure per cent according as the rate
of the Bank money is high or low,
or you may buy it of thoſe called
<hi>Cashiers</hi> or Broakers: then get the
Clarks to ſet downe in the folio what
you bring in, haveing done ſo you
may draw this ſumme, or ſell it in
what parcels you pleaſe, but then if
you let your money lye ſeven yeares
in the Bank, you receive no Intreſt
for the ſame. If you aske where then
is the advantage for the Merchants?
I anſwer firſt you have your money
ready at all tymes for anſwering
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57018:48"/>
bills of Exchange, and making other
payments: you are at no charge
for baggs or portage, at no loſs
by falſe tale or bad money, in no
danger of Thieves or unfaithfull
ſervants, or fire, and above all you
have the accounts of your caſh moſt
punctually and Juſtly kept without
any trouble or runing the risk of
Gouldſmith or Caſhieres breaking
in your Debt; for ſuch is their care
that twice a yeare, or ſome tymes
oftner they ſhut up the Bank for 14
dayes, and then all that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
therein muſt bring in their
accounts to the Clarkes, who a few
dayes after, haveing viewed the
Bookes, aquaint ſuch as have brought
in wrong accounts with their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
deſiring them to returne to
their bookes, and rectifie their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
not telling them wherein the
miſtake lyes, ſo that I have knowne
Merchants, in my tyme ſent back
three or foure tymes, with their
wrong accounts: but if they begin
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57018:48"/>
to grow Impatient and ſay that they
will ſtand to their accounts, then
they pay a mulct to the Clarkes upon
their Covincing them of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
either by chargeing to much
upon the Bank, or forgetting or
omitting what was their due. I
knew two Merchants, who haveing
forgott the one 750 L. and the other
220 L. in their accounts, were
honeſtly rectified by the Clarkes,
ſo that they ſusſtained no loſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this care of the Clarkes in
keeping and Stating the accounts,
the bank is obliged for five L. a
yeare to ſend to every Merchant,
that deſires it, their accounts every
morning before Exchange tyme,
of the moneyes written of by them
in the Bank the day before upon
any Merchants account, and what
ſummes are written of by others
upon their accounts: ſo that the
Merchants may compare the Banks
notes with their bookes and ſo ſave
much of the charges of Booke kee-
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57018:49"/>
Now if it be objected that though
this be an advantage to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
yet what can the Publick
gaine thereby, ſeeing the Charges
of paying Officers, Clarks &amp;c. muſt
needs be very conſiderable? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that indeed it is a myſtery
to thoſe who underſtand not the
thing, but if it were once known
and practiſed, the advantage of it
would appeare; For among other
things which might be ſaid, The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of the Citty take out of
the Merchants Bank a Sufficent ſtock
of money to ſupply the <hi>Lumbert,</hi> a
Banck that Lends out money, and is
Governed by 4 Commiſſioners cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the Magiſtrates, who ſitt
in Court every day in the <hi>Lumbert,</hi>
which is a large pile of Building 300
foot long, containing ſeveral Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and magazines under one Roof,
in theſe ſeveral Chambers the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
have Officers ſitting tolend
money upon all ſorts of Goods even
from a paires of ſhooes to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57018:49"/>
Jewell &amp;c. This is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venicence
for Poore people, yea
for Merchants alſo, who ſome tymes
may want money to pay a bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
and prevents the Cheatting
and Extraordinary Extortion uſed by
the Pawne brokers in <hi>England, France</hi>
and other Countryes. And beſides
the Poore have their <hi>Pawns</hi> ſafely
and well preſerved, neither are they
punctually ſould when the yeare is
out or denied under the pretext of
being miſlaid, as the Poore are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
tymes ſerved by the wicked
<hi>Pawn broakers.</hi> There is alſo
another convenience in this <hi>Lumbert</hi>
viz, an Exellent way they have of
diſcovering <hi>Thieves,</hi> and the
ſtollen goods; They publiſh two
generall open ſales of the Goods
pawnd twice a yeare, that ſuch as
will, may redeeme their goods
and paying the Intreſt may have them
although the time be relapſed. Thus
much as to the <hi>Lumbert.</hi> I was
once according to my duty to waite
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57018:50"/>
upon our preſent King at the Bank
of Merchants, where ſhewing his
Majeſtie the way of keeping the
<hi>Journall Book</hi> of the Bank which
is of a prodigious bigneſs, his
Majeſtie was Extreamly pleaſed with
the Contrivance of preſerveing it
from fire; ſaying that the courſe they
tooke might be of great uſe for
the preſerving <hi>Patents</hi> and the <hi>deeds</hi>
of Noblemens Eſtates; This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
which perhaps may be
thought uſefull or imitable, I ſhall
therefore diſcribe it, It is a large
fireſtone ſhaped like a Cheſt, and
ſet upright in a ſtone wall having a
large braſs doore of a Vaſt thicknes
with flops to fall over and Cover the
Lock and Hinges, into this cheſt the
Booke is drawn upon Rouls, it being
of ſuch a Bulk and waight as cannot
be handed in by a man, and there
it is ſo ſecurely preſerved that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the houſe ſhould be burnt,
the Booke in al probabilitie would
be ſafe; Should I here give an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57018:50"/>
account of the Vaſt ſummes of
money that dayly are written of in
this Bank, I might probably be
thought to ſpeake at Random, but
this I may bouldly affirme that it
farr Exceeds all the Bankes in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
both for Riches and Buſineſs,
and their Credit is ſuch that the
<hi>Italians, French, Germans</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
have great ſummes in the ſame,
neither was ever any man refuſed
his money in the worſt of times.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Tax is what ariſeth
from the juſt and laudable Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of a Regiſter, A Tax
which I think moſt men will be
willing to ſubmit to, Except ſuch
as deſigne to cheat and defraud their
Naibours, and live by ſuch like ſins
and Confuſion, and for the moſt part
die with the curſe of the people;
This Regiſter in <hi>Holland</hi> begitts
ſuch aſſurance and Safetie in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that in purchaſing of houſes
or land, a Childe tho overreached
in the Value yet cannot be cheated
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57018:51"/>
as to the title: The methodes of
which Regiſter. I have by me for
the uſe of our King and Parlement
when they pleaſe to Command it.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Tax is that of
ſealed paper as it is practiſed in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The Method of which I
likewiſe keep by me for his Maieſtie
and Parlements Commands. There
are many other things might be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as to the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
but I may not tyre your
patience. However one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing I would not paſſe by
touching the <hi>Melitia;</hi> There
are in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 60 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes
of <hi>Foot,</hi> the leaſt of them
haveing 200 men, ſome 300, which
in a modeſt account, amounts, at
leaſt to 15000 men, in which number
neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> who
carry no <hi>Armes</hi> are reckned,
only they are obliged to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the maintenance of the
<hi>1400 Souldiers</hi> who are kept in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
pay, as a <hi>Guard</hi> for the <hi>Citty,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57018:51"/>
and towards the night <hi>watch</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telwatch,</hi>
who walke the ſtreets the
whole night to keepe good <hi>Orders,</hi>
and tell us every halfe houre what
a Clock it is. There are alſo upon
every Church Tower, <hi>Trumpetters</hi>
who ſound every halfe houre, and
if any fire breakes out in the <hi>Citty</hi>
they give a <hi>Signall</hi> on which ſide of
the <hi>Citty</hi> the fire is, and ring the
<hi>Firebell,</hi> and they have Exellent
wayes on a ſuddain in ſuch ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to Quench <hi>Fire:</hi> but I may not
inlarge any longer, but haſten out
of <hi>Holland.</hi> And yet before I leave
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> I muſt vindicate her
from a malitious aſperſion caſt upon
her by the Ignorant, they accuſe
her to have very rudely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilly
affronted the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
beeing there. <hi>Anno</hi> 1681 All which
is very falſe, True the <hi>English
Phanaticks</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> were ſo
malitiouſly wicked as to ſpread ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
lyes of his <hi>Sacred</hi> Perſon,
and ſtird up the <hi>Canalie</hi> as much
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57018:52"/>
as they could to affront his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
but as for the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> they
payd him verie great reſpects; firſt
ſending me to the <hi>Hague</hi> to know
what day his <hi>Highnes</hi> would pleaſe
to honor their <hi>Citty</hi> with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that thereby they might be
prepared to receive his <hi>Royall</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with all the honor emaginable,
being reſolved to Treat his <hi>Highnes</hi>
in their <hi>Stathouſe,</hi> and that the
<hi>Burgers</hi> ſhould be in their <hi>Armes,</hi>
alſo giveing out orders for <hi>Coaches</hi>
and the <hi>Admiraltys Yagts</hi> to attend
his <hi>Highnes,</hi> when ever he pleaſed to
come, but his <hi>Highnes,</hi> by <hi>Collonel
werden</hi> let me know that I ſhould
attend the <hi>Burgemaſters,</hi> and thank
them for their kind preſentation,
but his <hi>Highnes</hi> was reſolved to ſee
their <hi>Citty incognito</hi> and therefore
deſired the <hi>Burgemaſters</hi> not to put

Notwithſtanding the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
Commanded their <hi>Yatchts</hi>
to lye ready the halfeway <hi>Harlem,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57018:52"/>
and Vice <hi>Admiral de Ruiter, Dirick
Tulp,</hi> and others went out in their
Coaches to meet his <hi>Highnes,</hi> and
conduct him into the <hi>Citty,</hi> at which
tyme our Engliſh <hi>Phanaticks</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe called <hi>Monmouths</hi>
twelve <hi>Apoſtels</hi> did all that they
could to ſtir up the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to affront his <hi>Highnes,</hi> crying
out to them, This is he that brought
the laſt war upon you, and with his
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> would cut all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
Throats; But the next day after his
<hi>Highnes</hi> was com into the <hi>Citty
Burgemaſter Valkenier</hi> the great
<hi>Solon</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſent for me
and could me that although the

of the <hi>City</hi> give no Viſits
to ſtrange <hi>Princes,</hi> unleſs they
<hi>be Crouned</hi> heads, yet ſaid he I have
a great Ambition to pay a Viſit to
the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> upon ſeverall
reſpects, firſt as being the brother
of ſo great a <hi>King,</hi> and as he is our
<hi>Statholders <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nckell</hi> and Father in

law, and therefore ſaid he you ſhall
procure me <hi>Audience</hi> in the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
maner imaginable: for I deſigne
to goe with you to him without
ſo much as a footman attending me;
here upon I waitted upon the Earle
of <hi>Peterborow</hi> and <hi>Collonel Werden</hi>
and <hi>Collonel Porter</hi> to deſire them to
aquaint his <hi>Highnes</hi> with the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemaſters</hi>

<hi>Highnes</hi> turnd to me, and ſaid
<hi>Mr. Carr</hi> when the <hi>Burgemaſter</hi>
pleaſeth, whereupon I went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the <hi>Burgemaſter</hi> and
attended him to his <hi>Highnes</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the newes whereof comeing
to the <hi>Cittizens,</hi> they gathered
together in great <hi>Multitudes</hi> to ſee
whether this great man their <hi>Petty
God</hi> did humble himſelf ſo far, as
to pay a Viſit to his <hi>Highnes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other <hi>Burgemaſters</hi> only
ſent a <hi>Secretary</hi> and one of there

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57018:53"/>
or <hi>Penſionaries;</hi> After the
<hi>Burgemaſter</hi> had had a long houres
<hi>Audience</hi> with the Duke in a Roome
a part, I attended the <hi>Burgemaſter</hi>
to his Daughter <hi>Pelicorns</hi> houſe,
the which was neare his <hi>Highnes</hi>
Lodgings, for the Tumult of the
Burgers was ſo great, that the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemaſter</hi>
did not care to pas by
them, and being come into his
daughters <hi>Parler,</hi> he began to
ſpeake to me after this maner,
Sir, I never in all my life met with
a <hi>Prince</hi> ſo generally Experienced
in all things, a <hi>Prince</hi> that hath
far penetrated into the affaires of
Europe, and hath the right meaſures
of the preſent State of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and diſcourſes as if he ſate in
our Councell, but above all I was
mightly pleaſed to heare him declare
himſelfe ſo freely touching Liberty
of Conſcience commending the
wiſdome of our <hi>State</hi> in Opening
their <hi>Gates</hi> to all tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that is it, ſaid his <hi>Highnes,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57018:54"/>
that makes you ſo conſiderable and
enticeth the Rich Merchants of
other places to come &amp; live amongſt
you, whereas the folly of the <hi>Spanish
Inquiſition</hi> hunts away the chiefeſt of
their <hi>Traders</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> and others;
For my part ſaid his <hi>Highnes,</hi> I
never was for oppreſſing tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
in <hi>England:</hi> for nothing
more diſturbs the peace and quiet
thereof then forceing men by <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To conclude, ſaid the <hi>Burgemaſter</hi>
do but, Remark this one thing
and remember it, if you out live
me, viz, that if ever this great <hi>Prince</hi>
come to be King of <hi>England</hi> he
will alter all the Meaſures of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and poſſible become the Arbiter

               </hi>
and others the <hi>Bewinthebbers</hi> of the
<hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> attended his
<hi>Highnes</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indie Houſe,</hi>
where was ſpread a <hi>Banquet</hi> of
<hi>Sweetmeats,</hi> and rich <hi>Wines,</hi> and
they offered his <hi>Highnes</hi> a preſent,
but his highnes would not accept of
any, only two large Bookes in
which were Painted all the <hi>Beaſts,
Fishes,</hi> and <hi>Foules,</hi> and likewiſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57018:55"/>
all the <hi>Plants, Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Fruites</hi>
of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and becauſe
his <hi>Highnes</hi> had taſted the Mum
in the <hi>Eaſt-Indie Magazine,</hi> and
liked it, the <hi>Company</hi> cauſed
twelve <hi>Caskes,</hi> to be neatly hoopt,
and gave me them to be ſent after
his <hi>Highnes</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> And I know
it was the reſolution of the <hi>Bewint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hebbers</hi>
to have ſpared no coſt if
his <hi>Highnes</hi> would have accepted
of a Treat in their houſe, by all
which you ſee that the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>
and chiefe men in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> were
not guilty of Rudenes to his
<hi>Highnes,</hi> but it was the Canalie.
And now haveing ſaid ſo much good
of the <hi>States</hi> Government, and of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> in particular, it will not
be amiſſe to take notice of ſome Bad
cuſtomes and practiſes now in vogue
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and leave it to the reader
to Judge what they may portend;
There are tollerated in the Citty
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> amongſt other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
at leaſt 50 Muſick houſes, where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57018:55"/>
lewd Perſons of both ſexs meet and
practiſe their villanies. There is alſo
a place called the <hi>Longſeller</hi> a Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
Exchange or publick meeting
houſe for whores and Rogues to
Rendevous in, and make their
filthy Bargains: This Exchange is
open from ſix a clock afterdinner
untill nine at night; Every whore
muſt pay three ſtivers at the dore
for her entrance or admiſſion; I
confeſs the Miniſters preach and
exclaim from the pulpit againſt this
horrible abuſe, but who they be
that Protect them I know not, yet I
have heard ſome plead for the tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of theſe wicked meetings
upon pretext, that when the
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> fleets come home, the
Seamen are ſo mad for women, that
if they had not ſuch houſes to bait
in, they would force the verie Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyzens

well known that as money does coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
ſo Diſcipline might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
that abuſe. The ould ſevere
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57018:56"/>
and frugall way of Liveing is now
allmoſt quite out of Date in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
there is very littell to be ſeene
of that ſober modeſtie in Apparell,
Diet, and habitations as formerly:
In ſtead of Convenient Dwellings
the <hi>Hollandtrs</hi> now build Stately
palaces, have their delightfull Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and houſes of pleaſure, keep
Coaches, waggons and ſleas, have
very rich furniture for their horſes
with Trappings-adorned with ſilver
Bells, I have ſeen the Vanitie of a
<hi>Vintners</hi> ſonne, who had the boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the bit and Trapping of his
horſe of pure ſilver, his footman
and Coachman having ſilver fringd
Gloves; yea ſo much is the humour
of the women altered and of their
Children alſo that no Apparel can
now ſerve them but the beſt and
richeſt, that <hi>France</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes
affoards, and their ſonns are ſo
much adicted to play, that many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are ruined by it
not that <hi>England</hi> is leſſe Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57018:56"/>
then the <hi>Duch,</hi> who as I ſaid
before got ſuch great Eſtates by their
frugalitie, whileſt they were not
addicted to ſuch prodigalitie and
wantoneſſe as the Engliſh are, whoſe
exceſſe I can not excuſe, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the grave and ſober people of
<hi>Holland</hi> are very ſenſible of the
great alteration that now is in their
Country, and as they ſay <hi>Paracelſus</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> invited the Thirty ſix
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and their wives to a
feaſt: who being come and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
big with Expectation of ſome
rare and Extraordinary Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſat down at table; where the
firſt courſe was Buttermilk boild
with Appells, Stockfiſh, Buttered
Turnips and Carrots, lettice Salade
and red Herrings, &amp; only ſmale beare
without any Wyne; At this the
Ladies ſtartled and began to whiſper
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57018:57"/>
to their husbands, that they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
no ſuch Entertainement,
but upon removing of the Diſhes
and plates they found underneath
printed verſes Importing that after
that manner of liveing they began
to thrive, &amp; had inlarged their Citty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond courſe conſiſted of
Bocke de kooks, quarters of Lamb,
roſted Rabits and a ſort of pudding
they cal a <hi>Brother</hi> here they had Dorts
and Engliſh beare with <hi>French</hi> wyne
yet all this did not pleaſe the dainty
Dames: but upon removing away
the plates another Diſh of poetrie
appeared, which acquainted them
that after that modeſt and ſober way
of Liveing, they might keep what
they had gott, and lay up ſome thing
for their Children.</p>
            <p>Then comes in the third courſe
made up of all the rarities of the
ſeaſon, as Patridges, Pheſeants and
all ſorts of foule and Engliſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties,
with plenty of Riniſh and other
ſorts of wyne, to moiſten them,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57018:57"/>
this put the ladyes in a frolick and
Jolly humour, but under their plates
was found the uſe and Application
in verſes, telling them that to feed
after that manner was Voluptuous
and Luxurious, and would Impaire
their health and waſt their Eſtates,
make them neglect their Trade, and
ſo in Tyme reduce their Stately and
new built flouriſhing Citty to their
ould fiſhing towne againe. After
this was brought in a Banquet of all
ſorts of ſweet meats piled up in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides
and delicate fruite with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of delitious wynes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all a ſet of Muſick and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
who danced with the young
Ladyes; but at parting like the hand
writing to <hi>Belteshazzar</hi> upon the
wall, every one had a printed paper
of moralities put into their hand
ſhewing them the cauſes of the ruine
of the Roman Commonwealth,
according to that of the Poët.</p>

            </q>
            <p>with an Excellent aduice to them that
if they did not quit the Buffoneries
and apiſh modes of the French, and
returne to the Simplicitie, plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

that the ould man being now paſt

would have none others to take

to what I thought fitt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
of the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited
Provinces</hi> only I will beg leave, to ſay
ſomething to the Hollander by way of
adviſe viz, That now they are in a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57018:58"/>
proſperous condition, Rich and at
eaſe, They would looke back and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what God in his Infinite
goodnes &amp; mercy did for them in the
dayes of their greateſt calamities;
for my owne part I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the great providence of God
in preſerveing them from being
devoured by their many Enimies
they had in the laſt warr, beſides
their enimies at home, ſome of
which particulars as they then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
give me leave to relate. At
the tyme when the French came to
Inuade the Territoryes of the <hi>States
General,</hi> it then looked as if God had
markd out the way for the French
to March, by ſending ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
drye ſeaſon that the Rivers
of the <hi>Rhine, Beta, Wall,</hi> and
other Rivers were fordable, ſo that
the French only waded throw, and
became ſo Victorious, that in a
little ſpace of tyme (what by the
Treaſons of ſome, and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and cowardiſe of others In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57018:59"/>
with the Militia, and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
the French became Maſters
of above 40 Cittyes and Garriſons,
at which tyme there was nothing to
be heard of in the States Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
but confuſion and miſerie,
even in the ſtrong and rich Citty of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, who at this tyme
beheld the French Armie like a
mighty Torrent comeing within
ſight of the Citty, and at the ſame
tyme wanting water in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls,
and Burgwalls to ply their
Sluces, and ſuch was the ſcarcity of
Raine that a payle of freſh water was
worth 6 pence; Thus heaven ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to frowne on them as well as the
French Armie, by the ſhutting up
as it were the Conduits of Heaven,
and yet a worſe thing had like to
have fallen out, for at the ſame tyme
the Diviſions grew ſo high amongſt
the Magiſtrates in the Stathouſe,
that it was putting to the Queſtion
wheather or no they ſhould not
goe and meet the French King with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57018:59"/>
the Keyes of their Citty, to ſave
it from fire, and Plunder, now
nothing in all probabilitie could
ſave this rich Citty from falling
into the hands of the French, but
an immediate hand from Heaven,
and it had undoubtedly come to
paſſe, had not providence cauſed
the French to make a ſtand at
<hi>Muyden,</hi> two howers from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
at what time the Valiant
Roman of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Scout <hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelaer</hi>
like a true father of his
Country oppoſed the French party
in the Councell, calling out to the
Burgers from the Stathouſe to take
Courage and rather chooſe to dye
like old Battavians with their ſwords
in their hands, then tamely and
Treacherouſly to yeald up their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the mercy of the French, as
ſome of the Mageſtrates were about
to doe, this ſo Incouraged the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that with great Courage they
mand' the walls, and heaven then
aſſiſting them with a ſuden and plenty
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57018:60"/>
full raine, that they plyd their ſluces,
and drouned the Lands round the
Citty 3 and 4 foot high, in ſome
places, which cauſed the Victorious
French Armie to make a quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
as farr as Utrick, elſe the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
had payd deare for ſeeing of
<hi>Amſterdam;</hi> Thus was <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
delivered by the hand of
Heaven.</p>
            <p>A ſecond was, when that Bloody
Duke of <hi>Luxenburg,</hi> who gloryed
and thanked God that he was borne
without pitty or remors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
took the opportunitye of an
exceeding hard froſt to march his
Armie over the Ice as it had been
drye ground, burning in his way the
three faire Villages of <hi>Bodygrave,
Swammerdam</hi> and <hi>Goudſe-ſluys.</hi>
Acting there a more cruell Tradigie
and worſe then ever did Turk, for
they Generally ſave the Country
people for Ranſom, but this cruell
Prince cauſed ſtrong Guards to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
the villages, and burnd men,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57018:60"/>
Women and Children together,
Thus he began his march with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
to burne <hi>Leyden, Hague,
Rotterdam, Delph</hi> and all the rich
Country of <hi>Rhineland:</hi> and this he
might have done in all probabilitie,
for firſt the Governor of Newſluce
who commanded the poſt that ſhould
have ſtopt the French, Treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
delivered up the fort without
firing a Gunn, and the handfull of
Troopes then under General <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsmark</hi>
were ſo Inconſiderable
that they joyned to the Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Vin</hi> the Governer of
new <hi>Sluce</hi> were not Able to make
head as could oppoſe <hi>Luxenburgs</hi>
Armie, and at the ſame tyme the
good <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> was with
the States Armie at Charle le Roy.
Now was <hi>Leyden</hi> ready to meet the
French with the Keyes of their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and other Cittyes too, for they
had neither fortifications nor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to man their walls; Thus the
whole Country and Cittyes of <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57018:61"/>
were like to fall under the
Crueltyes and Tyranny of the
French, but God a ſecond tyme
ſent theſe people reliefe from
Heaven, firſt by giveing ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted
Courage to that great States
man <hi>Penſionarie Fagel</hi> that he
forced <hi>Koningsmark</hi> to Rally his
Troopes together and to make a
Stand neare <hi>Leyden,</hi> offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to dye at the head of them if
there were occaſion, but God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
him for a furder good to the
Commonwealth by ſending ſuch a
ſudden Thaw as was never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for in leſs then ten howers the
Ice ſo ſunk and ſuch Floods of ſnow
came downe from the high lands
that the French were fain to make
a very diſorderly retreat, Marching
up to the middel for haſt, becauſe
on the Banks there could not march
above four men a breſt, ſo they
were conſtrained to leave behind
them the greateſt part of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they had robed from the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57018:61"/>
Country people, and the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Duch men on their Sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſes ſo
long as the Ice would beare them,
did ſhoot downe the French like
Ducks diving under water, ſo
that it coſt <hi>Luxenburgs</hi> Armie
deare, tho they had the pleaſure
to burne the poore people, of which
the French afterward wickedly made
their boaſt.</p>
            <p>The third was as wonderfull as
the two others, and although I doe
not believe miracles, as doe the
Papiſts, yet I ſay nothing I ever
obſerved looked more like a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
then this, to wit, when the
Engliſh and French Fleet lay before
<hi>Scheveling</hi> with a deſigne to land,
and the French ready on their March
to joyne with the English and other
French as ſoon as they ſhould land, at
the ſame tyme the <hi>Biſshop</hi> of <hi>Munſter</hi>
lyeing before <hi>Groeningen,</hi> and the
French before <hi>Gorcom,</hi> ſo that
now all things looked with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
face for the States, yet at this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57018:62"/>
very tyme God ſent a 3d reliefe by
ſending ſuch Miſts, and wonderfull
ſorts of Tydes, as ſo ſeparated the
two Fleets, that the Engliſh were
forced to quit <hi>Scheveling</hi> ſhore,
and were driven on the ſide of the
<hi>Texel</hi> Roade; from whence they
were conſtrained by the ſeaſon of the
yeare to retire home, and ſuch were
the ſudden &amp; great ſhowers of raine
that the Biſshop of Munſter was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in diſorder to raiſe his ſiege at
<hi>Groeningen,</hi> and the French to quit
<hi>Gorcom;</hi> I could ad many more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of the Providences of
God to theſe people, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveing
the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> from
the many treacherous deſignes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
againſt him from his Cradel,
but Moſes muſt be preſerved, to goe
in and out before his people, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
never young <hi>Prince</hi> Indured
ſo many fatigues as did his Highnes
in his tender yeares, of which I was
an eye witnes, and had his Highnes
had the yeares and Experience, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57018:62"/>
ſuch a good diſciplinde Armie (as now
he hath) in the yeare 1671 when
the French Entered the Country,
his Highnes had given them as good
a welcome as he did at Bergen.
I will ſay no more of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
only this, that the peace at
<hi>Nimwegen</hi> was alſo a very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing, for that not above 8
dayes before the peace was ſigned,
moſt of the <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the war would have continued
another yeare; firſt becauſe the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Duke of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> proſpered Exceedingly
againſt <hi>Sweedland,</hi> and totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
the propoſitions of France,
and ſecondly becauſe the French
King writ ſuch Bitter letters againſt
the <hi>States Generall:</hi> yet 8 dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dreſt a letter unto the <hi>States</hi> in
which he calles them his good
friends, and old Allyes, offering
them not only <hi>Maſtricht</hi> but every
foot of ground they could lay claime
to in the world, alſo giveing them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57018:63"/>
new Termes, and Conditions as to
their priviledges in France, by way
of Trade; Neither can I forget how
ſpeedilie and as ſtrangly the mighty
French King did quit his Conquered
Townes after the Valiant <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Orange</hi> took <hi>Naerden,</hi> which was
the firſt ſtep to the Frenchs ruine in
the States Dominions. I come now,
according to promeſs in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this book, to give the
reader ſome Remarkes I made in
other Countries where I have been
during my ſixteen years travels. To
give a full account of all that might
be obſerved in ſo many Countries,
is not a taske for one man, nor a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for ſo ſmall a book; I ſhall
onely therefore briefely take notice
of ſome remarkable matters which
may in ſome meaſure ſatisfie the
curioſitie of my Country men who
have not been in the ſaid places,
and convince, if poſſible, all of
them, that no Countrey that ever
I was in, afords ſo great convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57018:63"/>
for the generalitie of people to
live in, as the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi>
doth. Though I have twice made
the <hi>grand tour</hi> of <hi>Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and after
my return back to <hi>England</hi> travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a third time through <hi>Holland</hi>
as for as <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and ſo back by
<hi>Francfort</hi> to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
yet the reader is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I ſhould follow a Geographicall
method and order in ſpeaking of the
places I have been in; that is to be
lookt for in the map, and not in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels;
but onely that I mention pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as I found them on my rode ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as buſines or curioſitie led
mee to travel.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſiderable place I
then met with, after I was out of
the dominions of the <hi>States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
was <hi>Cleave</hi> the capital citie of
the Province ſo called, a fair
and lovely citie ſtanding upon the
<hi>Rhine</hi> and the rivers <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

This Province much reſembles <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57018:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in rich ſoyl and pleaſantneſs of
its rivers. The inhabitants of the
Countrey would have mee beleeve
that they were originally deſcended
of thoſe <hi>Saxons</hi> who made a deſcent
in to <hi>England,</hi> and conquered it; and
to convince the truth of this, they
ſhew'd mee a cloyſter ſtanding on
a hill, called <hi>Eltham,</hi> from which
they ſay our <hi>Eltham</hi> in Kent had
its name. I was made to obſerve
alſo two places ſtanding upon the
<hi>Rhine</hi> neare <hi>Emmerick</hi> called <hi>Doad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and <hi>Gron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wich,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to them, gave the names to
<hi>Dedford</hi> and <hi>Greenwich</hi> in <hi>England;</hi>
but many ſuch analogies and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
of names are to be found in
other places of Germany, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in uper <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi>
The greateſt part of this Province
of <hi>Cleave,</hi> and part of the duchy's
of <hi>Julieres</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> and of the
Provinces of <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Ravens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
belongs to the Elector of
<hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> the reſt belonging
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57018:64"/>
to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> now Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Elector of
<hi>Cologne.</hi> The inhabitants are partly
Roman Catholicks, partly Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
and partly Calviniſts, who
all live promiſcuouſly and peaceably
together both in city and Countrey.
The citie of Cleave is the out moſt
limit of the territories of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> on this ſide of
Germany; from whence his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Highneſs can travel two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
dutch miles out right in his
own Dominions, and never ſleep
out of his own Countrey but one
night in the territories of the Biſhop
of <hi>Oſnabrug.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Cleave</hi> I went to a ſmall
town called <hi>Rhinberg,</hi> but a
very ſtrong fortification belonging
to the Elector of <hi>Cologne;</hi> which
dies at two miles diſtance from the
citie of <hi>Weſel</hi> that belongs to the
Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi> Through
<hi>Diſſeldorpe:</hi> ſcituated on the Rhine,
and the Reſidence of the duke of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57018:65"/>
               <hi>Newbourg,</hi> I went next to
<hi>Cologne</hi> a very large city, called by
the Romans <hi>Colonia Agrippina,</hi>
and the French <hi>Rome d'Allema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cologne</hi> is an Imperial citie and
a Republick, though for ſome things
it does Homage to the Elector of
that name, and receives an oath
from him. It is much decayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe hundred years, having
been much prieſt ridden, a miſfortune
that hath undone many other great
cities. The Jeſuits have had ſo
great influence upon the Magiſtrats,
that they prevailed with them to
baniſh all Proteſtants, who remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to <hi>Hambourg</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
ſo that <hi>Cologne</hi> is become ſo diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
that the houſes dayly fall to
ruine for want of inhabitants, and
a great deal of corn and wine now
grows within the walls, upon ground
where houſes formerly ſtood. I dare
be bold to affirm that there is twice
the number of inhabitants in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57018:65"/>
pariſh of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields,
then there is in <hi>Cologne;</hi> and yet it
contains as many pariſh churches,
monaſteries and chappels, as there
are days in the year. The ſtreets
are very large, and ſo are the houſes
alſo, in many of which one may
drive a Coach or waggon into the
firſt room from the ſtreets; but the
ſtreets are ſo thin of people, that
one may paſs ſome of them and
not meet ten men or women, unleſs
it be Church men or Religious ſiſters.
The moſt conſiderable inhabitants
of the citie are Proteſtant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
tho but few in number,
and they not allowed a Church
neither, but a place called <hi>Woullin</hi>
a mile without the citie: the reſt of
the inhabitants who are lay men are
miſerably poor. There are no leſs
than 3000 Students in <hi>Cologne</hi>
taught by the Jeſuits <hi>gratis,</hi> who
have the priviledge to beg in muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
notes in the day time, and take
to them ſelves the liberty of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57018:66"/>
hats and cloaks in the night:
but if in the Jeſuits Schools there
be any rich Burgemaſters ſons who
have parts, they are ſure to be ſnapt
up and adopted into the ſocietie.
Formerly, before the matter was
otherwiſe adjuſted in the diet of
<hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> there have been deſigns
of voteing Proteſtant Magiſtrats into
the government again; but ſo ſoon
as the Jeſuits come to diſcover who
of the Magiſtrats were for that, they
immediately preferred their ſons or
daughters, and made them chanons,
abbots or chanoneſſes, and ſo diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them by intereſt. It's pity to
ſee a city ſo famous for traffike in
former times now brought to ſo
great a decay, that were it not for
the trade of Rheniſh wine it would
be utterly forſaken, and left wholy
to the Church men. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
alarms the Magiſtrats have had
by forreign deſigns upon their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the jealouſies fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
among themſelfs, as it is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57018:66"/>
thought, by the Agents and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of France, and eſpecially the
Biſhop of <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> have for
ſeverall yeares kept them in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
diſquiet, and neceſſitated them
to raiſe great taxes which hath not a
litle contributed to the impoveriſhing
of the people eſpecially the boars
round about; who tho the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
they live in be one of the moſt
pleaſant and fertile plains of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
yet are ſo wretchedly poor
that canvas cloaths, wooden ſhoes,
and ſtraw to ſleep on in the ſame
room with their beaſts, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
worldly happineſs that moſt of
them can attain unto. The Elector of
<hi>Cologne</hi> is a venerable old man, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of four great biſhopricks, viz
<hi>Cologne, Liege,</hi> Munſter, and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershime.</hi>
He divides his time
betwixt his devotion and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſtudies, being punctuall in ſaying
of maſs every morning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in his Elaboratory in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon;
for he is much addicted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57018:67"/>
to chymiſtry, and leaves the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Government to his
Cozen the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg.</hi> To
ſpeak of all the miracles of the three
Kings of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and the vaſt
number of ſaints who were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of England and interred
there, would be but tedious and
perhaps incredible to the reader,
aſwell as wide of my deſigne. I ſhall
therefore proceed.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cologne</hi> I took water on
the Rhine and advanced to the citie
of <hi>Bon</hi> and ſo forward to <hi>Coblints</hi>
the reſidence of the Elector of <hi>Trier.</hi>
over againſt this city, on the other
ſide of the Rhine ſtands that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
fort called <hi>Herminshine,</hi>
built on a high rocky hill as high
again as <hi>Windforcaſtle,</hi> and on the
north ſide of it the River Moſel
falls into the Rhine, over which
there is a Stately ſtone bridge. This
Prince governs his ſubjects as the
other Spirituall Electors doe, that
is, both by temporall and ſpirituall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57018:67"/>
authority, which in that Country is
pretty abſolute. The chiefe trade
of this Countrey is in wine, corn,
wood and Iron.</p>
            <p>The next Countrey I came to
was that of the Elector of <hi>Mayence</hi>
who is likewiſe both a ſecular and
Eccleſiaſticall Prince and governs
his ſubjects accordingly. He is
reckoned to be wholely for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of the French King; who
notwithſtanding of that, pretends
a title to the citadel of <hi>Mayence.</hi>
As I was upon my Journey to
<hi>Mayence</hi> by land, I made a turn
down the Rhin to viſit the famous
litle city of <hi>Backrack,</hi> and ſome
towns belonging to the Landgrave
of Heſſen, but eſpecially <hi>Backrack,</hi>
becauſe Travellers ſay it much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in its ſcituation
and manner of buildings. The
Burgemaſter of this city told mee
that the whole Country about
<hi>Backrack</hi> does not yield above 200
fouders of wine a year; And yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57018:68"/>
the Merchants of <hi>Dort</hi> by an art
of multiplication which they have
uſed ſome years, furniſh <hi>England</hi>
with ſeverall thouſande of fouders.
Here I ſhall take the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
a ſtrange ſtory which I found
recorded in this Countrey; tho I
know it to be mentioned in Hiſtory.
There was a certain cruel and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.
Biſshop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> who in
a year of great ſcarcity and famine
when a great number of Poor people
came to his gates begging for bread,
cauſed the Poor wretches, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children to be put into
a barn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under pretext of relieving
their neceſſities; but ſo ſoon as
they were got in, cauſed the barn
doors to be ſhut, fire ſet to it, and
ſo burnt them all alive: And whil'ſt
the poor wretches cried and ſhree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out for horrour and pain, the
Barbarous miſcreant ſaid to thoſe
that were about him, harke how
the Rats and mice doe crie. But
the juſt Judgement of God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57018:68"/>
not the fact to paſs unpuniſhed;
for not long after the cruel Biſhop
was ſo haunted with Rats and mice,
that all the guards he kept about
him, could not ſecure him from
them, neither at table nor in
bed, At length he reſolved to flee
for ſafetie into a tower that ſtood in
the middle of the Rhine; but the Rats
purſued him, got into his chamber
and devoured him alive; ſo that the
Juſtice of the Almighty made him
a prey to vermine who had inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
reckoned his fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to be ſuch. The tower which
I ſaw, to this day is called the
Rats-tower, and the ſtory is upon
record in the city of <hi>Mayence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On my Journey from thence I
came to the litle village of <hi>Hockom</hi>
not far diſtant, famous for our
Hockomore wine, of which though
the place does not produce above
150 fouders a year; yet the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
Hollanders of <hi>Dort</hi> make
ſome thouſand fouders of it goe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57018:69"/>
of, in England and the Indies.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hockom</hi> I proceeded to
<hi>Francfort</hi> a pleaſant city upon the
river of Maine, called formerl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
<hi>Teutoburgum</hi> and <hi>Helenopolis</hi> and
ſince <hi>Francfort,</hi> becaus here the
<hi>Franconians</hi> who came out of the
Province of <hi>Franconia</hi> foarded over,
when they went upon their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into <hi>Gallia,</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and named it <hi>France:</hi> and I
thought it might very well deſerve
the name of <hi>Petty-London,</hi> becauſe
of its Priviledges, and the humour
of the citizens. It is a Hanſiatick
and Imperiall town and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
the Magiſtrats being Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
which is the publick eſtabliſhed
Religion; though the Cathedrall
church belongs to the Roman
Catholicks who alſo have ſeverall
monaſteries there. The citie is
populous and frequented by all
ſorts of Merchants, from moſt parts
of Europe, &amp; part of Aſia alſo, becaus
of the two great faires that are yearely
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57018:69"/>
kept there, Many Jews live in this
city, and the richeſt Merchants are
Calviniſts, who are not ſuffered to
have a Church in the town, but
half an houres journey out of it, at
a place called <hi>Bucknam,</hi> where I have
told ſeventy four Coaches at a time
all belonging to Merchants of the
city. It was in ancient times much
enriched by <hi>Charle le maigne</hi> and
hath been ſince by the conſtitution
of the <hi>Golden bull:</hi> amongſt other
honours &amp; Priviledges its appointed
to be the place of the Emperours
Election, where many of the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
belonging to that Auguſt
ceremonie are to be ſeen. It is ſtrongly
fortified having a ſtately ſtone bridge
over the Maine that joynes it to <hi>Saxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſen</hi>
the quarter of the great maſter
of the Toutonick order. The
government is eaſy to the people,
they not being taxed as other cities
are, and had it not been for the
Alarmes the French gave them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the laſt war, they had not been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57018:70"/>
much troubled, but being forced to
keep three or four thouſand men in
conſtant pay to defend their fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
the Magiſtrats were conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to raiſe money by a tax. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that of the Emperour, they are
under the protection of ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Princes, as of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
of Heſſen-<hi>Caſſells,</hi> Landgrave
of <hi>Armeſtadt,</hi> the Count of <hi>Solmes</hi>
and the count of <hi>Hanau,</hi> who are
either Lutherans or Calviniſts,
amongſt whom the Late Elector-<hi>Palatine</hi>
was alſo one; but whether
the preſent who is Roman Catholick
be ſo or not, I cannot tel. This
city takes great care of their poor,
and in their charitie to poor travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
exceed Holland. I have ſeen a
liſt of ſeaven thouſand whom they
relieved in one year. Their great
hoſpitall is a large court or palace,
where the Engliſh Merchants for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lived, in the time of Queen
<hi>mary's</hi> perſecution of the Proteſtants,
who when they were recalled by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57018:70"/>
Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> were ſo generous
as to give the whole court, with
all their Packhouſes and lands to the
poor of the city. It was my fortune
to be there in that cold Winter in
the year 1683. and ſaw a ceremonie
performed by the Wine coopers of
the citie, who are obliged by law, that
when ever the Maine lyes faſt frozen
over for eight days together, to
make a great Fouder fat, Hoops
and Staves; and ſet it up compleat
upon the Ice. It was very good diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſee ſo many hands at worke,
and to obſerve the jollity and mirth
of the many thouſands of ſpectators
who wanted not plenty of Rheniſh
wine to carouſe in.</p>
            <p>I had the curioſitie afterward to
goe to the court of the Landgrave
of <hi>Armeſtadt</hi> a Lutheran Prince who
lives in part of the richeſt ſoyle in
Germany. His Highneſs is a very
courteous and obligeing Prince to
Strangers, and his ſubjects are in
a pretty good condition again,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57018:71"/>
though they have been great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
by the laſt war between the
Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen</hi> and this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to <hi>Heidleberg</hi>
a city I had been formerly in, in the
life time of that wiſe tho unfortunate
Prince Elector elder brother to Prince
Rupert. Here I had the Honour
to pay-my dutifull reſpects to the
Elector the ſon of that great Prince,
whoſe commiſſary I had the honour
to be for two years together in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi>
This Prince, ſince my being
there, is lately dead, and left behind
him the reputation of having been
a Zealous thorough paced Calviniſt,
and ſo conſtant a frequenter of the
church, that ſome Sundays he went
thrice a day to Sermon; but never
failed, if in health, to be once a
day at leaſt at the garriſon-church;
where he took particular notice of
ſuch officers as were abſent. He was
married to a moſt virtuous lady the
Royall ſiſter of the King of Denmark
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57018:71"/>
and his brother Prince George.
During his life time the univerſity
of Heidleberg flouriſhed exceedingly,
ſo that the number of ſtudents was
ſo great that Chambers and lodgings
in the citie were ſcarce, and <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius</hi>
was about quitting <hi>Leyden</hi>
to return to his profeſſors place in
<hi>Heidleberg,</hi> but how matters ſtand
ſince his death, I am as yet ignorant.
This Countrey is called the paradiſe
of <hi>Germany</hi> for its fruitfulneſs in
wine, corn, and all ſorts of fruit.
I my ſelf have ſeen growing in one
plain at the ſame time, vines, corn,
cheſtnuts, almonds, dates, figs,
cherries, beſides ſeverall other ſorts
of fruit. And as the Countrey is
fertile in yeelding the fruits of the
Earth, ſo the people are carefull
in providing ſtore room for them.
This I take notice of becauſe of the
prodigious Rheniſh wine fats which
are to be ſeen there, amongſt which
there are ſeaven, the leaſt whereof
holds the quantitie of 250 barells
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57018:72"/>
of Beere as I calculated; but the
large and moſt celebrated fat is that
which goes by the name of the great
Tun of <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> and holds 204
fouders of wine, and coſt 705 L.
Sterling in buildiug, for which one
may have a very good houſe built.
This fat I have ſeen twice, and
the firſt time was, when the Elector
treated the French Ambaſſadours
that came to conclude the match
betwixt his daughter and <hi>Monſieur</hi>
the French Kings brother, who
married her after the death of our
Kings ſiſter his firſt wife: at which
treat there happened an adventure
that I ſhall here pleaſe the Reader
with. In a gallery that is over this
fat the Elector cauſed a table to be
placed in the midle, exactly above
the bunghole of this Monſtrous veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and to be covered with a coſtly
banquet of all ſorts of ſweet meats:
The day before, all the wine being
emptied out of this Tun into other
Fats, a litle before the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57018:72"/>
with other forrein Miniſters
and Perſons of qualitie mounted the
ſtairs to come to the place of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
The Elector cauſed twelve
drummers with as many Trumpeters,
ſome Kettledrums and other muſick
to be lodged in the belly of the Tun,
with orders to ſtrike up upon a ſignall
given, when the Elector drank the
French Kings health. All being
ſate down at table and merrily fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the Elector drank the health,
and the ſignall was given; whereupon
the muſick began to play its part
with ſuch a roaring and uncouth
noiſe out of that vaſt cavitie below,
that the French and other Perſons
of qualitie who were unacquainted
with the deſigne, looking upon it to
be an infernall and ominous ſound,
in great aſtoniſhment began to cry
out <hi>Jeſu Marie. The worlds at
an end,</hi> and to ſhift every one for
himſelf in ſo great diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
that for haſte to be gone
they tumbled down ſtaires one over
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57018:73"/>
another. All that the Elector could
ſay to compoſe them, was either not
heard or not valued, nor could any
thing ſatisfie and reaſſure them, till
they ſaw the Actors com marching
out of their den. Had not many
Perſons of qualitie and travellers ſeen
this Fat as wel as my ſelf who know
that what I ſay of its incredible
bigneſs to be true, I ſhould be
afraid the Reader might think I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon his credulitie.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Heidleberg</hi> I went to ſee
that impregnable Fort or citadell
of <hi>Manheim alias Fredericks-berg</hi>
built by the Elector Frederick
brother to Prince Rupert, a Prince
of as good a head as any Germany
affoarded, who though ſome have
too partially Judged of him by his
miſfortunes, yet by the wiſeſt of
the age was acconnted the Cato of
Germany. The wiſeſt and beſt-men
of the world have been unfortunate,
which makes ſome to be of the
opinion that God in his wiſdom
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57018:73"/>
thinks fit it ſhould be ſo, leaſt
otherwiſe they might attribute their
proſperitie rather to the wiſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their own conduct, then
his all ſeeing Providence: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
dayly experience ſeemes to
evince the truth of this, ſince wee
ſee knaves and fools advanced to
preferment and richeſs, when men
of virtue and parts die neglected and
poor in the eyes of the world, though
rich in the enioyment of a contented
mind. But this is a digreſſion which
the honour I have for the memory
of that great man hath led mee into,
and therefore I hope will be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Reader. In the citadel
of <hi>Manheim</hi> I ſaw ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of that illuſtrious familie, which
without diſpute is the moſt ancient
of all the Secular Electors, being
elder to that of <hi>Bavaria</hi> which
ſprung from one and the ſame ſtock,
to wit, two Emperours of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.
Many writers derive them
originally from <hi>Charle le maigne,</hi> by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57018:74"/>
the line of <hi>Pepin</hi> King of France.
There have been ſeverall Emperours
of that race, one King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
and four Kings of <hi>Sweden,</hi> one of
which was King of <hi>Norway</hi> alſo,
beſides many great Generals of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in <hi>Germany, Hungary, France</hi>
and other Countries. Since I can
remember there vere five Proteſtant
Princes heires to that Electorall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
alive; which now by their death
is fallen to the Duke of <hi>Nowbourg</hi> a
Roman Catholick, whoſe Daughter
is Empreſs of Germany and another
of his Daughters maryed to the King
of Portugall. Being ſo neare Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,
I had the curioſitie to goe ſee
what figure that famous citie now
made ſince it had changed its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
for I had been thrice there
before, when it flouriſhed under the
Emperours protection, with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of a Hauſiatick town: And
Indeed I found it ſo diſfigured, that
had it not been for the ſtately Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
Church, and fair ſtreets and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57018:74"/>
buildings, I could ſcarcely have
know'n it. In the ſtreets and
Exchange which formerly were
thronged with ſober rich and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Merchants, you meet with
none hardly now but men in buff
Coats and ſcarffs with rabbles of
Soldiers their attendants. The
churches I confeſs are gayer, but not
ſo much frequented by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
as heretofore, ſeing the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans
are thruſt into the meaneſt
churches and moſt of the chiefe
Merchants both Lutherans and
Calviniſts removed to <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Hambourg.</hi> Within a few years, I
beleeve it will be juſt ſuch another
city for trade and Richeſs as <hi>Briſac</hi>
is. It was formerly a rich city and
well ſtockt with Merchants and
wealthy inhabitants, who lived under
a gentle and eaſy government; but
now the Magiſtrats have litle elſe
to doe in the government, but
onely to take their rules and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
from a citadell and great guns,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57018:75"/>
which are Edicts that Merchants
leaſt underſtand. I confeſs Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg
is the leſs to be pityed that
it ſo tamely became a ſlave, and put
on its chains without any ſtrugling.
Thoſe Magiſtrats who were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in it, are now ſenſible of their
own folly, and bite their nails for
anger, finding themſelves no better
but rather worſe hated than the
other Magiſtrats, who did what
they could to hinder the reception
of their new maſters the <hi>French.</hi> I
quickly grew weary of being here,
meeting with nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of poverty, and paying
exorbitant taxes; I therefore ſoon
returned to my <hi>Petty-London
Francfort,</hi> and from thence went to
<hi>Caſſells,</hi> the chiefe reſidence of the
Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen.</hi> This Prince
is a Calviniſt, as moſt of his ſubjects
are, very grave and Zealous in his
religion: He married a Princeſs
of <hi>Courland,</hi> by whom he hath an
hopefull iſſue, to wit, three ſons
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57018:75"/>
and two Daughters. The late King
was God father to one of his ſons,
who was Chriſtened by the name
of <hi>Charles.</hi> Captain <hi>William Legg</hi>
Brother to the Lord <hi>Dartmouth</hi>
repreſenting his Majeſtie as his
Envoy. The court of this Prince
does indeed reſemble a well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
colledge, or Religious Cloyſter,
in regard of its modeſtie and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie
in all things, and eſpecially
in the houres of devotion. He is
rich in money, and entertains about
nine thouſand men in conſtant pay,
under the command of <hi>Count van
derlipp,</hi> a brave and expert Soldier
his Lieutenant Generall; but can
bring many more upon occaſion
into field. This familie hath been
very happy both in its progenie and
alliances, many wiſe Princes of both
ſexes having ſprung from it; and
the mother of this preſent Landgrave
may be reckoned amongſt the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
women of the preſent and
paſt ages. After the death of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57018:76"/>
the 5. Landgrave of Heſſen her
husband, ſhe not only ſupported
but advanced the war wherein he
was engaged, did many ſignall
actions, Enlarged her territories,
and at the concluſion of the peace
kept under her pay 56 Cornets of
horſe in five Regiments, 166 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of foot, beſides thirteen
Companies of Dragons, and 14
independent Companies, in all 249
Companies of horſe and foot; ſhe
was a Princeſs extreamly obliging to
ſtrangers: eſpecially virtuous and
learned divines. I had the honour
a good many yeares agoe to kiſſe her
highneſſes hand; at which time ſhe
was mighty Zealous in promoting
an accommodation amongſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Religions, as the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
Lutheran and Calviniſt,
but eſpecially betwixt the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therefore entertained <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Duris</hi> at her court in <hi>Caſſels</hi>
who wrote ſeverall pieces upon that
ſubject of reconciliation, and with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57018:76"/>
ſome of his friends had a conference
with a learned prieſt that came from
Rome to forward the project; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Doctor publiſhed his
book of the <hi>Harmoney of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
which is highly eſteemed in
Germany.</p>
            <p>From this Princes court I dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
my journey to <hi>Hanover,</hi> taking
<hi>Lambſpring</hi> in my way, a place where
there is a convent of Engliſh Monks;
and there I met with a very aged
worthy and harmeleſs Gentleman
St. <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigue,</hi> a Perſon of
more integrity and pietie then to be
guilty, ſo much as in thought, of
what miſcreants falſly ſwore againſt
him in the licentions time of plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
the Lord Abbot and ſeverall
of the Monks I had ſeen there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
This monaſtery is very
obliging to all ſtrangers that travell
that way, as well as to theire own
Countreymen, and is highly reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the neighbouring Princes
of all perſuaſions, as the Princes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57018:77"/>
of the houſe of Lunenburg, the
Landgrave of Heſſen, and Elector
of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who as Biſhop of <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersheim</hi>
is their ordinary. The
town of Lambſpring is Lutheran
though under the government of
the Lord Abbot and his chapter, who
conſtantly chooſe Lutheran Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats
and Officers for the civill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
and live together in
that love and unitie, that as yet
there hath never the leaſt debate
happened amongſt them; and indeed
this harmoney is now to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in moſt parts of Germany where
different Religions are profeſſed.
When I conſidered ſo many goodly
faces both of Monks and ſtudents
in that Abbey, I could not forbeare
to make a ſerious reflexion on the
number of the Engliſh whom I had
ſeen in the colledges and Cloyſters
abroad, as at <hi>Rome, Rattesbonne,

Louvain, Bruſſels, Dunkerk,
Ghent, Paris,</hi> and other places,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57018:77"/>
beſides the ſeverall Nunneries, and
withall on the loſs that both King
and Kingdome ſuffered thereby,
when ſo many of our natives both
men and women ſhould be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſpend their own Eſtats and
the benevolence of others in a ſtrange
Land, which amounts to more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
than at firſt one may imagine;
and this thought, I confeſs, made
me wiſh it were otherwiſe. I would
not have the Reader to miſtake mee
here, as if I eſpouſed, or pleaded
for any particular party; No, I
plead onely for the ſentiments of
humanity, without which our nature
degenerates into that of brutes, and
for the love that every honeſt man
ought to have for his Countrey.
I am aſmuch a friend to the Spaniſh
Inquiſition, as to the perſecuting
of tender Conſcienced proteſtants,
provided there be no more but
Conſcience in the caſe; and I could
heartily wiſh that Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
could live as lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57018:78"/>
in <hi>England</hi> as they doe in
<hi>Holland, Germany,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
for give mee leave to ſay it, I
love not that Religion which in ſtead
of exulting, deſtroys the Principles
of morality and humane ſocietie. I
have met with honeſt men of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions,
even Turks and Jews,
who in their lives and manners have
far exceeded many of our Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
profeſſors at home; and when
ever this happened, I could not
forbeare to love the men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
embraceing there Religion,
for which they themſelves are to
account to their great maſter and
Judge.</p>
            <p>In my progreſs towards <hi>Hanover</hi>
I touched at <hi>Hildersheim</hi> a city
whoſe Magiſtrates are Lutheran,
though Roman Catholicks have
the Cathedrall Church, and ſeverall
monaſteries there. The court of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi>
makes another kind of figure
than that of <hi>Caſſels,</hi> it being the
court of a greater Prince, who is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57018:78"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> duke of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick
Lunenburg, Hanover</hi> &amp;c.
Here I had the honour to kiſs the
hands of the Princeſs Royall <hi>Sophia</hi>
youngeſt ſiſter to the late Prince
Rupert. Her highneſs has the
character of the <hi>Merry debonnaire
Princeſs</hi> of Germany, a lady of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
virtue and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and miſtriſs of the Italian,
French, High and low dutch and
Engliſh languages, which ſhe ſpeaks
to perfection. Her husband has
the title of the Gentlemen of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
a gracefull and comely Prince
both a foot and on horſeback, civill
to ſtrongers beyond compare, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Kind and beneficent to people
in diſtreſs, and known in the world
for a valiant and experienced Soldier.
I had the honour to ſee his troops
which without controverſic are as
good men, and commanded by as
expert Officers as any are in Europe:
Amongſt his Officers I found brave
<hi>Steel-hand Gordon</hi> Collonel of an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57018:79"/>
Excellent Regiment of horſe,
<hi>Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot</hi> and others
of our Kings ſubjects. God hath
bleſt the Prince with a numerous
offſpring, having ſix ſons all galant
Princes; of whom the two eldeſt
ſignalized themſelves ſo bravely at the
raiſing of the ſiege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that
as an undoubted proofe of their
valour they brought three Turks
home to this court priſoners. His
Eldeſt ſon is married to a moſt
beautifull Princeſs ſole heireſs of the
duke of <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> and <hi>Zell</hi> his
elder brother; as the lovely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
his daughter is lately married
to the Electorall Prince of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg.
He is a gracious Prince
to his people, and keeps a very
ſplendid court, having in his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
for the uſe of himſelf and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
no leſs than fifty two ſets of
coach horſes. he himſelf is Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
but as his ſubjects are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of different perſuaſions, nay
and ſome of them Jews too, ſo
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57018:79"/>
both in his court and army he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
Gentlemen of various opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Countries, as Italian ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
and Gentlemen that ſerve him,
and many Calviniſt French Officers:
neither is he ſo bigotted in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
but that he and his Children
goe many times to Church with the
Princeſs who is a Calviniſt, and
joine with her in her devotion.
His Countrey is good, having gold
and ſilver mines in it, and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
live well under him; as doe
thoſe alſo of his brother the duke
of <hi>Lunenbourg,</hi> and their Cozen the
duke of <hi>Wolfembottel,</hi> which are
the three Princes of the houſe of
<hi>Lunenbourg;</hi> of whom it may be
ſaid that they have alwayes ſtuck
honeſtly to the right ſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
the intereſts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
ſo that no by reſpect, neither
honour nor profit, could ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them, as it has with others,
to make them abandon the publick
concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57018:80"/>
From this Princes court I went
to <hi>Zell</hi> the reſidence of the duke
the elder brother of the familie.
This Prince is called the mighty
<hi>Nimrod</hi> becaus of the great delight
he takes in horſes, dogs and hunting.
He did mee the honour to let mee
ſhe his ſtables, wherein he keeps 370
horſes moſt of them Engliſh, or of
Engliſh breed. His dogs which
are alſo Engliſh, are ſo many, that
with great care they are quartered
in ſeverall apartments according to
their Kind and qualities, there being
a large office like a brewhouſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for boyling of malt and Corn
for them. It is this valiant Prince
who tooke <hi>Tieves</hi> from the French,
and made the <hi>Mareshall do Crequi</hi>
priſoner: he is extreamely obliging
to ſtrangers, and hath ſeverall brave
Scottiſh Officers under his pay, as
Major General <hi>Erskin, Graham,
Goloman, Hamilton Melvin</hi> and
others. His Lieutenant General is
one <hi>Chavot</hi> a Proteſtant of <hi>Alſatia</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:57018:80"/>
an excellent and experienced com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander;
who did mee the honour
to treat mee three days at his houſe,
where with all his <hi>Scottish</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Officers, whom he had invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
wee liberally drank to the
health of our preſent King, having,
as he told us, ſerved under his
Majeſtie, when duke of <hi>York,</hi> both
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he
gained the reputation both for skill
and conduct in the wars not onely
from Mareſhall <hi>Turin</hi> a competent
Judge, but alſo from all other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Perſons who had the honour
to know him, that fame hath made
better know'n in the world than the
encomium which that generous
Gentleman ingenuouſly gave, and
which heere I ſpare to relate. I ſhall
adde no more concerning this
Prince, his Officers, or Countrey;
but that he with the other two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the houſe of <hi>Lunenbourg Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi>
and <hi>Wolfenbottel,</hi> can upon
occaſion bring into the field 36000
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57018:81"/>
Soldiers whom they keep in conſtant
pay, and ſuch men as I never ſaw
better in my life.</p>
            <p>After ſome ſtay at the Court of
the duke of <hi>Zell</hi> I went to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
a famous Hanſiatick town.
It is a republick and city of great
trade, occaſioned partly by the
Engliſh Company of Merchant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
but much more by the
dutch Proteſtants who in the time
of the <hi>Duke of Alba</hi> forſook the low
Countries and ſeltled here, and
the Proteſtants alſo who were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of <hi>Cologne</hi> and other places
in Germany; who nevertheleſs are
not now allowed publick Churches
within the citie, but at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Altena</hi> a village belonging to
the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> a quarter of
an houres walk diſtant from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi>
This Commonwealth is
Lutheran and governed by four
<hi>Burgemaſters,</hi> twenty four <hi>Radts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres,</hi>
and a common Council of
all the Burghers who have above
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57018:81"/>
40 ſchellings <hi>per annum</hi> free hold.
The ſymbole or Motto under their
Armes is, <hi>da pacem domine in diebus
noſtris,</hi> and in their Standart are
theſe letters S. P. Q. H. The
people here grone under heavy tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and impoſitions; The State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
of continuall Alarms they have
from the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> or other
neighbours; and the inteſtine
broiles that frequently happen here,
as well as at <hi>Cologne,</hi> where the
Burgemaſters are often in danger of
their lives from the mutinous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile;
being forced to maintain ſix
or ſeaven thouſand men in pay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
two or three men of war to
guard their havens from pirats. I
ſhall not name all the wayes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
taxes which this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
uſes, becaus in moſt
they imitate the methods of the
<hi>States Generall</hi> as to that, which
have bin mentioned before: I ſhall
onely take notice of ſome peculiar
cuſtomes they have, wherein they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57018:82"/>
differ from Holland. When a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
ſhoe maker, or any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan
dies, leaving a widow and
Children, another of the ſame trade
is not admitted to ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as a maſter; unleſs he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with the widow for a piece
of money, or elſe marry her, or a
daughter of hers with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>If any man cauſe another to be
arreſted for debt or upon any other
ſuit, the plaintif muſt goe along
with the Officer who arreſts the
party and ſtay by him untill the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
be examined by the ſheriff;
ſo that if the ſheriff be not to be
ſpoken with that night, the plaintiff
muſt tarry with the priſoner all
night, untill the ſheriff examine
the matter, and ſee cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
or committing the party;
but this a plaintiff may doe by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation
Notariall.</p>
            <p>If a priſoner be committed for
debt, the plaintiff muſt maintain
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57018:82"/>
him in priſon according to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:
and if the party lye in priſon
during the ſpace of ſix yeares, at
the expiration of that time the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
is diſcharged; and if during
the time of his impriſonment, the
plaintif doe not punctually pay the
priſoners allowance at the months
end, the priſoner is ſet at liberty,
and nevertheleſs the plaintiff muſt
pay the Gailer the laſt months al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
            <p>This ſtate is ſevere in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtice againſt thieves,
murders and cheats. There is
no pardon to be expected for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and a Burgemaſter himſelf if
guilty cannot eſcape. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Murder is here as in
<hi>Sweden,</hi> breaking malefactors on
the wheele, pinching their breaſts
and Arms with hot Pincers, ſpeeting
them in at the fundament and out at
the ſhoulder, they have alſo cruel
wayes of torturing to make priſoners
confeſs; And are very carefull not to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57018:83"/>
be cheated in their publick revenue;
their acciſemen and collectors being
puniſhed as in <hi>Holland.</hi> They take
a very good courſe not to be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their acciſe; for all the mils
of the Countrey are in the hands
the State; ſo that no baker nor
brewer can grind his own corn, but
muſt have it ground at the States
mills, where they pay the acciſe.
There is a Generall tax upon all
houſes, and that is the Eight penny,
which nevertheleſs does not excuſe
them from chimney money. The
States here as at <hi>Genoa</hi> in Italy are
the publick vintners, of whom all
people muſt buy their wine, which
they buy from the Merchants, or
otherwiſe import it in their own
ſhips. In their ceremonies of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
and Chriſtening, they are
ridiculouſly prodigall; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
If one invite a Burgema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he muſt give him a ducat in
gold, if a <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dtsheer,</hi> that is, an
Alderman, a Rixdollar, to every
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57018:83"/>
Preacher, Doctor of Phyſick, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat
or Secretary halfe a Rixdollar,
and to every Schoolmaſter the third
part of a Rixdoller. The women
are the inviters to Burialls, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
and Chriſtenings, who weare
an Antick Kind of a dreſs, having
mitered caps as high again as the
Miter of a Biſhop. The Churches
here are rich in revenues, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
as Images and Stately
Organs wherein they much delight.
They are great lovers of Muſick;
in ſo much that I have told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5
maſters of ſeverall ſorts of Muſick
in one Church, beſides thoſe who
were in the Organ-gallery. Their
Organs are extraordinarely large.
I meaſured the great pipes in the
Organs of St. <hi>Catharins</hi> and St.
<hi>James's</hi> Churches, and found them
to be 3 foot and 3 quarters in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
and 32 foot long; in
each of which Organs there are two
Pipes 5 foot and 8 inches round.
The wealth and trade of this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57018:84"/>
citie encreaſes dayly: They ſend one
year with another 70 Ships to
Greenland, and have wonderfully
engroſſed that trade from <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> and it is beleeved
that ſmall and great there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to this Commonwealth five
thouſand ſayl of Ships. After <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,
Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> their
bank is reckoned the chiefe in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
but in trade they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the third in Europe, and come
next to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam.
Hambourg</hi> is now become the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of Germany and of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and northern ſeas. They give
great priviledges to the Jewes, and
to all ſtrangers whatſoever, Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Engliſh Company of
Merchant Adventures, whom they
allow a large building, where they
have a Church, and where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
governour, Secretary, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
and the other Officers
of the Company live, to whom
they yearly make preſent of Wine,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57018:84"/>
Beere, Sheep, Salmond and Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
in their ſeaſons. And ſo much
of <hi>Hambourg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Hambourg</hi> I went to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi>
which is alſo a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
and Imperiall town. It
is a large well built city contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ten pariſh Churches; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
dedicated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> being
in length 500 foot, with two high
ſpires all covered with braſs as the
reſt of the Churches of that city
are. In former times this city was
the place where the deputies of all
the Hanſiatick towns aſſembled,
and was once ſo powerfull as to make
war againſt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi>
and to conquer ſeverall places and
Iſlands belonging to thoſe two
Crowns, nay and to lend Ships to
England and other Potentates,
without any prejudice to their own
trade, wherein they vied in all parts
with their neighbours; but it is
now exceedingly run into decay not
onely in territories, but in wealth
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57018:85"/>
and trade alſo. And the reaſon of
that was chiefely the inconſiderate
zeal of their Lutheran Miniſterꝰ
who perſwaded the Magiſtrates to
baniſh all Roman Catholicks,
Calviniſts, Jews, and all that diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
even the Engliſh Company
too, who all went and ſetled in
<hi>Hambourg,</hi> to the great advantage
of that city and almoſt ruine of
<hi>Lubeck,</hi> which hath not now above
200 Ships belonging to it, nor
more territories to the State; than
the city it ſelf and a ſmall part cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Termond</hi> about eight miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from it. The reſt of there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
are now in the poſſeſſion of
the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> by whom
the burghers are ſo continually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed,
that they are quite tired
out with keeping guard and paying
of Taxes. The city is indeed well
fortified; but the government not
being able to maintain above 1500
Soldiers in pay, 400 Eurghers
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57018:85"/>
in two Companies are obliged to
watch every day. They have a
large well built Stathouſe, and an
Exchange covered, on the top
whereof the globes of the world
are painted. This Exchange is
about fifty yards in the length; and
but fifteen in breadth; over it there
is a Roome where the skins of five
Lions which the Burghers killed at
the city gates in the year 1252 are
kept ſtuft. The great market place
is very large where a monumentall
ſtone is to be ſeen, on which one
of their Burgemaſters was beheaded
for running away without fighting
in a ſea engagement. The people
here ſpend much time in their
Churches at devotion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
chiefely in ſinging. The women
are beautifull but diſfigured with
a kind of Antick dreſs; they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
cloaks like men. It is cheap
living in this town; for one may
hire a palace for a matter of 20
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a year, and have proviſions at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57018:86"/>
very reaſonable rates: beſides the air
and water is very good; the city being
ſupplied with fountains of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
freſh water, which <hi>Hambourg</hi>
wants; and good ground for cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerage,
there being cellars here fourty
or fifty foot deep.</p>
            <p>I had the curioſity to goe from
<hi>Lubeck</hi> to ſee the Ancient city of
<hi>Magdeburg,</hi> but found it ſo ruined
and decayed by the Swediſh war, that
I had no encouragement to ſtay
there. I therefore haſtened to
<hi>Berlin</hi> the chiefe reſidence of the
Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> at whoſe
Court I mett with a very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
French Merchant who
tould me that he and divers other
Merchants were deſigned to have
lived in <hi>England,</hi> but were diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by a letter ſent from <hi>London,</hi>
by a French man that was removeing
from thence to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for
theſe following reaſon which I cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
out of his Letter; Firſt becauſe
the Reformed Religion is perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57018:86"/>
in <hi>England</hi> as it is in <hi>France,</hi>
the which I tould him was a great
untruth, for it is apparent that
they have been all along graciouſly
admitted, and received into his
Majeſties Dominions, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
&amp; allowed the free exerciſe
of their owne forme of worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine &amp; diſcipline
of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> nor can
they who converſe with the French
Miniſters either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi>
be Ignorant, that the chiefeſt part,
if not all thoſe Miniſters are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to complye with the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and it is Evident that
moſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
(ſo called;) in <hi>Holland</hi>
make uſe of Organs in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing was that both
the bank of <hi>London</hi> and the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
Gouldſmiths were all broak,
the which I tould this Frenchman
was not true altogether, for there are
many able Bankers whome I named
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57018:87"/>
as <hi>Alderman Fowles, Alderman
Hornbey, Alderman Duncomb, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
Founs, Mr. Thomas Cook,
Mr. Rob: Vyner, Mr. Childe,
Mr. Endes, Mr. Evans</hi> and
others well known to the world by
their ſolid dealling: neyther was the
Bank (as he called the Chamber of
<hi>London)</hi> broak, only it had been
under the management of a bad
Perſon whoſe deſigne was to bring
it into diſgrace; beſides there is the
<hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> an unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſecuritie for thoſe as have money
to diſpoſe of, together with another
undeniable ſecuritie which is Land.
Thirdly he ſaith, that in <hi>England</hi>
there is no Regiſter, and therefore
many frauds in purchaſes &amp; morga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which begett teadious ſuites,
and renders both dangerous to truſt;
Fourtly that if a man would purchaſe
land he cannot, being an Alien, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
Naturalized. Fiftly that in
<hi>England</hi> there are ſo many plots
and Confuſions in Government that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57018:87"/>
the Kingdome is hardly quiet
twenty yeares together.</p>
            <p>Sixtly that falſe wittneſſes were
ſo common in <hi>England</hi> and the
crime of perjury ſo ſlightly puniſhed,
that no man could be ſafe in life or
Eſtate if he chanced to be in trouble.
Laſtly he ſaid that the <hi>English</hi> are
ſo reſtleſs and quarreleſome, that
they not only foment and cheriſh
Animoſities amongſt one another,
but are Every foot contriving and
plotting againſt their lawfull ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and the Government. By ſuch
ſurmiſes and inſinuations as theſe
the <hi>French</hi> and Germans are ſcared
from truſting themſelves and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in England and therefore
ſettle in <hi>Amſterdam, Hamburg</hi> and
other Cittyes, where there are Banks
and Regiſters; This I ſay is one
cauſe why there are now to be ſeene
at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſuch vaſt numbers of
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> who have
much inriched that Citty and raiſed
the rents of the houſes 20 parcent,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57018:88"/>
and the ſilkeweavers grow alſo verie
rich keeping ſo many Almes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to doe their work and having
all their labour without any charge
only for the teaching them their
trades; which hath leſſened the
revenues of the <hi>French</hi> crown, and
will in tyme greately increaſe the

advance ther publick Incomes.</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth the inconſtancy
and wantonneſſe of the <hi>English</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
eſpecially of late tymes, when
no other cauſe could be given for
it, but to much eaſe and plenty,
is not only wondered at but refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon by foreigners; yet I am
morally certaine that could the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> be once againe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in love and affection as they are
bound to be in duty and Intereſt,
and would they be as willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to their own hapines as
heaven hath been kind and liberal
in beſtowing the meanes of it, with
a good and gratious Prince ſolicitous
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57018:88"/>
for preſerveing the ſame to them,
could wee be ſo bleſt as wee have
great reaſon to Expect wee may
under the Auſpicious reigne of him
whoſe royall Virtues are dreaded
by none either at home or a broad
but ſuch as are the diſturbers of
publick and lawfull Authoritie.</p>
            <p>Having made this digreſſion, I return
to <hi>Berlin,</hi> It is a city lately enlarged
with fair ſtreets and palaces. The
Magiſtrates of the place are Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
which is the publick eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
Religion in all the Electors
dominions; though he himſelf and
his Children be Calviniſts. He is
lookt upon to be ſo true to that
perſuaſion, that he is reckoned the
Protector of the Calviniſts; and
indeed he ſollicited the Emperour
very hard for a toleration of the
Proteſtants in Hungary. His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
as moſt of the Lutheran
miniſters alſo, endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Engliſh in their way of
preaching: and his highneſs is ſo
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57018:89"/>
much taken with Engliſh divinity,
that he entertains divines for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Engliſh books into the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
tongue, as <hi>the whole duty of
man</hi> and ſeverall others. He has a
large and Srately palace at <hi>Berlin</hi> and
therein a copious library enriched
with many manuſcripts, medalls,
and rarities of Antiquity. He may
compare with moſt Princes for hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
guards, being all of them
proper well bodied men, and moſt
part Officers who ride in his guards
of horſe. As he is know'n in the
world to be a valiant and warlick
Prince, ſo he maintains in pay an
Army of 36000 men; beſides five or
ſix thouſand horſmen, who in time
of war are modelled into troopes;
with which body during the late
war with <hi>Sweden,</hi> his highneſs in
Perſon beat the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of his
Countrey. Hee keeps his forces
in ſtrickt Diſcipline, obliging all the
Officers, if Proteſtants, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
and holy days to march their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57018:89"/>
Companies in order to
Church, but if a ſuperiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
be of a contrary perſuaſion,
then the next in commiſſion ſupplies
his place. This cuſtome is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
obſerved by all his highneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
garriſons; whileſt he himſelf
with his Children, being five ſons,
two Daughters, and two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in law, goe conſtantly to the
Calviniſt Church adjoyning to the
Court. Amongſt other acts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
pietie and charitie, this Prince
hath eſtabliſhed and endowed ſome
Religious houſes or Nunneries for
Proteſtant young ladies, where they
may live virtuouſly and ſpend their
time in devotion as long as they
pleaſe, or otherwiſe marry, if they
think fit, but then they loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Monaſtery. There is
one of theſe at <hi>Herford</hi> in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia,
where I was and had the
honour to wait upon the Lady Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
the Princeſs <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> eldeſt
ſiſter of the Elector Palatine and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57018:90"/>
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who is ſince dead.
Notwithſtanding the late wars with
<hi>Sweden</hi> and that by the prevalency
of <hi>France</hi> in that haſty treaty of
peace concluded at <hi>Nimwegen,</hi> his
Electorall Highneſs was obliged to
give back what he had Juſtly taken
from that crown; yet his ſubjects
flouriſh in wealth and trade, his
highneſs having encouraged manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of all ſorts, by inviting Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans
into his dominions, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a Company of tradeing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to the Weſt-Indies, which
will much advance navigation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his ſubjects. And in all
humane probabilitie they are like to
continue in a happy condition, ſeing
by the alliances his highneſs hath
made with the Proteſtant Princes of
the Empire, and eſpecially the houſe
of <hi>Lunenbourg,</hi> they are in no danger
of being diſturbed by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
I told you before that the
Prince of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> was married
to the Daughter of the duke of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57018:90"/>
               <hi>Hanover,</hi> ſo that ſo long as that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
holds, the families of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi>
and <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> will be
in a condition to caſt the ballance
of the Empire; they both together
being able to bring into the field
80000 as good men as any are in
Europe.</p>
            <p>When I parted from <hi>Berlin</hi> I
made a turn back to <hi>Lunenbourg</hi>
in my way to Swedland, where I
found ſeverall of my Countrey men
Officers in the gariſon, who ſhew'd
mee what was moſt remarkeable in
the city, as the Saltworks (which
bring in conſiderable ſummes of
money to the duke of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg)</hi>
the Stathouſe, and Churches,
in one of which I ſaw a communion
table of pure ducat gold. From
thence I went into the Province of
of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and at a ſmall ſea port
called <hi>Termond,</hi> of which I ſpake,
before, I embarked for <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that hath read in the hiſtories
of this laſt age the great exploits of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57018:91"/>
               <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> and his <hi>Swedes,</hi>
perhaps may have a fancy that it
muſt be an excellent Countrey which
hath bredſuch warriours; but if he
approach it, he will ſoon find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
undeceived. Entering into
<hi>Sweedland</hi> at a place called <hi>Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ort,</hi>
wee ſailed forwards amongſt
high rocks having no other proſpect
from Land but mountains till wee
came to <hi>Dollers,</hi> which is about
four Swediſh, that is, twenty four
Engliſh miles from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the
capitall citie of the Kingdome: upon
my comeing a ſhore I confeſs I
was a litle ſurpriſed to ſee the
poverty of the people; and the
litle wooden houſes they lived in,
not unlike Soldiers huts in a leaguer;
but much more, when I diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
litle elſe in the Countrey but
mountanous rocks and ſtanding
lakes of water. The Reader will
excuſe mee, I hope, if I remarke
not all that I may have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in this Countrey, ſeing by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57018:91"/>
what I have already written, he may
perceive that my deſigne is rather
to obſerve the manner of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
living, then to give a full
deſcription of every thing that may
be ſeen in the Countrey they live in.
However I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of
that too, having premiſed once
for all that the ordinary people are
wretchedly poor; yet not ſo much
occaſioned by the Publick taxes,
as the barrenneſs of their Countrey,
and the oppreſſion of the nobles
their Landlords, and immediate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
who till the preſent King
put a ſtop to their violences, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically
domineered over the
lives and fortunes of the poor pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.
From <hi>Dollers</hi> I took waggon
to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> changing horſes three
times by the way, by reaſon of the
badneſs of the rode, on all hands
environed with rocks, that hardly
open ſo much as here and there to
leave a ſhred of plain ground. At
two miles diſtance upon that rode
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57018:92"/>
the citie of <hi>Stockholme</hi> looks great;
becaus of the Kings palace, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Noblemen, and ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which are ſeated upon rocks;
and indeed, the whole citie and
ſuburbs ſtand upon rocks, unleſs it
be ſome few houſes built upon
ground gained from the rivers that
run throw the town. <hi>Stockholme</hi>
has its name from a ſtock or logg
of wood which three brothers threw
into the water five miles above the
city, making a vow that where
ever that ſtock ſhould ſtop, they
would build a caſtle to dwell in.
The ſtock ſtopt at the Holme or
rock where the palace of the King
now ſtands; and the brothers to
be as good as their word, there
built their caſtle, which invited
others to doe the like; ſo that in
proceſs of time the other rocks or
holmes were covered with buildings
which at length became the capital
citie of the Kingdome. It is now
embelliſhed with a great many
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57018:92"/>
Stately houſes, and much emproved
from what it was 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 yeares agoe,
as indeed, moſt cities are; for the
Stathouſe then built, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible
and low that in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or <hi>England,</hi> it would not be
ſuffered to ſtand to diſgrace the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Council Chamber where
the Burgemaſter and <hi>Raedt</hi> ſit, is
two rooms caſt into one not above
nine foot high; and the two rooms
where the ſheriffs and the Erve col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(which is a Judicature like to
the <hi>Doctors Commons</hi> in England) ſit
are not above eight foot and a halfe
high. The Kings Palace is a large
ſquare of ſtone building, in ſome
places very high, but an old and
irregular fabrick, without a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantitie of ground about it
for gardens and walks. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſurrounded with water; but
ſome yeares ſince part of it was filled
up to make a way from the caſtlegate
down into the old town. In this
Palace there are large rooms; but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57018:93"/>
the lodgings of the King, Queen
and Royall familie are three pair of
ſtairs high, the rooms in the firſt and
ſecond ſtory's being deſtin'd for the
Senat Chamber and other courts of
Judicature. The Kings library is
four pair of ſtairs high, being a room
about fourty ſix foot ſquare, with
a cloſet adjoyning to it not half the
dimenſions. When I conſidered
the appartments and furniture of
this Court, I began to think that
the French Author wrote truth, who
in his Remarks upon Swedland ſayes,
that when Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> reſigned
the Crown to <hi>Carolus Guſtaphus</hi> the
father of this preſent King, ſhe
diſpoſed of the beſt of the furniture
of the Court, and gave away a large
ſhare of the Crown lands to her favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;
in ſo much that the King
conſidering the poor condition ſhe
had left the Kingdome in, and
ſeeing the Court ſo meanely furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
ſaid that had he know'n be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he accepted the Crown, what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57018:93"/>
then he did, he would have taken
other meaſures.</p>
            <p>There are many other Stately pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
in <hi>Stockholme</hi> belonging to the
nobilitie; but many of them for
want of repairs, and not being inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
run to ruine; ſeverall of the
nobles who lived in them formerly,
having loſt the eſtates that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their ancient ſplendour, as wee
ſhall ſee hereafter, being retired
unto a Countrey life. There are
alſo ſome other magnificent ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
begun, but not finiſhed, as
that Stately building intended for
a Parliament houſe for the nobles,
and two or three Churches: but
what I moſt wonder at is the vault
wherein the late King lies buried, is
not as yet covered but with boards,
for it is to he obſerved that the Kings
of <hi>Sweeden</hi> have no tombs and
monuments as in England and other
Countries; but are put into copper
coffins with inſcriptions on them,
and placed one by another in vaults
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57018:94"/>
adjoyning to the Gray Friers Church.
Theſe vaults are about Eight in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
having turets over them with
vains of Copper gilt, carved into
the ciphers of the ſeverall Kings
who give them their names by being
the firſt that are interred in them.
The vault of the late King is not
yet finiſhed, no more then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks
above mentioned, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be imputed to the late
troubles of <hi>Swedland.</hi> The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the inhabitants of <hi>Stockholme</hi>
are alſo much decreaſed within theſe
few yeares, partly by reaſon of the
removal of the Court of Admiraltie
and the Kings Ships from that citie to
<hi>Charles-crown,</hi> a new haven lately
made about 200 Engliſh miles from
thence, which hath draw'n many
families belonging to the fleet and
Admiralitie from <hi>Stockholme</hi> to live
there: and partly becaus many of
the nobilitie, gentry and thoſe that
depended on them, are, as I ſaid
before, withdraw'n from <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:57018:94"/>
to a retired life in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Nevertheleſs the ordinary
ſort of Bourghers who ſtill remain
are extreamly poor; ſeing the women
are fain to worke like horſes, drawing
carts, and as labourers in England,
ſerving maſons and bricklayers with
ſtone, bricks and mortar, and unloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
veſſells that bring thoſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials;
ſome of the poor creatures in the
ſummertime toyling in their ſmocks
without either ſhoes or ſtockings.
They performe alſo the part of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen,
and for a ſmall matter will
row paſſengers 40 miles or more if
they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Court here is very thin and
ſilent, the King living frugally &amp; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
dining in publick He eats
commonly with <hi>the two Queens</hi>
his mother and conſort, who is a
virtuous Princeſs ſiſter to the King
of Denmark. She is the mother of
five Children, three ſons and two
daughters, with whom ſhe ſpends
moſt of her time in retirement. The
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57018:95"/>
King is a goodly Prince whom God
hath bleſſed and endowed with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
far beyond what
might have been expected from his
education, wherein he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
abuſed, being taught litle
more than his mother tongue. He
is gracious, Juſt and valiant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
at his devotion, and utterly
averſe from all kind of debauchery,
and the unfaſhionable vanities of
other courts in playes, and danceing.</p>
            <p>His Sports are hunting and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeing
of his guards, and he rarely
appeares publickly or gives audience
to ſtrangers, which is imputed to
his ſenſe of the neglect of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
He is a Prince that hath
had a very hard beginning in the
world, which hath many times
proved fortunate to great men; and
indeed, if wee conſider all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of his early miſfortunes,
how he was ſlighted and neglected
by his nobles who would hardly
vouchſafe to pay him a viſit when he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57018:95"/>
was among them in the Countrey,
or to doe him homage for the lands
they held of the Crown; and how
by the Pernicious councels of the
French and the weakeneſs or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of his governours he was
miſled into a war that almoſt coſt
him his Crown, having loſt the
beſt of his territories in <hi>Germany</hi>
and <hi>Schonen,</hi> and moſt of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
both by ſea and land: If I ſay,
theſe things be conſidered, it will
probably appeare that hardly any
Prince before him hath in a ſhorter
time or more fully ſetled the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and prerogative of the
Crown, then he hath done in <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi>
for which he ſtands no wayes
obliged to France, as he was for the
reſtauration of what he loſt during
the war. He is now as abſolute as
the French King, and makes Edicts
which have the force of Laws with
out the concurrence of the Eſtates
of the Kingdome. He hath erected
two Iudicatures the one called the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57018:96"/>
colledge of Reduction, and the
other of inſpections; the firſt of
which hath put his Majeſty in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
again of all lands alienated
from the Crown, and the other
called to account all perſons even
the heires and executors of thoſe
who had cheated the Crown, and
made them <hi>refound</hi> what they or
their predeceſſors had appropriated
to their own uſe of the Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.
Theſe two neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
as they have reduced
many great families to a pinch, who
formerly lived ſplendidly upon the
Crown lands and revenues, and
obliged them to live at home upon
their ancient and private Patrimonie
in the Countrey, which is one great
cauſe that the Court of <hi>Sweden</hi> is
at preſent ſo unfrequented; ſo have
they enabled his Majeſtie, without
burdening of his ſubjects, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Charges of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to maintain 64000 men
in pay. The truth is his other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57018:96"/>
are but ſmall, ſeing Queen
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> enjoys the beſt of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
as her allowance, and that
what ariſes from the Copper and
Iron mines, one Silver mine, the
Pitch and Tar, the cuſtomes and
exciſe amounts to no extraordinary
ſumm of money, &amp; the land tax in
ſo barren a Countrey ſcarcely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
to be named. The cuſtomes
and exciſe, I confeſs, are very high,
and the rigorous manner of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them pernicious to trade; as for
inſtance. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a ſhip come to <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme</hi>
from <hi>London</hi> with a hundred
ſeverall ſorts of goods, and thoſe
goods aſſigned to fifty ſeveral men
more or leſs; if any of thoſe fifty
doe not pay the cuſtome of what
belongs to him, though it be for
a barrel of Beer, the Ship ſhall not
be unladen, nor no man have his
goods out, though he hath fully
payed the cuſtomes for them, till
this laſt man hath payed his. There
are ſeverall other ſilly cuſtomes in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57018:97"/>
               <hi>Swedland</hi> that diſcourages men
from tradeing there; as if any ſtranger
die there, a third of his Eſtate muſt
goe to the city or town where he
traded. No forreigne Merchant in
<hi>Stockholm</hi> can travell into any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
where there is a faire without a
paſsport: and at preſent ſeing there
is no treaty of trade betwixt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Sweden,</hi> though the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
bring as conſiderable a trade to
that Kingdome, as any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
whatſoever, yet they are very
unkindly uſed by the Officers of the
cuſtome houſe; whereas the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
in <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and other cities have new
and greater Priviledges allowed
them. Nor would I Counſel an
Engliſhman to goe to law with a
Swediſh Burgher in <hi>Sweden,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if he be a Whiggiſh Scot who
hath got his freedome in <hi>Stockholme,</hi>
for thoſe are a kind of skrapers, whom
I have obſerved to be more invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
againſt the <hi>English</hi> then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Sweeds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:57018:97"/>
Of all the Swediſh army of 64000
men, the King keeps but 12 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of 200 men a peece, with
ſome few horſe guards in <hi>Stockholme,</hi>
who are not upon duty as ſentinels
at the Court gates, as at the Courts
of other Princes. The reſt are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
into quarters and garriſons
upon the fronteers which are ſo far
diſtant in that large compaſs of land
which his territories take up, that
it would require a hard and tedious
worck to bring them together to a
generall muſter. They are however
kept under very ſtrick diſcipline,
and thoſe that lye neare often viewed
by the King. They have od ſorts
of puniſhments for the Souldiers
and Officers of all degrees: for
example if a Serjeant or Corporall
be drunk or negligent on duty, they
are put into armour, and with three
muskets tied under each arm, made
to walke two hours before the
Court of guard: yet for all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of diſcipline uſed againſt the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57018:98"/>
Soldiers, they commit many abuſes
in the night time, robbing and
ſometimes killing men upon the
ſtreets in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where they
have no lights nor guards as in <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhaguen.</hi>
Informer times there
have been at one time thirty five
Collonels beſides Generall Officers
in the Swediſh Army all the ſubjects
of the King of great Britain, but
at preſent there are few or none,
unleſs it be the ſons of ſome Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Officers deceaſed; nor did I
ever ſee an Engliſhmen in the Kings
guards horſe or foot but one, and
the ſon of <hi>Sr. Eduard</hi> wood, who
hath ſince quitted the ſervice. The
King hath exceedingly won the
hearts of the common people, not
onely by exempting them from the
tyrannical Juriſdiction of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and gentry, who formerly would
by their own private authority pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and put to death the peaſants
at their pleaſure; which makes the
Countries very willing to quarter the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57018:98"/>
Kings Soldiers, but by his exactneſs
in puniſhing duels, murder and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries.
Perjury is death here alſo
as in Holland: which makes the
Magiſtrates in ſome ports of this
Kings territories enjoyns ſtrange
kinds of oaths to deter men from
being forſworn. As for inſtance,
in ſome places, the witneſs is ſet,
with a ſtaff in his hand, upon ſome
peeble ſtones and charcoale, where
he is to imprecate and pray, that
if what he ſweareth be not true,
his land may become as barren as
thoſe ſtones, and his ſubſtance be
conſumed to aſhes like the coals he
ſtands on, which as ſoon as he
ſteps down are ſet on fire. This
manner of ſwearing ſo terrifies
the people, that they commonly
tremble when they come to take
their oath.</p>
            <p>The Religion of the dominions
of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as of thoſe
of the King of Denmark, and of
other Princes and ſtates whom wee
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57018:99"/>
have named is Lutheran; who are
more rigid to Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and Calviniſts than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtanrs
of Germany. There is no
tolleration allowed here to Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt
miniſters; and they take an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
courſe to keep the Countrey
clear of prieſts and Jeſuits, by guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them whether they be young
or old. In commemoration of the
great loſſes and deſolation iuſtained
in the late war, the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſtrictly
keep four faſting days in the months
of <hi>April, May, June</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> on
which days all men are prohibited
by Authority to kindle fire in their
houſes, or to eat till after Evening
ſervice is don, which in the winter
time could not be endured. They
delight much in ſinging in their
Churches, which they conſtantly
performe twice every day, morning,
and evening. In their maryings,
Chriſtenings and buryings they are
ſo prodigally extravagant, that if
all three happen in one yeare to a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57018:99"/>
man of a competent eſtate, it is
enough to breake him, The clergy
of <hi>Sweden</hi> are neither ſo rich nor
learned as thoſe of Germany, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both the opportunities of ſtudy,
and of converſing with learned men,
that thoſe of other Countreys en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
though there be ſome learned
men amongſt them. A Biſhoprick
in <hi>Sweden</hi> is no great benefice, if
compared with ſome Perſonages in
England; for the Archbiſhop and
Metropolitan hath not above 400
L. <hi>per ann.</hi> and ſome of the reſt are
not worth above 150 or 200 L. a
yeare. The inferiour Clergy are
not ſo regular in their lives and
converſation in the Countries di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from <hi>Stockholme,</hi> as they are
neare the court, and the reaſon is,
partly becaus they entertain tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
that paſs the Countrey, there
being no Ins in moſt places for the
accommodation of perſons of any
qualitie, and ſo are obliged to drink
with their gueſts: and partly becaus
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57018:100"/>
at buryings and Chriſtenings, where
there is commonly high drinking,
the Pape or Parſon is maſter of the
Ceremonies; And here give mee
leave, to tell a ſhort ſtory of one
of them. A Pape comeing to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
a Child in a Church, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Scottiſh man to be Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was ſo tranſported either with
Zeal or his cups, that when he came
to exorciſe the Child which is a rite
uſed in their Office of Adminiſtring
that Sacrament, He neglected the
forme preſcribed by the liturgie, and
in an extemporary prayer begg'd
that the devill might depart out of
the Child, and enter into that
Scottiſh Heretick; for ſo they call
the Presbyterians of that nation.
The prayer of the Pape ſo incenſed
the Scot that he vowed revenge,
and watched the Pape with a good
cudgell next day as he croſſed the
Church yard, where he beat him
and left him all in blood lying on
the ground and crying out murder.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57018:100"/>
For this fact the Scot was had before
the Juſtice, who asking him how
he durſt be ſo bold as to lay his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
hands upon the man of God,
He, who knew very well what uſe
to make of the devill he had got,
foaming at the mouth and cunningly
acting the demoniack, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that the Pape might thank
himſelf for what he had met with;
for ſince he had conjured the devill
into him he ſpared no body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wife nor Children, nor would
he ſpare the Juſtice himſelf, and
with that ſell a mangling and tearing
the Magiſtrat, that he was fain to
betake himſelf to his heeles, crying
out <hi>O! the devill, ſave mee;</hi> and
ſo the Scot marched home no man
daring to lay hold on him, for fear
of being torn to peeces by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
But the Juſtice recollecting
himſelf ſent for the Pape, told him
that the Scot was a cunning rogue,
and bid him goe home, get a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for his head and be ſilent; leaſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57018:101"/>
if the matter came to the Biſhops
ears, he might be cenſured for
goeing againſt the rubrick of the
liturgie.</p>
            <p>The famous Univerſitie where
their Clergy are bred is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſall</hi> eight
Swediſh miles from <hi>Stockholme.</hi>
There are commonly 150 or 200
Students there, but no endowed
colledges as in other Countries.
The library is ſo meane and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
that the libraries of many
Grammar Schools and of privat
men in England or Holland are
far better ſtored with books then it
is. Upon viewing of it, and that of
the Kings Palace, I called to mind
the ſaying of a French man, upon
the like occaſion; That <hi>Swedland</hi>
came behind <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
in the knowledge of men and things
at leaſt 800 yeares; yet ſome <hi>Swedes</hi>
have been ſo conceited of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of their Countrey, as to
bragg that Paradice was ſeated in
<hi>Sweden,</hi> that the Countrey was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57018:101"/>
turned into ſuch heaps of rocks for
the rebellion of our firſt parents,
and that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel</hi> in a Countrey three <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi>
miles diſtant from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſall.</hi> A
French man ſtanding by and hearing
this Romantick ſtory, as I was
told, fitted him with the like, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that when the world was
made in ſix days, at the end of the
creation all the Rubbiſh that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
was throw'n together into
a corner, which made up <hi>Sweden</hi>
and Norway. And indeed the
French ſeeme to have no great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Countrey, what ever
kindneſs they may have for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for a French Ambaſſadour, as
an author of that Countrey relates,
being by order of Queen Chriſtina
treated in a Countrey houſe 4
Swediſh miles from <hi>Stockholme,</hi>
and upon the rode goeing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meing,
with all the varieties and
pleaſures that the Countrey could
affoard, on purpoſe to make him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57018:102"/>
have a good opinion of the ſame;
made anſwere to the Queen (who
asked him upon his return what he
thought of <hi>Sweden)</hi> that were he
maſter of the whole Countrey, he
would preſently ſell it &amp; buy a farme
in France or England; which, under
favour, I think was a litle tart and
ſawcy.</p>
            <p>Having ſtayed a conſiderable time
in Swedland, and moſt part at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,</hi>
I ſet out from thence to goe
to <hi>Elſenbourg</hi> by land, and went a
litle out of my way to ſee a ſmall
city called <hi>Eubrone</hi> famous for a coat
of Arms which it got in this manner.
A certain Maſculine Queen of
<hi>Denmark</hi> who had conquered a
great part of <hi>Sweden,</hi> comeing to
this city, asked the Magiſtrates,
what was the Arms of their city;
who having told her that they had
none, ſhe plucked up her coats and
ſquatting upon the Snow, bid them
take the marke ſhe left there for their
Arms: It's pity ſhe did not give them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57018:102"/>
a ſuitable motto to it alſo. What
that figure is called in blazonerie
I know not, but to this day the
city uſes it in their Armes, and for
marking their commodities. This
Queen came purpoſely into <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
to pay a viſit to a brave woman
that oppoſed a King of <hi>Swedland,</hi>
who in a time of famine would have
put to death all the men and women
in his Countrey above ſixty years
of age. The Countrey all the way
I travelled in <hi>Swedland</hi> is much of
the ſame qualitie of the land about
<hi>Stockholme,</hi> untill I came neare the
Province of <hi>Schonen</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſtore houſe and Kitchin
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> where the Countrey is
far better. It was formerly very
dangerous to travell in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Schonen,</hi> becaus of the
Snaphances who were a kind of
bloody robbers, now utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by the King; ſo that it is
ſafe enough travelling there. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into <hi>Schonen</hi> I ſaw twenty nine
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57018:103"/>
of theſe rogues upon wheeles, and
elſewhere in the Countrey, ten and
twenty at ſeverall places. The
King uſed great ſeveritie in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; ſome he cauſed to be
broken upon the wheele, others
ſpeeted in at the fundament and out
at the ſhoulders, many had the fleſh
pinched off of there breaſts, and ſo
were faſtened to ſtakes till they died,
and others again had their noſes and
both hands cut off, and being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a hot Iron were let goe to
acquaint their camerades how they
had been ſerved. The King is very
ſevere againſt Highway-men and
duellers. In above a hundred
miles travelling, wee found not a
houſe where there was either French
wine or brandie, which made mee
tell a <hi>Swede</hi> of our Company who
was travelling to Denmark, that I
would undertake to ſhew any man
500 houſes wherein a traveller
might have wine and other good
accommodation in the ſpace of an
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57018:103"/>
hundred miles upon any rode from
<hi>London.</hi> There are ſeverall ſmall
towns and fertile land in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Schonen,</hi> lying upon the
<hi>Sound;</hi> at the narroweſt part
whereof lies <hi>Elſenbourg</hi> burnt down
by the Danes in the laſt war:
Here I croſt over to <hi>Elſenore,</hi>
the paſſage being but a league
broad.</p>
            <p>The King of Denmark has a caſtle
at <hi>Elſenore</hi> which commands the
narrow paſſage of the <hi>Sound,</hi> where
all Ships that enter into or come
out of the Baltick ſea muſt pay
toll. Having viſited this caſtle
and ſtai'd about a fortnight with
the Engliſh Conſul, and <hi>Sr.
John Paul</hi> late reſident at the
Court of <hi>Swedland,</hi> I went to
the daniſh Court at <hi>Coppenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Copenhaguen</hi> is the capitall city
of <hi>Zeeland, Jutland</hi> or <hi>Denmark</hi>
and place of reſidence of the King
It ſtands on a flat, encompaſſed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57018:104"/>
with a pleaſant and delightfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
much reſembling England. The
ſtreets of the city are kept very neat
and cleane, with lights in the night
time for the convenience and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of thoſe who are then abroad;
a cuſtome not as yet introduced
into <hi>Stockholme</hi> where it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be abroad when it is dark.
The Kings men of war lye here
very conveniently, being orderly
ranged betwixt <hi>Booms</hi> after the
manner of Amſterdam, and neare
the Admiralty houſe, which is a
large pile of building well furniſhed
with ſtores and Magazines, ſecured
by a citadell, that not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the city, but alſo the Haven,
and entrey into it. The Court of
Denmark is ſplendid, and makes
a far greater figure in the world
then that of <hi>Sweden,</hi> tho not many
yeares agoe in the time of <hi>Carolus
Guſtaphus</hi> the father of the preſent
King of <hi>Swedland,</hi> it was almoſt
reduced to its laſt, when the walls
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57018:104"/>
of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> ſaved that Crown
and Kingdome. That ſiege was
famous, caried on with great
vigour by the <hi>Swede,</hi> and as bravely
maintained by the <hi>Danes:</hi> The
monuments whereof are to be ſeen
in the canon bullets gilt that ſtill
remain in the walls of ſome houſes
and in the ſteeple of the great Church
of the town. The Royall palace in
<hi>Copenhaguen</hi> is but ſmall and a very
ancient building, but his Majeſties
houſe <hi>Fredenburg</hi> is a ſtately fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of Modern Architecture, and
very richly furniſhed. <hi>Denmark</hi>
is at preſent a flouriſhing Kingdome
and the King who hath now made
it hereditary, ſurpaſſes moſt of his
predeceſſours in power and wealth:
He hath much enlarged his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
aſwell as Authority, and by
his perſonall and Royall virtues,
no leſs then the eminent qualities of
a great many able miniſters of State,
he hath gained the univerſall love
of his ſubjects, and the eſteeme of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57018:105"/>
all forreigne Princes and States.
The Court if much frequented eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, but eſpecially on Sundays
where about eleven of the clock in
the morning, the Nobility, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
Miniſters, and Officers of
the Army aſſemble and make a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
appeareance. There one may
ſee many Knights of the order of the
Elephant of <hi>Malto</hi> but I never ſaw
any order of the like nature as that of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> that King rarely appearing
in his George and garter, but on
days of publick audience I have
obſerved at one time above 150
coaches attending at the Court of
Denmark, which are ten times more
than ever I ſaw together at that
of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The King is affable
and of eaſy accels to ſtrangers, ſeen
often abroad by his ſubjects in his
gardens and ſtables, which are very
large and well furniſhed with all
ſorts of Horſes. He is a great lover
of Engliſh horſes and dogs, and
delights much in Hunting, as his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57018:105"/>
eldeſt ſon the Prince with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe in cockfighting; in ſo
much that the Engliſh Merchants
can not make a more acceptable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to thoſe Princes, then of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
game-cocks. The ſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Denmark</hi> are well diſciplined
men, and commanded by good
Officers both natives and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> as
Major General <hi>Duncan,</hi> and Major
General <hi>Veldun</hi> both Scottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whom I ſaw at <hi>Copenhaguen.</hi>
The Soldiers, aſwell as courtiers are
quartered upon the citizens, a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
which is likewiſe practiſed in
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and tho ſomewhat uneaſy,
yet not repined at by the people
who by the care and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King find trade much
advanced. For his Majeſtie by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
ſtrangers of all religions
to live in his dominions, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the French and dutch Calviniſts,
to have publick Churches, hath
brought many tradeing families to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57018:106"/>
               <hi>Coppenhaguen,</hi> and by the meaſure
he hath taken for ſettling trade in
prohibiting the importation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
manufactures, and reforming
and new modelling the Eaſt and
Weſt India Companies, hath much
encreaſed commerce and thereby
the wealth of his ſubjects; ſo that
notwithſtanding the new taxes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon all coaches, waggons,
Ploughs, and all reall and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
eſtates, which amount to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſumms of money, the
people live very well and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
There are commonly about
eight thouſand men in gariſon in
<hi>Coppenhaguen,</hi> and his Majeſties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of foot guards who are all
cloathed in red, with cloaks to keep
them warm in the winter time, is
a very handſome body of men, and
with the horſe guards who are
bravely mounted, and have their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeers
and Hoboyes, make a very
fine ſhew. His Majeſtie hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſeverall new fortifications to be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57018:106"/>
built upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> and other rivers,
and hath now in his poſſeſſion that
ſtrong Caſtle called <hi>Hilgueland,</hi>
at preſent commanded by a Scottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
The Queen of <hi>Denmark</hi> is a
moſt virtuous Princeſs, ſiſter to
the preſent Landgrave of <hi>Heſſel-Caſſel,</hi>
and in perſuaſion a Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,
having a chappell allowed her
within the Court; though the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
religion of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
be Lutheran. The Clergie
here are learned, many of them
having ſtudied at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
where they learnt the Engliſh
Language, and amongſt the Biſhops
there is one Doctor <hi>King</hi> the ſon of
a Scottiſhman. But ſeing it is my
deſigne rather to obſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the people, then to be
punctuall in deſcribing all the rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are remarkeable in the
Countries I have been in, I ſhall
conclude what I have to ſay of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
by acquainting the Reader
that the people of that Countrey
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57018:107"/>
live far better then the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
and aſwell as moſt of their adjoyning
neighbours; and that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
places, both there and in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
which have the names of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
towns, as <hi>Arundale, Totneſs,
London</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When I fiſt began to write this
treatiſe, I had ſome thoughts of
making obſervations upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
governments of other States and
Dominions, where I had travelled
ſome years before I was in the
Countries I have been ſpeaking of,
as of the reſt of Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
<hi>Switzerland, Italy</hi> and France;
but that was a ſubject ſo large,
and the uſefulneſs of it to my preſent
deſigne ſo inconſiderable, that by
doeing ſo, I found I could neither
ſatisfie the curious, by adding any
thing materiall to thoſe many who
have already obliged the publick by
the remarks of their travells in thoſe
places; or make my diſcontented
Countrey men more averſe then
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57018:107"/>
they are already from removing
into thoſe Countries, where I think
few of them will chuſe to tranſport
themſelves for the ſake of liberty and
Propertie, tho England were even
worſe, than they themſelves fancy it
can be. All that remains to be
done then, is to conclude this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
with an obvious and popular
remark, that thoſe Countries where
cities are greateſt and moſt frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by voluntary inhabitants, are
alwayes the beſt to live in; and by
comparing the city of <hi>London</hi> with
all other cities of Europe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating
by the ſurveys I have
made (which I think will hardly be
contradicted or confuted,) that of
all the capitall cities of Europe it is
the biggeſt, and moſt populous, &amp; ſo
prove conſequentially that England,
for the generality of people, is the
beſt Countrey in the world eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for its natives to live in. Now
this being an obſervation, (for
what I know) not hitherto made
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57018:108"/>
good by induction and inſtance,
(as I intend to doe it) I hope it
will pleaſe the Reader as much, as
if I gave him a particular account of
other Countreys and governments,
and leave it to his own reflexion to
State the compariſon.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>London</hi> within the walls
cannot vie for bigneſs with many
cities of Europe; yet take the city
and ſuburbs together, according
as it hath been ſurveyed by <hi>Mr.
Morgan,</hi> in breadth from <hi>St.
Georges</hi> Church in Southwarke to
Shore ditch, and in length from
Limehouſe to petty France in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
and it is in a vaſt proportion
larger in compaſs of ground, and
number of houſes then any city
whatſoever in Europe. This I
shall demonſtrate firſt by compare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with ſome cities of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and then with the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
cities of the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of Europe, which I ſhall ſet
down in an alphabeticall order with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57018:108"/>
the number of the houſes they ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
contain.</p>
            <p>When <hi>London</hi> and ſuburbs was
ſurveyed ſome years agoe by <hi>Mr.
Morgan,</hi> there were reckoned to
be in it 84000 houſes beſides hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
Almeshouſes, and other
buildings that payed no chimney
money to the King: Now if thoſe
were added, and the vaſt number
of new houſes that have been built
ſince that ſurvey, upon modeſt
computation <hi>London</hi> may be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to countain 100000 houſes;
I know the <hi>French</hi> doe vapour and
would perſwade the world that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
is much bigger then <hi>London.</hi>
And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> will ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that <hi>London</hi> hath more <hi>Houſes</hi>
then the 18 <hi>Cittyes</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> that
have voyces in the States, for ſay
they <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Stands upon a 1000
<hi>Morgens</hi> land, and <hi>London</hi> Stands
but upon 1800; To both which I
anſwer, that it is very true that
<hi>Paris</hi> takes up a great ſpot of ground,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57018:109"/>
but then you muſt conſider, that in
<hi>Paris</hi> there are ſeverall hundreds of
<hi>Monaſteries, Churches, Coledges,</hi>
and <hi>Cloyſters,</hi> ſome of them haveing
large <hi>Gardens,</hi> and that in <hi>Paris</hi>
there are 7500 <hi>Palaces</hi> and <hi>Ports</hi>
for <hi>Coaches,</hi> which have likewiſe
great <hi>Gardens,</hi> whereas <hi>London</hi> is
very thick built, and in the <hi>Citty</hi> the
<hi>Houſes</hi> have ſcarce a Yard big
enough to ſett a <hi>Pump,</hi> or <hi>Houſe</hi> of
conveniency in; but the weekely
bills of <hi>Mortality</hi> will decide this
<hi>Queſtion</hi> and plainely give it to
<hi>London,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Mons: la Cour,</hi>
and Sir. <hi>William Pette</hi> in his laſt
<hi>Eſſayes</hi> dedicated lately to our King,
makeing it appeare that <hi>London</hi> is
bigger then <hi>Paris, Rhoan,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi>
altogether; and as for <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
I doe appeale to all knowing
men that have ſeen it, that although
it be true that it Stands upon 1000
<hi>Morgens Land;</hi> yet there is not
above 400 <hi>Morgens</hi> built, and this I
prove thus, that the large <hi>Gardens,</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:57018:109"/>
on the <hi>Heeregraft, Kyſersgraft,</hi>
and <hi>Princegraft,</hi> and the <hi>Burgavalls</hi>
of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> take up more then a
third part of the <hi>Citty,</hi> then reckon
the <hi>Baſtions,</hi> and the ſpace of
<hi>Ground</hi> betweene the <hi>Wall,</hi> and
the <hi>Houſes,</hi> and all the <hi>Ground</hi>
unbuilt from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricks-Port,</hi> to
the <hi>Weſoper-Port, Muyer-Port,</hi> and
ſo to the <hi>Seaſido,</hi> and you will find
it to be near 300 <hi>Morgens land:</hi>
There are 2 <hi>Parishes</hi> in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> viz <hi>Stepuey,</hi> and
<hi>St. Martins</hi> in the fields, (the later
being ſo big that the laſt Parlement
divided it into 4 <hi>Parishes,)</hi> either
of them have more <hi>Houſes</hi> then
<hi>Rotterdam,</hi> or <hi>Harlem,</hi> and there
are ſeverall other great <hi>Parishes</hi> as
<hi>St. Margrets-Weſtminſter, St.
Giles</hi> in the fields, <hi>Toolyes,</hi> and <hi>St.
Mary Overs,</hi> the which if they ſtood
apart in the Country would make
